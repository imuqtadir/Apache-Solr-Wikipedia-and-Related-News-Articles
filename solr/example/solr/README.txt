The project has two cores. One called wiki and another called wikinews. 
The project should be simple to run. Get your solr started with the both these cores and then run the web application using any server,
say Apache Tomcat. We assume that you will be running solr on 8983 using jetty. In case you wish to reindex the whole corpus,
jus download the wikidumps and make sure you give the right location in data-config.xml.

WARNING: Few lines of code has not been removed for supertitious purpose. They have only been commented out. Enjoy :)
