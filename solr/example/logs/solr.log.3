'''Cuernavaca''' ({{Audio-IPA|Cuernavaca.ogg|kwe?na??aka}}; {{lang-nci-IPA|Cuauhn?huac|k?aw?na?wak}} "near the woods") is the capital and largest city of the [[Mexican state|state]] of [[Morelos]] in [[Mexico]]. It was established by the [[Olmec]], "the mother culture" of [[Mesoamerica]], approximately 3200 years ago and is designated as the archaeological site of Gualupita I . The city is located south of [[Mexico City]], from which it may be reached after a drive of approximately thirty minutes using the D-95 Freeway.<ref name="wright">{{cite web |first=Anthony  |last=Wright  |title= In Morelos, Cuernavaca springs eternal |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3365-in-morelos-cuernavaca-springs-eternal |publisher=MexConnect |date=2009-04-17 |accessdate=2009-09-28 }}</ref>

The city was nicknamed the "City of Eternal Spring" by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in the nineteenth century. It has long been a favorite escape for Mexico City and foreign visitors because of this warm, stable climate and abundant vegetation. [[Tlatoani|Aztec emperors]] had summer residences there, and today many famous people as well as Mexico City residents maintain homes there.<ref name="rumbo">{{cite web |title= Cuernavaca, Mexico Caminando sin rumbo |url= http://www.caminandosinrumbo.com/mexico/cuernavaca/ |language=Spanish |date=July 2006 |accessdate=2009 September 28 = }}</ref><ref name="verdadera">{{cite web |first=Barbara |last=Kastelein |url= http://www.revistatravesias.com/numero-59/fin-de-semana/cuernavaca-la-verdadera-historia-de-su-eterna-primavera.html|publisher=Revista Travesias |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |title=Cuernavaca: la verdadera historia de su eterna primavera |trans_title=Cuernavaca: The true story of its eternal spring |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2009-09-28 }}</ref> Considering its location of just a 30 minutes drive from Mexico City, Cuernavaca traditionally has been a center of Mexican society and glamour, with many of the country's wealthy citizens owning sprawling mansions and haciendas in this cultural haven. Cuernavaca is also host to a large foreign resident population, including large numbers of students who come to study the Spanish language.<ref name="morse">{{cite web |first=Emily  |last=Morse |title= Cuernavaca, Mexico: The Perfect Place to Study Spanish |url= http://www.gonomad.com/alternatives/0606/cuernavaca.html |accessdate=2009-09-28 }}</ref>

The name "Cuernavaca" is derived from the [[Nahuatl]] phrase "Cuauhn?huac" and means "surrounded by or close to trees". The name eventually was Hispanicized to Cuernavaca. The coat-of-arms of the municipality is based on the pre-Columbian pictograph emblem of the city which depicts a tree trunk (''cuahuitl'') with three branches, with foliage, and four roots colored red. There is a cut in the trunk in the form of a mouth, from which emerges a [[speech scroll]], probably representing the language Nahuatl and by extension the locative suffix "-n?huac", meaning "near".<ref name="encmuc">{{cite web  |title= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México ESTADO DE MORELOS CUERNAVACA |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_morelos |language=Spanish  |accessdate=2009-09-28 }}</ref>

==The city==

===City of Eternal Spring===
[[File:Jardin borda.jpg|thumb|Flora in Cuernavaca]]
Cuernavaca was [[nickname]]d "city of eternal spring" by Alexander von Humboldt in the nineteenth century.<ref name="wright"/> The city is located in a tropical region, but its temperature is kept fairly constant in the 70s (°F). It is located on the southern slope of the Sierra de Chichinautzin mountains. In the morning, warm air flows up the mountains from the valley below and in the late afternoon, cooler air flows down from the higher elevations.<ref name="rumbo"/><ref name="encmuc"/>

This pleasant climate has attracted royalty and nobles since Aztec times. Most of the Aztec emperors called Cuernavaca their summer residence. Foreign princes, archdukes, and other nobles have been attracted to this place because of its flowers, sun, fruits, fresh-water springs, and waterfalls. The Shah of Iran had a house here, as did the Emperor of Ethiopia, [[Haile Selassie]], and late sculptor, [[John Spencer]]{{dn|date=October 2014}}, a relative of [[Princess Diana]]. Although a native of the U.S., [[Bauhaus]] designer Michael van Beuren established his residence in a family hacienda in Cuernavaca while fleeing the rise of the Nazi regime in [[Germany]] (where he studied and practiced his profession), and a colony of Bauhaus designers grew in the city during [[World War II]].<ref name="verdadera"/>

===Cuernavaca metropolitan area===
[[File:Libramiento Cuernavaca.JPG|thumb|Highway in the newer area of the city]]
Cuernavaca always has been a popular place for people from Mexico City to escape the city. In the twentieth century, the climate and flora began to attract many foreigners as well. Population increase in this urban area began in 1940, but the metro area was not created, nor recognized, until the 1960s. From this time the population and the extension of the metropolitan area has grown. From 1960 to 1980, the population had grown from 85,620 to 368,166. From the 1980s to the present, the municipalities of Emiliano Zapata, Jiutepec, [[Texmixco, Morelos|Temixco]], [[Tepoztlán]], [[Xochitepec]], and Yautepec have been added to the metropolitan area. These municipalities have seen the highest rates of growth, however, population and economic activity remains concentrated in the city of Cuernavaca proper.<ref name="encmuc"/> As of 2005, the metropolitan area had a population of 802,371, with 349,102, living in the city proper.<ref name="zona">{{cite web |url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/geografia/publicaciones/delimex05/DZMM-2005_28.pdf  |title=Delimitación de las zonas metropolitanas de México 2005 |publisher=INEGI  |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-09-28 }}</ref>

Over the decades since 1970, this metropolitan area has become more economically and socially integrated with the Mexico City metropolitan area. Many people from Mexico City own second homes there for weekend retreats, both for the climate and for the well-developed infrastructure.<ref name="rumbo"/><ref name="encmuc"/> Starting in the 1980s permanent migration of Mexico City residents began, spurred by pollution and crime problems in the capital.

The [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]] also pushed many well-to-do families there, fearful of the next catastrophe. In many of these cases, the main breadwinner commutes each day to work in Mexico City.<ref name="wright"/><ref name="encmuc"/> This has produced the great increase in housing developments on the outskirts of the city, especially in the late 1990s and 2000s. This influx has had a positive economic benefit for the city, but has put pressure on the infrastructure as well. 85% of the city of Cuernavaca is dedicated to housing, and much of this is in upper-class housing developments such as Rancho Cortés, Rancho Tetela, and Colonia del Bosque, which are located on the outskirts of the city. Lower-income housing is concentrated in the city proper. Only 2% of the housing in Cuernavaca is in high-rise buildings.<ref name="encmuc"/> Cuernavaca has been called the "Beverly Hills of Mexico"<ref name="morse"/> because from just about any elevation in the city, one can see that many of the homes have swimming pools.<ref name="wright"/>

==History==
[[File:Cuernavaca Teopanzolco.JPG|thumb|Ruins at Teopanzolco, Cuernavaca]]
The first major culture to inhabit this area was the [[Tlahuica]], whose main settlement was where the city of Cuernavaca is today. The Tlahuicas have inhabited this area at least since the twelfth century.<ref name="rumbo"/>

The first incursions south into the area by peoples of the [[Valley of Mexico]] occurred in the twelfth century, when a lord named Xolotl (ruler of [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Tetzcoco]]) conquered most of the Valley of Mexico. An allied [[Chichimeca]] tribe also moved south into what is now northern Morelos state, making Techintecuitla lord of the Cuernavaca area, with the Tlahuicas concentrated in the nearby towns of Yecapixtla and Yautecatle. According to the Tlatelolco Annals, in 1365, the lord of Cuernavaca, Macuilxochitl, tried to conquer lands as far as the Valley of Mexico, but was met by the lord of [[Chalco (altépetl)|Chalco]], Tzalcualtitlan, with similar ambitions.<ref name="machistoria">{{cite web |author=Municipality of Cuernavaca |title=Historia |url= http://mac.cuernavaca.gob.mx/portal/secciones/historia/index.php |publisher=Municipality of Cuernavaca |location=Cuernavaca, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=History |accessdate=2009 September 28 = }}</ref>

The first Aztec emperor, [[Acamapichtli]], began to expand his empire to the south of the Valley of Mexico and beyond in the 1370s. His successor, [[Huitzilihuitl]], was eager to press on into what is now Morelos state because of the cotton grown there, it was called Tlalnahuatl at that time. He asked to marry the daughter of the ruler of Tlalnahuatl, but was rejected. That rejection started a war that ended with an Aztec victory in 1396. Huitziliuitl then married the princess and [[Moctezuma I]] was born of the union. Credit for the conquest of Cuernavaca is given to Acamapichtli in the Mendocino Codex, but later writings cite [[Itzcóatl]], or even Moctezuma I, as conqueror. The conquered dominion, Tlalnahuac, was roughly the size of the modern state of Morelos, and subsequently was renamed as Cuauhnahuc by the Aztecs.<ref name="machistoria"/>

From 1403 to 1426, this province grew in strength, subduing neighboring peoples such as the Coauixcas. Eventually, the province, then ruled by Miquiuix, rebelled against the Aztec Empire. This rebellion was put down by [[Totoquihuatzin]] and [[Netzahualcoyotl]] in 1433. This area then joined in the conquests of what now are known as [[Taxco]], [[Tepecoacuilco de Trujano|Tepecuacuilco]], and [[Ocuilán]]. For tribute purposes, the dominion was divided into two zones, one headed by Cuernavaca and the other by [[Oaxtepec|Huaxtepec]].<ref name="machistoria"/>
[[File:Palacio de cortez 9.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Palace of Cortés, Cuernavaca|Palace of Cortés]], the oldest conserved colonial era civil structure on the continental Americas]]

At the time of the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish Conquest]], Itzohuatzin was governing Cuernavaca. It was a rich city and densely populated, with large farms and its characteristic ravines bridged over. In the center of the city was a large fort, however, this fort and the entire city fell to the Spanish. The Spanish marched on Cuernavaca even before taking the Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan]]. They were led by [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]] and he was joined later by the [[conquistador]], [[Hernán Cortés]].<ref name="machistoria"/>

Cortés returned to Cuernavaca in 1523, stopping in Tlaltenango, where he founded the Church of San José and constructed the first sugar plantation. The fertility of these lands compelled the conquistador to found his favorite residence here. Juana de Zúñiga, Cortes’s wife, lived in Cuernavaca in the palace that was constructed in 1526. Cortes then moved the hacienda in Tlaltenango to Amatitlan and finally settled in his hacienda at Atlacomulco.<ref name="encmuc"/>
The [[Franciscans]] arrived in Cuernavaca in 1529 and founded their fifth monastery in [[New Spain]] there. This first group included Martín de Lua, Francisco Martínez, Luis Ortiz, Juan de Cervo, Francisco de Soto, Andrés de Córdova, Martín de Jesús, Juan Juárez, Juan de Motolinía, and Juan García de Cervo. Originally they lived at the San Francisquito hermitage, but later they constructed the open-air chapel, [[Capilla Abierta]], at the Church of San José in Tlaltenango. They extended their presence into the neighboring communities of [[Tetecala, Morelos|Tetecala]], [[Jiutepec]], and [[Tlaquiltenango]], among others, eventually forming the province of Santo Evangelio, which would be part of the province of Mexico in 1543. In 1646, this province was reorganized several times. Cuernavaca and Cuautla became high mayorships which answered directly to the viceregal authorities in Mexico City. In 1786, New Spain was divided into twelve provinces and in 1824, Cuernavaca was initially a district of Mexico City.<ref name="machistoria"/>

During the [[Mexican War of Independence]], [[José María Morelos]] was imprisoned at the Palacio de Cortés in November 1815. [[Agustín de Iturbide]]'s army passed through Cuernavaca to fight [[Vicente Guerrero]] in 1820 and came through again in 1821, as the head of the [[Ejército Trigarante]]. After Independence and with the Constitution of 1824, the territory now known as the State of Morelos became part of the [[State of Mexico]]. Between 1827 and 1829, Cuernavaca was a district of this state. From 1829 to 1833, it was called a prefecture. In 1833, the State of Mexico declared the Atlacomulco Hacienda, which contains the Palacio de Cortés and Cortés’s houses in [[Coyoacán]], to be public property.<ref name="machistoria"/>

[[File:AltarGuadTabCV.JPG|thumb|left|Main altar of the Chapel of The Third Order of Saint Francis]]
In 1834, [[Ignacio Echevarría]] and [[José María Tornel]] drafted the [[Plan of Cuernavaca]], which permitted [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] to disregard the laws protecting church property, exile [[Valentín Gómez Farías]], reopen the university, and dissolve the tribunal that was set to convict [[Anastasio Bustamante]] for the assassination of Vicente Guerrero. In the same year, the State of Mexico declared Cuernavaca to be a city.<ref name="machistoria"/>

During the [[Mexican-American War]], Cuernavaca was captured by the Cadwalader Brigade and was forced to pay retributions to the U.S. Army after the Cuernavaca Infantry under Francisco Modesto Olabuibel fell. During the Ayutla Rebellion in 1854, Santa Anna was forced out of the capital of Mexico City in 1855. He moved his government to Cuernavaca, reorganized it, and named a junta to elect an interim president. This junta consisted of [[Valentín Gómez Farías]], [[Melchor Ocampo]], [[Benito Juárez]], [[Francisco de P. Zendejas]], Diego Álvarez, and [[Joaquín Moreno]]. They then voted for Alvarez as president. This new president swore to uphold the Plan of Ayutla and his inauguration was celebrated with much pomp in the city.<ref name="machistoria"/>
In 1856, the District of Cuernavaca and the District of Mexico were declared separate.<ref name="machistoria"/>
During the Three-year War (1858–1860) when conservatives rejected the liberal constitution of 1857, Juan Vicario voiced the cry of "Religión y Fueros" in Cuernavaca on 13 January 1858. In 1861, the Government of the State of Mexico created the districts of Cuernavaca, Morelos, Jonacatepec, Tautepec, and Tetecala.<ref name="encmuc"/>

In order to facilitate operations against the French during the [[French Intervention in Mexico|French Intervention]], President Juarez divided the State of Mexico into three military districts.  The third consisted of the territories of Cuernavaca, [[Yautepec de Zaragoza|Yautepec]], Morelos, and Tetecala, with its capital in the city of Cuernavaca. Soon thereafter, this district fell into French hands.  [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] converted the Borda Garden into his summer residence and bought land in nearby Acapantzingo to construct a chalet. This prompted the construction of the Mexico-Cuernavaca highway.<ref name="machistoria"/>

When the French-installed monarch fell in 1867, Republican forces under [[Francisco Leyva]], [[Ignacio Figueroa]], and [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]] laid siege to Cuernavaca, which was defended by General Joaquín Ayestarán. The attackers cut off water supplies to the city and attacked on 3 January, but were met with a long series of street battles throughout the city. During the fighting, the general was killed and the Republican forces withdrew, victorious, to Mexico City, but only after burning a large portion of the city.<ref name="machistoria"/>

[[File:Emiliano Zapata en la ciudad de Cuernavaca.jpg|thumb|Emiliano Zapata in Cuernavaca]]
The State of Morelos was created in April 1869, with General Francisco Leyva as its first governor. Cuernavaca was declared the capital of the new state in November of the same year. In 1877, the [[Toluca]]-Cuernavaca highway was built and a rail connection created between Cuernavaca and Mexico City. In 1891, the Diocese of Cuernavaca was established by [[Pope Leo XII]], comprising the entire state of Morelos, with Fortino Hipolito y Vera as first bishop of Cuernavaca. The first locomotive to arrive in the city was in 1897 and greeted by President Porfirio Díaz. The Bank of Morelos was founded in 1903. In 1909, the anti-reelection movement was established in Cuernavaca, and by the end of this same year guerilla operations against the Diaz government were headed  by [[Genovevo de la O]] in [[Santa María Ahuacatitlán]]. [[Emiliano Zapata]] took over the movement in the south and named De la O in charge of the Cuernavaca area.<ref name="machistoria"/>

[[File:Palacio de Gobernacion (Cuernavaca, Morelos).jpg|thumb|left|The Head Government Building of Cuernavaca]]
Wealthy North Americans and Europeans established secondary residences in Cuernavaca and took long vacations there or frequently traveled back and forth, while servants maintained the haciendas in their absence. Sometimes, their offspring have made Cuernavaca their permanent residence, creating an enclave of natives with international roots bearing the influence of their cultures. For example, when the American designer, Michael van Beuren fled Germany with members of Bauhaus, where he was practicing his profession, he took up residence at the vacation hacienda of his parents in Cuernavaca, and stayed permanently, establishing his factory nearby and raising his family there. Others in his family began to reside there year 'round. Their children became natives of Mexico.{{YouTube|ANM-U91sj7A}}

In the first decades of the twentieth century, Cuernavaca became a place to vacation and gamble when the Hotel de la Sevla was converted into the Casino de la Selva, which attracted people such as [[Rita Hayworth]], [[Bugsy Siegel]], and [[Al Capone]] to Cuernavaca, however, gambling was shut down by [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] in 1934. He is the same president who declared the area a ZPG (Forest Protection Zone). The casino hosted very important artistic works, including murals of Alvarez Icaza, Messeguer, and the architecture of Candela. The main vault was considered to be the "Mexican Sistine Chapel" by Nobel Prize author, Gabriel García Márquez.

1936 was the year that Malcolm Lowry wrote his short story, "Under The Volcano", which inspired his 1947 novel of the same name. It is still considered{{Who|date=January 2014}} one of the top five greatest novels of the twentieth century, and has never gone out of print. Cuernavaca, or Quaunahuac, as it is called in the novel, and the surrounding area, figure prominently in this great historical novel, where extensive details on Mexican history, culture, topography, and especially, politics and religion figure prominently. The recurrent artifacts are the twin volcanos, [[Popocatepetl]] and [[Iztaccihuatl]], and the barranca, symbols of division, death, and rebirth in the city of eternal spring.

In the 1960s, the city was one of the centers of the [[psychedelic movement]]. [[Timothy Leary]] tried [[psilocybin]] mushrooms there in the summer of 1960 and came back regularly to repeat the experience. In 1956, [[Erich Fromm]] founded the Sociedad Mexicana de Psicoanálisis and from his house in Cuernavaca promoted new ideas in the field of [[psychiatry]], incorporating [[Zen Buddhism]] and "communal psychoanalytic studies" (estudios psicoanalíticos comunitarios). This attracted many artists, composers, architects, and counterculture types here.<ref name="verdadera"/>

More recently the city has seen a very active society dedicated to the preservation of its environment and cultural heritage. The Frente Civico which is now influential throughout the country, along with some 150 other organizations has promoted a boycott against [[Costco]] for having destroyed the Casino de la Selva to build a couple of warehouses. One of its members, Professor [[Jaime Lagunez]], (also promoter of Zen buddhism) lobbied a general agreement in the national congress for the purpose of protecting its sixty archeological sites, its vegetation, historic center, and neighboring forests, among other important cultural aspects of the city. (see http://www.senado.gob.mx/gace.php?sesion=2008/08/13/1&documento=60). The Frente Civico received the 2004 National Mendez Arceo Human Rights Award for having protected the world cultural heritage found in the city.

After having been the residence of Cortés and his descendents for several centuries, the building became a warehouse, a jail, a military barracks, and then the State Government Palace (until 1969). From 1971 to 1973, the building was restored extensively and today houses the [[Museo Regional Cuauhnáhuac]], dedicated to the history of [[Morelos]] State. It often is referred to as, the Palacio. It has ten exhibit halls with maps, illustrations, photographs, works of art, and everyday items from various epochs representing the first human settlements in the state to the present day. It has murals created by [[Diego Rivera]] that reflect both Morelos and Mexican history.<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/> Adjacent to the Palacio a permanent local handicraft market in which one may purchase [[silver]] jewelry, T-shirts, beaded bracelets, pottery, hammocks, blankets, and much more.<ref name="Taylor">{{cite web |first=Julia |last=Taylor |title= Retire to Mexico: A New Home Town and a New Life |url=http://www.giddylimits.co.uk/retirement/retire_to_mexico.html  |accessdate=2009-09-28 }}</ref>

====Morelos and Juárez Gardens====
[[File:JardinJuarez1.JPG|thumb|Juárez Garden]]
The Juárez and Morelos Gardens are in the center of the city, both of which are plazas lined with trees. Between the two is the State Government Palace, a three story building with a [[tezontle]] façade built between 1955 and 1969. The Morelos Garden dates from 1908 and is easily recognizable by the large stone statue of José María Morelos, which is known colloquially as "Morelotes". The Juárez Garden is located to the north of the State Government Palace and is the oldest public square in Cuernavaca.<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/> The Garden contains a kiosk from England dating from the end of the nineteenth century.<ref name="finsemana"/> Unlike most main squares in Mexico, neither of these open up the way to the main cathedral. The main cathedral in Cuernavaca is located a few blocks west of the square.<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/>

These two gardens or plazas are known colloquially as the "zócalo". Spectacles are often to be seen here and can include people dancing the "[[danzón]]" or other popular dances<ref name="finsemana"/> and "estudiantinas" dressed in colonial-era Spanish garb, playing instruments and dancing, and any number of free concerts. Often clowns perform on the zocalo as well, with balloons and tricks for the children and tell double-entendre jokes for the adults. Locals use the plazas to sell products such as honey, yogurt, traditional candies, and crafts. Street food such as corn on the cob, snow cones, candies, fruit smoothies, and more generally are available.<ref name="Taylor"/>

====The cathedral====
[[File:FacadeCatCV2.JPG|thumb|left|Facade of [[Cuernavaca Cathedral|Cathedral]]]]
The [[Cuernavaca Cathedral]] is the main church of what was the monastery of the Third Order of the Franciscans, called La Asunción, that dates back to the sixteenth century.<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/> It sits on the southeast corner of a large [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], which also contains a number of other chapels that were built at different times and with different architectural styles.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="finsemana"/> This complex is located at the intersection of Hidalgo and Morelos streets, a few blocks west of the town center.<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/>

The cathedral was built by Cortés to double as a fortress, with cannons mounted above the [[buttress]]es.<ref name="wright"/> Over time, this church underwent a number of transformations, updating its interior. This was undone in the mid-twentieth century, when restoration work removed all the [[Neoclassical sculpture|Neoclassical]] altars and images. These now are stored in the cathedral's [[pinacotheca]] and not available to the public. Restoration work uncovered [[al fresco]] murals on the lateral walls, relating to the martyrdom of [[Philip of Jesus]], the first Mexican canonized as a saint. The only other decoration inside this church now is a modern-style crucifix and an image of the [[Assumption of Mary]]. This restoration work was carried out by Bishop Sergio Méndz Arceo.<ref name="finsemana"/>

After the [[Reform War|Reform Laws]] in the 1860s, most of the monastery property passed into state, then private hands, leaving only what is now the cathedral and several smaller chapels on a very large atrium. The Revolution Garden was the orchard of the Cathedral,<ref name="finsemana"/> and the cloister with its observatory, is now the [[Robert Brady Museum]].<ref name="wright"/> The church became the Cathedral of Cuernavaca in 1891.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="mexdesmorelos"/><ref name="finsemana"/>

[[File:Cuernavaca Catedral de madrugada.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Cathedral's side-chapel at sunset]]
Next to the cathedral is the "open chapel" (''capilla abierta'') of San José, which is an original structure built in the sixteenth century. It also was rescued and restored by Bishop Méndez Arceo and is one of the oldest constructions on the site. The building consists of a vault with three arches that face the atrium. These arches are supported by a pair of [[flying buttress]]es. Inside the arches is an altarpiece dating from the seventeenth century.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="finsemana"/>

The main entrance is on Hidalgo street, where one passes between two large chapels called the Chapel of Santa Cruz and the Chapel of the Tercera Orden. The Tercera Orden is considered to be the more valuable artistically of the two, with its highly sculpted early [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] main and side portals painted in various colors. Inside, there is a later [[Churrigueresque]] main altar. A third chapel, called the Chapel of Nuestra Señora de los Dolores is farther into the atrium and near the Open Chapel of San José.<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/>

====Teopanzolco====
[[Teopanzolco]] is an archeological site located just east of the historic downtown of Cuernavaca. Its construction is dated to the year 1427, and it was an important ceremonial center during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries when the native Tlahuicas were dominated by the Aztecs. The site shows significant Aztec influence. It has a large pyramidal base, called the Gran Basamento, topped by two shrines, much like the [[Templo Mayor]] in Tenochtitlan. Only the stone columns of these shrines remain today. The [[teocalli]], or sacred plaza, contains fourteen monuments including a circular altar dedicated to the wind deity [[Ehécatl]].<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/><ref name="finsemana"/> There are also two concentric structures separated by a moat or ditch. Both might have been dedicated to [[Quetzalcoatl]], the feathered-serpent deity.<ref name="encmuc"/>

====Borda Garden====
[[File:BordaHouseCourtyard.JPG|thumb|left|Borda House courtyard]]
The Borda Garden is located near the cathedral on Morelos Street. Originally, this was a house bought by [[José de la Borda]], the mining magnate of Taxco in the mid-eighteenth century. Later, his son, Manuel de Borda y Verdugo, transformed the grounds of the house into gardens filled with flower and fruit trees to satisfy his passion for [[botany]]. These gardens also contain a number of fountains and an artificial lake that were completed in 1783. The complex also contains lodgings, offices, a restaurant, and a nightclub. In 1865, this was the summer home of Emperor Maximilian I and his wife Carlota Amalia. It hosted major political soirées in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, such as those sponsored by Porfirio Díaz and Emiliano Zapata. Today the area is a public park where the gardens have been maintained and it is possible to take a short boat ride on the lake. The house has been converted into a museum. Six of its halls are dedicated to temporary exhibits while the other seven are devoted to recreating the characteristics of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/>

The Church of Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe is located next to the Borda Garden, and was constructed by Manuel de la Borda in 1784. It has a [[Baroque]] [[façade]] and what is considered to be the best [[cupola]] in the city. It was the royal chapel of Emperor Maximilian.<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/>

====Robert Brady Museum====
[[File:RobertBradyMusCasaTorre.JPG|thumb|Exterior of the Museum]]
[[File:CourtyardRBMusCV.JPG|thumb|Museum Courtyard]]
The [[Robert Brady (musum founder)|Robert Brady]] Museum is on Nezahualcoyotl Street and occupies the building known as the Casa de la Torre, originally part of the monastery of La Asunción.<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/> In 1960, it was purchased by the U.S. artist, Robert Brady, who transformed it into his home and a private art and collectible museum.<ref name="wright"/> It contains a collection of art and crafts from around the world as well as the original ''[[Self-Portrait with Monkey]]'' painted by [[Frida Kahlo]]. Other works are by artists such as [[Miguel Cobarruvias]], [[Pelegrí Clavé]], [[María Izquierdo]], and [[Rufino Tamayo]]. Non-Mexican paintings include those from North America and Europe. Other objects in the collection include antique furniture, African and Indian crafts, and archeological pieces.<ref name="finsemana"/> The collection occupies fourteen rooms of the old house, which has been kept mostly the way it was when Brady died in 1986 and bequeathed the house and its contents to the city.<ref name="wright"/><ref name="mexdesmorelos"/>

====Tlaltenango====
[[File:AtriumFacMilagroTlalCV.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Atrium and façade of the Nuestra Señora de los Milagros Church]]
[[File:NaveMilagrosTlatenango.JPG|thumb|upright|right|interior of the Church of San Jose]]
Tlaltenango used to be a separate town, but now is a neighborhood of Cuernavaca city. The main attraction there is the church compound containing the Church of San José and the Church of Nuestra Señora de los Milagros de Tlaltenango. San José is one of the oldest churches in Mexico, built between 1521 and 1523. Two centuries later an image of the Virgin appeared to members of this village, prompting the building of the second church. This is the Sanctuary of Nuestra Señora de los Milagros, which was built in 1730, with its bell towers built at the end of the nineteenth century.<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/><ref name="finsemana"/>

====Hacienda Atlacomulco====
The Hacienda de San Antonio Atlacomulco is located south of the Cuernavaca and was established by Hernán Cortés as one of the first sugar plantations in Mexico. Descendants of the Conquistador held the property until the nineteenth century, when it became the property of [[Lucas Alamán]], who modernized the facility. The hacienda lost its surrounding properties during the [[Mexican Revolution]] and all that remains is the main house. After a long period of restoration and modification, the hacienda today houses an exclusive hotel, which can accommodate conventions and banquets.<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/><ref name="finsemana"/>

====Museum of Traditional and Herbal Medicine and the ethnicbotanical garden====
South of the city center is Acapantzingo, which had been a separate town, but now is part of the city. A large farm owned by Emperor Maximilian I existed there in the 1860s. It was named Olindo, referring to a character in the poem by [[Torquato Tasso]].<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/> The emperor used this property as one of his residences in Cuernavaca, and according to rumor, to enjoy the company of a certain beautiful Indian woman.<ref name="finsemana"/> On this farm and in what was the Pavilion, is now the Museum of Traditional and Herbal Medicine (Museo de Medicina Tradicional). The museum sponsors workshops and classes on the use of plants to make soap, cremes, dyes, decorative objects, and more. Outside is the ethnicbotanical garden with exhibits including 800 species of plants organized by uses, such as the making of textiles, animal feed, condiments, ritual, and others.<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/>

====Museo Muros====
Located a short distance outside the city center is another art museum called the Museo Muros (Avenida Vicente Guerrero 205, Colonia Lomas de Selva). This museum exhibits the art collection of Jacques and Natasha Gelman. Jacques, a Russian émigré, made his fortune as the producer of hit comedies by the legendary Mexican comic, [[Cantinflas]]. A good portion of the money he made went into the acquisition of art, which he collected for half a century. Works by Rivera, Kahlo, [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[Francisco Toledo]], Rufino Tamayo, [[Cisco Jimenez]], [[Gerardo Suter]], and [[Juan Soriano]] are among the works that could be found there. This museum was closed in 2008.<ref name="wright"/> Opened in its place is the [[Papalote museo del niño]] an interactive children's museum with up to thirty exhibitions and artistic experiences for children, such as Mindball, Kandinsky Rug, Gigantic Piano, and others.

====Chapultepec Ecological Park====
The Chapultepec Ecological Park is located about four km southeast of the Cuernavaca city center. It contains fresh-water springs, which form the beginning of a river, and is surrounded by large trees called Chapultepec. Before 2003, this area was privately operated under concession as the "Magic Jungle". Today, it is a public park administered by the State Commission of Water and Environment. In addition to a large family picnic area with playgrounds, the park has constructed habitats for monkeys, birds, crocodiles, reptiles, and aquatic plants. It also has a petting zoo, environmental museum, planetarium, house of terror, theatre, and tour train.<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/>

====Chapitel del Calvario====
[[File:InsideChapitelCV.JPG|thumb|left|Interior of the Chapitel del Calvario]]
[[File:ChapitelCV1.JPG|thumb|The Chapitel del Calvario]]
The Chapitel del Calvario is a church located at the corner of Morelos and Matamoros Streets, which was constructed in 1532. The word "chapitel" means "[[spire]]" as the church is named after two spires that define its appearance. It also has a fourteen-meter-high dome. It was constructed in the sixteenth century and was the last building encountered within Cuernavaca, as one left the city on the road to Mexico City. In 1772, this church was dedicated to the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]].<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/><ref name="finsemana"/>

====El Castillito====
Museo de Fotografía Antigua, also known as El Castillito (the little castle), is located one block from the Chapitel del Calvario. It is a very small [[brick]] building that dates from the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. It is now a small museum dedicated to antique [[photograph]]s of the city of Cuernavaca.<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/><ref name="finsemana"/>

====Salto de San Antón====
[[File:WtrfllSanAntonCV.JPG|thumb|Inside the Salto de San Antón ravine]]
The Salto de San Anton is a large ravine with a small waterfall that is located within the city limits of Cuernavaca. The waterfall is 36 meters high, with its water coming from a small tributary of the Zempoala River. The vertical walls of the ravine are of [[basalt]] and broad-leafed vegetation grows in nooks and crannies of the stone. A series of stairs and platforms have been built to enable access to the waterfall area from the park above. Unfortunately, a lot of trash gets dumped there.<ref name="mexdesmorelos"/><ref name="finsemana"/>

====Festivals and dance====
[[File:BicentennialClockCVMX.JPG|thumb|left|Clock ticking down to Mexico's Bicentennial celebrations in Parque Morelos]]
The Feria de la Flor was established in 1965 as a festival that is held from 2 to 12 May. In the Borda Garden, flower growers from all over Mexico come to exhibit their wares, competing for an annual prize. The event also has traditional fair rides, [[cockfighting|cockfights]], and horse competitions as well as music and sociocultural events. Neighborhood celebrations are held in Cuernavaca, mostly for patron saints, they include 15 May, the feast of San Isidro Labrador; 13 June, the feast of San Antonio in the neighborhood of San Antón, with Aztec dances; 6 August, the feast of the Savior or the Transfiguration in [[Ocotepec, Cuernavaca, Morelos|Ocotepec]], featuring the Moors and Christians dance, [[mole (sauce)|mole]], and [[pulque]]; 10 August the feast of San Lorenzo in Chamilpa; 15 August, the festival of the Assumption of Mary in Santa María Ahuacatilán; and 8 September, Festival of Nuestra Señora de los Milagros in Tlaltenango. Since 1965, the city Cuernavaca has had a [[carnival]] as well.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The Huehuechis, a dance group, was started in Cuernavaca in 1870 by a group of young people. They dressed up in old boots and clothes, covering their faces with cloth, dancing sponteaneously in the streets with whistles and shouts. The name comes from a Nahuatl word for old, worn-out clothing. The event spread to other municipalities. It became popular enough among participants and spectators alike to be organized formally in 1871, when it became a traditional way to celebrate the days just before Lent, or the Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday of Carnival. The tradition spread to Tepoztlan, where it became even more famous after the people there modified the clothing worn, adding masks with beards and large mustaches. The dance there was renamed "[[Chinelos]]". This new version became a fixture at the carnaval of Yautepec and other towns in Morelos as well.<ref name="encmuc"/>

===International presence in Cuernavaca===
Cuernavaca has been a getaway, especially for the well-to-do, since Aztec times. This has continued to the twenty-first century, with many of these residents including artists, intellectuals, and film stars.<ref name="suspiro">{{cite web |first=Leonor |last=Lopez |title= Cuernavaca "a la breve distancia de un suspiro " |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1283-Cuernavaca-%5Ca-la-breve-distancia-de-un-suspiro-%5C-%28Morelos%29 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans_title=Cuernavaca, just a breath away |accessdate=2009-09-28 }}</ref> For example, [[María Félix]], a Mexican [[diva]], had an opulent, cobalt-blue and papaya-colored villa on Avendia Palmira, along with five other houses. It is known as the Casa de las Tortugas (House of the Turtles) and has Louis XV beds, is adorned with silk brocades, Venetian mosaics, talavera urns, marble fireplaces, sixteenth-century Spanish armor, Italian gilded chairs, and portraits of her created by [[Antoine Tzapoff]].

The legalization of [[gambling]] for a short time in the 1930s attracted Hollywood visitors such as Rita Hayworth and [[mafia]] figures such as Bugsy Siegel and Al Capone from the United States. Cuernavaca was the setting of [[Malcolm Lowry]]'s ''[[Under the Volcano]]'' written in 1947. It is a tale of despair and self-destruction due to [[alcoholism]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, the city attracted many directors, producers, and actors from [[Hollywood]], many of whom had been blacklisted through the influence of [[McCarthyism]]. In the 1960s, the city became one of the centers of the psychedelic movement, attracting many artists, composers, and [[hippies]]. Another infamous resident was [[Sam "Momo" Giancana]], a mafia boss from Chicago, who made Cuernavaca his home from 1967 until his arrest and deportation in 1974. He was associated with the [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre]]. Many of these foreign residents, famous or not, first come as visitors, but then decide to stay.<ref name="verdadera"/>

The trend continues today, with a large number of retirees, diplomats, business executives, and government officials living in Cuernavaca from all over the world. It still attracts creative and intellectual people.<ref name="living">{{cite web |title= Living in Cuernavaca |url= http://www.solutionsabroad.com/en/cities/cuernavaca/living-in-cuernavaca.html |accessdate=2009-09-28 }}</ref> Many of these foreign residents have formed active expatriate groups, such as the ''Cuernavaca Newcomers Club'' to offer get-togethers and advice for its members and newcomers to the city.<ref name="wright"/><ref name="Taylor"/> Services for foreign residents include a large network of English-speaking doctors, foreign mass media via satellite, and ATMs networked to U.S. banks.<ref name="glance">{{cite web |title= Cuernavaca, Morelos at a Glance  |url= http://www.mexicoretirementguide.com/communities/cuernavaca.htm |publisher= |accessdate=2009-09-28 }}</ref>

The deposed Shah of Iran Mohammed Reza Palevi, during his exile, lived for a short time in Cuernavaca.

Cuernavaca also has attracted Hollywood production with parts of the 1969 Western film ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' being shot in the countryside south of the city, and parts of the classic 1979 comedy ''[[The In-Laws (1979 film)|The In-Laws]]'', starring [[Alan Arkin]] and [[Peter Falk]], being filmed there.

==Economy==
Most of the economic activity in the municipality is retail trade, concentrated in and around the city of Cuernavaca. Agriculture and fish farming employs the least number of people, although the municipality contains a good quantity of resources for these enterprises. The far north of the municipality generally is not suited to agriculture, due to the terrain and types of volcanic soil found there. Most agriculture is concentrated in the southeast. The lower elevations, at around 1,800 meters, is best-suited for fishing and fish-farming. The middle range, between 1,800 and 2,100 meters, has uses mixed between agriculture and forest products, and the elevations higher than 2,100 are primarily forest. Fish farming areas are under pressure from urban development, especially in the Ahuatepec region east of the city, where irregular and sometimes illegal, housing developments are appearing among the farms.<ref name="encmuc"/>

On the outskirts of Cuernavaca, there are a handful of plant [[Plant nursery|nurseries]], specializing in the planting, growing and distribution, including international shipments, of plants, flowers and seeds. Many famous gardens around the world are supplied with flowers from the Cuernavaca region.

Industry is minimal and mostly limited to micro-industries such as printing, framing, ceramics, garment-making, and the production of cleaning supplies. This employs about 28% of the population. Most of the population (67%) is employed in the retail and service industries, both dependent on tourism.<ref name="encmuc"/>

Crafts from this area primarily consist of ceramics and [[wax]] products. The wax used is from bees and generally it is shaped into capricious figures. Flowerpots and clay objects from San Antón, handcrafted paper from wood chips with multicolored paintings, and wood lacquered masks are other products of the municipality.<ref name="encmuc"/>

'''Robert Edward Machado''' (better known simply as '''Rob Machado''') (b. October 16, 1973 Sydney, Australia) is an [[Australia|Australian-born]] [[United States|American]] professional [[surfer]] from [[Cardiff-by-the-Sea]], a community in [[Encinitas]] ([[San Diego]] County), California.

[[File:Robert Machado, Professional Surfer.jpg|thumb|Professional Surfer Rob Machado provides live commentary during the Boost Mobile Pro at Lower Trestles, September of 2009]]

Machado attended [[San Dieguito High School]], and is known for his casual, "laid-back" style both in and out of the water.  Though he rides a modern tri-fin [[shortboard]], he is still considered a "soul-surfer" largely because of his soft-spoken, humble personality and his disinterest in the spotlight, along with his fluid surfing style, which has earned him the nickname "Mr. Smoothy."  He is one of the best-known goofy-foot surfers in the world today.

Rob has won many of pro surfing's most prestigious contests, including Hawaii's Pipeline Masters (Triple Crown of Surfing),<ref>{{cite news|last=Arritt|first=Dan|title=Machado Is Left With Nowhere to Look but Up|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2003-08-01|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/aug/01/sports/sp-surfing1|accessdate=2010-09-04}}</ref> and the U.S. Open of Surfing,<ref>{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Pete|title=Machado Rules Pier – and Peers|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2006-07-31|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/31/sports/sp-surf31|accessdate=2010-09-04}}</ref> the largest surfing event held on the U.S. mainland.  His 2006 win in that competition was only his latest at [[Huntington Beach]], and it came on the heels of his victory at the 2006 Monster Energy Pro (also held at Pipeline) on Oahu's North Shore. Also, Rob was on the "West" team that won the 2006 Summer X Games surfing competition, called "The Game," held each year in Mexico.

He is now retired from the [[World championship tour (WCT) surfing|WCT (World Championship Tour)]], but was among the top contenders until injuries began plaguing him in the past few years.  Nevertheless, he's finished in the top three of the world in the year-end rankings twice.  Since retiring, he has concentrated on a select few surfing competitions that are close to his heart.
The surfing magazines and his videos and films keep him in the public eye.

Rob hosts and participates in an annual event held at his home reef called the Rob Machado Surf Classic and Beach Fair, which is an amateur competition for the locals of all ages, and it includes demo sessions with Rob and other pros, as well as a lunchtime break when he talks with kids and gives them pointers.  The competition crowns a King and Queen of the Reef for the best overall performances in a combination of surf-related events over the weekend.

Currently, Rob is still frequently voted in surf magazine polls as readers' favorites, and has many sponsors, including [[Hurley International|Hurley]], [[Reef (shoe company)|Reef]], and [[Nixon Watches|Nixon]].  Machado is a very good friend of and served as an inspiration to [[quadriplegic]] surfer [[Jesse Billauer]] of the Life Rolls On Foundation.

Just like [[Kelly Slater]], he played "[[Surf's Up (film)#Cast|himself]]" in the 2007 animated picture "[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]."
He also wrote and starred as himself in the 2009 film The Drifter.<ref>{http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1462768/}</ref>

Machado was featured in Vogue magazine's summer issue (June 2010) with Blake Lively, in photographs which were taken in Cardiff and Encinitas, California.

Machado is a 2011 inductee into the Surfing Walk of Fame in [[Huntington Beach, California]] in the surf champion category.<ref>{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=Corky|title=Walk of Fame inductee list one of the best ever|newspaper=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=June 9, 2011|authorlink=Corky Carroll}}</ref>
[[Image:Boost Mobile Pro 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Right to left: Rob Machado (with sunglasses), Christiaan Bailey, Kelly Slater & Sam George]]

In 2013, Rob married his current wife Sophie Vilardo and the two now have a son together. 

In 2014, Rob re-signed with long-term sponsor Reef who subsequently released another 'Rob Machado signature model' sandal.

[[File:Run on the Seamen's Savings' Bank during the Panic of 1857.png|thumb|336px|right|[[Bank run]] on the Seamen's Savings' Bank during the [[Panic of 1857]].]]

'''Panic''' is a sudden sensation of [[fear]] which is so strong as to dominate or prevent [[reason]] and [[logical]] thinking, replacing it with overwhelming feelings of [[anxiety]] and frantic [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]] consistent with an animalistic [[Fight-or-flight response|fight-or-flight]] reaction. Panic may occur singularly in individuals or manifest suddenly in large groups as [[mass panic]] (closely related to [[herd behavior]]).

The word ''panic'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''???????'', "pertaining to shepherd god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]", who took amusement from frightening herds of goats and sheep into sudden bursts of uncontrollable fear. The ancient [[Greeks]] credited the battle of [[Marathon]]'s victory to Pan, using his name for the frenzied, frantic fear exhibited by the fleeing enemy soldiers.

[[Human evolution#Before Homo|Prehistoric men]] used mass panic as a technique when hunting animals, especially [[ruminant]]s. [[Herd]]s reacting to unusually strong sounds or unfamiliar visual effects were directed towards [[cliff]]s, where they eventually jumped to their deaths when cornered. [[Human]]s are also vulnerable to panic and it is often considered infectious, in the sense one person's panic may easily spread to other people nearby and soon the entire group acts [[Irrationality|irrational]]ly, but people also have the ability to prevent and/or control their own and others' panic by disciplined thinking or training (such as disaster drills). [[Architect]]s and [[city planner]]s try to accommodate the [[symptom]]s of panic, such as [[herd behavior]], during [[design]] and [[planning]], often using [[simulation]]s to determine the best way to lead people to a safe exit and prevent congestion ([[stampede]]s). The most effective methods are often non-intuitive. A tall column, approximately 1&nbsp;ft (300&nbsp;mm) in diameter, placed in front of the door exit at a precisely calculated distance, may speed up the evacuation of a large room by up to 30%, as the obstacle divides the congestion well ahead of the choke point.{{cn|date=October 2012}}

An influential theoretical treatment of panic is found in [[Neil Smelser|Neil J. Smelser]]'s ''Theory of Collective Behavior''. The science of panic management has found important practical applications in the armed forces and emergency services of the world.

Many highly publicized cases of deadly panic occurred during massive public events. The layout of [[Mecca]] was extensively redesigned by [[Saudi]] authorities in an attempt to eliminate frequent [[stampede]]s, which kill an average of 250 [[pilgrim]]s every year.<ref>{{Citation

The chief investigator was Theodore Or, a judge at an Israeli High Court.

==Main conclusions of the Or Commission==

===Police responsibility===
The governmental body of inquiry criticised the Israeli police for being unprepared for the riots and using excessive force to disperse the protesting and rioting citizens. Eight policemen were reprimanded by the commission, most of them after they had retired from the police force. Two police officers were released from the force due to the conclusions.

===Official responsibility===
As the Commission's mandate was one of inquiry, no action was taken against most of those warned by it, but rather recommendations were made. Most Jewish politicians were determined to be largely not responsible, with the exception being the Internal Security Ministry, Prof. [[Shlomo Ben-Ami]]. The commission recommended that he be removed from his post, and he would later become foreign minister. Also, three Arab figures (two Arab members [[Knesset]] and the head of the northern branch of the Islamic movement in Israel) were found to be partially responsible by incitement that preceded the riots.<ref name="Haaretz Official Summary">{{cite news

|publisher = [[Haaretz]]
|accessdate = 2007-10-05}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}
</ref>

===Background to the demonstrations===
The Or Commission found that Arab citizens suffer discrimination in Israel and leveled criticism at the government for failing to give fair and equal attention to the needs of Arab citizens of Israel. The commission found that frustration with discrimination led to the outpourings of frustration in October 20001.<ref name="Haaretz Official Summary"/>

==Reception==

The commission's report was highly controversial on all sides, both gravely disappointing the families of the victims and angering those who blamed Arab citizens for the unrest of October 2000.

Arab advocacy organizations such as Adalah,<ref>[http://www.adalah.org/eng/commission.php Adalah reports on the Or Commission findings]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> the Arab Association for Human Rights, and Mossawa argued that the report exonerated Jewish Israeli political figures who played a central role in mishandling the crisis around October 2000, and gave slap-on-the-wrist treatment to those who fired the shots, while severely censuring Arab political figures for incendiary speech. Some commentators believed this amounted to virtual circumvention of [[due process]] for Arab citizens.<ref>{{cite news |author=Yoav Stern |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/adalah-police-failed-to-seek-indictments-in-oct-2000-riots-1.201366 |title=Adalah: Police failed to seek indictments in Oct. 2000 riots |work=Haaretz |date=13 October 2006 |accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref>

At the same time, the Or Commission's statements were perhaps the first public official acknowledgment of discrimination faced by the Arab citizenry of Israel; Adalah and Mossawa commended the Or Commission for this admission. One year after the release of the commission report, Theodore Or publicly attacked the [[Politics of Israel|government]] for failing to implement its recommendations.<ref>{{cite news |author=Yair Ettinger |date=2 September 2004 |newspaper=Haaretz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/or-slams-apathy-over-arab-riots-report-1.133505 |title=Or slams apathy over Arab riots report |accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref>

[[James Taranto]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote: <blockquote>Yet even acknowledging that Israeli democracy is flawed, its political system is still vastly superior to those of its adversaries. Israeli Arabs enjoy more political and civil liberties than citizens of just about any Arab country; and the only Arab lands that come anywhere close to being democracies are Lebanon, Iraq and the disputed Palestinian territories—the last two only because of American intervention. That the Israeli government criticizes its own treatment of Arabs is a testament to its democracy; can anyone imagine, say, the Saudi regime offering similar criticisms of its treatment of Shiites, non-Muslims or women? American democracy, too, is not without its flaws. During World War II, for instance, black Americans were still disfranchised, and innocent Japanese-Americans were rounded up and put in camps. It does not follow that America was no better than Nazi Germany.<ref>{{cite news |author=James Taranto |date=20 March 2006 |work=The Wall Street Journal |title=(unknown title) |url=http://www.icjs-online.org/index.php?eid=1164&ICJS=2394&article=858 |accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

The '''Altamont Speedway Free Festival''' was a [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]-era [[rock concert]] held on Saturday, December 6, 1969, at the [[Altamont Raceway Park|Altamont Speedway]] in northern California, between [[Tracy, California|Tracy]] and [[Livermore, California|Livermore]].  The event is best known for considerable violence, including the [[death of Meredith Hunter]] and three accidental deaths: two caused by a [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run]] car accident and one by [[drowning]] in an irrigation canal. Four births were reported during the event.<ref name="gimmeshelter">{{cite video |people=The Rolling Stones et al. | title=Gimme Shelter  |type = DVD released 2000 |publisher=Criterion |date=1970 }}</ref> Scores were injured, numerous cars were stolen and then abandoned, and there was extensive property damage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ortega |first=Tony |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2010/08/in_the_wake_of_1.php |title=Viewing the Remains of a Mean Saturday Village Voice December 18, 1969 |publisher=Blogs.villagevoice.com |date=2010-08-24 |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref><ref>[http://www.livermorehistory.com/Newsletters/2011-01-02_Jan_Feb.pdf "Altamont Rock Festival of 1969: The Aftermath,"] ''Livermore Heritage Guild Journal'', January/February 2011</ref>

Approximately 300,000 people attended the concert, and some anticipated that it would be a "[[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] West."<ref>[http://www.livermorehistory.com/Newsletters/2010_03-04_MarApr.pdf "Altamont Rock Festival: '60s Abruptly End,"] ''Livermore Heritage Guild Journal'', March/April 2010</ref>  Filmmakers [[Albert and David Maysles]] shot footage of the event and incorporated it into a documentary film titled ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]'' (1970).

==The Jefferson Airplane/Grateful Dead-centered background narrative==
According to [[Jefferson Airplane]]'s [[Spencer Dryden]], the idea for "a kind of Woodstock West" began when he and bandmate [[Jorma Kaukonen]] discussed the staging of a free concert with the Grateful Dead and Rolling Stones in Golden Gate Park. Referring to the Stones, Dryden said, "Next to the [[Beatles]] they were the biggest rock and roll band in the world, and we wanted them to experience what we were experiencing in [[San Francisco]]." As plans were being finalized, Jefferson Airplane were on the road, and by early December they were in Florida believing the concert plans for Golden Gate Park were proceeding. But by December 4, the plans had broken down, in [[Paul Kantner]]'s account because the city and police departments were unhelpful; innate conflict between the hippies of [[Haight-Ashbury]] and the police was manifested in obstructiveness. [[Sears Point Raceway]] was suggested, but its owners wanted $100,000 in [[escrow]] from the Rolling Stones. At the last moment, Dick Carter offered his Altamont Speedway in [[Alameda County]] for the festival. Jefferson Airplane flew out of [[Miami]] on December 5. Kantner said the location was taken in a spirit of desperation: "There was no way to control it, no supervision or order." According to [[Grace Slick]], "The vibes were bad. Something was very peculiar, not particularly bad, just real peculiar. It was that kind of hazy, abrasive and unsure day. I had expected the loving vibes of Woodstock but that wasn't coming at me. This was a whole different thing."<ref>Grace Slick, Biography, Barbara Rowes, pp. 155-157</ref>

==The Rolling Stones/Grateful Dead-centered background narrative==
During the [[Rolling Stones]]' American tour in 1969, many (including journalists) felt that the ticket prices were far too high. In answer to this criticism, the Rolling Stones decided to end their tour with a free concert in San Francisco.

The concert was originally scheduled to be held at San Jose State University's practice field, as there had recently been a three-day outdoor free festival there with 52 bands and 80,000 attendees. Dirt Cheap Productions was asked to help secure the property again for the Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead to play a free concert. The Stones and the Dead were told the city of San Jose was not in the mood for another large concert and the grounds were out of bounds. [[Golden Gate Park]] in [[San Francisco]] was next on the list. However, a previously scheduled [[Chicago Bears]]-[[San Francisco 49ers]] football game at [[Kezar Stadium]], located in Golden Gate Park, made that venue impractical, and permits were never issued for the concert. The venue was then changed to the [[Infineon Raceway|Sears Point Raceway]]. However, a dispute with Sears Point's owner, [[Filmways, Inc.]], arose over a $300,000 up-front cash deposit from the Rolling Stones and film distribution rights, so the festival was moved once again. The Altamont Raceway was chosen at the suggestion of its then-owner, local businessman Dick Carter. The concert was to take place on Saturday, December 6; the location was switched on the night of Thursday, December 4.

In making preparations, Grateful Dead manager [[Rock Scully]] and concert organizer [[Michael Lang (producer)|Michael Lang]] helicoptered over the site before making the selection, much as Lang had done when the [[Woodstock Festival]] was moved at the last moment from [[Wallkill, Orange County, New York|Wallkill, New York]] to [[Bethel, New York]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=sWCRWJnTTF8C&pg=PA343&dq=Michael+Lang+Altamont&lr=#v=onepage&q=Michael%20Lang%20Altamont&f=false Inside History of the Grateful Dead] by Dennis McNally - Broadway (August 12, 2003) ISBN 0-7679-1186-5</ref>

The hasty move resulted in numerous logistical problems, including a lack of facilities such as portable toilets and medical tents. The move also created a problem for the stage design; instead of being on top of a rise, which suited the geography at Sears Point, at Altamont the stage would now be at the bottom of a slope.  The Rolling Stones' stage manager on the 1969 tour, [[Chip Monck]], explained that "the stage was one metre high – 39 inches for us - and [at Sears Point] it was on the top of a hill, so all the audience pressure was back upon them".<ref name="curry">Curry, David.  'Deadly Day for the Rolling Stones'.  ''The Canberra Times''.  December 5, 2009.</ref>  Because of the short notice for the change of location, the stage couldn't be changed. "We weren’t working with scaffolding, we were working in an older fashion with parallels.  You could probably have put another stage below it … but nobody had one," Monck said.<ref name="curry">Curry, David.  'Deadly Day for the Stones'.  The Canberra Times.  December 5, 2009.</ref>

Because the stage was so low, members of the [[Hells Angels]] motorcycle club, led by [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] chapter head [[Ralph "Sonny" Barger]], were asked to surround the stage to provide security.<ref name="gimmeshelter"/><ref name="saloncom">{{cite web |last=Sragow |first=Michael |title=Gimme Shelter: The True Story |url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/col/srag/2000/08/10/gimme_shelter/index.html |date=August 10, 2000  |publisher=Salon.com |accessdate=2009-07-07 }}</ref>

==Security==

By some accounts, the [[Hells Angels]] were hired as security by the management of the Rolling Stones, on the recommendation of the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane (who both had previously used the Angels for security at performances without incident),<ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp; Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-rolling-stones/news/artists/14845/87369/87433 |title=The Rolling Stones &#124; Rolling Stone Music |publisher=Rollingstone.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101104165015/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-rolling-stones/news/artists/14845/87369/87433| archivedate= 4 November 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="miller">Miller, James.''Flowers in the Dustbin: The Rise of Rock and Roll, 1947-1977''. Simon & Schuster (1999), pp. 275-77.ISBN 0-684-80873-0.</ref> for $500 worth of beer (${{Inflation|US|500|1969}} after inflation). This story has been denied by some parties who were directly involved. According to the road manager of the Rolling Stones' 1969 US Tour [[Sam Cutler]], "the only agreement there ever was ... the Angels would make sure nobody tampered with the generators, but that was the extent of it. But there was no way 'They're going to be the police force' or anything like that. That's all [[bollocks]]."<ref name="m344">McNally, p. 344</ref> The deal was made at a meeting including Cutler, Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully and Pete Knell, a member of the Hells Angels' San Francisco chapter.<ref name="curry">Curry, David.  'Deadly Day for the Rolling Stones'.  The Canberra Times.  December 5, 2009.</ref>  According to Cutler, the arrangement was that all the bands were supposed to share the $500 beer cost, "[but] the person who paid it was me, and I never got it back, to this day.”<ref name="curry"/>

Hells Angels member Bill "Sweet William" Fritsch recalled this exchange he had with Cutler at a meeting prior to the concert, in which Cutler had asked them to provide security:

:"We don't police things.  We're not a security force.  We go to concerts to enjoy ourselves and have fun."

:"Well, what about helping people out - you know, giving directions and things?"

:"Sure, we can do that."

When Cutler asked how they would like to be paid, William replied, "we like beer."<ref name="m344"/> In the documentary ''Gimme Shelter'', [[Sonny Barger]] states that the Hells Angels were not interested in policing the event, and that organizers had told him that the Angels would be required to do little more than sit on the edge of the stage, drink beer and make sure there weren't any murders or rapes occurring. Other accounts{{Who|date=October 2008}} also state that the initial arrangement was for the Hells Angels to watch over the equipment, but that Cutler later moved them, and their beer, near the stage to placate them or to protect the stage.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In 2009, Cutler explained his decision to use the Angels. "I was talking with them, because I was interested in the security of my band -- everyone’s security, for that matter. In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. They were the only people who were strong and together. [They had to protect the stage] because it was descending into absolute chaos.  Who was going to stop it?"<ref name="curry"/> Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully said that if the Angels hadn't been on the stage, "that whole crowd could have easily passed out, and rolled down onto the stage. There was no barrier."<ref name="curry"/>

[[Stefan Ponek]], who hosted a December 7, 1969 [[KSAN (FM)|KSAN]]-FM radio broadcast of a four-hour, "day after" post-concert telephone call-in forum (and who also helped organize the event), provided the following for the 2000 release of the ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]'' DVD: "What we learned in the broadcast was pretty much startling: These guys -- the Angels -- had been hired and paid with $500 of beer, on a truck with ice, to essentially bring in the Stones and keep people off the stage. That was the understanding, that was the deal. And it seemed like there was not a lot of disagreement over that; that seemed to emerge as a fact, because it became rather apparent that the Stones didn't know what kind of people they were dealing with."

The ''Gimme Shelter'' DVD contains extensive excerpts from that broadcast. A Hells Angels member who identified himself as "Pete, from Hells Angels San Francisco" (most likely Pete Knell, president of the San Francisco chapter), says "they offered us $500 worth of beer (to) go there and take care of the stage...we took this $500 worth of beer to do it." Sonny Barger, who also called into the KSAN forum, states: "We were told by one of the (other Hells Angels) clubs if we showed up down there (and) sat on the stage and drink some beer... that the Stones manager or somebody had bought for us." In his lengthy call, Barger mentions the beer deal yet again: "I ain't no cop, I ain't never going to ever pretend to be no cop. I didn't go there to police nothing, man. They told me if I could sit on the edge of the stage so nobody could climb over me, I could drink beer until the show was over. And that's what I went there to do."

[[Emmett Grogan]] (founder of the radical community-action group, the [[Diggers (theater)|Diggers]]), who was intimately involved in the organization of the event (especially at the two earlier-planned venues), confirmed the $500 beer arrangement on that same KSAN forum with Ponek.

"Pete" also tells host Ponek that the Angels were hired by Cutler because of some rowdy, anxious on-stage incidents during the Stones' Oakland and Miami concerts weeks earlier. As security guards, Pete said "we ain't into that security", but that they agreed after the beer offer. He also claimed that, other than being told to "just keep people off the stage", Cutler gave the Hells Angels very little specific instructions for stage security: "They didn't say nothing to us about any of that."  And although the Angels are not security guards, "If we say we're going to do something, we do it. If we decide to do it, it's done. No matter what, how far we have to go to do it."  The similar lack of detailed security instructions by the concert's management was also mentioned by Barger during his telephone call-in.

Altamont Speedway owner Dick Carter had hired hundreds of professional, plainclothes security guards, ostensibly more for the purpose of protecting his property rather than for the safety and well-being of the concertgoers. Barger mentions these guards, as identified by their wearing of "little white buttons".

Political scientist and cultural critic [[James Miller (academic)|James Miller]] believes that since [[Ken Kesey]] had invited the Hells Angels to one of his outdoor [[Acid Tests]], the [[hippies]] had viewed the bikers unrealistically, idealizing them as "[[noble savage]]s"<ref name="miller"/> and thus "outlaw brothers of the counterculture".<ref>"Ever since Ken Kesey had invited the motorcycle gang to one of his outdoor LSD bashes, the bikers had been widely regarded as noble savages, barbarians, perhaps, but the best imaginable guardians for the gates of Eden. And at Monterey, a splendid time was guaranteed for all," James Miller, ''Flowers in the Dustbin: The Rise of Rock and Roll'', 1947-1977 (1999), 275–76.</ref> Miller also maintains that the Rolling Stones may have been misled by their experience with a British contingent of self-described "Hells Angels", a non-outlaw group of admirers of American biker gear who had provided nonviolent security at a free Stones concert earlier that year in [[Hyde Park, London]].<ref name="miller"/> Cutler, however, denies ever having had any illusions about the true nature of Californian Hells Angels. "That's another canard foisted on the world by the press", he said,<ref name="curry"/> but Rock Scully remembers explaining to the Stones what the "real" Angels were like after watching the Hyde Park concert.<ref name="curry"/>

==Situation deteriorates==
The first act on the stage, [[Santana (band)|Santana]], gave a performance that generally went smoothly; however over the course of the day, the mood of both the crowd and the Angels became progressively agitated and violent. The Angels had been drinking their free beer all day in front of the stage, and most were very drunk. The crowd had also become antagonistic and unpredictable, attacking each other, the Angels, and the performers. A Mick Jagger biographer, [[Anthony Scaduto]], in ''Mick Jagger: Everybody's Lucifer'', wrote that the only time the crowd seemed to calm down to any degree was during a set by the country-rocking [[The Flying Burrito Brothers|Flying Burrito Brothers]]. By the time the Rolling Stones took stage in the early evening, the mood had taken a decidedly ugly turn as numerous fights had erupted between Angels and crowd members and within the crowd itself. Denise Jewkes of local San Francisco rock band [[the Ace of Cups]], six months pregnant, was hit in the head by an empty beer bottle thrown from the crowd and suffered a [[skull fracture]]. The Angels proceeded to arm themselves with sawed-off pool cues and motorcycle chains to drive the crowd further back from the stage.

After the crowd (perhaps accidentally) toppled one of the Angels' motorcycles, the Angels became even more aggressive, including toward the performers. [[Marty Balin]] of [[Jefferson Airplane]] was punched in the head and knocked unconscious by an Angel during the band's set, as seen in the documentary film ''Gimme Shelter''.<ref name="gimmeshelter"/> The [[Grateful Dead]] had been scheduled to play between Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and the Rolling Stones, but after hearing about the Balin incident from [[Santana (band)|Santana]] drummer [[Michael Shrieve]], they refused to play and left the venue, citing the quickly degenerating security situation.

The Rolling Stones waited until sundown to perform. [[Stanley Booth]] stated that part of the reason for the delay was that [[Bill Wyman]] had missed the helicopter ride to the venue.<ref name="booth-true">{{cite book |last=Booth |first=Stanley |title=The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones (2nd edition) |publisher= A Capella Books |year=2000 |isbn=1-55652-400-5 }}</ref> When the Stones began their set, a tightly-packed group of between 4,000 and 5,000 jammed to the very edge of the stage, and many attempted to climb onto it.<ref>The Capital, April 20, 1970</ref>

==Death of Meredith Hunter==
{{Main|Death of Meredith Hunter}}

Rolling Stones lead singer [[Mick Jagger]], who had already been punched in the head by a concertgoer within seconds of emerging from his helicopter,<ref name="gimmeshelter"/><ref name="saloncom"/> was visibly intimidated by the unruly situation and urged everyone to, "Just be cool down in the front there, don't push around." During the third song, "[[Sympathy for the Devil]]", a fight erupted in the front of the crowd at the foot of the stage, prompting the Stones to pause their set while the Angels restored order. After a lengthy pause and another appeal for calm, the band restarted the song and continued their set with less incident until the start of "[[Under My Thumb]]". Some of the Hells Angels got into a scuffle with [[Meredith Hunter]], age 18, when he attempted to get onstage  with other fans.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} One of the Hells Angels grabbed Hunter's head, punched him, and chased him back into the crowd.  After a minute's pause, Hunter returned to the stage {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} where, according to ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]'' producer [[Porter Bibb]], Hunter's girlfriend Patty Bredahoft found him and tearfully begged him to calm down and move further back in the crowd with her; but he was reportedly enraged, irrational and so high he could barely walk.<ref>{{cite book|author=Osgerby, Bill |year=2005|title= Biker: Truth and Myth: How the Original Cowboy of the Road Became the Easy Rider of the Silver Screen|publisher= Globe Pequot|page=99|ISBN =1-59228-841-3}}</ref> Rock Scully, who could see the audience clearly from the top of a truck by the stage, said of Hunter, “I saw what he was looking at, that he was crazy, he was on drugs, and that he had murderous intent. There was no doubt in my mind that he intended to do terrible harm to Mick or somebody in the Rolling Stones, or somebody on that stage."<ref name="curry"/>

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Meredith Hunter Altamont.jpg|thumb|Meredith Hunter (in green jacket) making his way to the stage]] -->Following his initial scuffle with the Angels as he tried to climb onstage,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Hunter (as seen in concert footage wearing a bright lime-green suit) returned to the front of the crowd and drew a long-barreled [[.22 caliber]] [[revolver]] from inside his jacket. Hells Angel Alan Passaro, seeing Hunter drawing the revolver, drew a [[knife]] from his belt and charged Hunter from the side, parrying Hunter's pistol with his left hand and stabbing him twice with his right hand, killing him.

The footage was shot by [[Eric Saarinen]], who was on stage taking pictures of the crowd, and [[Baird Bryant]], who climbed atop a bus.<ref>{{cite news|title=Obituary of Baird Bryant|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/baird-bryant-filmmaker-who-captured-the-killing-of-a-fan-in-the-rolling-stones-documentary-gimme-shelter-1052558.html|accessdate=22 April 2011|newspaper=The Independent (UK)|first=Pierre|last=Perrone|date=2008-12-05}}</ref>  Saarinen was unaware of having caught the killing on film. This was discovered more than a week later when raw footage was screened in the New York offices of the Maysles Brothers. In the film sequence, lasting about two seconds, a two-meter opening in the crowd appears, leaving Bredahoft in the center. Hunter enters the opening from the left. His hand rises toward the stage, and the silhouette of a revolver is clearly seen against Bredahoft's light-colored dress. Passaro is seen entering from the right and delivering two stabs with his knife as he parries Hunter's revolver and pushes him off-screen; the opening then closes around Bredahoft. Passaro is reported to have stabbed Hunter five times in the upper back, although only two stabs are visible in the footage. Witnesses also reported Hunter was stomped on by several Hells Angels while he was on the ground.<ref name=rrwd /> The gun was recovered and turned over to police. Hunter's autopsy confirmed he was high on [[methamphetamine]] when he died.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/05/26/ALTAMONT.TMP#ixzz0UvTWCi8g|title=Altamont 'cold case' is being closed: Theory of second stabber debunked by Sheriff's Dept.|last=Lee|first=Henry K.|date=2005-05-26|publisher=sfgate.com|accessdate=2009-10-25}}</ref>  Passaro was arrested and tried for murder in the summer of 1971, but was acquitted after a jury viewed concert footage<ref>{{cite news | title=Movie of Slaying at Rock Fest Is Key Evidence in Coast Trial | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=10 January 1971}}</ref> showing Hunter brandishing the revolver and concluded that Passaro had acted in self-defense.

The Rolling Stones were aware of the skirmish, but not the stabbing ("You couldn't see anything, it was just another scuffle", Jagger tells David Maysles during film editing), and felt that had they abandoned the show, the crowd may have become even more unruly, leading to riots and other chaos.

In 2003, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office initiated a two-year investigation into the possibility of a second Hells Angel having taken part in the stabbing.  Finding insufficient support for this hypothesis, and reaffirming that Passaro acted alone, the office closed the case for good on May 25, 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-05-26-altamont_x.htm |title=USA TODAY, Investigators close decades old Altamont killing case |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2005-05-26 |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref>

==Reactions==

The Altamont concert is often contrasted with the [[Woodstock festival]] that took place less than four months earlier. While Woodstock represented "peace and love", Altamont came to be viewed as the end of the hippie era and the ''de facto'' conclusion of late-1960s American youth culture: "Altamont became, whether fairly or not, a symbol for the death of the Woodstock Nation."<ref>{{cite book|author=Mark Hamilton Lytle |year=2006|title=America's Uncivil Wars: The Sixties Era from Elvis to the Fall of Richard Nixon|publisher=Oxford University Press|page= 336| ISBN= 0-19-517496-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/2009-08-09/news/altamont.art_1_woodstock-youth-culture-altamont |title=Ill-Fated Altamont Is A Far More Fitting Symbol Of The '60s Than Glorified Woodstock Hartford Courant August 9, 2009 |publisher=Courant.com |date=2009-08-09 |accessdate=2013-08-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/blues-based-rock/rolling-stones-at-altamont/ |title=Rolling Stones at Altamont BBC 2 Seven Ages of Rock |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1969-12-06 |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref> Rock music critic [[Robert Christgau]] wrote in 1972 that "Writers focus on Altamont not because it brought on the end of an era but because it provided such a complex metaphor for the way an era ended."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-aow/altamont.php |title=The Rolling Stones: Can't Get No Satisfaction |author=Robert Christgau |journal=Newsday |date=July 1972 |publisher=Robertchristgau.com |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref>

The Grateful Dead wrote several songs about, or in response to, what lyricist [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]] called "the Altamont affair", including "New Speedway Boogie" (featuring the line "One way or another, this darkness got to give") and "Mason's Children".  Both songs were written and recorded during sessions for the early 1970 album ''[[Workingman's Dead]],'' but "Mason's Children" was viewed as too "popular" stylistically and was consequently not included on the album.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The music magazine ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' stated, "Altamont was the product of diabolical egotism, hype, ineptitude, money manipulation, and, at base, a fundamental lack of concern for humanity," in a 14-page, 11-author article on the event entitled "The Rolling Stones Disaster at Altamont: Let It Bleed" published in their January 21, 1970 issue.<ref name=lib /> The article covered the many issues with the event's organization and was very critical of the organizers and the Rolling Stones; one writer stated: "what an enormous thrill it would have been for an Angel to kick Mick Jagger's teeth down his throat." <ref name=lib /> Another follow-up piece in ''Rolling Stone'' called the Altamont event "rock and roll's all-time worst day." <ref name=rrwd /> In ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine, Ralph J. Gleason observed, "The day The Rolling Stones played there, the name ''[Altamont]'' became etched in the minds of millions of people who love pop music and who hate it as well. If the name 'Woodstock' has come to denote the flowering of one phase of the youth culture, 'Altamont' has come to mean the end of it." <ref name=aw>{{cite journal|last=Gleason|first=Ralph J.|title=Aquarius Wept|journal=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=August 1970|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/altamont-1969-aquarius-wept-0870|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref>

The Rolling Stones' member Keith Richards was relatively sanguine about the show, calling it "basically well-handled, but lots of people were tired and a few tempers got frayed" <ref name=rrwd /> and  "on the whole, a good concert." <ref name=aw />

In 2008, a former [[FBI]] agent asserted that some members of the Hells Angels had conspired to murder Mick Jagger in retribution for The Rolling Stones' lack of support following the concert, and for the negative portrayal of the Angels in the ''Gimme Shelter'' film. The conspirators reportedly used a boat to approach a residence where Jagger was staying on [[Long Island, New York]]; the plot failing when the boat was nearly sunk by a storm. Jagger's spokesperson has refused to comment on the matter.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7274829.stm |title=Jagger 'escaped gang murder plot' BBC March 3, 2008 |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-03-03 |accessdate=2010-10-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101102025623/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7274829.stm| archivedate= 2 November 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The Altamont concert and the stabbing incident inspired [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] writer [[Tibor Déry]]'s 1971 novel, ''Imaginary Report from an American Pop Festival'' (''Képzelt riport egy amerikai popfesztiválról''), which dealt with the death of a Hungarian immigrant girl on a fictional rock festival in [[Montana]]. The novel was later adapted into a [[stage musical]] by [[Gábor Presser]] and [[Anna Adamis]] titled ''[[An Imaginary Report on an American Rock Festival]]''.

The concert is repeatedly mentioned in [[Norman Spinrad]]'s 1987 novel, ''Little Heroes'', as one of the major events in the main female protagonist's life.<ref name="spinrad">{{cite book |last=Spinrad |first=Norman |title= Little Heroes |publisher=Hunter Publishing Inc. |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-586-20362-0}}</ref>

===In music===

The Grateful Dead's "New Speedway Boogie" by Robert Hunter, was "[w]ritten as a reply to an indictment of the Altamont affair by pioneer rock critic Ralph J. Gleason."<ref>http://artsites.ucsc.edu/GDead/agdl/spee.html</ref>

[[Blue Öyster Cult]]'s "Transmaniacon MC," the leadoff song on their 1972 debut album, mentions Altamont by name twice and is sometimes seen as a metaphoric recollection of the ill-fated concert.

[[Pete Atkin]]'s song "An Array of Passionate Lovers", with lyrics by [[Clive James]], taken from the 1974 album ''[[The Road of Silk]]'' describes the end of the hippy dream with direct references to the death at Altamont during the performance by The Rolling Stones.

The [[Seth Putnam]]-led [[grindcore]] band Insult wrote a song titled "Altamont Was Cool", which was released on their split CD with Ruido in 1998.

The Australian band [[Black Cab (band)|Black Cab]] released an album in 2004 entitled ''Altamont Diary''. Loosely based on the Altamont Free Concert, it features a cover of the Grateful Dead song "New Speedway Boogie".

Altamont has often been suggested as a likely interpretation of the fifth verse of [[Don McLean]]'s classic rock song "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]", with lines alluding to "Jumping Jack Flash", an enraged spectator, Hells Angels, and "Sympathy for the Devil," coupled with an earlier reference in the song that ties the Rolling Stones to an event ten years after the song's beginning (McLean, although he has purposely never confirmed or denied this interpretation, acknowledges that the song begins with an event that happened in 1959, thus putting Altamont in the right time frame).

The rock band [[Altamont (band)|Altamont]], a side project by [[Dale Crover]] of the [[Melvins]], is named after the concert.

===In sculpture===
American artist [[Sam Durant]] referenced the Altamont Free Concert in his 1998 sculptural installation "Partially Buried 1960s/70s Dystopia Revealed (Mick Jagger at Altamont) & Utopia Reflected (Wavy Gravy at Woodstock)."<ref>Meyer, James. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_8_38/ai_61907732/ "Impure Thoughts: The Art of Sam Durant."] Artforum 38, no. 8 (April 2000): 112-17.</ref>

===In television===
The Fox television show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' has referenced this event twice. In season one, [[Characters of Glee#Rod Remington|Rod Remington]] remarks having "seen that guy get shot." In the episode "[[Prom Queen (Glee)|Prom Queen]]" of season 2, [[Santana Lopez]] states that the Bully Whips will be "like the Hells Angels to The Rolling Stones at Altamont", with the joke being her lack of awareness at the disaster that occurred.

In episode 1.12, "Road Worrier", of the MTV original series ''Daria'', Jake Morgendorffer says that he attended Altamont. He does mention the tragedy and demanded his money back, which leads to the exchange:
Daria - Wasn't Altamont free?
Jake - (laughs) That's the same line they tried to use on me.

In the movie [[The Cable Guy]], Chip ([[Jim Carrey]]) sings "Somebody To Love" by Jefferson Airplane, on the karaoke machine during a party at Steven's ([[Matthew Broderick]]) house. In his introduction, he mentions the event: "You might recognize this song as performed by Jefferson Airplane, in a little rockumentary called "Gimme Shelter," about the Rolling Stones and their nightmare at Altamont. That night the Oakland chapter of the Hell's Angels had their way. Tonight, it's my turn."

[[File:Memorial for Peter Bergman 03.jpg|thumb|The surviving members of the Firesign Theatre paying tribute to the late Peter Bergman on April 21, 2012. Left to right: Philip Austin, David Ossman, Philip Proctor.]]
[[File:Proctor and Bergman 1976.JPG|thumb|Philip Proctor (left) and Peter Bergman (right), 1976.]]
'''The Firesign Theatre''' is an American [[comedy]] troupe consisting of [[Phil Austin]], [[Peter Bergman (comedian)|Peter Bergman]], [[David Ossman]] and [[Philip Proctor]]. Their brand of [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] humor is best known through their [[Album|record albums]], which acquired an enthusiastic following in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The troupe began as live [[radio]] performers in Los Angeles on radio stations [[KPPC (defunct)|KPPC-FM]] and [[KPFK]] during the mid-1960s.

The group's name stems in part from [[astrology]], because the membership encompasses all three "[[Astrology and the classical elements|fire signs]]": [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] (Austin), [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] (Proctor), and [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] (Bergman and Ossman).

==Style==
The Firesign Theatre employs a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] style that includes direct references to movies, radio, TV, political figures, and other cultural sources, intermingled with sound effects and bits of music. The resulting stories — including the theft of a high school, a fair of clowns and [[hologram]]s and aliens who use [[hemp]] smoking to turn people into crows — border on [[Psychedelic|psychedelia]], an effect intensified by the frequent appearance of mock "[[Advertising|advertisements]]" satirizing real products.

The Firesign approach to comedy was strongly influenced by ''[[The Goon Show]]''. All four Firesign members have spoken of their admiration for this show. Said Ossman:

{{cquote|We all listened to ''The Goon Show'', [[Peter Sellers]], [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Harry Secombe]], at various times in our lives. We heard a lot of those shows. They impressed us when we started doing radio ourselves, because they sustained characters in a really [[surreal humour|surreal]] and weird kind of situation for a long period of time. They were doing that show for 10 years, all the way through the 1950s. So we were just listening to them at the end. It was that madness and the ability to go anywhere and do anything and yet sustain those funny characters. So when we first did written radio, where we would sit down and write half hour skits and do them once a week, which we did in the fall of 1967, we did things that were imitative of ''The Goon Show'' and learned a lot of voices from them and such.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firezine.net/issue4/fz4_13.htm |title=FIREZINE #4: Under the Influence of the Goons |publisher=Firezine.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref><ref name="MilliganHisPartInOurLives">{{cite book | last = Ventham | first = Maxine | title = Spike Milligan: His Part In Our Lives. | year = 2002 | publisher = Robson | location = London | isbn = 1-86105-530-7 }}</ref>}}

While their stream of consciousness style has the feel of [[improvisational comedy]], most of the material is tightly scripted and memorized. The group's writing method demands the consent of all four members before a line can be included.<ref>[http://www.tickets--tickets.com/event/5863/Firesign-Theatre-Schedule.html]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> Much of their work (including all of their Columbia LPs, now on CD) has been copyrighted under the name "4 or 5 Krazy Guys."

==Other projects==
In September 1967, The Firesign Theatre performed an adaptation of [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' short story "La Muerte y La Brujula" ("[[Death and the Compass]]") on Radio Free Oz.

In 1969, they created a number of improvised television commercials for Jack Poet Volkswagen in Highland Park, California, with the characters of Christian Cyborg (Peter Bergman), Coco Lewis (Philip Proctor), Bob Chicken (Phil Austin), and Tony Gomez (David Ossman).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/Firesign_Theatre_Podcasting_003 |title=Jack Poet Volkswagen commercials : Firesign Theatre : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref>

Between September 9, 1970 and February 17, 1971, they performed a one-hour live series, produced by Bill McIntyre, on radio station [[KPFK]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] titled ''[[Dear Friends Radio Program (Firesign Theatre)|Dear Friends]]''. These live programs were recorded and then edited into slightly shorter shows which were syndicated to radio stations across the country on 12-inch [[LP album|LP]]s. The group later collected the best segments from the series for their fifth record, ''Dear Friends''.

In 1972 and 1974, [[Straight Arrow Press]], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s book publishing arm, published two books authored by the Firesign Theatre. These books, ''[[The Firesign Theatre's Big Book Of Plays]]'' and ''[[The Firesign Theatre's Big Mystery Joke Book]]'', feature background information, satirical introductions and [[parody|parodic]] histories, as well as transcripts from their first seven albums. ''Apocalypse Papers'', also authored by the group and published by a small press, was limited to an edition of only 500 copies.

In 1983 Mattel released two Intellivision video games with Intellivoice: Bomb Squad, with Phil Proctor as the voice of Frank and Peter Bergman as the voice of Boris; and B-17 Bomber, with  Phil Proctor as the voice of the Pilot and Phil Austin as the Bombardier.   <ref>http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/games/credits/voice.html#b17</ref>

In 1996, Peter Bergman began placing radio-show-like comedy sound bites on his own [[Internet]]-based comedy radio station, www.rfo.net. "The show will be the Internet's funny bone," Bergman said.<ref>[http://www.filmkauai.com/cafe/PeterBergman/ ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>

In 1996, a computer game written by Peter Bergman, ''[[Pyst]]'', a parody of the game ''[[Myst]]'', was released by [[Parroty Interactive]].

In 2008, the Firesign Theatre released a four-CD boxed set based on their most famous character, Nick Danger "Third Eye." It was compiled from various radio shows, albums and fan recordings that were sent in via their website.

The group plans to reissue all of their past Firesign albums with new bonus material. The members are asking fans to submit any high-quality audio and video clips to their website.

==Films==
The group co-wrote the screenplay to the comedy [[Western (genre)|western]], ''[[Zachariah (1971 film)|Zachariah]]'', released in 1971. The film was inspired by the novel ''[[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddhartha]]'' by [[Hermann Hesse]].

The movie "J-men Forever" was made by Phil Proctor and Peter Bergman in 1979. The film is a compilation of Republic Science Fiction serial clips with new dialogue voiced over.

The movie ''[[Americathon]]'' (1979) was based on a sketch created by Phil Proctor and Peter Bergman.

==Later work==
During the mid-1970s, members of the group mostly went in separate directions. Firesign productions continued sporadically, but [[Proctor and Bergman]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://concerts.wolfgangsvault.com/dt/proctor-and-bergman-concert/20052618-19151.html |title=Proctor and Bergman &#124; Bottom Line &#124; New York, NY &#124; Jun 8, 1978 &#124; Late Show - wolfgangsvault.com |publisher=Concerts.wolfgangsvault.com |date=1978-06-08 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref> also performed as a duo, and Austin and Ossman worked individually and together in a few stage shows and most notably in the writing and production of ''In the Next World, You're on Your Own.'' In the mid-1980s, Ossman temporarily left the group to produce shows for [[National Public Radio]].

Their recordings through 1975 were originally released by [[Columbia Records]].

The Firesign Theatre's most recent performances were a series of live performances in December 2011.<ref>{{Official website|http://firesigntheatre.com/pressrel/20110830.html }} announcement, retrieved August 30, 2011</ref>  They claimed to be the longest surviving group from the "[[Classic rock]]" era to still be intact with the original members (at the time of the claim in 2011, 45 years).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://davidgordonschmidt.wordpress.com/2011/11/25/firesign-theatre-still-an-original-after-45-years/ |title=Firesign Theatre Still an Original After 45 Years « Audio Eclecticism in the 60s |publisher=Davidgordonschmidt.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref>

{{nihongo|'''Enoshima'''|???}} is a small offshore [[island]], about 4&nbsp;km in circumference, at the mouth of the [[Katase River]], which flows into the [[Sagami Bay]] of [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. Administratively, Enoshima is part of the mainland city of [[Fujisawa, Kanagawa|Fujisawa]], and is linked to the eponymous Katase section of that city by a 600 meter-long bridge. Home to some of the closest sandy beaches to [[Tokyo]] and [[Yokohama]], the island and adjacent coastline are the hub of a local [[resort area]].

==History==
[[Benzaiten]], the goddess of music and entertainment, is enshrined on the island. The island in its entirety is dedicated to the goddess, who is said to have caused it to rise from the bottom of the sea in sixth century.<ref>Papinot (1972:82)</ref> The island is the scene of the ''[[Enoshima Engi]]'', a history of the shrines on Enoshima written by the [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhist]] [[Bhikkhu|monk]] [[K?kei (monk)|K?kei]] in 1047 AD.

In 1880, after the [[Shinbutsu bunri|Shinto and Buddhism separation order]] of the new [[Government of Meiji Japan|Meiji government]] had made the land available, much of the uplands was purchased by [[Samuel Cocking]], a British merchant, in his Japanese wife's name. He developed a power plant and extensive botanical gardens including a very large greenhouse. Although the original greenhouse was destroyed in the [[1923 Great Kanto earthquake]], the botanical garden (now the [[Samuel Cocking Garden]]) remains an attraction with over half a million visitors a year.

Enoshima was the [[Sailing at the 1964 Summer Olympics|Olympic harbor]] for the [[1964 Summer Olympics]].<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1964/or1964v1pt1.pdf 1964 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 1. Part 1. p. 115.</ref>

Enoshima is now the center of [[Sh?nan]], a resort area along the coast of Sagami Bay.

==Transportation==
Enoshima is served by three railway stations: [[Katase-Enoshima Station|Katase-Enoshima Terminus]] on the [[Odaky? Enoshima Line]], [[Enoshima Station]] on the [[Enoshima Electric Railway]] ('Enoden'), and [[Shonan-Enoshima Station]] on the [[Shonan Monorail]].

'''Queens College''', located in [[Flushing, Queens|Kew Gardens Hills]] in the borough of [[Queens]] in [[New York City]], is one of the senior [[college]]s of the [[City University of New York]]. It is also the fifth-oldest of the City University's twenty-three institutions of higher learning. The college's 77-acre campus is located along Kissena Boulevard. Queens College opened in 1937 and is one of CUNY's largest senior colleges.

==History==
[[File:Walt Whitman Stone.jpg|thumb|left|300px|upright|This marker, just outside the [[Student Union]] building, marks the original location of the one-room schoolhouse]]
Before Queens College was established in 1937, the site of the campus was home to the Jamaica Academy, a one-room schoolhouse built in the early 19th century, where [[Walt Whitman]] once worked as teacher.<ref>http://www.qc.cuny.edu/communications/newsletter/Documents/fyi_Mar07.pdf</ref> The building was located on Flushing-Jamaica Road (later renamed Kissena Boulevard). Jamaica Academy became public in 1844.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walsh|first1=Kevin|title=POMONOK, Queens|url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2006/01/pomonok-queens/|website=Forgotten NY|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref> In 1909, the New York Parental School, a home for troubled boys, opened on the land surrounding the future site of Queens College and incorporated Jamaica Academy on its campus. Buildings such as Jefferson Hall (named after [[Thomas Jefferson]]) were used as both dormitories and classrooms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Queens College: 10 Year Sustainability Plan|url=http://www.qc.cuny.edu/about/sustainability/Documents/10%20Year%20Sustainability%20Plan.pdf|publisher=Queens College|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref>

In 1934, the New York Parental School was investigated amid rumors of abuse.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tompkins|first1=New York Times|title=PARENTAL HOME ENTERS NEW ERA: Sympathetic Treatment to Be Basic Policy in Handling Wayward Boys|accessdate=2 July 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=Feb 24, 1935}}</ref> The school was shut down and students were transferred to local public schools. A few months later, the grounds were turned over to the city. The city planned to house 500 mental patients from [[Randall's Island]] Hospital, who were temporarily displaced by the construction of the [[Triborough Bridge]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CITY TO HOUSE WARDS IN PARENTAL SCHOOL: Education Board Lends Flushing Institution as Hospital for Mental Defectives.|accessdate=2 July 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=Jun 15, 1935|page=15}}</ref>

Meanwhile, County Judge Charles S. Colden appointed and chaired a committee to assess the feasibility of opening a free college in Queens. In September 1935, the committee recommended the establishment of such a college.<ref>{{cite news|title=QUEENS COLLEGE BACKED.: Colden Committee Holds Proposal for New Institution Feasible.|accessdate=2 July 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=Sep 13, 1935|page=15}}</ref> Mayor La Guardia backed the recommendation and pushed for the free college's creation. In March 1937, the Board of Education designated the site of the former Parental School to be the future location of Queens College.<ref>{{cite news|title=COLLEGE SITE GIVEN TO CITY IN QUEENS: Education Board Cedes 48 Acres and Buildings of Flushing Parental School|accessdate=2 July 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=Apr 1, 1937|page=25}}</ref> Paul Klapper, former dean of the School of Education at [[City College of New York]], was appointed the new college's president.<ref>{{cite news|title=DR.

The college campus grew as buildings were constructed and enrollment increased. In 1958, 10,754 students were enrolled, more than ever before.<ref>{{cite news|title=QUEENS COLLEGE GAINS: Enrollment of 10,754 for Semester Sets Record|accessdate=2 July 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=Oct 10, 1958|page=24}}</ref> By 1976, enrollment was at 20,243.<ref name=nyt1976>{{cite news|last1=Ferretti|first1=Fred|title=City U.and City Hall Are Steering Collision Course on Further Cuts: City U. and City Hall on Collission Course|accessdate=2 July 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=Dec 9, 1976|page=97}}</ref> But changes beyond growth were in store for Queens College: in 1970, CUNY adopted the controversial policy of Open Admissions, which guaranteed a place at CUNY for any high school graduate in New York, regardless of traditional criteria like grades or test scores. The program was intended to offer college education to more New York City residents, in particular those of color. But Open Admissions did not seem to affect Queens College as much as it did other schools — a year after its implementation, only 10% of its student body was black or Puerto Rican, according to the newly appointed college president, Dr. Joseph S. Murphy.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Queens College President Strives to Meet Most Demands by Students|accessdate=2 July 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=Apr 4, 1971|page=BQ84}}</ref> By 1976, other concerns overtook the college as New York City faced a crippling financial crisis. CUNY's policy of free tuition was revoked; the overall CUNY budget was cut by $135 million; and CUNY Chancellor Robert Kibbee of CUNY demanded that Queens College slash its budget by 15%.<ref>{{cite web|title=WHEN TUITION AT CUNY WAS FREE, SORT OF|url=http://www1.cuny.edu/mu/forum/2011/10/12/when-tuition-at-cuny-was-free-sort-of/|website=CUNY Matters|accessdate=2 July 2014|date=October 12, 2011}}</ref> Some faculty members resigned in protest.<ref>{{cite news|title=Six at Queens College Quit Over Budget Cuts|accessdate=2 July 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=Jul 3, 1976|page=20}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' reported in December 1976 that "Queens College, considered the jewel in the university's crown, has been particularly hard hit by the cuts, which have gone to the heart of the faculty."<ref name=nyt1976 /> All hiring and building on campus was halted.

By 1984, the student enrollment had declined to 15,000. But with a $175 million building program in place by 1986 for the college's 50th anniversary, enrollments were expected to rise and the college was beginning to recover from the financial crisis of the 1970s. In addition, the student body, in accordance with the mission of the short-lived Open Admissions program, had grown much more diverse, and college faculty were trained to understand Latin American culture and how to teach American literature to non-American students.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Carmody|first1=Deirdre|title=Queens College, 50 Years Old, Seeks to Rebound|accessdate=2 July 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=Oct 11, 1987|page=80}}</ref> By that time, former Queens College president Dr. Joseph S. Murphy was now the CUNY Chancellor. In the 1990s, the college attracted high-profile researchers to its faculty, including the virologist [[Luc Montagnier]], and established a law program.<ref>{{cite news|title=Queens College Law School Is Granted Full Accreditation|accessdate=2 July 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=Aug 14, 1992|page=B8}}</ref> Under President Allen Sessoms, the college underwent such growth but also some missteps, including the highly publicized inability to fund the planned AIDS research center that Dr. Montagnier was hired to lead.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Arenson|first1=Karen|title=College Returns $3 Million Gift For AIDS Lab: Queens College Returns $3 Million Donation for AIDS Center|accessdate=2 July 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=Mar 17, 2001|page=B1}}</ref>

The college campus continued improving its facilities. Under a $1 billion CUNY-wide improvement program, Queens College's Powdermaker Hall was given a $57 million renovation, begun in 2000.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brozan|first1=Nadeen|title=On CUNY's Campuses, The Subject Is Change|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/17/realestate/on-cuny-s-campuses-the-subject-is-change.html|accessdate=2 July 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=September 17, 2000}}</ref> By 2014, student enrollment had neared its former height of 20,000 students, half of which come from minority backgrounds.<ref>{{cite web|title=QC at a Glance|url=http://www.qc.cuny.edu/about/Glance/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Queens College|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CUNY--Queens College|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/cuny-queens-college-2690|website=U.S. News & World Report|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref> Dr. Felix V.

===Involvement in Civil Rights===
[[File:Queens College CORE.png|right|thumb|300px|The Queens College chapter of CORE ([[Congress of Racial Equality]]) at the [[March on Washington]], 1963.]]
Queens College students were active participants in the Civil Rights movements of the 1960s, including the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] in 1963. The most well-known student activist was [[Andrew Goodman]], who was slain in Mississippi in 1964 with two other young men, [[James Earl Chaney]], and [[Michael H. Schwerner]]; all three were trying to register African-Americans to vote in the South. Schwerner and Chaney were on the organizing staff of CORE; Goodman was a "Freedom Summer" volunteer. The three activists were stopped and arrested for allegedly driving over the speed limit on a Mississippi road in 1964. Upon being brought into the sheriff's department and later released, the three young men were stopped by two car loads of [[KKK]] members on a remote rural road. The men approached their car, then shot and killed all three young men. The murders received national attention, and six conspirators were brought to trial and convicted by federal prosecutors for civil rights violations. The Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner Clock Tower of Rosenthal Library, a highly visible borough landmark, is named in their honor.<ref>{{cite web|title=CUNY Trustees Approve New Queens Home for CUNY Law School|url=http://www1.cuny.edu/mu/law/2009/09/29/cuny-trustees-approve-new-queens-home-for-cuny-law-school-2/}}</ref>

In February 2011, Queens College inherited the personal collection of the late [[James Foreman]]. The collection, along with other civil rights leaders' collections, is available for research at the [http://archives.qc.cuny.edu/civilrights Queens College Civil Rights Archive]. A special program on February 17, 2011 included a presentation by the Honorable [[Julian Bond]] for [[Black History Month]], as well as a formal announcement of the acquisition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ablamsky|first=Jessica|title=Civil Rights Titan Bond Looks Back|url=http://www.queenstribune.com/news/News_030311_Bond.html|work=Queens Tribune|accessdate=26 August 2011}}</ref>

==Degrees==
Queens College is a [[liberal arts college]] that offers undergraduate degrees in 78 majors, [[Master's degree|master's]] degrees in 24 departments, 20 doctoral degrees through the [[CUNY Graduate Center]], and a number of advanced certificate programs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Admissions|url=http://www.qc.cuny.edu/admissions/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Queens College|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref> It is also one of seven participating schools in the [[CUNY Honors College]]. The department for [[Continuing Education]] offers non-credit courses.

Six of the original Spanish-style buildings dating back to the early 20th century still stand, such as Jefferson Hall, which was built in 1900{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}.  The college has since expanded to include over 40 buildings including the main classroom building, Powdermaker Hall, rebuilt in 2003 and named after the college's distinguished [[anthropologist]] [[Hortense Powdermaker]]. The college is embarking on a variety of campus-beautification projects.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Queens College is the only CUNY college that participates in Division II sports{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}. A Child Development Center, staffed by professionals, offers inexpensive child care services to students with children. The college is also home to the Godwin-Ternbach Museum, which houses more than 3,500 works of art.

The college holds courses at several off-campus locations, including the 43rd Street Extension Center in Manhattan and the CUNY Center for Higher Education in downtown [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], which opened in late 2003.

The college has a low-rise 506-bed dormitory on campus called [http://www.thesummitatqc.com "The Summit at Queens College"], which opened for the fall semester of 2009. Queens College is one of only three CUNY campuses with dorm facilities (the other two being [[Hunter College]] and [[City College of New York|City College]]).

The campus maintains the [[Benjamin Rosenthal]] Library. The library's Chaney-Schwerner-Goodman Clocktower was named after the three civil rights workers who were murdered in 1964, including [[Andrew Goodman]], a Queens College student. Built in 1988, the library contains 752,900 books, 32,600 print and electronic materials, the [http://www.qc.cuny.edu/Academics/Degrees/DAH/library/SpecialCollections/Pages/default.aspx college archives], a collection of multimedia materials in its Media Center and an art center. The library is also home to the papers of [[Robert Morris (merchant)|Robert Morris]] and the [[Louis Armstrong]] archives.

The college is home to the [[Aaron Copland]] School of Music located in the music building, constructed in 1991. The building houses the music library and the 490-seat Lefrak Concert Hall.

[[CUNY Law School]] was previously located to the west of the campus of Queens College; while it was always a separate administrative unit of CUNY, the building itself read "CUNY School of Law at Queens College," and was once a building for the Department of Education.  The CUNY Board of Trustees approved plans for the Law School to be relocated to 2 Court Square in Long Island City, with the first semester of classes held in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.cuny.edu/mu/law/2009/09/29/cuny-trustees-approve-new-queens-home-for-cuny-law-school-2/|title=CUNY Trustees Approve New Queens Home for CUNY Law School}}</ref> Queens College has since taken over the former CUNY Law building for future use.

[[Townsend Harris High School]] is located at the edge of the Queens College campus.

===Godwin-Ternbach Museum===
Since 1957 Queens College has been collecting works of art, these collections were initially used for teaching purposes and were meant to serve the college community. The collections were eventually brought together with the establishment of the Godwin-Ternbach Museum in 1980. The Museum is now a part of the Kupferberg Center for the Arts which has joined together all the works of art on campus in collaborations of visual, performance, dance, and theater arts.<ref>[http://www.nyc-arts.org/organizations/325/godwin-ternbach-museum-at-queens-college NYC ARTS > Museums > Godwin-Ternbach Museum at Queens College]</ref> In the early 1990s, the museum was downsized due to budget cuts. Over the next few years, the college kept it open but on a reduced budget and staff. In 2001 however the college hired Amy Winters as director of the museum. To address the concerns of the museum Winters turned to MAP (The Museum Assessment Program); as a result not only did the museum improve their facilities but they increased their collections-related staff as well.<ref>[http://americanmuseums.wordpress.com/2011/01/07/thirty-years-of-excellence-through-the-museum-assessment-program/ 30 Years of Excellence Through MAP &#124; AAMblog]</ref> Today the museum is an integral part of the Queens College community, and it continues to serve not only the faculty and staff but the community at large.

The  Museum is located in Klapper Hall and maintains a fine collection of 3,500 pieces of art, as well as artifacts from all cultures dating from ancient times to the modern day. These include works by [[Rembrandt|Rembrandt Van Rijn]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Georges Braque]]. The museum also hosts a series of exhibitions each year. These exhibitions and events are open to Queens College students, faculty, staff and the public.

===Residence===
[[File:The summit.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Category:Buildings|The Summit at QC|The Summit is Queens College's first [[residence hall]], it opened in the fall of 2009.]]
In 2009, Queens College was the third school in the CUNY system to open a residence hall. The Summit, a low-rise 506-bed dormitory, is located in the middle of the campus.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Summit at Queens College|url=http://www.thesummitatqc.com|publisher=Queens College|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref> Queens College is still primarily a commuter school, having only 500 of its over 18,000 students living on campus. The Summit hall has earned a silver certificate from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), an organization that certifies buildings to have met environmentally sustainable construction standards.<ref>[http://www.qgazette.com/news/2009-10-07/front_page/001.html Queens College Opens First Dorm &#124; www.qgazette.com &#124; Queens Gazette]</ref> Queens College's residence hall offers study lounges on each floor, wireless internet, laundry services, and a state of the art fitness center. Apartments also include kitchens with full size appliances, as well as dining areas, microwaves, couches, entertainment stands, and music practice rooms.<ref>[http://www.qc.cuny.edu/StudentLife/TheSummit/Pages/default.aspx QC Queens College]</ref>

The Summit has attracted students from around the country and the world to Queens College, especially aspiring artists looking to attend the internationally renowned [[Aaron Copland]] School of Music. Although it remains a commuter school, the college has become more dynamic as a result of the construction of the Summit; offering students a traditional college experience at an affordable public university.

==Athletics==

[[File:KNIGHTS BBALL HUDDLE.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Queens College Men's [[Basketball]] team (above). QC is the only [[CUNY]] school to participate in [[NCAA Division II]] sports.]]

The Athletic Department at Queens College sponsors fifteen separate men’s and women’s championship eligible varsity teams in eight different sports. The longest running among these fifteen programs are the men’s [[basketball]] and [[baseball]] teams.  The men's basketball team has put a team on the court in every season since its inception in 1938. On February 14, 2004 the team played its 1500th game and, in those 1500 games, has produced twenty 1,000-point scorers. Of these twenty players, twelve have achieved this after the [[college]] began play in [[Division II (NCAA)]] in 1983 and four ([[Alan Hevesi]] (#5), [[Norman Roberts]] (#15), Jeff Maloney (#22) and Norman Roberts (#15)) have had their numbers retired. Although the program has a long-running record of achievement, its biggest successes have come in the 21st century. In 2001, the Knights earned their first [[NCAA Division II]] Northeast Regional bid. 2002 saw the team earn their second consecutive bid along with the program’s first NYCAC championship and, in 2005, the team once again was crowned NYCAC Champions and received an automatic bid to the NCAA's.<ref name="qcpages1">[http://qcpages.qc.edu/qcsports/accomplishments.html Queens College Athletics]</ref>

With the exception of three years during [[World War II]], the baseball program, like men's basketball, has fielded a team since 1938. In both 1967 and 1976 the team captured the Knickerbocker Conference championship and in 1981 it won the [[CUNY]] championship. Their championships in 1976 and 1981 also earned them [[NCAA Division III]] tournament bids. More recently, the squad captured the NYCAC regular season championships in 1997 and 1998, the NYCAC tournament championship in 1998 and a bid to the NCAA Division II Northeast Regional. Individually, seven players have been drafted and nine players have gone on to play professionally with organizations including the [[New York Yankees]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Kansas City Royals]]. The latest of these draftees is 1998 All-American Justin Davies who, after playing in the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] organization for two seasons, has spent the four years (2000-2004) as on outfielder for the [[Long Island Ducks]] of the Independent League.<ref name="qcpages1"/>

The women's basketball team has also experienced success. On March 24, 1973, the Knights, who were ranked #2 in the country, took the Fitzgerald Gymnasium court with the AIAW (Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women) National Championship at stake. On February 22, 1975 they played in the first women’s basketball game ever played in [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref name="MSG and crowd"/><ref name="Jenkins History"/> Three players from this era (Debbie Mason (#15), [[Gail Marquis]] (#25) and Althea Gwyn (#31)) have had their numbers retired. On January 4, 2015, the two teams will play in the [[Maggie Dixon Classic]] as a commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the original event.<ref name="40th anniversary"/> In the 2000s, the team has rebounded from a short down period to make a return to the NYCAC playoffs while producing several top-flight players, including Honorable Mention All-American in Carolyn Burke.

In the period from 1997 until 2003, the softball team posted a .640 winning percentage and won 30 or more games in a season three times. One of those 30 win seasons came in 1999 when the team won their first NYCAC tournament championship and earned their first [[NCAA]] bid. Two season later, third team All-American Cheryl Cosenzo helped lead the Lady Knights to their second NYCAC championship as well as an NCAA bid and in 2002 the team earned their third Northeast Regional bid in five years.

The women's tennis team has experienced nineteen consecutive winning seasons. The team has won four conference championships, while its players have won a number of individual and doubles titles. In 2004, Dominika Bajuk was selected as NYCAC Player of the Year. The Lady Knights have also earned NCAA Division II post-season championship bids in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005; as well as in 1995 when, as hosts, they won their region.<ref name="qcpages1"/>

The men's track and field team hosted and won the East Coast Conference Championships in 2013.

'''''Song and Dance''''' is a [[Musical theater|musical]] comprising two acts, one told entirely in "Song" and one entirely in "Dance", tied together by a love story.

The first part is ''[[Tell Me on a Sunday]]'', with lyrics by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] and music by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], about a young [[United Kingdom|British]] woman's romantic misadventures in [[New York City]] and [[Hollywood]]. The second part is a [[ballet]] [[choreographed]] to ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]'', composed by Lloyd Webber for his [[cellist]] brother [[Julian Lloyd Webber|Julian]], which is based on the A Minor Caprice No. 24 by [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]].

==Development==
The ''Song'' portion was written specifically for [[Marti Webb]], and presented at the [[Sydmonton Festival]] in the summer of 1979. It was subsequently recorded and aired as a one-hour television special by the [[BBC]] the following January. The ''Dance'' portion was recorded in 1978, and nearly became incorporated into ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]''. The opening sequence was utilized as the theme music for London Weekend Television's ''[[South Bank Show]]''.

Producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] proposed that the two pieces be combined under the umbrella title ''Song and Dance'' to acknowledge the primary aspect of each act, billing the piece as "a concert for the theatre".

Black altered some of the songs from the original album and worked with Lloyd Webber on new material: "The Last Man in My Life", "I Love New York" and "Married Man", the latter set to the same tune as "Sheldon Bloom". A new orchestration of the ''Variations'' for a sixteen-piece theatre orchestra was produced from the original symphonic version played by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] but [[Harry Rabinowitz]] retained the baton for the stage production. "When You Want to Fall in Love", with a tune previously released by Marti Webb and [[Justin Hayward]] as "Unexpected Song" which itself was later added to the score, was used at the climax of the dance section to meld the two halves.

==Productions==

===1982 London===
The musical had its world premiere on March 26, 1982 in the [[West End theatre|West End]] at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]], where it ran for 781 performances. [[Marti Webb]] performed the ''Song'' half; she subsequently was succeeded by [[Gemma Craven]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], and [[Liz Robertson]]. Carol Nielsson, Webb's original understudy took over the role at short notice when Lulu damaged her voice after a foldback monitor failed during a performance. Verity Ann Meldrum, who had been shortlisted for the leading role in the original production of ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' was the understudy to Liz Robertson. A video of the production was recorded with [[Sarah Brightman]] in the lead role soon after the show closed on March 31, 1984. It was directed by [[Tom Gutteridge]]. The ''Dance'' portion was choreographed by [[Anthony van Laast]] and featured [[Wayne Sleep]] and [[Jane Darling (dancer)|Jane Darling]].

The original recording of the London production was made live at the opening night using a recording studio then built into the Palace Theatre, later used to record Lloyd Webber's ''[[The Woman in White (musical)|The Woman in White]]'' in 2004. The album was produced by [[Martin Levan]], who designed the sound system for the show and who went to be one of the top sound designers in the West End.

===1985 Broadway===
Director/lyricist [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]] was approached to adapt the first act for an [[United States|American]] audience, adding more plot.  The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, choreographed by [[Peter Martins]], opened on September 18, 1985 at the [[Royale Theatre]], and closed on November 8, 1986, after 474 performances and seventeen previews. [[Bernadette Peters]] starred in ''Song'' for nearly thirteen months; she was succeeded by [[Betty Buckley]] for the final four weeks. ''Dance'' featured [[Christopher d'Amboise]] and [[Gregg Burge]].  

Singer-songwriter [[Melissa Manchester]] starred in a subsequent 6-month US national tour of the show in 1987, starting in [[Dallas]], Texas and ending in [[Tampa]], Florida.<ref>Harrison, Thomas B.  "Melissa Manchester: Pop music pro enters a new stage with 'Song and Dance'", ''St. Petersburg Times'' (Florida), December 8, 1987, p. 1D</ref><ref>[http://ezp.lndlibrary.org/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com.ezp.lndlibrary.org/pqdweb?did=115188353&sid=1&Fmt=10&clientId=5166&RQT=309&VName=HNP Listing, see Pittsburgh, Civic Light Opera Company]''The New York Times'', August 9, 1987, p. G16</ref> 

The Broadway production received eight [[Tony Award]] nominations, with Peters winning as Best Actress (Musical).

==Synopsis==

===London===
An English girl, newly arrived in New York, stumbles upon her boyfriend in her apartment. She confronts him and decides to break up. She writes to her mother in England about what happened, and that she has met a new man, Sheldon Bloom, with whom she travels to California.  Bloom is a Hollywood producer and lives in a mansion named ''La Bohème''. Days pass and the girl finds out how uneventful Hollywood is ("Capped Teeth and Caesar Salad").  She realizes that Sheldon has only been using her as a trophy, and she ends things once and for all. Los Angeles becomes a quick disappointment for her.

The girl meets yet another man, this time a younger one who she finds more fulfilling.  Soon, however, it is time for the younger man to go away to work. The girl can't bear to let him go.  Her friend later comes over to tell her about the man's infidelity, and she asks him for the truth.  The girl walks through the streets of New York, very depressed.  This time, she has met a married man.  She reflects that the affair is wrong.  The married man comes by to confess his love, and she realizes that she has been using him. In the end she decides that it wasn't the end of the world to have no one.

Act Two is the examination of one of the men (presumably the younger one), through the music of "Variations", in a series of dances. At the end, the man sees the girl, and they make up, joining both in Song and Dance.

===Broadway===
The revised Broadway musical follows the London version; the girl is named "Emma" and is an aspiring hat designer. Through each of the men Emma becomes involved with she undertakes an emotional journey and learns something about herself.  Although she has fallen in love with "Joe", he is unable to commit, and after he leaves her, she takes up with "Paul", the married man. Ultimately she realizes that she has started using men, as they had used her: "I'll be Emma again, If it means being hurt, I'll be hurt, But I'll like myself then..." ("What Have I Done").

Emma is alone on stage in Act 1, and the conversations she has with others and her out-loud musings take place with off-stage or imaginary characters.  Act 2 belongs to Joe and tell his story through the "Dance" portion; he and Emma finally unite at the end, as Joe matures and realizes that he is in love with Emma.

==Recording==
The Broadway original cast recording, titled ''Bernadette Peters in Andrew Lloyd Webber's Song and Dance'' was released in 1985 by RCA Victor.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=yQkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA50&dq=%22Andrew+Lloyd+Webber%22+%22Song+and+Dance%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22Andrew%20Lloyd%20Webber%22%20%22Song%20and%20Dance%22&f=false "The Musicals on Record, 'Song and Dance'"]''Billboard'' (books.google.com), October 19, 1996, p. 52</ref>

==Critical reception==
In [[Frank Rich]]'s ''New York Times'' review, he wrote: "Miss Peters is more than talented: As an actress, singer, comedienne and all-around warming presence, she has no peer in the musical theater right now. In her half of ''Song & Dance,'' she works so hard you'd think she were pleading for mercy before a firing squad. Yet for all the vocal virtuosity, tempestuous fits and husky-toned charm she brings to her one-woman musical marathon, we never care if her character lives or dies.."<ref>Rich, Frank.[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E7D91739F93AA2575AC0A963948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all "Stage: 'Song and Dance' With Bernadette Peters",]''The New York Times'', September 19, 1985</ref>

[[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]], in ''The New York Magazine'', noted that the unseen men seemed "nebulous and unreal, so too, does the seen woman", and in the ''Dance'' half, "things go from bad to worse."  However, he wrote that "Miss Peters is an unimpeachable peach of a performer who does so much for the top half of this double bill as to warrant its immediate rechristening 'Song of Bernadette'. She not only sings, acts, and (in the bottom half) dances to perfection, she also, superlatively, 'is' ".<ref>Simon, John Ivan.

'''''Tell Me on a Sunday''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with music by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and lyrics by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]]. A one-act [[song cycle]], it tells the story of an ordinary [[English people|English]] girl from [[Muswell Hill]], who journeys to the United States in search of love. Her romantic misadventures begin in [[New York City]], lead her to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], and eventually take her back to [[Manhattan]].

==Background==
The musical is based on an idea originally conceived by [[Tim Rice]], who intended to develop it as a cycle of television shows with songwriting partner Andrew Lloyd Webber. The two relished working on a small-scale project following ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]''. Shortly after they began working, however, Lloyd Webber realized Rice was writing specifically for [[Elaine Paige]], with whom the married father of two young children was having a blatant affair. Lloyd Webber felt that allowing Paige to appear in the series would suggest he approved of the relationship, so he decided to look for a new lyricist. He opted for [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] who, following a successful stint in Hollywood (including an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for [[Born Free (song)|"Born Free"]]), had begun writing for the theatre. Although it had proven to be unsuccessful, his ''[[Bar Mitzvah Boy (musical)|Bar Mitzvah Boy]]'' had impressed Lloyd Webber, who thought Black would be a good match.<ref>Citron, Stephen. ''Sondheim & Lloyd-Webber: The New Musical''. New York, New York: Oxford University Press 2001. ISBN 0-19-509601-0 pp. 262-63</ref>

Rice's original concept had kept 'the girl' in the UK. It was Black who suggested she emigrate to the States. He quickly began writing lyrics for several tunes Lloyd Webber already had composed. It was their intent to present as complete a work as possible at the [[Sydmonton Festival]] in September 1979. The two decided to cast [[Marti Webb]], who was portraying [[Eva Perón]] at the matinee performances of ''Evita'', as their heroine.<ref>Citron, p. 264</ref>

The show was positively received at Sydmonton Festival in 1979, which promoted the release of [[Tell Me on a Sunday (1980 album)|a recording]] later that year, and a special one-hour [[BBC]] television show recorded at the [[Royalty Theatre]] in London on 28 January 1980. The broadcast on 12 February was a critical success and garnered high ratings; thus repeated the following month.<ref>Citron, p. 266</ref> Following its transmission, the album reached #2 on the UK charts, and the single release "[[Take That Look Off Your Face]]" reached #3.

Lloyd Webber decided the piece would work well on the stage if paired appropriately with another one-act piece. He previously had considered writing a brief [[opera]]tic piece about the friendship between [[Giacomo Puccini]] and [[Ruggiero Leoncavallo]], going so far as to compose the melody that later would become [[Memory (Cats song)|"Memory"]] for it, but decided it would not fit well with 'the girl's' saga. He tried adapting the [[Charles Dickens]] work ''[[The Signal-Man]]'', but decided it was too gloomy and rejected it as well. Eventually he and Black set aside ''Tell Me on a Sunday'' and turned to other projects.<ref>Citron, p.266-67</ref>

==Productions==

===Combined into ''Song and Dance''===
In 1982, the creative team decided to combine ''Tell Me on a Sunday'' with a [[ballet]] choreographed to Lloyd Webber's ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]'', a classical piece based on the A Minor Caprice No. 24 by [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]] that had debuted at Sydmonton in 1977. ''Tell Me on a Sunday'' became Act I of ''[[Song and Dance]]'', which was staged in the [[West End theatre|West End]] with [[Marti Webb]] as 'the girl'. She later was succeeded by [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Gemma Craven]], [[Liz Robertson]], and [[Sarah Brightman]].

[[Image:Sunday2003.jpg|left|thumb|150px|2003 recording]]Three years later, lyricist [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]] was brought in to help create an [[United States|Americanised]] version of ''Tell Me on a Sunday'' for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], with [[Bernadette Peters]] as 'the girl', now renamed as Emma. It opened on 18 September 1985 to mixed reviews. Writing in the ''[[New York Post]]'', [[Clive Barnes (critic)|Clive Barnes]] thought it was "the best thing that Lloyd Webber has written for the theater," but [[Frank Rich]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' was not impressed, observing that "empty material remains empty, no matter how talented those who perform it. Emma is a completely synthetic, not to mention insulting, creation whom no performer could redeem."<ref>Citron, p. 309</ref> Peters went on to win the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]], but the show failed to win Best Musical or Best Original Score. Black, unimpressed that Peters had insisted on gathering background information about the character, later said he preferred the original London production and Webb's performance.<ref>Inverne, James, ''Wrestling With Elephants: The Authorised Biography of Don Black''. London: Sanctuary Publishing Ltd. 2003. ISBN 1-86074-468-0, p. 137</ref>

===Revision as a stand-alone piece===
Reverted to its one-act format, ''Tell Me on a Sunday'' was substantially updated and rewritten, with five new songs and additional material by [[Jackie Clune]], for a 2003 London production at the [[Gielgud Theatre]]. The BBC critic observed, "this may be the smallest show Lloyd Webber's ever written, but the score (to appropriately conversational lyrics by Don Black) contains several of his very best songs."<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/entertainment/theatre/tellme_160403.shtml BBC review]</ref> Directed by Christopher Luscombe and starring [[Denise Van Outen]], it ran for ten months. Marti Webb succeeded Van Outen and subsequently toured the UK with the show, alternating with former [[Steps (group)|Steps]] vocalist, [[Faye Tozer]], and actress [[Patsy Palmer]]. The show, with musical supervision by [[Simon Lee (conductor)|Simon Lee]], featured an all-electronic band, consisting of three keyboards, a [[bass guitar]], electric guitar, electro-acoustic guitar and a [[Roland V-Drums]] kit. 

In 2008, the Alloy Theater Company<ref>[http://www.alloytheater.org Alloy Theater website]</ref> staged the original one-act version with Irish actress, Maxine Linehan,<ref>[http://www.maxinelinehan.com MaxineLinehan.com]</ref> at the Laurie Beechman Theatre in New York City. That same year, Bailiwick Repertory produced the Chicago premiere starring [http://www.harmonyfrance.com Harmony France] to rave reviews and the Kookaburra Theatre presented the [[Australia]]n premiere starring [[Jolene Anderson]], with [[Noni Hazlehurst]] and [[John Waters (actor)|John Waters]] providing the voices of "Mum" and "Married Man" respectively. Despite mixed reviews, it had sellout performances in both [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]].<ref>[http://www.thewest.com.au/aapstory.aspx?StoryName=506666 TheWest.com.au]</ref>

''Tell Me on a Sunday'', in its one-act and "definitive" format,<ref>{{cite web|title=Official 2010 UK tour website|url=http://www.tellmeontour.com}}</ref> toured the United Kingdom, starring [[Claire Sweeney]] as 'the girl' with direction by Tamara Harvey. It began on 30 August 2010 at [[Northampton]]'s [[Royal Theatre (Northampton)|Royal Theatre]] and continued until autumn 2011. The [[Tell Me on a Sunday#2010 UK tour|song list and order]] sticks very closely to the 1982 Song and Dance version, with the addition of the finale song "Dreams Never Run On Time", itself a rewrite of the song from the 2003 version "Somewhere, Someplace, Sometime".  Minor script rewrites were made to update it for the 21st century and also reference the main character as originating from [[Liverpool]] - like Claire Sweeney herself.

===Revival of the Original===
In early 2014, Webb returned to the piece to perform essentially the original album material in London. Performing "Tell Me on a Sunday" and "Take That Look Off Your Face" at a tribute show to Don Black in late 2013, Webb met Lewis Carnie, the Head of Programmes for [[BBC Radio 2]], who asked if she would consider performing the entire piece for broadcast on the station. Producer Robert Mackintosh then suggested the show could be staged for a week at the [[St James Theatre, London]] in January, the popularity of which saw it being restaged for initially two and subsequently three weeks at the [[Duchess Theatre]] in February and early March.

The show had musical direction by [[Simon Lee (conductor)|Simon Lee]], lighting designed by Humphrey Mcdermott and sound designed by Matt McKenzie. The set was sparsely decorated; a large screen with projected images hung above the stage on which were the small band and a couple of different seating positions for Webb.

==Plot==
In the original production, 'the girl' arrives in New York City. She tells her pal she does not want to become a hard-bitten career woman or a user of men. Shortly after, she discovers her beau has been cheating on her with numerous other women and she walks out.

'The girl' meets Hollywood producer Sheldon Bloom, who takes her to Los Angeles. Sheldon's career ambitions preclude his spending much time on a personal relationship and, after realizing life in the film capital is uneventful and Sheldon has been using her as a [[Trophy wife|trophy girlfriend]], 'the girl' returns to Manhattan.

Back in [[Greenwich Village]], 'the girl' meets a salesman, and once again faces disappointment when she learns he frequently has been in town with other women when he supposedly was away on business. The two split up and she meets a married man. Intent on succeeding in her career and acquiring a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]], 'the girl' is content with the noon-to-two relationship she and the married man share, until he announces he has told his wife everything and wants to leave her and marry 'the girl'. She is horrified because not only does she not love him, but she realizes she's been using him, something she had vowed never to do. She sends the married man away and promises herself she will return to being the idealistic and ethical woman she was when she first arrived in the States.

'The girl' is the only person who appears on stage, despite having conversations with her friends and writing letters to her mum.

=='The girl's' name==
In the [[Marti Webb]] recording and subsequent London productions (of both ''Tell Me on a Sunday'' and ''Song and Dance''), the lead character is not named, nor are most of the men she has relationships with, except Sheldon Bloom/Tyler King (2003 version). When ''Tell Me'' was combined with "Variations" to form ''Song and Dance'', "the girl" was finally given a name - Emma, in the 1985 Broadway production, starring Bernadette Peters. This was the result of the rewrite of plot and lyrics, and "Americanization" by Don Black and Richard Maltby Jr.

WARN  - 2014-11-30 14:43:06.005; org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.SolrWriter; Error creating document : SolrInputDocument(fields: [contents=[[File:Elmer flying monk.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Stained glass window showing Eilmer, installed in Malmesbury Abbey in 1920]]

'''Eilmer of Malmesbury''' (also known as '''Oliver''' due to a scribe's miscopying, or '''Elmer''') was an [[Timeline of aviation - pre-18th century|11th-century]] English [[Benedictine monk]] best known for his early attempt at a gliding flight using wings.

== Life ==
Eilmer was a monk of [[Malmesbury Abbey]] and is known to have written on [[astrology]].<ref name="White 1961, 98">{{harvnb|White|1961|p=98}}</ref> All that is known of him is told in the ''Gesta regum Anglorum'' (Deeds of the English Kings), written by the eminent medieval historian [[William of Malmesbury]] in about 1125.<ref name="White 1961, 98"/><ref>{{harvnb|White|1961|p=102}}</ref> Being a fellow monk of the same abbey, William almost certainly obtained his account directly from people who knew Eilmer himself when he was an old man.<ref name="White 1961, 98"/>

Later scholars, such as the American historian of technology [[Lynn White]], have attempted to estimate Eilmer's date of birth based on a quotation in William's ''Deeds'' in regard to [[Halley's Comet]], which appeared in 1066. The difficulty lies in that William recorded what Eilmer said not to establish his age, but to show that his prophecy was fulfilled later that year when the [[Normans]] [[Norman Conquest of England|invaded England]].

{{quote|You've come, have you? &ndash; You've come, you source of tears to many mothers. It is long since I saw you; but as I see you now you are much more terrible, for I see you brandishing the downfall of my country.<ref name="William">William of Malmesbury, ''Gesta regum Anglorum / The history of the English kings'', ed. and trans. R. A. B. Mynors, R. M. Thomson, and M. Winterbottom, 2 vols., Oxford Medieval Texts (1998–9)</ref>}}

If Eilmer had seen Halley's comet seventy-six years earlier in 989, he could have been born about 984, making him about five or six years old when he first saw the comet, old enough to remember it. However the periodicity of comets was probably unknown in Eilmer's time, and so his remark "It is long since I saw you" could have referred to a different, later comet. Since it is known that Eilmer was an "old man" in 1066, and that he had made the flight attempt "in his youth", the event is placed some time during the early 11th century, perhaps in its first decade.<ref>{{harvnb|White|1961|p=99}}</ref>

== The flight ==
William records that, in Eilmer's youth, he had read and believed the [[Greek mythology|Greek fable]] of [[Daedalus]]. Thus, Eilmer fixed wings to his hands and feet and launched himself from the top of a tower at Malmesbury Abbey:

{{quote|He was a man learned for those times, of ripe old age, and in his early youth had hazarded a deed of remarkable boldness. He had by some means, I scarcely know what, fastened wings to his hands and feet so that, mistaking fable for truth, he might fly like Daedalus, and, collecting the breeze upon the summit of a tower, flew for more than a furlong [201&nbsp;metres]. But agitated by the violence of the wind and the swirling of air, as well as by the awareness of his rash attempt, he fell, broke both his legs and was lame ever after. He used to relate as the cause of his failure, his forgetting to provide himself a tail.<ref name="William" />}}

Given the geography of the abbey, his landing site, and the account of his flight, to travel for "more than a furlong" (220&nbsp;yards, 201&nbsp;metres) he would have had to have been airborne for about 15&nbsp;seconds. His exact flightpath is not known, nor how long he was in the air, because today’s abbey is not the abbey of the 11th century, when it was probably smaller, although the tower was probably close to the present height.<ref name=woosnam>Woosnam (1986)</ref> "Olivers Lane", off the present-day High Street and about {{convert|200|m}} from the abbey, is reputed locally to be the site where Eilmer landed.<ref name=woosnam/> That would have taken him over many buildings. Maxwell Woosnam's study concluded that he is more likely to have descended the steep hill off to the southwest of the abbey, rather than the town centre to the south.<ref name=woosnam/>

== Flight analysis ==
To perform the manoeuvre of gliding downward against the breeze, utilizing both gravity and the wind, Eilmer employed an apparatus somewhat resembling a gliding bird. However being unable to balance himself forward and backwards, as does a bird by slight movements of its wings, head and legs, he would have needed a large tail to maintain equilibrium. Eilmer could not have achieved true soaring flight in any event, but he might have glided down in safety if he had had a tail.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eilmer the Flying Monk, 981&ndash;1069AD |author=James of Wanborough |url=http://www.jane-williams.me.uk/so/cartnav/eilmer.htm |accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref> Afterwards, Eilmer remarked that the cause of his crash was that "he had forgotten to provide himself with a tail."<ref name=Hallion/>

== Historical traditions and influence ==
Other than William's account of the flight, nothing has survived of Eilmer's lifetime work as a monk, although his astrological treatises apparently still circulated as late as the 16th century.<ref name="White 1961, 98"/>

Based on William's account, the story of Eilmer's flight has been retold many times through the centuries by scholars, encyclopaedists, and proponents of man-powered flight, keeping the idea of human flight alive. These include over the years: [[Helinand of Froidmont]] (before 1229), [[Alberic of Trois-Fontaines]] (before 1241), [[Vincent of Beauvais]] (1250s), [[Roger Bacon]] (ca. 1260), [[Ranulf Higden]] (before 1352, and the first to misname him "Oliver") and the English translators of his work, [[Henry Knighton]] (before 1367), [[John Nauclerus of Tübingen]] (c.&nbsp;1500), [[John Wilkins]] (1648), [[John Milton]] (1670), and [[John Wise (balloonist)|John Wise]] (1850).<ref>{{harvnb|White|1961|p=102f.}}</ref>

More recently, Maxwell Woosnam in 1986 examined in more detail the technical aspects such as materials, glider angles, and wind effects.<ref name=woosnam/>

Eilmer typified the inquisitive spirit of medieval enthusiasts who developed small drawstring toy helicopters, windmills, and sophisticated sails for boats. In addition, church artists increasingly showed angels with ever more accurate depictions of bird-like wings, detailing the wing's camber (curvature) that would prove beneficial to generating the lifting forces enabling a bird &ndash; or an aeroplane &ndash; to fly. This climate of thought led to a general acceptance that air was something that could be "worked." Flying was thus not magical, but could be attained by physical effort and human reasoning.<ref name=Hallion>{{cite web |title=Pioneers of Flight: Eilmer of Malmesbury |first=Richard |last=Hallion |url=http://www.af.mil/history/essay2.asp  |year=2004 |publisher=[[USAF]] Centennial of Flight office |accessdate=2008-05-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041020011322/http://www.af.mil/history/essay2.asp |archivedate = 2004-10-20}}</ref>

The '''Sonoran Desert''' is a [[North America]]n [[desert]] which covers large parts of the [[Southwestern United States]] in [[Arizona]] and [[California]], and of [[Northwestern Mexico]] in [[Sonora]], [[Baja California]] and [[Baja California Sur]]. It is the hottest desert in North America, with an area of {{convert|280000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. The western portion of the [[United States–Mexico border]] passes through the Sonoran Desert.

In [[phytogeography]], the Sonoran Desert is within the Sonoran [[Floristic province|Floristic Province]] of the [[Madrean Region]] in southwestern [[North America]], part of the [[Holarctic|Holarctic Kingdom]] of the northern [[Western Hemisphere]].  The desert contains a variety of unique and [[endemism|endemic]] [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, such as the [[Saguaro]] (''Carnegiea gigantea'') and [[Stenocereus thurberi|Organ Pipe cactus]] (''Stenocereus thurberi'').

==Location==
The Sonoran desert wraps around the northern end of the [[Gulf of California]], from [[Baja California Sur]] ([[El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve]] in central and Pacific west coast, Central Gulf Coast subregion on east to southern tip), north through much of [[Baja California]], excluding the central northwest mountains and Pacific west coast, through southeastern [[California]] and southwestern and southern [[Arizona]] to western and central parts of [[Sonora]].<ref name=museum>[http://www.desertmuseum.org/ Arizona–Sonora Desert Museum]</ref>

It is bounded on the west by the [[Peninsular Ranges]], which separate it from the [[California chaparral and woodlands]] (northwest) and [[Baja California desert]] (Vizcaino subregion, central and southeast) ecoregions of the Pacific slope. To the north in California and northwest Arizona, the Sonoran Desert transitions to the colder-winter, higher-elevation [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]], [[Great Basin]], and [[Colorado Plateau]] deserts.

To the east and southeast, the deserts transition to the [[Temperate coniferous forests|coniferous]] [[Arizona Mountains forests]] and [[Sierra Madre Occidental|Sierra Madre]] and [[Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests|Sierra Madre Occidental pine–oak forests]] at higher elevations. To the south the [[Sonoran-Sinaloan transition subtropical dry forest|Sonoran–Sinaloan transition subtropical dry forest]] is the transition zone from the Sonoran Desert to the [[Sinaloan dry forests|tropical dry forests]] of the state of [[Sinaloa]].<ref name=museum/>

==Sub-region deserts==
The desert's sub-regions include the [[Colorado Desert]] of southeastern California; and the [[Yuma Desert]] east of the north-to-south section of the [[Colorado River]] in southwest Arizona. In the 1957 publication, ''Vegetation of the Sonoran Desert'', Forrest Shreve divided the Sonoran Desert into seven regions according to characteristic vegetation: Lower Colorado Valley, Arizona Upland, Plains of Sonora, Foothills of Sonora, Central Gulf Coast, Vizcaíno Region, and Magdalena Region.<ref>[http://alic.arid.arizona.edu/sonoran/documents/mcginnies/McGinnies_overview.html ''An Overview of the Sonoran Desert'', by William G. McGinnies]</ref> Many ecologists now consider Shreve's Vizcaíno and Magdalena regions, which lie on the western side of the [[Baja California Peninsula]], to be a separate [[ecoregion]], the [[Baja California desert]].

Within the southern Sonoran Desert in Mexico is found the [[Gran Desierto de Altar]], with the ''[[Pinacate Peaks|Reserva de la Biosfera el Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar]]'' ('Pinacate National Park' in Mexico), extending {{convert|2000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} of desert and mountainous regions.<ref>http://www.bajaquest.com/penasco/pinacate.htm</ref> The Pinacate National Park includes the only active [[Erg (landform)|Erg]] dune region in [[North America]]. The nearest city to the ''Reserva de la Biosfera el Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar'' is [[Puerto Peñasco]] (a.k.a. 'Rocky Point') in the state of [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]].

;Sub-regions
Sonoran Desert sub-regions include:
* [[Colorado Desert]]
* [[Gran Desierto de Altar]]
* [[Lechuguilla Desert]]
* [[Tonopah Desert]]
* [[Yuha Desert]]
* [[Yuma Desert]]

==Ecology==
The Sonoran Desert includes 60 mammal species, 350 bird species, 20 amphibian species, over 100 reptile species, 30 native fish species, over 1000 native bee species, and more than 2,000 native plant species.<ref>[http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/2005/1/survivingsonoran.cfm Surviving the Sonoran]</ref> The Sonoran Desert area southwest of [[Tucson]] and near the Mexican border is vital habitat for the only population of [[Jaguar]]s living within the United States.<ref>[http://www.envsci.nau.edu/scbs/students/2004_newell/Jaguar%20web%20site/conservation.html The Jaguar in the Borderlands of Arizona, New Mexico and Northern Mexico: Conservation—Threats & Strategies]</ref>  The [[Colorado River Delta]] was once an ecological hotspot within the Sonoran desert, fueled by the flow of fresh water through the Colorado river in this otherwise dry area, but the delta has been greatly reduced in extent due to the damming and use of the river upstream.

[[Image:Sonoradesert 1.JPG|200px|thumb|The Sonoran Desert near [[Tucson, Arizona]] during winter.]]

Many plants not only survive, but thrive in the harsh conditions of the Sonoran Desert. Many have evolved to have specialized adaptations to the desert climate. The Sonoran Desert's biseasonal rainfall pattern results in more plant species than in the other North America deserts.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|name=Sonoran desert|id=na1310}}</ref> The Sonoran Desert includes  plant genera and species from the [[agave]] family, [[Arecaceae|palm]] family, [[cactus]] family, [[legume]] family, and numerous others.

The Sonoran is the only place in the world where the famous [[saguaro cactus]]  (''Carnegiea gigantea'') grows in the wild.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/sagu/guides/saguarocactus.pdf The Saguaro Cactus]</ref> [[Cylindropuntia|Cholla]] (''Cylindropuntia'' spp.), [[Opuntia basilaris|beavertail]] (''Opuntia basilaris''), [[Echinocereus|hedgehog]] (''Echinocereus'' spp.), [[Ferocactus wislizeni|fishhook]] (''Ferocactus wislizeni''), [[Opuntia|prickly pear]] (''Opuntia'' spp.), [[Peniocereus|nightblooming cereus]] (''Peniocereus'' spp.), and [[Stenocereus thurberi|organ pipe]] (''Stenocereus thurberi'') are other taxa of cacti found here. Cactus provides food and homes to many desert mammals and birds, with showy flowers in reds, pinks, yellows, and whites, blooming most commonly from late March through June, depending on the species and seasonal temperatures.

[[Larrea tridentata|Creosote bush]] (''Larrea tridentata'') and [[Ambrosia dumosa|bur sage]] (''Ambrosia dumosa'') dominate valley floors. [[Psorothamnus fremontii|Indigo bush]] (''Psorothamnus fremontii'') and [[Mormon tea]] are other shrubs that may be found. [[List of Sonoran Desert wildflowers|Wildflowers of the Sonoran Desert]] include [[Abronia villosa|desert sand verbena]] (''Abronia villosa''), [[Geraea canescens|desert sunflower]] (''Geraea canescens''), and [[evening primrose]]s.

[[File:Prosopis velutina Anza-Borrego.jpg|thumb|[[Prosopis velutina|velvet mesquite]] (''Prosopis velutina'')]]
Ascending from the valley up [[Bajada (geography)|bajada]]s, various subtrees such as [[Prosopis velutina|velvet mesquite]] (''Prosopis velutina''), [[Parkinsonia florida|palo verde]] (''Parkinsonia florida''), [[Olneya tesota|desert ironwood]] (''Olneya tesota''), [[Chilopsis linearis|desert willow]] (''Chilopsis linearis'' ssp. ''arcuata''), and [[Canotia holacantha|crucifixion thorn]] (''Canotia holacantha'') are common, as well as multi-stemmed [[Fouquieria splendens|ocotillo]] (''Fouquieria splendens''). Shrubs found at higher elevations include [[Acacia constricta|whitethorn acacia]] (''Acacia constricta''), fairy duster, and [[jojoba]]. In the desert subdivisions found on Baja California, cardon cactus, elephant tree, and [[boojum tree]] occur.<ref>MacMahon, J. A. ''Deserts''. 1986, 638 pages</ref>

[[File:Washingtonia filifera Anza-Borrego.jpg|thumb|''[[Washingtonia filifera]]'' in [[Anza Borrego Desert State Park]]]]
The [[Washingtonia filifera|California fan palm]] (''Washingtonia filifera'') is found in the [[Colorado Desert]] section of the Sonoran Desert, the only [[native plant|native]] palm in California, among many other introduced [[Arecaceae]] genera and species. It is found at [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]-fed [[oasis|oases]], such as in [[Anza Borrego Desert State Park]], [[Joshua Tree National Park]], and the [[Kofa National Wildlife Refuge]].<ref>Hogan, C.

==Human population==
{{main|:Category:History of indigenous peoples of North America}}
{{see also|:Category:Native American history of California}}
The Sonoran Desert is home to the cultures of over seventeen contemporary [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, with settlements at  [[:Category:American Indian reservations in California|American Indian reservations in California]] and [[:Category:American Indian reservations in Arizona|Arizona]], as well as populations in Mexico.

The largest city in the Sonoran Desert is [[Phoenix, Arizona]], with a 2013 metropolitan population of about 4.3 million.<ref name="census">[http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metro_general/2006/CBSA-EST2006-01.csv Table 1: Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2006 (CBSA-EST2006-01)], [[United States Census Bureau]], 2007-04-05. Accessed 2007-09-11</ref>{{Not in citation|date=March 2014}} Located on the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] in central [[Arizona]], it is one of the fastest-growing [[United States metropolitan area|metropolitan areas]] in the United States. In 2007 in the Phoenix area, desert was losing ground to [[urban sprawl]] at a rate of approximately {{convert|4000|m2|acre|sp=us}} per hour.<ref>[http://researchmag.asu.edu/stories/ewan.html Make No Small Plans], Adelheid Fischer, ''ASU Research'' magazine.

The next largest cities are [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], in southern Arizona, with a metro area population of around 1 million,<ref name="census" /> and [[Mexicali]], [[Baja California]], whose [[Municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] also has a population of around 900,000. The municipality of [[Hermosillo]], [[Sonora]], has a population of around 700,000. [[Ciudad Obregon]], [[Sonora]], in the southern part of the desert has a population of 375,800.<ref>[http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ Principales resultados por localidad 2005], Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática (Mexico).

===California===
The [[Coachella Valley]], located in the [[Colorado Desert]] section of the Sonoran Desert, has a population of 365,000. Many famous [[Southern California]] desert resort cities such as [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] and [[Palm Desert, California|Palm Desert]] are located here.

During the winter months, from November to April, the daytime temperatures in the Coachella Valley range from 70°F (21°C) to 90°F (32°C) and corresponding nighttime lows range from 46°F (8°C) to 68°F (20°C) making it a popular winter resort destination. Due to its warm year-round climate [[citrus]] and subtropical fruits such as mangoes, figs, and dates are grown in the Coachella Valley and adjacent [[Imperial Valley]]. Other cities include [[Indio, California|Indio]], [[Calexico, California|Calexico]], and [[Blythe, California|Blythe]].

===Illegal border crossing===
Straddling as it does the [[Mexico–United States border|US-Mexican border]], with low levels of human-installed security, the Sonoran is a popular route to attempt illegal entry into the United States.  The harsh conditions mean that the 3-5-day march, usually moving at night to minimise exposure to the heat, often ends in death.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21029783 Arizona: Naming the dead from the desert], BBC News, 17 January 2013</ref>

==Parks, conservation centers and research facilities==
[[File:Sondes.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Mexican Gold Poppy|Mexican goldpoppies]] in the [[Sonoran Desert National Monument]].]]

There are many National Parks and Monuments; federal and state [[nature reserve]]s and [[wildlife refuge]]s; state, county, and city parks; and government or nonprofit group operated [[natural history museum]]s, science research institutes, and [[botanical garden]]s and desert landscape [[garden]]s.

Extremely little is known about him.

A West-Saxon genealogy fragmentarily preserved in London, British Library, Add. MS 23211, possibly of the late 9th century, makes him a son and successor of King [[Æscwine of Essex|Æscwine]]. The post-Conquest historians [[Henry of Huntingdon]]'s ''Historia Anglorum'', [[Roger of Wendover]]'s ''Flores Historiarum'' and [[Matthew Paris]]'s ''Chronica Majora'' substitute his father's name for Eorcenwine (''Erkenwine'', ''Erchenwine''). Though their testimony is centuries removed from Sledd's floruit, it is thought that they drew on alternative pre-Conquest material.

Although Æscwine or Eorcenwine is sometimes credited with the foundation of the kingdom, genealogies included in the works of William of Malmesbury and John of Worcester (''Chronicon'' B) make Sledd the first king of Essex and genealogies for Sigered and Swithred in Add. MS 23211 trace the line of East Saxon kings no further than Sledd. This suggests that Sledd may have been regarded as the founder of the East Saxon house. On no known authority, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris state that Sledd directly succeeded his father on his death in 587.

Sledd married Ricula, sister of King [[Æthelberht of Kent]]. His name appears as being the father of [[Sæberht of Essex|Sæberht]], whose rule began in ''c''. 604, and another son is named as Seaxbald.

{{notice|This is a project page meant to give examples of common usage errors in Wikipedia articles. It is not meant to be an encyclopedic article about such errors.}}

This is a list of English words which are commonly misused. It is meant to include only words whose ''misuse'' is deprecated by most usage writers, editors, and other professional linguists of Standard English. It is possible that some of the meanings marked ''non-standard'' may pass into ''Standard'' English in the future, but at this time all of the following ''non-standard'' phrases are likely to be marked as ''incorrect'' by English teachers or changed by editors if used in a work submitted for publication. Some of the examples are [[homonym]]s or pairs of similarly spelled words which are often confused.

The words listed below are frequently used in ways that major English dictionaries do not condone in any definition. <!-- note to editors: please check in at least the Merriam-Webster Dictionary [http://www.m-w.com] and the American Heritage Dictionary [http://www.bartleby.com/61] to make sure that any additions are in fact misuses and not merely disputed uses -->See [[list of English words with disputed usage]] for words that are used in ways that are [[wikt:deprecate|deprecated]] by some usage writers but are condoned by some dictionaries. There may be regional variations in grammar, spelling, and word-use, especially between different English-speaking countries. Such differences are not seen as incorrect once they have gained widespread acceptance in a particular country.

===L===
* '''[[wikt:lay|lay]]''' (''lay'', ''laid'', ''laid'', ''laying'', ''lays'') and '''[[wikt:lie|lie]]''' (''lie'', ''lay'', ''lain'', ''lying'', ''lies'') are often used synonymously. ''Lay'' is a [[transitive verb]], meaning that it takes an object. "To lay something" means to place something. ''Lie'', on the other hand, is [[intransitive]] and means to recline. The distinction between these related verbs is further blurred by the fact that the past tense of ''lie'' is ''lay''. An easy rule of thumb is to replace the words with ''sit'' and ''set''.  If ''sit'' makes sense (e.g. sit down) then ''lie'' should be used (lie down). If the sentence works with ''set'' (e.g. set the book on the table) then ''lay'' should be used (lay the book on the table).  A '''layoff''' is never a ''lieoff'' or ''lyoff''. (''To lie'' can also mean "to not tell the truth" – but in that case, the past tense is ''lied''.)

(Should be ''lie'', ''lay'', ''lying'' and ''lain'')
* '''[[wikt:levee|levee]]''' and '''[[wikt:levy|levy]]'''. A ''levee'' is a structure built along a river to raise the height of its banks, thereby preventing nearby land from flooding (see: [[wikt:dike|dike]]). ''To levy'' is to impose (1) a tax, fine or other assessment, or (2) a military draft; as a noun, a ''levy'' is an assessment or army thus gathered. The two words share a common root, but they are not considered interchangeable in Standard English. Because they are [[homophones]], misuse is usually only apparent when observed in writing.
** ''Standard'': The Netherlands is well known for its elaborate system of levees.
** ''Standard'': This statute allows the state to levy a 3% tax.

* '''[[wikt:lose|lose]]''' and '''[[wikt:loose|loose]]'''. ''Lose'' can mean "fail to win", "misplace", or "cease to be in possession". ''Loose'' can mean the opposite of tight, or the opposite of tighten. ''Lose'' is often misspelled ''loose'', likely because ''lose'' has an irregular rhyme for the way it is spelled: it is more common for words ending ''-ose'' to rhyme [[wikt:Rhymes:English:-??z|-??z]], like ''nose'', or ''rose'', but ''lose'' rhymes [[wikt:Rhymes:English:-u?z|-u?z]], like ''news'' or ''confuse''. This may cause poor spellers to guess the correct spelling should match another -u?z rhyming word like ''choose'', although ''choose'' is itself also an exception to the regular rhyme for words ending ''-oose'' (typically such words, including ''loose'', rhyme [[wikt:Rhymes:English:-u?s|-u?s]], like ''goose'' or ''caboose'').

(From  post-classical Latin ''marina'' brine, short for classical Latin ''aqua marina'' sea water.)<ref name=OED>[[Oxford English Dictionary]], (1933)</ref> In Standard English, ''marinade'' is a noun and not a verb; marinate is the verb. ''Macerate'' means "to soften by steeping in a liquid" and in culinary terminology is used for non-protein items, specifically ''fruit''.<ref name=OED />  The word ''macerate'' is also used in science "to soften bone, rock etc. in a liquid".<ref name=OED />

* '''[[wikt:me|me]]''', '''[[wikt:myself|myself]]''', and '''[[wikt:I|I]]'''. In a traditional prescriptive grammar, ''I'' is used only as a subject, ''me'' is used only as an object, and ''myself'' is used only as a reflexive object, that is to say when the subject is "''I''" and the object would otherwise be "''me''". ''Myself'' is often used incorrectly, often in a form of [[hypercorrection]]. Like the other [[reflexive pronoun]]s, ''myself''  should be used only when both the subject and object of the verb are the speaker, or as an emphatic pronoun ([[intensifier]]).
** ''Standard'': Jim and I took the train.
** ''Standard'': He lent the books to Jim and me.
** ''Standard'': That is I in the picture. (This is very formal, and seldom found in speech.)

The ''[[Catholic novitiate|novitiate]]'' is the state of being a novice, or the time for which one is a novice. However, a novice monk or nun is often incorrectly described as "a novitiate" (perhaps confused with "initiate").

===O===
* '''[[wikt:of|of]]''' and '''[[wikt:have|have]]'''. In some dialects of spoken English, ''of'' and the contracted form of ''have'', '' 've'', sound alike. However, in standard written English, they are not interchangeable.
** ''Standard'': Susan would have stopped to eat, but she was running late.
** ''Standard'': You could have warned me!

{{Nihongo|'''''Wolf's Rain'''''|???????|Urufuzu Rein|lead=yes}} is an [[anime]] series created by writer and [[story editor]] [[Keiko Nobumoto]] and produced by [[Bones (studio)|Bones Studio]]. It was directed by [[Tensai Okamura]] and featured character designs by [[Toshihiro Kawamoto]] with a soundtrack produced and arranged by [[Yoko Kanno]]. It focuses on the journey of four lone wolves who cross paths while following the scent of the Lunar Flower and seek for Paradise.

''Wolf's Rain'' spans twenty-six television episodes and four [[original video animation]] (OVA) episodes, with each episode running approximately twenty-four minutes. The series was originally broadcast in Japan on [[Fuji TV]] and the anime [[communications satellite|CS]] television network, [[Animax]]. The complete thirty episode series is licensed for [[Region 1]] release by [[Bandai Entertainment]], in [[Region 2]] (Europe) by [[Beez Entertainment]] and in [[Region 4]] by [[Madman Entertainment]]. The series was adapted into a short <nowiki>two-</nowiki>[[tank?bon|volume]] [[manga]] series written by Keiko Nobumoto and illustrated by Toshitsugu Iida. The manga, which was released while the series was airing, is a retelling of the story rather than a straight adaptation. It was originally serialized in ''[[Magazine Z]]'' and has been released in North America by [[Viz Media]].

The anime series was well received in Japan, being the third ranked anime series in its time slot while airing on Fuji TV. The Bandai Entertainment English language release sold well in North America. It helped Bandai gain the 2004 Anime Company of the Year award from industry news company ICv2 in the ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga. The manga adaptation was selected as one of their top ten anime products of 2005 and sold well in North America. Reviewers of the series gave it high marks for characterization, visual presentation and its soundtrack, while disparaging the existence of four recapitulation episodes in the middle of the series. The manga adaptation also sold well in North America and received good reviews, though reviewers felt its short length resulted in a rushed plot and neglected supporting characters.

==Plot==
According to an old legend, when the end of the world comes, a place known as Paradise will appear. However, only wolves will know how to find it. Although wolves are believed to have been hunted to extinction nearly two hundred years ago, they still exist, surviving by casting illusions over themselves to make them appear human.<ref name="Ep1">{{cite episode |title=City of Howls |series=Wolf's Rain |episodelink=List of Wolf's Rain episodes |number=1 }}</ref> Freeze City is a northern human city in a world where the majority of people live in poverty and hardship.

[[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Kiba|Kiba]], an injured lone white wolf, goes to Freeze City following the scent of the Lunar Flower, which is the key to opening Paradise. There he encounters [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Tsume|Tsume]], [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Hige|Hige]] and [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Toboe|Toboe]], three other wolves who were drawn to Freeze City by the scent of the Lunar Flower and are now living in the city. The wolves encounter [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Quent Yaiden|Quent Yaiden]], a former Sheriff of Kyrios who is obsessed with hunting down wolves, and his dog [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Blue|Blue]]. [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Cheza|Cheza]], the Flower Maiden who is destined to lead the wolves to Paradise, is being studied at a laboratory under the care of [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Cher Degré|Cher Degré]]. She is awakened by the smell of wolf's blood. As Kiba and Hige approach the lab to find her, she is stolen away by [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Darcia|Lord Darcia the Third]], whose people created Cheza.

With the Flower Maiden gone, the wolves have no reason to stay in the city. Despite some initial misgivings and suspicions, they decide to stay together and follow Kiba in his search for the Flower Maiden and Paradise. As they pursue Cheza, the wolves travel through various cities and the remnants of former habitations. Cher joins the city's army to try to recover Cheza, while Cher's ex-husband [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Hubb Lebowski|Hubb Lebowski]] searches desperately for Cher, and Quent continues his relentless pursuit of the wolves. When Blue eventually encounters Cheza, it awakens her wolf blood from dormancy and causes her to leave Quent and take on her own human form. She joins the wolves and travels with them for a while, developing an intense and close [[romantic relationship]] with Hige, and meanwhile Hubb finds himself traveling with Quent, who is now searching for Blue as well as the wolves. Hubb eventually finds Cher and from there they continue their pursuit of the wolves to find Cheza.

Together the wolves reach Darcia's keep after Kiba goes off on his own. Hubb, Cher, and Quent arrive in the keep, and Tsume, Toboe, and Hige find Kiba, Cheza and Darcia during a sword fight between Darcia and Kiba. The reunion is short-lived however because Jaguara's troops attack, destroying the keep in the process. The Noble's troops capture Cheza, Hubb, Cher, and Blue during the raid, and the wolves get separated from Kiba. After finding Kiba, the wolves continue their journey to rescue Cheza from Jaguara, while Cher rescues Blue and manages to find Cheza with help from Hubb, but Jaguara's troops instantly recapture Cheza, taking Hubb with them and forcing Cher and Blue to find Cheza on their own.

The wolves and the humans eventually come together in Jaguara's city, where the captured Cheza is being held. In attempting to rescue the abducted Cheza, Kiba, Tsume and Toboe are captured. Tsume and Toboe are thrown into a dungeon with Hubb while [[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Jaguara|Jaguara]] attempts to use Kiba's blood to force Paradise to open. Meanwhile, Hige and Blue are reunited outside the Keep, where Hige remembers that he had once worked for Jaguara and decides to go rescue his friends, but not before telling Blue to stay outside and promising her that he will return to her no matter what. While waiting for Hige, Blue is reunited with her master Quent and meanwhile Darcia, having survived the attack on his keep, interrupts Jaguara's ceremony as Kiba and the other wolves break free and rush to free the Flower Maiden. Hige is wounded during the fight against Jaguara and Kiba arrives after Darcia is poisoned by the Noble. Darcia battles Jaguara along with Kiba and finally slays her as the keep begins to collapse. The wolves and the humans barely escape with their lives, and Quent is gravely wounded saving Blue from an oncoming vehicle after escaping from Jaguara's city.

The wolves, now accompanied by Cheza, Cher, Hubb and Quent, continue trying to make their way to Paradise, pursued by the now insane Darcia. Cher, Toboe, Quent, Hubb, Hige, Blue and Tsume are all killed before they can see Paradise, leaving only Kiba, Cheza and Darcia alive at the place where it can be opened. Darcia is killed when he attempts to enter Paradise, and Cheza's body disintegrates into seeds. Fatally wounded, Kiba concludes that his quest has failed, but as he lays dying, rain begins to fall and Cheza's seeds grow into thousands of lunar flowers. Kiba is then plunged into the waters depths as he dies, the blood red moon turning back to its normal color. Cheza's death causes Paradise, as well as the world, to be reborn. However, Darcia's corruption can be seen taking root in this new Paradise.

===Changes in manga adaptation===
The two-volume manga adaptation includes some of the core events of the anime series with few changes, but as a whole the manga veers greatly from its anime inspiration.  Many events from the anime do not occur in the manga, and some of the events from the anime that are presented in the manga are completely different in terms of dialogue, chronological sequence, and final outcomes.<ref name="Manga1" /> In particular, the second volume tells an almost completely different story, with Darcia recruiting Blue to help him open the door to Paradise with her blood.  The wolves must go to Darcia's keep, rather than Jaguara's, in order to free Cheza, with Kiba missing but appearing at the end to make the final rescue effort.  At the end of the manga, the four wolves and Cheza are sitting on a rock as the clouds break and sunlight streams through for the first time.  The world rejoices the end of the [[Ice Age]] and rumors that Paradise has been found abound.<ref name="Manga2">{{Cite book|title=Wolf's Rain, Volume 2 |last=Nobumoto |first=Keiko |authorlink=Keiko Nobumoto |date=February 1, 2005 |publisher=Viz Media| series=Wolf's Rain |isbn=1-59116-718-3}}</ref>

In the manga most of the characters are similar in appearance and personality to their anime counterparts, but some characters seen in the anime do not appear in the manga, including the Noble Lord Orkham.<ref name="Manga1" /><ref name="Manga2" />

{{Main|List of Wolf's Rain characters}}

*{{Nihongo|'''[[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Kiba|Kiba]]'''|??|lit. "Fang"}} is an [[Arctic Wolf]] who is dedicated solely to finding the Lunar Flower and opening the way to Paradise. He will protect Cheza with his life. Kiba primarily acts on his instincts, which sometimes lead him to behave rashly, and the others to call him idealistic.  Full of wolf pride, Kiba initially expresses disgust at wolves who use human disguises, but eventually realizes that it is necessary to survive. {{Voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]]|[[Johnny Yong Bosch]]}}

*{{Nihongo|'''[[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Tsume|Tsume]]'''|??|lit. "Claw"}} is a [[Grey Wolf]] with a big scar across his chest, not counting many others. Rough and self-reliant, Tsume is a strong fighter who keeps his true feelings to himself. He joins the others after his human gang in Freeze City betrays him. He does not initially believe in Paradise, but eventually starts to believe in their goal. Though he frequently quarrels with Kiba over their journey, he eventually accepts his leadership and comes to trust in him, also growing protective of Toboe and eventually forming a relationship with him{{Voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]]|[[Crispin Freeman]]}}

*{{Nihongo|'''[[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Hige|Hige]]'''|??|lit. "Whiskers"}} is a [[Mexican Wolf]] with a carefree attitude, who seems quite comfortable living in human society. Hige likes to converse with girls and to eat, he is quite chubby. After meeting Kiba, he goes along with the idea of searching for Paradise without much argument. Hige wears a collar around his neck, that seems to attract soldiers of a Nobel, Lady Jaguara, leading him to put his wolf crew in danger and himself in pain. {{Voiced by|[[Akio Suyama]]|[[Joshua Seth]]}}

*{{Nihongo|'''[[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Toboe|Toboe]]'''|????|T?boe|lit. "Howling"}} is a [[Red Wolf]] and the youngest of the group. He is considered the pup or the [[runt]] by the others, but after he desperately fights a huge walrus during the journey to rescue Cheza from Jaguara, the other wolves change their mind about him. He was raised by an old woman who found him outside the city, and still wears the bracelets she gave him. Due to his upbringing, Toboe is friendly and protective towards most humans. He forms a relationship with Tsume {{Voiced by|[[Hiroki Shimowada]]|[[Mona Marshall]]}}

*{{Nihongo|'''[[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Cheza|Cheza]]'''|???}} is also called the "Flower Maiden". The wolves need Cheza to find and open the gateway to Paradise.

Originally asleep and under study in a lab in Freeze City, Cheza is eventually able to join the wolves, whom she loves, and travels with them. She refers to herself in the third person, usually adapted to 'this one'. The spilling of wolf blood makes Cheza scream, and she has the ability to heal them or put them to sleep through her song and touch.  {{Voiced by|[[Arisa Ogasawara]]|[[Sherry Lynn]]}}

*{{Nihongo|'''[[List of Wolf's Rain characters#Blue|Blue]]'''|}} is a blue [[Wolfdog]]. At first, she travels along with Quent Yaiden, hunting wolves.

Cheza, the Lunar Flower, awakens at Kiba's arrival, but she is stolen away by Darcia. The four wolves join together and leave the town. After a rough trip through a town that violently rejects all outsiders, the wolves are able to meet with Cheza, who sensed their presence below and jumped from Darcia's airship to float down to them.

Darcia aims to open Paradise using Cheza and the blood of Blue, whom he found in the woods and recruited for the project. After a fight with Darcia that leaves Kiba completely blind, the wolves are able to free Cheza and escape Darcia's keep just before it collapses. At the end, as the wolves and Cheza sit on a rock, the sun breaks through the clouds for the first time and the Ice Age ends, leading people to believe that Paradise has open.

Tasha Robinson of ''[[SciFi Weekly]]'' praised the series for its unusual focus on non-human characters and the interesting dynamic of wolves behaving like wolves as they interact with the human characters and environments in the series.<ref name="SciFiReview">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue377/anime.html | title=Anime Reviews: Wolf's Rain | first=Tasha |last=Robinson |work=SciFi Weekly | accessdate=December 29, 2007 |date=July 12, 2004 |volume=10 | issue=377 | publisher=[[Syfy|Sci Fi channel]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071218211929/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue377/anime.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = December 18, 2007}}</ref><ref name="ANNSeriesReview" /> Carlo Santos of [[Anime News Network]] praised the visuals of the series, noting that they "showcase Studio BONES at their most imaginative, with beautiful backgrounds that depict settings from high-tech mysticism to urban decay to open wilderness.

In ''[[The Anime Encyclopedia]]'', Jonathan Clements and [[Helen McCarthy]] criticized the production delays and the hiatuses that led to the creation of the four recap episodes, stating that "if the makers had spent less time recounting the story so far, they might have had more than enough space to finish the entire run within the requisite 26 episodes." They praised the series soundtrack, feeling it supported "the atmosphere and character development", and felt the "moody, dark, and understated" art was attractive.<ref name="AnimeEncyc">{{Cite book|last=Clements |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Clements |author2=[[Helen McCarthy]] |title=The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917, Revised and Expanded Edition |date=November 1, 2006 |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=1-933330-10-4 |oclc=71237342 |pages=728–729 |edition=2nd }}</ref>

{{Nihongo|'''Sagami Bay'''|???|Sagami-wan|also known as the '''Sagami Gulf''' or '''Sagami Sea'''}} lies south of [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] in [[Honshu]], central [[Japan]], contained within the scope of the [[Miura Peninsula]], in Kanagawa, to the east, the [[Izu Peninsula]], in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]], to the west, and the [[Sh?nan]] coastline to the north, while the island of [[Izu ?shima]] marks the southern extent of the bay. It lies approximately {{convert|40|km|mi}} southwest of the capital, [[Tokyo]]. Cities on the bay include [[Odawara]], [[Chigasaki]], [[Fujisawa, Kanagawa|Fujisawa]], [[Hiratsuka]], [[Ito, Shizuoka|Ito]], and [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].

== History ==
The epicenter of the [[1923 Great Kanto earthquake|Great Kant? earthquake]] in 1923 was deep beneath [[Izu ?shima]] Island in Sagami Bay. It devastated Tokyo, the port city of [[Yokohama]], and the surrounding prefectures of [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], [[Kanagawa]], and [[Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka]], and caused widespread damage throughout the Kant? region.<ref>Hammer, Joshua. (2006).

Nankaid? earthquake|massive tsunami of 1498]]. <ref> Kamio, Kenji & Willson, Heather, An English Guide to Kamakura's Temples and Shrines, p.143-144. </ref>

== Natural environment ==
A branch of the warm [[Kuroshio Current]] warms the bay, allowing it to host marine organisms typical of more southerly regions and giving a mild climate to the land bordering it. The maximum depth of Sagami Bay is about 1500 meters.

Organisms from sub-arctic regions are advected into the bay by intrusions of the Oyashio Current resulting in very high [[biodiversity]].<ref>[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=315031 CJO - Abstract - Biodiversity in midwater cnidarians and ctenophores: submersible-based results from deep-water bays in the Japan Sea and north-western Pacific<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It is the major study site for research programs at the University of Tokyo (ORI) and the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC).

In 2004, soil samples from Sagami Bay were found to contain [[radioactive contamination]] from the [[Bikini Atoll]] [[nuclear testing|nuclear tests]] that took place from 1946 to 1958.<ref>[http://www.zhb.gov.cn/english/chanel-1/detail-1.php3?chanel=1&column=a&id=9561 SEPA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The currency is used in both Hong Kong and Macau, as the two regions are of close proximity and their currencies have similar exchange rates.

==Terminology==
In formal [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]], the ? or ? ({{zh|j=jyun4}}) character is used. In spoken Cantonese, ? ({{zh|j=man1}}) is used, perhaps a [[transliteration]] of the first syllable of “money”, although some suggest that the character is a [[Corruption (grammar)|corruption]] of [[Wiktionary:?|?]] ({{zh|j=man4}}). The dollar is divided into 100 cents, with the character ? ({{zh|j=sin1}}, a transliteration of “cent”) used on coins and in spoken Cantonese. However, ? is now only used in the stock market, as now it no longer has a note or coin form due to its small value, and is no longer used in regular transactions. ? ({{zh|j=fan1|p=f?n}}) is used in [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]]. The amount of 10 cents is called 1 ''houh'' in Cantonese (?, {{zh|j=hou4}}, on coins and in spoken Cantonese, ??, {{zh|j=hou4 zip}}, in colloquial speech, ?, {{zh|j=gok3|p=ji?o}}, in Mandarin). The mil was known as the ''man'' or ''tsin'' in Cantonese (?, {{zh|j=man4|p=wén}}, or ?, {{zh|j=cin1|p=qi?n}}, on coins and in spoken Cantonese and Mandarin).

To express prices in spoken Cantonese, for example $7.80, the phrase is ??? ({{zh|j=cat1 go3 baat3|l=seven units and eight [decimals]}}); in financial terms, where integer values in cents exist, e.g., $6.75, the phrase is ????? ({{zh|j=luk6 go3 cat1 hou4 bun3|l=six and seven ''houh'' half}}; fives in cents is normally expressed as “half”, unless followed by another five, such as 55 cents when preceded by a dollar value); $7.08 is ????? ({{zh|j=cat1 man1 ling4 baat3 sin1|l=seven dollars zero eight cents}}).

===Slang terms===
In Hong Kong, the following are slang terms used to refer to various amounts of money:

*?? ({{zh|j=san4 sa1}}): cents (Rarely used; ‘’lit.’’ [[cinnabar]], [[mortar and pestle|ground]] (therefore small-size) which is used in [[Chinese medicine]])

Some of these terms are also used by [[overseas Chinese]] to refer their local currency.

A common slang term in English, especially among Western expats living in Hong Kong, is "Honkie".

==History==
When Hong Kong was established as a free trading port in 1841,<ref>{{cite news   |title= Hong Kong Currency (Local History Unit, Hong Kong Museum of History, 1993) |publisher=hk.history.museum |url=http://hk.history.museum/en/pspecial_2.php  |accessdate=8 Jan 2012 }}</ref> there was no local currency in everyday circulation. Foreign currencies such as Indian [[rupee]]s, Spanish and Mexican [[Spanish dollar|8 reales]], and [[Chinese cash (currency unit)|Chinese cash]] coins circulated. Since 1825, it had been the policy of the British government to introduce [[sterling silver]] coinage to all of its colonies, and to this end, in 1845, the Spanish and Mexican 8 reales coins were set at a legal tender value of 4 shillings 2 pence [[pound sterling|sterling]]. But just as in the case of the [[British North America]]n colonies, the attempts to introduce the sterling coinage failed to overcome the strong local adherence to the silver [[Spanish dollar]] system.

By 1858, London gave up all attempts to influence the currency situation in Canada, and, by the 1860s, it came to the same realisation in Hong Kong: that there was no point in trying to displace an already existing currency system. In 1863, the [[Royal Mint]] in London began issuing special subsidiary coinage for use in Hong Kong within the dollar system. In 1866, a local mint was established at [[Sugar Street]] in [[Causeway Bay]] on Hong Kong Island for the purpose of minting Hong Kong silver dollar and half dollar coins of the same value and similar likeness to their Mexican counterparts.

The Chinese did not however receive these new Hong Kong dollars well, and in 1868 the Hong Kong mint was closed down with a loss of $440,000. The machinery at the Hong Kong mint was sold first to [[Jardine Matheson]] and in turn to the Japanese and used to make the first [[Yen]] coins in 1870. In the 1860s, banknotes of the new British colonial banks, the [[Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]] and the [[Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China]], denominated in dollars, also began to circulate in both Hong Kong and the wider region.
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:1884 trade dollar rev.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Trade Dollar of the USA minted between 1873-1885]] -->

In 1873, [[Panic of 1873|the international silver crisis]] resulted in a devaluation of silver against gold-based currencies. Since the silver dollars in the USA and Canada were attached to a gold exchange standard, this meant that the silver dollars circulating along the China coast dropped in value as compared to the [[United States dollar|US dollar]] and the [[Canadian dollar]].

By 1895, the circumstances had changed to the extent that there was now a dearth of Mexican dollars and the authorities in both Hong Kong and the [[Straits Settlements]] were putting pressure on the authorities in London to take measures to have a regular supply of silver dollar coins. London eventually acquiesced and legislation was enacted in attempts to regulate the coinage. New [[British trade dollar]]s were coined at the mints in [[Calcutta]] and [[Bombay]] for use in both Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements.

In 1906, the Straits Settlements issued their own silver dollar coin and attached it to a gold sterling exchange standard at a fixed value of 2 shillings and 4 pence. This was the point of departure as between the Hong Kong unit and the Straits unit.

By 1935, only Hong Kong and China remained on the silver standard. In that year, Hong Kong, shortly after China, abandoned silver and introduced a crawling peg to sterling of 1 pound = 15.36 to 16.45 dollars. It was from this point in time that the concept of a Hong Kong dollar as a distinct unit of currency came into existence.

The One-Dollar Currency Note Ordinance of that year led to the introduction of one-dollar notes by the government and the government acknowledged the Hong Kong dollar as the local monetary unit. It was not until 1937 that the [[legal tender]] of Hong Kong was finally unified. In 1939, the dollar was put on a fixed peg of 16 dollars = 1 pound (1 dollar = 1 shilling 3 pence).

[[Image:100 cent bill, Hong Kong (2).JPG|thumb|right|A 100 Japanese military yen note]]
During the [[Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupation]], [[Japanese military yen]] were the only means of everyday exchange in Hong Kong. When the yen was first introduced on 26 December 1941, the exchange rate was 1 yen = 2 dollars. However, in August 1942, the rate was changed to 4 to 1. The yen became the only legal tender on 1 June 1943. The issue of local currency was resumed by the Hong Kong government and the authorised local banks after liberation, with the pre-war rate of 16 dollars = 1 pound being restored. The yen was exchanged at a rate of 100 yen = 1 dollar. On 6 September 1945, all yen notes were declared void.

In 1967, when sterling was devalued, the dollar's peg to the pound was increased from 1 shilling 3 pence to 1 shilling 4½ pence (14.5455 dollars = 1 pound) although this did not entirely offset the devaluation. In 1972, the Hong Kong dollar was pegged to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] at a rate of 5.65 H.K. dollar = 1 U.S. dollar. This was revised to 5.085 H.K. dollar = 1 U.S. dollar in 1973. Between 1974 and 1983, the Hong Kong dollar was floated. On 17 October 1983, the currency was pegged at a rate of 7.8 H.K. dollar = 1 U.S. dollar, through the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority#Currency board system|currency board system]].

As of 18 May 2005, in addition to the lower guaranteed limit, a new upper guaranteed limit was set for the Hong Kong dollar at 7.75 to the American dollar. The lower limit has been lowered from 7.80 to 7.85 (by 100 [[percentage in point|pip]]s per week from 23 May to 20 June 2005).<ref>{{cite news   |title= Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Annual Report 2005 |url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr05-06/english/panels/fa/papers/fa0504cb1-1338-4e.pdf }}</ref> The Hong Kong Monetary Authority indicated this move is to narrow the gap between the interest rates in Hong Kong and those of the United States. A further aim of allowing the Hong Kong dollar to trade in a range is to avoid the HK dollar being used as a proxy for speculative bets on a [[Chinese renminbi|renminbi]] revaluation.

The [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]] and the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] provides that Hong Kong retains full autonomy with respect to currency issuance. Currency in Hong Kong is issued by the [[Hong Kong Government|government]] and three local banks under the supervision of the territory's ''de facto'' [[central bank]], the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]]. Bank notes are printed by [[Hong Kong Note Printing Limited]].

A bank can issue a Hong Kong dollar only if it has the equivalent exchange in US dollars on deposit. The currency board system ensures that Hong Kong's entire monetary base is backed with US dollars at the linked exchange rate. The resources for the backing are kept in Hong Kong's [[exchange fund]], which is among the largest official reserves in the world. Hong Kong also has huge deposits of US dollars, with official foreign currency reserves of 281.7 billion USD as of October 2011.<ref>http://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/key-information/press-releases/2011/20111107-3.shtml</ref>

==Coins==
[[Image:Hk money coins.jpg|frame|Reverses of Hong Kong coins]]
{{main|Coins of the Hong Kong dollar}}
In 1863, 1 mil, 1 and 10 cent coins were introduced, followed in 1866 by 5 and 20 cents, ½ and 1 dollar. The 1 mil and 1 cent were struck in bronze, with the 1 mil a holed coin. The remaining coins were struck in silver. Production of the 1 mil ended in 1866, whilst that of the ½ and 1 dollar ceased in 1868, with only the ½ dollar (now with the denomination given as 50 cents) resuming production in 1890. Production of all silver coins was suspended in 1905, only briefly resumed in 1932 and 1933 for the production of 5 cent coins.

In 1934, the last 1 cent coins were issued, but the last minting was 1941. These were not issued because of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The following year (1935), cupro-nickel 5 and 10 cents were introduced, replaced by nickel in 1937 and nickel-brass between 1948 and 1949. Copper-nickel 50 cents were issued in 1951, these were changed to Nickel-brass in 1977.

In 1960, cupro-nickel 1 dollar coins were introduced, these were reduced in size in 1978. These were followed in 1975 by nickel-brass 20 cents and cupro-nickel 2 dollars (both scallop shaped), and in 1976 by [[decagon]]al, cupro-nickel 5 dollars, changed to a round thicker shape in 1980. The 5 cent was last issued in 1979, but last struck in 1988. In 1994, a bimetallic 10 dollar coin was introduced.

Starting in 1993, prior to the establishment of the SAR, coins with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]'s portrait were gradually withdrawn from circulation. Most of the notes and coins in circulations feature Hong Kong's ''[[Bauhinia blakeana|Bauhinia]]'' flower or other symbols. Coins with the Queen's portrait are still legal tender and can be seen, but these are slowly being phased out. However, most still remain in legal tender and are in circulation.

Because the redesign was highly sensitive with regard to political and economic reasons, the designing process of the new coins could not be entrusted to an artist but was undertaken by [[Joseph Yam]], Chief Executive of the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]], himself who found in the bauhinia the requested "politically neutral design" and did a secret scissors and paste job.<ref>Joseph Yam's Viewpoint article, 18 November 1999, [http://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/publications-and-research/reference-materials/viewpoint/19991118.shtml  ''Joseph Yam's coin designs'']</ref>

In 1997, to commemorate the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|Hong Kong transfer of sovereignty from Britain to the PRC]], the government issued new one dollar coins which depicted a dragon and 19 and 97 on each side of the dragon.

==Banknotes==

{{Economy of Hong Kong}}
{{main|Banknotes of the Hong Kong dollar}}

The issue of Hong Kong dollar notes is governed today by the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]] (HKMA), the governmental currency board of Hong Kong. Under licence from the HKMA, three [[commercial bank]]s issue their own banknotes for general circulation in the region. Notes are also issued by the HKMA itself. In most countries of the world the issue of banknotes is handled exclusively by a single [[central bank]] or government. The arrangements in Hong Kong are unusual but not unique; a comparable system is used in the [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|United Kingdom]], where seven banks issue banknotes.

In 1845, the first private bank, the [[Oriental Bank Corporation|Oriental Bank]], was founded. However, banknotes were not produced until the 1860s, when the Oriental Bank, the [[Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China]] and the [[Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation|Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Company]] began issuing notes. Denominations issued in the 1860s and 1870s included 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 dollars. These notes were not accepted by the Treasury for payment of government dues and [[tax]]es, although they were accepted for use by merchants. 25 dollar notes did not survive beyond the end of the 19th century, whilst the 1 dollar notes (only produced by the [[HSBC]]) were issued until 1935.

Under the Currency Ordinance of 1935, banknotes in denominations of 5 dollars and above issued by the three authorised local banks, (the Mercantile Bank of India Limited, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, were all declared legal tender. The government took over production of 1 dollar notes. In 1941, the government introduced notes for 1, 5 and 10 cents due to the difficulty of transporting coins to Hong Kong caused by the [[Second World War]] (a ship carrying 1941 1 cent coins was sunk, making this unissued coin very rare). Just before the [[Japan]]ese occupation, an emergency issue of 1 dollar notes was made consisting of overprinted Bank of China 5 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] notes.

In 1945, paper money production resumed essentially unaltered from before the war, with the government issuing 1, 5 and 10 cents, and 1 dollar notes, and the three banks issuing 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 dollar notes. 1 dollar notes were replaced by coins in 1960, with only the 1 cent note issued by the government after 1965.

In 1975, the 5 dollar notes were replaced by a coin, whilst 1000 dollar notes were introduced in 1977. The Mercantile Bank was absorbed by the HSBC in 1978 and ceased issuing notes. In 1985, 20 dollar notes were introduced, whilst, in 1993, a 10 dollar coin was introduced and the banks stopped issuing 10 dollar notes. In 1994 the HKMA gave authority to the [[Bank of China]] to issue notes.

After a less-than-successful trial from 1994 to 2002 to move the 10-dollar denomination from the banknote format (issued by the banks) to the coin format (Government-issued), 10 dollar banknotes are currently the only denomination issued by the HKMA, having acquired the note printing plant at Tai Po from the [[De La Rue|De La Rue Group]] of the UK on behalf of the Government. The older 10-dollar banknotes are, although rare and being phased out, still circulating.

A commemorative polymer ten dollar note was issued in July 2007 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China.<ref>{{cite web | author=Nachthund | date=7 January 2007 | url=http://www.nachthund.biz/CatalogUpdate/HongKong/HK0107-01.html | title=Update – Hong Kong. | accessdate=19 January 2007}}</ref>  The new notes will circulate along with other issues for a trial period of two years, though the initial batch released was largely snapped up by collectors.<ref>{{cite web | author=HKMA | date=12 March 2007 | url=http://www.info.gov.hk/hkma/eng/press/2007/attach/20070312e3a.pdf| title= General Information on the Hong Kong Ten Dollar Polymer Note | accessdate=13 March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=HKMA | date=23 June 2007 | url=http://www.info.gov.hk/hkma/eng/polymer/index.htm| title=Hong Kong Ten Dollar Polymer Note | accessdate=25 June 2007}}</ref>

A new series of banknotes was issued starting in 2010.<ref>http://www.info.gov.hk/hkma/eng/press/2010/20100720e4_index.htm</ref>

==Linked exchange rate system==
{{main|Linked exchange rate}}
{{Most traded currencies}}
The primary monetary policy objective of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is to maintain exchange rate stability within the framework of the linked exchange rate system through sound management of the Exchange Fund, monetary operations and other means deemed necessary.

The important underpinnings of the linked exchange rate system include the strong official reserves of Hong Kong, a sound and robust banking system, fiscal prudence and a flexible economic structure.

In 2007, [[Jim Rogers]], a former partner in [[George Soros]]'s [[Quantum Group of Funds|Quantum Fund]], said the Government should abolish the Hong Kong dollar and adopt the [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] as the official currency of the territory when the [[renminbi]] is freely convertible.<ref>{{Cite news

'''Romagna''' ([[Romagnol language|Romagnol]]: ''Rumâgna'') is an [[Italy|Italian]] historical region that approximately corresponds to the south-eastern portion of present-day [[Emilia-Romagna]]. Traditionally, it is limited by the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] to the south-west, the [[Adriatic]] to the east, and the rivers [[River Reno|Reno]] and [[Sillaro]] to the north and west. The region's major cities include [[Cesena]], [[Faenza]], [[Forlì]], [[Imola]], [[Ravenna]], [[Rimini]] and [[City of San Marino]] ([[San Marino]] is a landlocked state inside the Romagna historical region). The region has been recently formally expanded with the transfer of seven [[comune|comuni]] ([[Casteldelci]], [[Maiolo]], [[Novafeltria]], [[Pennabilli]], [[San Leo]], [[Sant'Agata Feltria]], [[Talamello]]) from the [[Marche]] region,<ref>[http://www.corriere.it/politica/09_luglio_29/comuni_passaggio_marche_emilia_afb09444-7c4c-11de-bec1-00144f02aabc.shtml Marche addio: all'Emilia Romagna sette Comuni dell'Alta Valmarecchia] Corriere della Sera, July 29, 2009 (in [[Italian language|Italian]])</ref> which are a small number of comuni where [[Emiliano-Romagnolo|Romagnolo dialect]] is spoken.
[[File:Romagna.png|thumb|right|300px| Map of Romagna, showing its administrative divisions (new territories not shown)]]

==Etymology==
The name ''Romagna'' comes from the Latin name ''Romània'', which originally was the generic name for "land inhabited by Romans", and first appeared on Latin documents in the 5th century.
It later took on the more detailed meaning of "territory subjected to [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] rule", whose citizens called themselves Romans (''Romàioi'' in Greek).
Thus the term ''Romània'' came to be used to refer to the territory administered by the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] in contrast to other parts of [[Northern Italy]] under [[Lombards|Lombard]] rule, named ''Langobardia'' or ''[[Lombardy]]''.
''Romània'' later became ''Romandìola'' in [[Vulgar Latin]], meaning "little Romània", which became ''Romagna'' in modern times.<ref>[http://www.rionemadonnadellestuoie.it/documenti/storia/romania_e_romagna.htm Romània e Romagna] Rione Madonna delle stuoie (in [[Italian language|Italian]])</ref>

==History==

===Prehistory===
A number of [[archaeological site]]s in the region, such as [[Monte Poggiolo]], show that Romagna has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic]] age.

===Umbri and Gauls===
The [[Umbri]], speaking an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[Italic language]] called [[Umbrian]], are the first traceable inhabitants of the region. The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]s also dwelt in some portions of Romagna.

In the 5th Century BC, various [[Gaul]]ish tribes, most notably the [[Lingones]], [[Senoni]] and [[Boii]], moved south into [[Italy]], and [[Battle of the Allia|sacked Rome]] in 390 BC. The Senoni utterly subjugated the Umbri and settled in Romagna. The Senoni extended further south to [[Ancona]], with their capital ''Sena Gallica'' ([[Senigallia]]). The lands formerly inhabited by the Senoni were known as ''ager Gallicus'' (Gallic plain) to the Romans.

According to the Italian [[linguistics|linguist]] Giacomo Devoto, there are still a number of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] [[substratum|substrata]] in the [[Emiliano-Romagnolo|Romagnolo dialect]].

===Roman Republic===
The Gaul predominance in the region was consistently challenged by the Romans. In the [[battle of Telamon]], the Romans defeated the joint forces of the Celtic tribes, thus achieving a [[hegemony]] over the new [[Roman Province]] of [[Cisalpine Gaul]] centred at Mutina ([[Modena]]).

After the [[Second Punic War]], the pro-[[Carthage|Carthaginian]] [[Lingones]] and [[Senoni]] were expelled. To consolidate the Roman rule in the region, the [[Via Aemilia]] was built from Ariminium (Rimini) to Piacentia ([[Piacenza]]), and a series of [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colonies]] were founded. The most significant ones are Forum Livii (Forlì), Forum Cornelii (Imola) and Forum Popili ([[Forlimpopoli]]). After the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]], the [[Lex Julia]] was introduced in 90 BC, and [[Roman citizenship]] was granted to all [[municipia]] south of the [[River Po]].

In the first [[Roman civil wars|Roman civil war]], between [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], most cities in the regions supported [[Gaius Marius|Marius]]. As a result, Forum Livii and [[Cesena|Caesena]] were razed to ground, and the region was looted by [[Sulla]]'s army.

During the [[first triumvirate]], the [[Roman Republic]] was divided along the infamous [[Rubicon]]. Most of modern Romagna was ruled by [[Julius Caesar]], the notable exception of [[Rimini|Ariminium]], which is south of the river. In 49 BC, Caesar, who was residing in Ravenna then, led the [[Legio XIII]] across the Rubicon and ignited [[Caesar's civil war]].

===Roman Empire===
After the decisive [[battle of Actium]], [[Augustus]] started a century-long era of ''[[Pax Romana]]''. All of [[Cisalpine Gaul]] had been incorporated into [[Italia (Roman province)|the Roman province of Italia]]. Around 7 BC, Augustus divided all of [[Italia (Roman province)|Italy]] into eleven ''regiones'', and most of Romagna (except [[Rimini]]) was in the eighth, ''Aemilia''.

By the beginning of the 3rd Century, [[Diocletian]] re-divided the Empire into four [[prefecture]]s, each divided into [[diocese]]s, and into [[provinces]]. Under the new system, Italy was demoted to a mere Imperial province. Modern Romagna was organized into the [[Roman province]] of ''Flaminia et Picenum'' in the [[diocese of Italia Annonaria]].

Steadily Ravenna, which was surrounded by swamps and marshes, prospered and rose in importance, and a [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]]  was based at the city. It had developed into a major port on the [[Adriatic]]. However, in 330, the capital of the Empire was transferred to [[Constantinople]], so with the fleet that stationed at Ravenna, thus weakened the coastal defence in the [[Adriatic]].

===Germanic migrations and Exarchate of Ravenna===
Stepping into the 5th Century, the [[Migration Period|Germanic migrations]] into the Empire further intensified. In 402, [[Honorius (emperor)|Emperor Honorius]] even moved the [[Western Roman Empire]]'s capital from [[Mediolanum]] to Ravenna, mainly because of the region's defensive terrain. 8 years later, [[Alaric I]] of the [[Visigoths]] looted Rome. In 476, [[Odoacer]] deposed [[Romulus Augustus]] in Ravenna, thus marked an end to the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]].

Encouraged by [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]], [[Theodoric the Great]] led the [[Ostrogoths]] into Italy. He entered Ravenna and murdered [[Odoacer]] in 493, establishing a [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|twofold kingdom]] of the Romans and Goths. Under the Ostrogoths Italy was partly restored to its former prosperity.

In 535 [[Justinian I]] initiated the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]]. It was fought for 20 years, and bitterly the Ostrogoths were finally subjugated. The peninsula, depopulated and devastated, was ruled by an [[Exarchate of Ravenna|exarch]] from Ravenna. However, Imperial authority was maintained for barely more than a decade. In 568 new [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]]s, namely the Lombards, entered Italy and established their capital at [[Pavia]]. The Empire could barely defend the region around Ravenna and Rome, connected by a narrow strip of land passing through [[Perugia]], as well as a series of coastal cities. The Imperial frontier retreated to [[Bologna]].

In 727 the Lombard King [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] renewed the war against the Byzantines, taking most of Romagna and besieged Ravenna itself. They were returned to the Byzantines in 730. In 737 the king entered Romagna once more and took Ravenna. The exarch, [[Eutychius (exarch)|Eutychius]], retook the region in 740, with [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] assistance. Eventually another Lombard king, [[Aistulf]], conquered Romagna and marked an end to the exarchate in 751.

===Papal rule===
[[Image:Piazza Saffi.jpg|thumb|right|Piazza Saffi, Forlì.]]
The Romagna was officially ceded to the Papal States by [[Rudolf I of Germany]] in 1278. However, the Papal control over it remained scanty and often nominal for much of the following centuries. The area was divided among a series of regional lords, like the [[Ordelaffi]] of Forlì and the [[House of Malatesta|Malatesta]] of Rimini, many of them naturally adhering to the [[Ghibelline]] party in natural opposition to the pro-papal [[Guelphs]]. This situation started to change in the late 15th century, when after their return to Rome stronger popes progressively reasserted their authority in the fragemented region. Other powers also seized various part of Romagna, including Venice and most notably the [[Republic of Florence]] which expanded up to Forlì and Cervia, building the famous city-fortress of [[Terra del Sole]]. The Florentine Romagna remained part of [[Tuscany]] until the 1920s.

In 1500 [[Cesare Borgia]], illegitimate son of Pope [[Alexander VI]], carved for himself an ephemeral Duchy of Romagna, but his lands were reabsorbed into the Papal States after his fall. The [[Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis]] divided Romagna between the [[Farnese family]], the [[Duchy of Parma and Piacenza]], the [[House of Este]] of [[Duchy of Ferrara|Ferrara]], the [[Duchy of Modena and Reggio]], and the Papal States.

This situation lasted until the [[Napoleonic Wars|French invasion]] of 1796, which brought tragic feats (massacre of [[Lugo, Emilia-Romagna|Lugo]], looting, heavy taxation, abolition of Cesena University) but also innovative ideas in social and political fields. During the Napoleonic rule Romagna received for the first time recognition, with the creation of the provinces of the Pino (Ravenna) and Rubicone (Forlì). When in 1815 the [[Congress of Vienna]] re-established the pre-war situation, secret anti-Papal societies were formed, and riots broke out in 1820, 1830–31 and 1848.

This opposition was fuelled by the [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzini]]an propaganda and the direct action of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]. Men like [[Felice Orsini]], [[Piero Maroncelli]] and [[Aurelio Saffi]] were among the protagonists of the Italian [[Risorgimento]].

===In a re-united Italy===
However, after joining the re[[unification of Italy]] in 1860, Romagna did not receive a separate status by the Savoy monarchs, who were afraid of dangerous destabilizing tendencies in the wake of the popular figures cited above.

In the early 20th century the autonomy of Romagna was advocated by [[Aldo Spallicci]], [[Giuseppe Fuschini]], [[Emilio Lussu]] and others. A movement proposing separation from [[Emilia-Romagna]] was created in the 1990s.

'''Paxi''' or '''Paxoi''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ?????, pronounced {{IPAc-en|p|æ|k|?|s|i:|}} in English and {{IPA-el|p?k?si|}} in Greek) is the smallest group of [[Ionian Islands]] (the Heptanese). In Greek it is a plural form. The largest islands are '''Paxos''' and nearby '''[[Antipaxos]]'''. Antipaxos is famous for its wine and two of the finest sand beaches in the Ionian Sea. The main town of Paxoi, and the seat of the municipality, is [[Gaios]].<ref name=Kallikratis>[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}</ref> In [[Greek mythology]], [[Poseidon]] created the island by striking [[Corfu]] with his [[trident]], so that he and wife [[Amphitrite]] could have some peace and quiet.

==History==
Although it was possibly inhabited from prehistoric times, the [[Phoenicians]] are traditionally held to have been the first settlers on Paxos. The name is believed to be derived from ''Pax'', which meant ''trapezoidal'' in their language.<ref name=paxist>{{cite web|url=http://www.paxi.gr/2008/index.php?lang=1&page=2&article=2|work=Paxos Island: Municipality of Paxos|title=??????? |language=Greek|date= 30 November 1999 | accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] ruled the island from the 2nd century BC, and during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period and [[Middle Ages]] it was constantly attacked by pirates. After various rulers and [[Crusade]]rs had passed through, the island was taken by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] at the end of the 14th century.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]], the [[Ionian Islands]] were taken by the [[France|French]] and the Russo-Turkish alliance.  On 13 February 1814, the island of Paxos surrendered to the [[Royal Navy]] [[sailing frigate|frigate]] [[HMS Apollo (1805)|HMS ''Apollo'']] and 160 troops from the 2nd Greek Light Infantry from [[Cephalonia]] and the 35th Regiment of the Royal Corsican Rangers. In 1815, [[United Kingdom]] established the [[Ionian Union]]. In 1864, together with the rest of the [[Heptanese]], Paxos was ceded to [[Greece]].

==Geography==
The island is approximately eight miles ({{convert|8|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) in length and tipped up towards the west. The west coast is dominated by steep white, chalky cliffs that are greatly eroded at sea level, and harbour many 'blue caves', which can be explored on launches departing from [[Gaios]]. Much of the attractive landscape is still covered in olive groves. These stretch from [[Lakka, Greece|Lakka]], the harbour community in the north, through [[Magazia, Greece|Magazia]] to [[Gaios]], the capital. Olive oil making, soap manufacture and fishing were supplanted by tourism as the main industry in the mid sixties, resulting in a construction boom, which has greatly altered the coastline around Gaios, the capital of the Paxiot ''demos'' (community). There are ferry and jetfoil connections daily with Kerkyra (Corfu) and with the mainland at Parga. Excursions to Albania (the resort of Saranda and the magnificent Greco-Roman settlement of Butrint) can also be arranged with the local jetfoil operators.

==Province==
[[File:Paxos gaios town bgiu.jpg|thumb|Gaios town]]

The province of Paxoi ({{lang-el|??????? ?????}}) was one of the [[provinces of Greece|provinces]] of the Corfu Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipality Paxoi.<ref name=census91>{{PDFlink|[http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00086.pdf Detailed census results 1991]|39&nbsp;MB}} {{el icon}} {{fr icon}}</ref> It was abolished in 2006.

==Foreign residents==
Among well known semi-permanent British inhabitants were [[Audrey Good]], former commander of the UN refugee bases in [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] following the [[Greek Civil War]], the late actor [[Peter Bull]] (author of 'It isn't all Greek to me') and actress [[Susannah York]]. Some members of the [[Agnelli family]] (of [[FIAT]] fame) have built a palatial holiday home—complete with ''faux'' medieval tower—on a small island ([[Kaltonisi]]) situated near the southernmost tip ('the heel') of Paxos, close to the popular beach of [[Mongonissi]]. The presence of such residents, and the development of the coastal area (mostly by [[Italy|Italian]] nationals) explains why Paxos has now become one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in Greece. One of Loggos's landmarks, the so-called 'Manor House' was put on sale for 1.6M€ in 2006.

Paxos is part of a European network called [[Cultural Village of Europe]]. It hosts a yearly classical music festival (founded by John Gough, and now organised by the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama|Guildhall]]), which attracts some of [[Europe]]'s finest young performers. This festival usually takes place in late August/early September, however the 2010 festival is in doubt as sponsorship cannot be determined. Concerts are usually held in the now-disused school of [[Longos, Paxoi]].

==Transport==
[[File:Corfu tourists boarding ship bgiu.jpg|thumb|Tourists boarding the Ilida hydrofoil at the new port of Corfu, bound for Paxi]]

The island is serviced by hydrofoils and ferry boats from the mainland [[Greece]] port of [[Igoumenitsa]] (1.5 hours), hydrofoil boats from [[Corfu]] (1 hour) and from [[Bari]] and [[Brindisi]] (4 hours). There is no airport but there was a privately owned seaplane service (7 minutes from [[Corfu]] town) operated by [[AirSea Lines]]. As of late 2009, this service is no-longer operational.

==Dialect==
A dialect is spoken resembling that of Corfu and having a similar prosody. It is heavily influenced by Italian. There is a [http://www.translatum.gr/etexts/bogdanos/paxos-glossary.htm glossary of Paxiot expressions].

==Trivia==
In his scientific article ''The Part-Time Parliament'', Leslie Lamport created his [[Paxos algorithm]] for distributed voting, inventing a Greek society on the Aegean island ''Paxos'' as a whimsical illustration of an otherwise dry subject. He later admitted that the allegory was a dismal failure, in that it failed to pique readers' interest in the underlying material.<ref name=Lamport>[http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#lamport-paxos Lamports Writings]</ref>

The Paxos Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) is a small Anglo-Greek charity, dating from 2005 and registered in the UK, whose purpose is to improve the plight of animals on this beautiful Greek island. It has succeeded in making a substantial difference. Working closely with the municipality, it has established a new permanent surgery at Magazia, which was opened by the mayor in September 2013.<ref name=PAWS>[http://www.pawspaxos.com PAWS]</ref>

The '''New Taiwan dollar''' has been the [[currency]] of [[Taiwan]] since 1949, when it replaced the [[Old Taiwan dollar]]. Originally issued by the [[Bank of Taiwan]], it has been issued by the [[Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan)]] since 2000. The [[currency code]] '''TWD''' and common abbreviation '''NT$'''.

==Etymology==
The Chinese term equivalent to "New Taiwan dollar," {{linktext|?|?|?}} or {{linktext|?|?|?}}, is used only in contexts where it is necessary to avoid any ambiguity, such as banking, contracts, or foreign exchange. In common usage, the unit is typically referred to as ''[[Chinese yuan|yuán]]''. In Taiwan, the [[Chinese character|character]] for yuan can be written in either of two forms, an informal ? or a formal ?, which are interchangeable. Colloquial alternatives for the currency unit include the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] ''kuài'' (?), meaning "piece", and the [[Taiwanese Minnan]] ''kho?'' (? ; literally "circle"). In English usage the new Taiwan dollar is often abbreviated as NT, NT$, NT Dollar or NTD, while the abbreviation TWD is typically used in the context of foreign exchange rates. Subdivisions of a new Taiwan dollar are rarely used, since practically all products on the consumer market are sold in whole dollars.

==History==
The New Taiwan dollar was first issued by the Bank of Taiwan on June 15, 1949, to replace the [[Old Taiwan dollar]] at a ratio of 40,000 to one. The first goal of the New Taiwan dollar was to end the [[hyperinflation]] that had plagued Nationalist China due to the [[Chinese Civil War]]. After the communists captured Beijing in January, the Nationalists began to retreat to Taiwan. China's gold reserve was moved to Taiwan in February.

Even though the New Taiwan dollar was the [[de facto currency]] of Taiwan, for years the silver yuan remained the legal currency. The value of the silver yuan was decoupled from the value of silver during World War II. Many older statutes have fines and fees given in this currency.

According to statute, three New Taiwan dollars is worth one silver yuan.<ref>''[[s:Regulation of exchange rate between new Taiwan dollars and the fiat currency in the ROC laws]]</ref> Despite decades of inflation, this ratio has not been adjusted. This made the silver yuan a purely notational currency long ago, nearly impossible to buy, sell, or use.

In July 2000, the New Taiwan dollar became Taiwan's legal currency. It is no longer secondary to the silver yuan. At this time, the central bank began issuing New Taiwan dollar banknotes, and the notes issued earlier by the Bank of Taiwan were taken out of circulation.

The exchange rate compared to the [[United States dollar]] has varied from less than ten to one in the mid-1950s, more than forty to one in the 1960s, and about twenty-five to one in 1992. The exchange rate as of October 2013 is 29.4 to one.<ref>{{cite web|last=Google Finance|title=US Dollar / New Taiwan Dollar|url=http://www.google.com/finance?q=USDTWD|publisher=Google|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>

Coins are minted by the [[Central Mint of China]], while notes are printed by the [[China Engraving and Printing Works]]. Both are run by the Central Bank. The NT$½ coin is rare because of its low value, while the NT$20 coin is rare because of the government's lack of willingness to promote it. As of 2010, the cost of the raw materials in a NT$½ coin is worth more than the face value of the coin.

===Remarks===
# "????XX?" = "[[Minguo calendar|Minguo]] XX". "????" is also the state title "[[Taiwan|Republic of China]]".
# "????" = "[[Mona Rudao]]", anti-Japanese leader at the [[Wushe Incident]].

==Banknotes==
{{main|Fifth series of the new Taiwan dollar banknote}}
The current series of banknotes for the new Taiwan dollar began circulation in July 2000. This set was introduced when the new Taiwan dollar succeeded the silver yuan as the official currency within Taiwan.

The current set includes banknotes for NT$100, NT$200, NT$500, NT$1000, and NT$2000. Note that the NT$200 and NT$2000 banknotes are not commonly used by consumers. This may be due to the tendencies of consumers to simply use multiple NT$100 or NT$500 bills to cover the range of the NT$200, as well as using NT$1000 bills or credit/debit cards instead of the NT$2000 bill. Lack of government promotion may also be a contributing factor to the general lack of usage.

It is relatively easy for the government to disseminate these denominations through various government bodies that do official business with the citizens, such as the post office, the tax authority, or state owned banks. There is also a conspiracy theory against the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], the ruling party at the time the two denominations were issued. The conspiracy states that putting [[Chiang Kai-shek]] on a rarely used banknote would "practically" remove him from the currency, while "nominally" including him on the currency would not upset supporters on the other side of the political spectrum that much (the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]]).

[[Image:Taiwan 100 2011.01.06 text.jpg|NT$100_20110106]]<BR>
On 6 January 2011, the Central Bank issued a new 100-dollar legal tender circulating commemorative in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. The red paper note measures 145 × 70&nbsp;mm and features a portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen on the front, and the Chung-Shan Building on the back. The design is no different from the ordinary NT$100 note, except for the wording in Chinese language in the reverse of the note, which reads: “Celebrating the 100 years of founding of the Republic of China.”<ref>{{cite news |author= The Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) |title= Issue a commemorative NT$100 banknote for circulation and uncut commemorative NT$100 currency sheets in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China on January 6, 2011 |url= http://www.cbc.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=37761&ctNode=752&mp=2 |date=2011-01-06 }}</ref>

'''Investigative journalism''' is a form of [[journalism]] in which reporters deeply investigate a single topic of interest, such as serious crimes, [[political corruption]], or corporate wrongdoing. An investigative journalist may spend months or years researching and preparing a report. Investigative journalism is a [[primary source]] of information. <!--The source says "primary sources" include "investigative reports" but it doesn't say by whom!--><!--The source doesn't sound like it explicitly says investigative journalism is primary source?--><!--The source doesn't sound like it explicitly says investigative journalism is primary source? If you are citing the book, just cite the book--><!--The source doesn't sound like it explicitly says investigative journalism is primary source?-->Most investigative journalism is conducted by [[newspapers]], [[wire service]]s, and [[freelance]] journalists. Practitioners sometimes use the terms "[[watchdog journalism]]" (though that has a broader meaning) or "accountability reporting".

An investigative reporter may make use of one or more of these tools, among others, on a single story:

* Analysis of documents, such as [[lawsuit]]s and other [[legal document]]s, tax records, government reports, regulatory reports, and corporate financial filings
* Databases of public records
*Investigation of technical issues, including scrutiny of government and business practices and their effects
* Research into social and legal issues
* Subscription research sources such as [[LexisNexis]]
* Numerous interviews with on-the-record sources as well as, in some instances, interviews with [[anonymous source]]s (for example [[whistleblower]]s)
* Federal or state [[Freedom of Information Act]]s to obtain documents and data from government agencies

== Professional definitions ==
[[University of Missouri]] journalism professor Steve Weinberg defined investigative journalism as: "Reporting, through one's own initiative and work product, matters of importance to readers, viewers, or listeners."<ref>Steve Weinberg, ''The Reporter's Handbook: An Investigator's Guide to Documents and Techniques'', St. Martin's Press, 1996</ref> In many cases, the subjects of the reporting wish the matters under scrutiny to remain undisclosed. There are currently university departments for teaching investigative journalism. Conferences are conducted presenting peer reviewed research into investigative journalism.

British media theorist [[Hugo de Burgh]] (2000) states that: "An investigative journalist is a man or woman whose profession it is to discover the truth and to identify lapses from it in whatever media may be available. The act of doing this generally is called investigative journalism and is distinct from apparently similar work done by police, lawyers, auditors, and regulatory bodies in that it is not limited as to target, not legally founded and closely connected to publicity."<ref>Investigative Journalism: Context and Practice, Hugo de Burgh (ed), Routledge, London and New York, 2000</ref>

Founded by the [[Laskaris]] family,<ref name="A. Heurtley, H. C page 55"/> it lasted from 1204 to 1261, when the Nicaean recovery of Constantinople re-established the Byzantine Empire.

==History==

===Foundation===
In 1204, [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Alexius V|Alexius V Ducas Murtzouphlos]] fled [[Constantinople]] after [[Fourth Crusade|crusaders]] invaded the city. [[Theodore I Lascaris]], the son-in-law of Emperor [[Alexius III Angelus]], was proclaimed emperor, but he too fled, to the city of Nicaea (today [[?znik]]) in [[Bithynia]], realizing the situation in Constantinople was hopeless.

The [[Latin Empire]], established by the Crusaders in Constantinople, had poor control over former Byzantine territory, and Byzantine [[successor state]]s sprang up in [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]], and Nicaea. Trebizond had broken away as an independent state a few weeks before the fall of Constantinople. Nicaea, however, was the closest to the Latin Empire and was in the best position to attempt to re-establish the Byzantine Empire.

Theodore Lascaris was not immediately successful, as he was defeated at Poemanenum and Prusa (now [[Bursa, Turkey|Bursa]]) in 1204, but he was able to capture much of northwestern [[Anatolia]] after the Latin Emperor [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Baldwin I]] had to defend against invasions from [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]]. Theodore also defeated an army from Trebizond, as well as other minor rivals, leaving him in charge of the most powerful of the successor states. In 1206, Theodore proclaimed himself emperor at Nicaea.

Numerous truces and alliances were formed and broken over the next few years, as the Byzantine successor states, the Latin Empire, the [[Bulgaria]]ns, and the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuks]] of [[Iconium]] (whose territory also bordered Nicaea) fought each other. In 1211, at [[Battle of Antioch on the Meander|Antioch on the Meander]], Theodore defeated a major invasion by the Seljuks, who were backing a bid by [[Alexios III]] to return to power. The losses suffered at Antioch, however, led to a defeat at the hands of the Latin Empire at the [[Battle of the Rhyndacus (1211)|Rhyndacus River]] and the loss of most of [[Mysia]] and the [[Marmara Sea]] coast in the subsequent [[Treaty of Nymphaeum (1214)|Treaty of Nymphaeum]]. The Nicaeans were compensated for this territorial loss when, in 1212, the death of [[David Komnenos]] allowed their annexation of his lands in [[Paphlagonia]].<ref name="''Cambridge Medieval History'', p. 547">{{harvnb|Abulafia|McKitterick|1999|p=547}}.</ref>

Theodore tried to validate his claim to the imperial throne by naming a new [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] in Nicaea. In 1219, he married the daughter of Latin Empress [[Yolanda of Flanders]], but he died in 1222 and was succeeded by his son-in-law [[John III Ducas Vatatzes]].

===Expansion===
[[File:Lefke Kapisi Iznik 932a.jpg|thumb|250px| Nicaea city wall, Lefke gate; [[Iznik]], [[Turkey]]]]

The accession of Vatatzes was initially challenged by the Laskarids, with the ''[[sebastokrator]]es'' Isaac and Alexios, brothers of Theodore I, seeking the aid of the Latin Empire. Vatatzes prevailed over their combined forces, however, in the [[Battle of Poimanenon]], securing his throne and regaining almost all of the Asian territories held by the Latin Empire in the process.

In 1224, the Latin [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] was captured by the [[Despot of Epirus]], but Epirus itself came under Bulgarian control in 1230. With Trebizond lacking any real power, Nicaea was the only Byzantine state left, and John III expanded his territory across the [[Aegean Sea]]. In 1235, he allied with [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]], allowing him to extend his influence over [[Thessalonica]] and Epirus.

In 1242, the [[Mongols]] invaded Seljuk territory to the east of Nicaea, and although John III was worried they might attack him next, they ended up eliminating the Seljuk threat to Nicaea. In 1245, John allied with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by marrying [[Constance II of Hohenstaufen]], daughter of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. By 1248, John had defeated the Bulgarians and surrounded the Latin Empire. He continued to take land from the Latins until his death in 1254.

[[Theodore II Lascaris]], John III's son, faced invasions from the Bulgarians in [[Thrace]], but successfully defended the territory. Epirus also revolted and allied with [[Manfred of Sicily]], and Theodore II died in 1258. [[John IV Lascaris]] succeeded him, but as he was still a child he was under the regency of the general Michael Palaeologus. Michael proclaimed himself co-emperor (as [[Michael VIII Palaeologus|Michael VIII]]) in 1259, and soon defeated a combined invasion by Manfred, the Despot of Epirus, and the Latin [[Principality of Achaea|Prince of Achaea]] at the [[Battle of Pelagonia]].

===Recapture of Constantinople===
[[File:Hyperpyron-Michael VIII Paleologus-sb2241.jpg|thumb|250px|Coin issued by [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]] to celebrate the liberation of Constantinople from the Latin army, and the restoration of the Roman/Byzantine Empire.]]
In [[Siege of Constantinople (1260)|1260]], Michael began the assault on Constantinople itself, which his predecessors had been unable to do. He allied with [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], and his general [[Alexios Strategopoulos]] spent months observing Constantinople in order to plan his attack. In July 1261, as most of the Latin army was fighting elsewhere, Alexius was able to convince the guards to open the gates of the city. Once inside he burned the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] quarter (as Venice was an enemy of Genoa, and had been largely responsible for the capture of the city in 1204).

Michael was recognized as emperor a few weeks later, restoring the Byzantine Empire. Achaea was soon recaptured, but Trebizond and Epirus remained independent Byzantine Greek states. The restored empire also faced a new threat from the [[Ottoman Empire]], when it arose to replace the defeated Seljuks.

==Military==
The Nicaean Empire consisted of Byzantium's most highly populated Greek region, with the exception of Thrace which was under Latin/Bulgar control. As such, the Empire was able to raise a reasonably numerous military force of around 20,000 soldiers at its height – numbers recorded as participating in its numerous wars against the Crusader states.

The Nicaeans continued some aspects of the [[Komnenian army]], but without the resources available to the Komnenian emperors the Nicaean Byzantines could not match the numbers, nor the quality, of the armies that the emperor [[Manuel Komnenos|Manuel]] and his predecessors had fielded. Western Asia Minor had access to the sea, making it wealthier than most of the splinter states around and in time became the most powerful state in the region, if only for a short period.

==Ideology and Hellenism==
{{Anatolian History timeline infobox}}
Some scholars see the Nicene empire period as an indication of rising ethnic Hellenic consciousness and Greek nationalism. However, these scholars caution that a rise in ethnic consciousness did not have an impact on the official imperial ideology.<ref name="Angelov, Dimiter 1330. p95">Angelov, Dimiter. Imperial ideology and political thought in Byzantium (1204–1330. Cambridge, UK New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007.  p95 Also Kaldellis, Anthony. Hellenism in Byzantium : the transformations of Greek identity and the reception of the classical tradition. Cambridge, UK New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007.</ref> In the official ideology, the traditional Byzantine view of Byzantium as the successor of Rome was not overturned, as the usage of the word Rhomaioi for subjects of the Nicene emperors demonstrates.<ref name="Angelov, Dimiter 1330. p95"/> The official ideology of the Nicene Empire was one of reconquest and militarism, which was not to be seen in later 14th-century Palaiologan rhetoric.<ref>Angelov,  99–101</ref> The ideology of 13th-century Nicaea was characterized by belief in the continued significance of Constantinople and the hope to recapture the city, drawing less on claims of political universalism or Hellenic nationalism than on Old Testament ideas of Jewish providence.  The emperor in this period is frequently compared to [[Moses]]<ref>Angold, Michael. A Byzantine government in exile : government and society under the Laskarids of Nicaea, 1204–1261. London: Oxford University Press, 1975.   p13</ref> or [[Zorobabel]], or even as the “[[pillar of fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]]” that guides God’s people to the Promised Land, e.g. in a speech delivered by [[Theodore I Laskaris]], written by [[Niketas Choniates]].<ref>Angelov, 99</ref>

The rhetoric of this period also glorified war and the reconquest of Constantinople using images not drawn from the Old Testament. For example, in his panegyric of Theodore I Laskarsis, Choniates describes a battle with a Seljuk sultan as a battle between Christianity and Islam, rhetorically comparing the wounds of Theodore, who had himself slain an enemy commander, to those of Christ on the cross.<ref name="Angelov, 100">Angelov, 100</ref> Dimiter Angelov suggests that western crusading ideology may have influenced the development of this view on reconquest, and during this period there is mention that Patriarch Michael IV Autoreianos offered full remission of sins to Nicene troops about to enter battle, a practice almost identical to a western [[plenary indulgence]].  However, the granting of such indulgences was short lived, and many of the possible crusader influences seem to have dropped off after 1211.<ref name="Angelov, 100"/>

The Byzantines of the 13th century also drew parallels between the situation of the empire after 1204 and that of Classical Greeks. This evidence has helped to strengthen the view of some scholars, such as A. E. Vacalopoulos, who see these references, combined with a re-evaluation of Byzantium's classical past, to be the genesis of Greek nationalism.<ref>Angold, Michael. "Byzantine ‘Nationalism’ and the Nicaean Empire." Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies 1 (1975) p51-52</ref> With the loss of Constantinople, this comparison played on the idea of [[Names of the Greeks|"Hellenes"]] surrounded by barbarians; Choniates equated the Seljuk sultan killed by Theodore I with Xerxes, and patriarch [[Patriarch Germanus II of Constantinople|Germanos II]] recalled the victory of [[John III Vatatzes]] as another battle of [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] or [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]].<ref>Angold, 29</ref> In much the same way, [[Theodore II Laskaris]] compared his father's victories to those of [[Alexander the Great]] and proceeded to extol the martial values of contemporary "Hellenes".<ref>Angelov 97</ref>

In addition, during this period there seems to have been a shift in how the word "Hellene" was used in Byzantine parlance. Up to this point, "Hellene" had borne a negative connotation and was in particular associated with the remnants of paganism. In this period, however, both the terms "Graikoi" and "Hellenes" appear to enter into the diplomatic usage of the empire as a form of religious and ethnic self-identification, spurred by a desire to differentiate the empire and its citizens from the Latins.<ref>Angelov 96–97</ref> [[Patriarch Germanus II of Constantinople]] in particular exemplifies this new vision of ethnic and religious identity. His letters equate good birth with the purity of his Hellenistic ancestry, placing more value in his Hellenistic linguistic and ethnic background than in any association with Constantinople, and showing his contempt for the Latins who prided themselves on possessing the city. There is a debate among scholars regarding the exact timing of the shift in meaning of the word Hellene. Roderick Beaton, considering the evidence of the usage of the term "Hellenes" in the 12th century, sees the re-evaluation of the term as occurring before the loss of Constantinople in 1204. In addition, unlike Vacalopoulos,<ref>A. E. Vacalopoulos, The Origins of the Greek Nation:the Byzantine Period (12°4-1461) (New Brunswick, N.J., 1970).</ref> Beaton sees not the birth of Greek nationalism, but rather an embryonic “ethnic” awareness, primarily based around language.<ref>Beaton, Roderick. “Antique Nation? 'Hellenes' on the Eve of Greek Independence and in Twelfth-Century Byzantium.” Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies 31, no. 1 (2007): 76–95</ref>

Michael Angold notes that the ideology of the period displays the ability of the Byzantines to react and adapt to changing cultural and political circumstances, including exile, and that the ideological developments of this period were, for the most part, cut short and discarded by the restored empire of the [[Palaiologoi]], as [[Michael VIII]] returned to the ideology of earlier periods.<ref>Angold, Michael. "Byzantine ‘Nationalism’ and the Nicaean Empire." Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies 1 (1975) p70</ref>

'''Zakynthos''' ({{IPAc-en|?|z|??|n|t|i|,_|-|t|e?|,_|?|z|æ|n|-}}; {{lang-el|????????}} {{IPA-el|?zacin?os||El-????????.ogg}}) or '''Zante''' (; from [[Venetian language|Venetian]]) is a Greek island in the [[Ionian Sea]]. It is the third largest of the [[Ionian Islands]]. Zakynthos is a separate [[regional units of Greece|regional unit]] of the [[Ionian Islands (region)|Ionian Islands]] region, and its only [[Communities and Municipalities of Greece|municipality]]. It covers an area of {{convert|410|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and its coastline is roughly {{convert|123|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in length.  The name, like all similar names ending in -nthos, is pre-Mycenaean or [[Pelasgian]] in origin.  In [[Greek mythology]] the island was said to be named after [[Zakynthos (person)|Zakynthos]], the son of a legendary [[Arcadia]]n chief [[Dardanus]].

Zakynthos is a tourist destination, with an international airport served by many charter flights from northern Europe. The island's nickname is ''To fioro tou Levante'' ({{lang-it|Il fiore di Levante}}, English: ''The flower of the East''), given by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]].

=== Ancient history ===
Zakynthos was inhabited from the [[Neolithic Age]], as some [[archaeological]] excavations have proved.

The ancient Greek poet [[Homer]] mentioned the island in the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', stating that the first inhabitants of it were the son of King Dardanos of Troy called Zakynthos and his men.  In mythology the island was then conquered by King [[Arkesios]] of [[Kefalonia]], and then by [[Odysseus]] from [[Ithaca]].

Later on, a treaty was signed that made Zakynthos an independent [[Greek democracy|democracy]], the first established in Greece, that lasted more than 650 years.

The [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] military commander [[Tolmides]] concluded an alliance with Zakynthus during the [[First Peloponnesian War]] sometime between 459 and 446 BC.<ref>{{cite book |title=History of the Peloponnesian War |last=Thucydides |authorlink=Thucydides |others=[[Richard Crawley]] (trans.) |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |at=2.8 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War/Book_2 |accessdate=24 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Library of History |last=Diodorus Siculus |first= |authorlink=Diodorus Siculus |others=C.

Tar is a more effective protector of ship planking than [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] (which is made from [[Pine|pine tree]]s). The Athenian [[trireme]] fleet needed protection from rot, decay and the [[Shipworm|teredo]], so this new source of tar was valuable to them. The tar was dredged up from the bottom of a lake (now known as [[Keri, Greece|Lake Keri]]) using leafy [[Myrtus|myrtle]] branches tied to the ends of poles. It was then collected in pots and could be carried to the beach and swabbed directly onto [[Hull (watercraft)|ship hulls]].<ref>{{cite book |title=History of Herodotus |last=Herodotus |first= |authorlink=Herodotus |others=George Rawlinson (trans.) |year=1910 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |at=4.195 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_Herodotus/Book_4 |accessdate=24 July 2010}}</ref> Alternatively, the tar could be shipped to the Athenian naval yard at the [[Piraeus]] for storage.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lords of the Sea: The Epic Story of the Athenian Navy and the Birth of Democracy |last=Hale |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher=Viking |location=New York |isbn=978-0-670-02080-5 |page=107 |url=http://www.lordsofthesea.org/ |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Neapolitan and Venetian rule===
{{further|Ionian Islands under Venetian rule}}
During the [[Middle Ages]], the island was part of the [[Byzantine]] [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Cephallenia (theme)|Cephallenia]]. After 1185 it became part of the [[County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos]] under the [[Kingdom of Naples]] until its last Count [[Leonardo III Tocco]] was defeated by the Ottomans in 1479. The Turkish rule lasted only until 22 April 1484, when it was swapped with the Turks by [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] secretary [[Giovanni Dario]], negotiator of the [[treaty of Constantinople (1479)]], against neighboring [[Cephalonia]] and an annual tribute of 500 [[ducat]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Papacy and the Levant, 1204–1571: The fifteenth century|volume=Volume 2|first=Kenneth|last=Meyer Setton|authorlink=Kenneth Meyer Setton|publisher=American Philosophical Society|year=1978|isbn=978-0-87169-127-9|pages=341, 515|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=0Sz2VYI0l1IC&pg=PA515|accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|language=French|title=Histoire d'Italie: depuis les premiers temps jusqu'à nos jours|trans_title=History of Italy: from the oldest times till nowadays|volume=Volume 1|first1=Heinrich|last1=Leo|authorlink1=Heinrich Leo|first2=Carlo|last2=Botta|authorlink2=Carlo Botta|editor-first=Louis|editor-last=Dochez|editor-link=fr:Louis Dochez|publisher=Adolphe Delahays|location=Paris|year=1856|page=600|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=SSHOyMv57JoC&pg=PA600|accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref> From then on Zakynthos remained an [[Stato da Mar|overseas colony]] of the [[Venetian Republic]] until its very end in 1797, following the fate of the [[Ionian islands]], completed by the [[Siege of the Castle of St. George|capture of Cephalonia]] in 1500 and [[Lefkas]] in 1684 from the Turks.

Venetian rule protected the island from Ottoman domination but in its place it put a feudal oligarchy. The cultural influence of Venice (and of [[Venetian language|Venetian]] on local dialect) was considerable. The wealthy made a habit of sending their sons to [[Italy]] to be educated. Good examples are [[Dionysios Solomos]], a native of Zakynthos and Greece's national poet, and [[Ugo Foscolo]], also native of Zakynthos and a national Italian poet. However, both the Greek language and Orthodox faith survived intact. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, it was one of the largest exporters of [[Zante currant|currants]] in the world together with [[Cephalonia]].

===French, Ionian state period and British Rule===
The [[Treaty of Campoformio]] dismantling the Venetian Republic awarded the Ionian Islands to [[First French Republic|France]]. General Antoine Gentili, leading a French expeditionary force with boats captured in Venice, took control of the islands on 26 June 1797. From 1797 to 1798, the island was part of the [[French departments of Greece|French départment]] [[Mer-Égée]]. A Russian-Turkish fleet captured the island on 23 October 1798. From 1800 to 1807, it was part of the [[Septinsular Republic]], nominally under sovereignty of the [[Ottoman Empire]] but protected by [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. In 1800–1801, Britain attempted to take control of the Ionian islands from Zakynthos after a revolt, under the leadership of [[James Callander Campbell]]<ref>Sir James Callander Campbell, Knight of Ardkinglass (1745–1832), Council (?) in Zante in 1801, not to be confused with [[s:Campbell, James (1763-1819) (DNB00)|James Campbell (1763–1819)]], military governor of Corfu in 1814–1816</ref> but these intentions stopped after the [[Peace of Amiens]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Sir James|last=Campbell|title=Memoirs of Sir James Campbell, of Ardkinglas|publisher=[[Henry Colburn]] & [[Richard Bentley (publisher){{!}}Richard Bentley]]|location=London|year=1832|volume=Volume 1|oclc=04662979|chapter=Chapter XVI: (...)

===Union with Greece===
In 1864, Zakynthos, together with all the other Ionian Islands, became a full member of the Greek state, ceded by Britain to stabilize the rule of the newly crowned Danish-born King of the Hellenes, [[George I of Greece|George I]].

===During World War II===

During the Nazi occupation of Greece, Mayor Karrer and [[Chrysostomos of Zakynthos|Bishop Chrysostomos]] refused Nazi orders to turn in a list of the members of the town's Jewish community for deportation to the death camps. Instead they hid the town's 275 Jews in rural villages. Every Jew of Zakynthos survived the war. Statues of the Bishop and the Mayor commemorate their heroism on the site of the town's historic synagogue, destroyed in the earthquake of 1953. In 1978, Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in Israel, honored Bishop Chrysostomos and Mayor Loukas Karrer with the title of "Righteous among the Nations", an honor given to non-Jews who, at personal risk, saved Jews during the Holocaust. After the war, all of the Jews of Zakynthos moved either to Israel or to Athens.<ref>Dionyssios Stravolemos, An Act of Heroism – A Justification</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The miraculous story of the Jews of Zakynthos|author=LEORA GOLDBERG|publisher=THE JERUSALEM POST|location=ZAKYNTHOS, Greece|url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/Article.aspx?id=162994}}</ref>

===The Great Earthquake of 1953===
{{refimprove section|date=June 2014}}
{{Main|1953 Ionian Earthquake}}

The island suffered a series of four severe earthquakes in August 1953, resulting in the total destruction of its infrastructure, including most of the state archives. The third and most destructive of these quakes, registering 7.3 on the Richter Scale, occurred at 09:24 UTC (11:24 am local time) on 12 August 1953. It had its epicentre directly on the southern tip of the nearby island of [[Kefalonia]],  also causing widespread destruction there.  The quake was felt throughout most of the country, and only three buildings on Zakynthos were left standing after the disaster: the St. Dionysios Cathedral, the National Bank building, and the church of St. Nicholas "tou Molou" (of the Quay). And other buildings in outlying areas managed to avoid complete collapse.

{{wideimage|Zakynthos Town Panorama.jpg|800px|Panorama of Zakynthos city.}}

===After the quake===
[[File:Agios Dionysos Church, Belltower, Zakynthos City, Greece 01.jpg|thumb|The Cathedral of [[Dionysios of Zakynthos|Saint Dionysios]].]]

After the enormous earthquake, the island's roads were expanded and paved along with the GR-35, one of the roads linking with the town and [[Porto Roma]] along with [[Laganas]], Keri and Volimes and from Lachans to Keri, and its airport was opened in the 1960s. The island's population partly emigrated, but subsequently boomed in later years.

Mining is  common on the island. A small mountain located in Zakynthos' west side was mined during the 1990s, though it is no longer in use. Today mining continues, but with two quarries on the mountain range on the western part of the island. [[Tourism in Greece|Tourism]] continues to thrive and Zakynthos is currently one of the most popular tourist destinations in [[Greece]].

A few earthquakes hit the island in the 2000s (decade), one on Sunday 8 June 2008 at 6.4 R, felt without any damage or injuries. Another less serious tremor occurred four months later on Saturday 11 October,  measured at 4R and also causing almost no damage.

===The April 2006 earthquake swarm===
Starting in the early morning hours of 4 April 2006, a series of moderate to strong earthquakes occurring on an almost daily basis began shaking almost the entire island. On 11 April, however, the phenomenon intensified in both magnitude and rate of events. At 03:02 local time of that day, a powerful, magnitude 5.7 earthquake hit the area, only to be followed by an even stronger tremor, registering 5.9 on the Richter Scale, at 8:30 p.m. (20:30) EET. On 12 April, a committee of the nation's most prominent seismologists had an emergency meeting with the Greek [[Minister for the Environment, Physical Planning and Public Works|Ministry of Environment, Physical Planning and Public Works]], in order to assess the emerging situation. The meeting ended in a scientific consensus that this specific area of the Ionian Sea was simply not ready to produce an even stronger quake, advising the nervous citizens of the island to remain calm. However, at 19:52 and at 19:56 local time of that same evening, two more earthquakes shook the region, sending scores of terrified people into the streets. The earthquakes had a preliminary [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 5.8 and 5.4 respectively. Seismologists at the [[National Observatory of Athens|Athens Seismological Institute]] were once again taken by surprise by what turned into an unprecedented riddle concerning whether or not these were in fact [[foreshock]]s of a major event. The chances are, nonetheless, that this was just a phenomenon known as [[earthquake swarm]], characterized by a pattern of a considerable amount of magnitude-wise similar tremors, all occurring within a limited number of days or weeks. As a result of the recurring jolts, moderate damage was reported to a total of sixty residencies and one library, while a small crack appeared on the eastern part of the capital's port. In addition, several rocks tumbled down onto one of the island's main roads, running through its mountainous areas.

The Ionian Islands are situated upon one of Europe's most notorious [[fault (geology)|faults]], capable of producing earthquakes potentially causing both widespread damage and considerable loss of life. However it should be stressed that, following the catastrophe of 1953, the authorities of Zakynthos have enforced a strict program of antiseismic standards (the same applies to the rest of Greece) to be applied in every building to be constructed. All buildings have been built on a swimming slab and enforced with steel, determined by the government to ensure safety.

===After the quake and the Wildfires of 2006===
On Thursday 18 July 2006, the western portion of the island was hit by a forest fire. The fire spread to the island's forest and ended up spreading by hectares. Firefighters along with helicopters and planes from the mainland arrived to fight the fire's expansion and further deforestation. The fire lasted for several days and on 20 July, much of the area was contained; though it had become unpopular and unattractive scenery. One of the conflagrations appeared as a fiery line visible from as far away as the southern portion of the island and the Ionian Sea.

==Geography==
[[File:Zakynthos 3D version 1.gif|right|thumb|Three-dimensional view of Zakynthos relief.]]
[[File:Agios Sostis Island, Zakynthos, Greece 03.jpg|thumb|Agios Sostis island.]]

Zakynthos lies in the eastern part of the Ionian sea, around {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=off}} west of the Greek ([[Peloponnese]]) mainland. Island of [[Kefalonia]] lies {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=off}} on the north. It is the southernmost of the main group of the Ionian islands (not counting distant [[Kythira]]). Zakynthos is about {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=off}} wide, and covers an area of {{convert|410|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. Its coastline is approximately {{convert|123|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long. According to the 2011 census, the island has a population of 45,650. The highest point is [[Vrachionas]], at 758 m.

Zakynthos has the shape of an [[arrowhead]], with the "tip" (Cape [[Skinari]]) pointing northwest. The western half of the island is a mountainous plateau and the southwest coast consists mostly of steep cliffs. The eastern half is a densely populated fertile plain with long sandy beaches, interrupted with several isolated hills, notably [[Bochali]] which overlooks the city and the peninsula of [[Vasilikos, Zakynthos|Vasilikos]] in the northeast. The peninsulas of Vassilikos on north and [[Marathia, Zakynthos|Marathia]] on south enclose the wide and shallow bay of [[Laganas]] on the southeast part of the island.

The capital, which has the same name as the prefecture, is the town of [[Zakynthos (city)|Zakynthos]]. It lies on the eastern part of the northern coast. Apart from the official name, it is also called ''Chora'' (i.e. the Town, a common denomination in Greece when the name of the island itself is the same as the name of the principal town). The port of Zakynthos has a ferry connecting to the port of [[Kyllini (Elia), Greece|Kyllini]] on the mainland. Another ferry connects the village of Agios Nikolaos to [[Argostoli]] on Kefalonia.

Minor uninhabited islands around Zakynthos included in the municipality and regional unit are: Marathonisi, Pelouzo, Agios Sostis in the Laganas bay; Agios Nikolaos,  near the eponymous harbor on the northern tip; and Agios Ioannis near Porto Vromi on the western coast.

===Flora and fauna===
[[File:Zante currant drying in Tsilivi.jpg|thumb|Sun-drying of [[Zante currant]]]]
[[File:Loggerhead sea turtle.jpg|thumb|[[Loggerhead sea turtle]] (Caretta-Caretta)]]

The mild, [[Mediterranean climate]] and the plentiful winter rainfall endow the island with dense vegetation. The principal products are [[olive oil]], [[Zante currant|currant]]s, grapes, and [[citrus]] fruit. The Zante currant is a small sweet seedless grape which is native to the island.

Bay of Laganas is the site of the first National [[Zakynthos Marine Park|Marine Park]] and the prime nesting area for [[loggerhead sea turtle]]s (''Caretta caretta'') in the Mediterranean. In the early 1980s, the Bay of Laganas was seriously threatened as a nesting habitat, but thanks to the efforts of [[MEDASSET]] founder and president [[Lily Venizelos]] it could be preserved. ''Caretta caretta'' is an [[endangered species]] – especially by the deck chairs laid out on their breeding grounds and the inevitable pollution. Every year at the beginning of June, the female turtles come to the southern beaches in order to bury their eggs in the sand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmp-zak.org/index.php?pn=park_area&t=content&l=EN&r=home_menu |title=Park Area |publisher=Zakynthos Marine Park}}</ref> The incubation period for the nest is approximately fifty-five days, after which time hatchlings emerge from the nest and make their way to the sea. The survival rate for hatchlings is very small, and it is estimated that only one in one thousand hatchlings that enter the sea lives to adulthood. Each nest contains around one hundred to one hundred and twenty eggs, each of which are around the size and shape of a ping-pong ball. Female turtles begin to lay nests at around twenty to thirty years of age.

==Sights==
The most famous landmark of the island is the [[Navagio]] beach. It is a cove on the southwest (northwest near village of Anafonitiria) shore, isolated by high cliffs and accessible only by boat, or parachute. The beach and sea floor are made of white pebbles, and surrounded by turquoise waters. It is named after a shipwreck ([[MV Panagiotis]]), which sunk on the shore around 1980. The ridge area from [[Anafonitria]] has a small observation deck which overlooks the shipwreck, and there is a monastery nearby. The unique and stunning visuals of the location are a favourite for BASE jumpers, and each year a major event in the BASE calendar is held at Navagio, around the end of August.

Numerous "Blue Caves", are cut into cliffs around Cape [[Skinari]], and accessible only by small boats. Sunrays reflect through blue sea water from white stones of cave bottoms and walls, creating visual lighting effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greeka.com/ionian/zakynthos/zakynthos-excursions/zakynthos-blue-caves.htm |title=Zakynthos Blue Caves: The Blue Caves of Zakynthos Greece, Ionian}}</ref> [[Keri, Greece|Keri]]  is located in the far south of the island. It is a mountain village and has a lighthouse in the south. It includes a panorama of the southern part of the [[Ionian Sea]]. The whole western shore from Keri to Skinari contains numerous interesting [[rock formations]], including arches.<ref name=usatoday>{{cite news |url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/beaches-zakynthos-greece-37375.html |title=Beaches in Zakynthos, Greece |author=Carole Simm |publisher=USA Today Travel}}</ref>

Northern and eastern shores contain numerous wide sandy beaches, some of which are attract tourists in summer months. The largest resort is [[Laganas]], whose beach stretches around {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}}. Small Xigia beach in the north is noted for its underwater springs rich in [[sulphur]], giving a distinct odour.<ref name=usatoday/>

[[Bochali]] hill above the Zakynthos town contains a small venetian castle and offers panoramic views onto the town. [[Strani]]'s hill located on the other side of [[Bochali]] is the place where [[Dionysios Solomos]] wrote the [[Hymn to Liberty|Greek national anthem]].<ref>http://www.presidency.gov.cy/presidency/presidency.nsf/prc34_gr/prc34_gr?OpenDocument</ref>

[[Marathonissi]] (also known as "Turtle Island" because of its turtle-like shape) is an islet near [[Limni Keriou]] (the beach of village [[Keri]]; also known as Keri Lake). It contains tropical vegetation, turquoise waters, beaches, and sea caves.

==Administration==

Zakynthos is a separate [[regional units of Greece|regional unit]] of the [[Ionian Islands (region)|Ionian Islands]] region, and the only [[Communities and Municipalities of Greece|municipality]] of the regional unit. The seat of administration is [[Zakynthos (city)]], the main town of the island.

===Prefecture===

As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Zakynthos was created out of the former [[prefectures of Greece|prefecture]] Zakynthos ({{lang-el|????? ????????}}). The prefecture had the same territory as the present regional unit. At the same reform, the current municipality Zakynthos was created out of the 6 former municipalities:<ref name=Kallikratis>{{PDFlink|1=[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis reform law text]}}</ref>

It is also one of the only three prefectures (out of 54) in which the rural population has a positive growth rate. In fact, the rural population's growth rate is higher than that of the urban population in Zakynthos. Out of the 507 births, 141 were in urban areas and 366 were in rural areas. Out of the 407 deaths, 124 were in urban areas and 283 were in rural areas.

The population of Zakynthos suffers from an exceptionally high rate of [[blindness]] of about 1.8%. That rate is about nine times the average in Europe, according to the [[World Health Organisation|WHO]]. In April 2012 the [[Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity (Greece)|Greek Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity]] launched an investigation into [[Dissability benefits|disability benefits]] for the blind.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203370604577263863362854348.html?mod=googlenews_wsj | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=James | last=Angelos | title='Island of the Blind' Riles a Greek Public Facing Cutbacks | date=3 April 2012}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{see also|Cuisine of the Ionian islands|Music of the Heptanese|Ionian School (music)}}

The island has a long musical tradition. It was a precursor of opera and [[operetta]] in Greece and on the island it constituted links between nobles and the rest of the people. In 1815 it saw the establishment of the first Music School in Greece. During the first Olympic Games ([[1896 Summer Olympics|Athens 1896]]), the Music Band of Zakynthos took part in the event. It was the period when composers of Zantiote origin, such as [[Domeneginis Kapnissis]], enjoyed some fame in Europe. Inaugurated in 2009, Zakynthos also now has its own ''Zante Jazz Festival''.

The novel Among the Olive Groves, by Chrissie Parker is primarily set on the island of Zakynthos.

=== Museums ===
There are two museums located in [[Zakynthos Town]]: The [[Byzantine Museum of Zakynthos]], featuring renaissance paintings, Byzantine icons and more. And the [[Museum of Solomos and Eminent People of Zakynthos]], hosting the mausoleum of [[Dionysios Solomos]] and [[Andreas Kalvos]], as well as works by many eminent Zakynthians.

The island offers  exceptional attractions for scuba divers.  Many of the dive sites are cave dives around the island. Further, a wide range of marine life can be found, common amongst being moray eels, monk seals, octopus, and loggerhead turtles (caretta caretta).

[[Zakynthos F.C.]] is the football club of the island.

==Transportation==
[[File:Zakynthos Airport, New Terminal, Greece 02.jpg|thumb|Zakynthos Airport.]]

The island is covered by a dense network of asphalt roads, particularly the flat eastern part. Main routes link the town with Volimes on north, Keri on the south, and peninsula Vassiliki on the west. The road between Volimes and [[Lithakia]] is the spine of the western half of the island.

The island has one airport, [[Zakynthos International Airport, "Dionysios Solomos"]] (on former GR-35) which connects flights with other Greek airports and numerous touristic charters. It is located near Laganas.

Zakynthos also features two ports: the main port, located in the Zakynthos town, and another in the village of [[Agios Nikolaos, Zakynthos|Agios Nikolaos]]. From the main port there is a connection to the [[port of Kyllini]], which is the usual route for arrivals to the island by sea from the mainland. From the port of Agios Nikolaos there is a connection to the island of [[Kefalonia]] (port of [[Pesada]]).

==Science==
Since 2003 Zakynthos possesses two academic departments belonging to the Technological Educational Institute of Ionian Islands.<ref>[http://www.teiion.gr teiion.gr]</ref> The first of which is the department of Environmental Technology and Ecology<ref>[http://envi.teiion.gr envi.teiion.gr]</ref> where environmental technologies, atmospheric physics, chemistry, climate dynamics, renewable energy sources, environmental management, biodiversity, and ecosystems dynamics are developed from the basis of natural sciences and mechanics. The department's sections have developed significant laboratory and field station infrastructures along Zakynthos and the Strofades islets. The second department is that of Protection and Conservation of Cultural Heritage.<ref>[http://culture.teiion.gr culture.teiion.gr]</ref>

The freshwater resources on Zakynthos are limited, and as a result a Greek-Norwegian educational collaboration is being established on the island. The [[Science Park Zakynthos]] is a collaboration between the Technological Educational Institute of the Ionian Islands (TEI), The [[Norwegian University of Life Sciences]] (UMB), and the [[Therianos Villas]] and Therianos Family Farm on Zakynthos.

==Notable people==

The '''Bangladesh Nationalist Party''' ({{lang-bn|???????? ???????????? ??}}, [[Romanization of Bengali|transliterated]]:
''Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Dôl''), often abbreviated as '''BNP''', is one of the two the largest political parties of [[Bangladesh]].

The BNP was founded as a centre-right liberal democratic party. It was established on September 1, 1978 during the regime of [[Ziaur Rahman]]. It has ruled Bangladesh for a total of 14 years and three terms since its birth (1978–1982, 1991–1996, 2001–2006). During the early 1990s, the BNP administration, with stalwarts such as [[Saifur Rahman]], oversaw a landmark [[Economic liberalization|liberalization]] of the Bangladeshi economy, which set a precedent for economic reforms across South Asia.

The BNP has been led by [[Khaleda Zia]] since 1983, the widow of [[Ziaur Rahman]]. Her son [[Tarique Rahman]] emerged as an influential force within the party in 2001 and is currently serving as its Senior Vice-Chairperson. The student wing of the party is the [[Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Chatra Dal]]

==History==
BNP was founded on 1 September 1978. President Ziaur Rahman had founded the party when he was elected as president. After his assassination, [[Abdus Sattar (president)|Abdus Sattar]] was elected as the president. Sattar was ousted from the party and [[Begum Khaleda Zia]] was elected as the chairperson of the party. Army General Hussain Muhammed Ershad declared martial law in the country. In the [[Bangladeshi general election, 1991|Bangladeshi General Election, 1991]] the party had won 140 seats, only 11 short of a majority. Begum Khaleda Zia was sworn in as the first woman Prime MInister of Bangladesh. In the February election of 1996 Khaleda Zia became Prime minister for another term, winning 300 seats out of 300. Fresh elections were held in June and BNP had introduced the caretaker government system for neutral elections. In the election of 2001 BNP won 193 seats and came to power for the fourth time. Khaleda Zia had become Prime Minister for the third time. <ref>http://www.bnpbangladesh.com/en/index.php/b-n-p/history</ref>

==2001–2006 period==
BNP won the general election in 2001 with a two-thirds majority of seats in parliament, and 46% of the vote (compared to the principal opposition party's 40%), returning to power for a third term.

==Caretaker government (2006–2008)==
{{main|2006-2008 Bangladeshi political crisis}}
A [[caretaker government]] was established following the end of Khaleda Zia's term and resignation of her government. Protests and violence began immediately after Khaleda's resignation, resulting in 40 deaths and hundreds injured in the first month. Following the Awami League's last minute withdrawal from elections scheduled for 22 January 2007, a bloodless military coup established a new government on January 11. President [[Iajuddin Ahmed]] (in office since 2002) declared a [[state of emergency]] before resigning as [[Chief Advisor]]; [[Fakhruddin Ahmed]], a prominent banker, was appointed as CA.

The military-backed government promised to tackle the longstanding problems of corruption, filing charges against more than 160 politicians, civil servants and businessmen in 2007. Among those charged were Khaleda Zia and her two sons, as well as [[Sheikh Hasina]], leader of the Awami League.<ref name ="aljazeera April 10, 2008"/> Some party members chose former finance minister [[Saifur Rahman]] as chairman, and former water resources [[Minister (government)|minister]] Hafizuddin Ahmed as secretary general to lead the party. Khaleda Zia's supporters refused to recognize these choices.

The [[Bangladesh Election Commission]] invited Hafizuddin's faction, rather than Khaleda Zia's, to participate in talks, effectively recognizing the former as the legitimate BNP. Khaleda Zia challenged this in court, but her appeal was rejected on 10 April 2008.<ref name="aljazeera April 10, 2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2008/04/2008525142259751359.html|title=Bangladesh court rejects Zia appeal|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=April 10, 2008}}</ref> After her release later that year, Zia was restored to her position as party leader.<ref name="Daily Star September 14, 2008">{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=54711|title=BNP top brass hails decision on Tarique|date=September 14, 2008|work=Daily Star|accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref> There is speculation that the military government was trying to force both major leaders into exile in order to change the political system.

'''Kythira''' ({{IPAc-en|k|?|?|?|?|r|?}}; {{lang-el|??????}}, also transliterated as '''Cythera''', '''Kythera''' and '''Kithira'''<ref>The Italian ''Cerigo'' can be used in speaking of late medieval and early modern Kythira.</ref>) is an [[Greek islands|island in Greece]] lying opposite the south-eastern tip of the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula.  It is traditionally listed as one of the seven main [[Ionian Islands]], although it distant from the main group. Administratively, it belongs to the [[Islands (regional unit)|Islands]] regional unit, which is part of the [[Attica (region)|Attica]] region (although at large distance from [[Attica]] itself).

For many centuries, while naval travel was the only means for transportation, the island possessed a strategic location. From ancient times until the mid 19th century, Kythira was a crossroads of merchants, sailors, and conquerors. As such, it has had a long and varied history and has been influenced by many civilisations and cultures. This is reflected in its architecture (a blend of traditional, [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[Venice|Venetian]] elements), as well as the traditions and customs, influenced by centuries of coexistence of the Greek, [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] cultures.

==Administration==
Kythira and the nearby island of [[Antikythira]] were separate municipalities until they were merged at the 2011 local government reform; the two islands are now municipal units.<ref name=Kallikratis>[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}</ref> The province of Kythira ({{lang-el|??????? ???????}}) was one of the [[provinces of Greece|provinces]] of the [[Piraeus Prefecture]]. It had the same territory as the present municipality Kythira. It was abolished in 2006.

==History==

===Pre-classical and ancient===
[[File:0142 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - Antikythera mechanism - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 11 2009.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Antikythera mechanism]], [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]

There are archaeological remains from the [[Helladic period]], contemporary with the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]]. There is archaeological evidence of Kythiran trade as far as Egypt and Mesopotamia.

Kythira had a [[Phoenicia]]n colony in the early archaic age; the sea-snail which produces [[Tyrian purple]] is native to the island. Xenophon refers to a Phoenician Bay in Kythira (''[[Hellenica]]'' 4.8.7, probably Avlemonas Bay on the eastern side of the island). The archaic Greek city of Kythira was at Scandea on Avlemonas; its ruins have been excavated. Its acropolis, now Palicastro (Palaeocastron, "Old Fort"), has the temple of [[Aphrodite|Aphrodite Ourania]], who may well represent a Phoenician cult of [[Astarte]].

In classical times, Kythira was part of the territory of several larger city-states. Sparta took the island from Argos early in the sixth century, and ruled it under a ''kytherodíkes'' (k??????????, "judge on Kythira"), in Thucydides' time [4,53,3]; Athens occupied it three times when at war with Sparta (in 456 during her [[First Peloponnesian War|first war with Sparta and the Peloponnesians]]; from 426 to 410, through most of the great [[Peloponnesian War]]; and from 393 to 387/386, during the [[Corinthian War]] against Spartan dominance) and used it both to support her trade and to raid Laconia.

Kythira was independent, and issued her own coins, in 195, after the Achaean defeat of Sparta. In Augustus' time, it was again subject to Sparta, being the property of [[Gaius Julius Eurycles]], who was both a Spartan magnate and a Roman citizen.

By this time, the Greek cities were in practice subject to the [[Roman Empire]]. Kythira continued to exist under the Roman Empire and its [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine successor state]] for centuries. Christianity is attested from the fourth century AD, the time of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]]; according to her legend, Saint Elessa came from Laconia to convert the island.<ref>''Brill's New Pauly'', article on "Cythera" (for entire section), citing Paus. 1,27,5; Thuc. 4,53,1ff.; 57,4; 5,14,3; 18,7; 7,26,2; 57,6; Xen. Hell. 4,8,7; Isoc. Or. 4,119, and Cassius Dio 54,7,2).</ref>

===Medieval and modern===

[[File:Kythira - Hora 1.jpg|thumb|View of Kythira Castle]]
[[File:Katouni bridge.JPG|thumb|Katouni bridge (19th century)]]

Kythira is not mentioned in the literary sources for centuries after its conversion; in the period of Byzantine weakness at the end of the seventh century, it would have been exposed both to the Slavic tribes who occupied the mainland and to Arab raiders from the sea. Archaeological evidence suggests the island was abandoned about 700 AD.

When Saint [[Theodore of Cythera]] led a resettlement after the Byzantine reconquest of Crete in 962, he found the island occupied only by wandering bands of hunters. He established a great monastery at Paliochora; a town grew up around it, largely populated from Laconia.

When the Byzantine Empire was divided among the conquerors of the [[Fourth Crusade]], the [[Republic of Venice]] took her share, three eighths of the whole, as the Greek islands, Kythira among them. She established a coast patrol on Kythira and Antikythera to protect her trade route to Constantinople; Kythira was one of the islands Venice continued to hold despite the Greek reconquest of Constantinople and the Turkish presence all over the Near East.<ref>[[Fernand Braudel]], ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean world in the age of Philip II'', trans. Reynolds. In the 1995 ed. Vol II, p.877.</ref> During the Venetian domination the island was known as '''Cerigo'''.

Kythirans still talk about the destruction and looting of [[Paliochora]] by [[Aruj|Barbarossa]]; it has become an intrinsic part of the Kytherian folklore. One can easily accept the stories of locals by noticing the number of monasteries embedded in the rocky hillsides to avoid destruction by the [[pirate]]s.

When [[Napoleon]] put an end to the Venetian Republic in 1797, Kythira was among the islands incorporated in that most distant [[Département in France|départment]] of France, called [[Mer-Égée]]. Kythira shared a common destiny with the other [[Ionian islands]] during the turbulent Napoleonic era, and is still accounted one of them; it was counted as one of the [[Cyclades]] in antiquity.

In 1799, the Ionian islands became the [[Septinsular Republic]], nominally under Turkish [[suzerainty]], but in practice dominated by Russia. In 1807, France took them back only to have the British seize the islands in 1809 and set up one of their first [[protectorate]]s, the [[United States of the Ionian Islands]]. The British held them for nearly half a century; under the British, they were governed by a High Commissioner who could act with both legislative and executive powers. After a long history of turbulence, never settled even by such eminent Commissioners as [[William Ewart Gladstone]], the British discussion whether they were a waste of money or a vital Imperial possession ended with the cession of  the Ionian Islands, including Kythira, to the new King [[George I of Greece]], who was brother-in-law to the Prince of Wales. Under the British, Kythira was known as Carigo or Cerigo, as was its chief town, the name it had under the Venetian Republic.

The chief town of the island, Kythira (or Chora, "village") has the Historical Archives of Kythira, the second largest in the Ionian islands, after [[Corfu]].

==Geography==
[[File:Fonisa waterfall.jpg|thumb|Fonisa Waterfall at [[Mylopotamos, Cythera]]]]

Kythira  has a land area of {{convert|279.593|km²|2|abbr=out}}; it is located at the  southwestern exit from the [[Aegean Sea]], behind [[Cape Malea]].<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2011. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Aegean_Sea?topic=49523 ''Aegean Sea''. Eds. P.Saundry & C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC]</ref> The rugged terrain is a result of prevailing winds from the surrounding seas which have shaped its shores into steep rocky cliffs with deep bays. The island has many beaches, of various composition and size; only half of them can be reached by road through the mountainous terrain of the island.

Kythira is close to the [[Hellenic arc]] [[Tectonic plate|plate]] boundary zone, and thus highly prone to [[earthquake]]s. Many earthquakes in recorded history have had their [[epicentre]]s near or on the island. Probably the largest in recent times is the 1903 earthquake near at the village of Mitata, that caused significant damage as well as limited loss of life. It has had two major earthquakes in the 21st century: that of November 5, 2004, measuring between 5.6 and 5.8 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] and the earthquake of January 8, 2006, measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale. The epicenter of the latter was in the sea about {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} to the east of Kythira, with a [[Hypocenter|focus]] at a depth of approximately {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}}.  Many buildings were damaged, particularly old ones, mostly in the village of Mitata, but with no loss of life. It was felt as far as [[Italy]], [[Egypt]], [[Malta]] and [[Jordan]].

The Kythirian Straits, formed by the southeastern peninsula of the [[Peloponnese]] and the islands of [[Elafonissos]] and Kythira represent one of the most dangerous navigational hazards in the Mediterranean. Most sea-traffic  from [[Athens]], [[Istanbul]], and the [[Black Sea]] to the central and western Mediterranean passes through the straits and are often subject to strong winds and shipwreck on Cape Malea.

===Climate===
Kythira has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa'') with mild, rainy winters and warm to hot dry summers.<ref name = koppen>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

==Mythology==
In Ancient [[Greek mythology]] mythology, Kythira was considered to be the island of celestial [[Aphrodite]], the Goddess of love, (cf. [[Cyprus]], the island of [[Astarte]], the Goddess of Love).

==Demographics==
Like many of the smaller Aegean islands, Kythira's population is decreasing. While the island had reached a peak population of about 14,500 in 1864, that has steadily declined mostly due to emigration, both internal (to major urban centres of Greece) and external (to Australia, the United States, Germany) in the first half of the 20th century. Today its population hovers around 3,354 people (2001 census).

===Villages of Kythira===

[[File:Kythira - Kapsali.jpg|thumb|right|300px|View of Kapsali from the castle of Chora]]

The largest villages (2001 Greek census) are Potamós (pop. 396), Agía Pelagía (281), Chóra/Kýthira (267), Áno Livádi (175), Kálamos (157), and Livádi (126).

==Economy==
Since the late 20th century, the Kythirean economy has largely focused and, in the process, has become dependent on [[Tourism in Greece|tourism]], which provides the majority of the island's income, despite the fact that Kythira is not one of the most popular tourist destinations in Greece. The popular season usually begins with the Greek holiday of [[Pentecost]] at the end of May, and lasts until the middle of September. During this time, primarily during August, the island's population will often triple due to the tourists and natives returning for vacation. Dependence on tourism has resulted in increased building activity in many of the island's villages, mostly for commercial purposes (hotels and hospitality facilities, shops etc.), but also secondary homes; prominent examples are Agia Pelagia and Livadi, both of which having witnessed significant growth in their size since the early 1990s.

Minor sources of revenue are thyme honey, famous within Greece for its rich flavor, as well as some small-scale cultivation of vegetables and fruit and animal husbandry that is, nevertheless, increasingly restricted to local consumption.

Only five of the island's villages are on the coast (Platia Amos, Agia Pelagia, Diakofti, Avlemonas, & Kapsali). During July and August, several traditional dances will be held in various villages. These dances usually attract the majority of the island's population, the biggest of which are the festival of 'Panagia' in Potamos on 15 August, and the wine festival in Mitata on the first Friday and Saturday of August.

==Kythira (town)==
[[File:Chora Kythira panorama.jpg|thumb|300px|right|View of the capital, Chora]]
[[File:Chora5.jpg|thumb|Street of Chora]]

The capital, Chora, is located on the southern part of the island having no ports connected to the southern Peloponnese or [[Vatika]]. Kythira's port for Vatika was previously situated at Agia Pelagia, although in recent years this port has been decommissioned and has been replaced by a new port at the coastal town of Diakofti, Kythira.

Most of the over 60 village names end with "-anika" and a few end with -athika, -iana and -ades. This is due to the villages being named after influential families that settled first in that region. For Example, 'Logothetianika' is derived from the Greek last name of 'Logothetis'.

==Transportation==
The island in the past has been plagued by a poor infrastructure, exacerbated by the effect of weather on transportation during the winter months. However the construction of the new port in Diakofti along with the renovation of the island's airport have significantly reduced these effects. A new road from the island's most populated town of Potamos in the north to the island's capital of Chora in the south is currently in the planning and development stage.

===Port===
Despite the fact that the island has been a trade route for centuries, construction of a modern port was postponed several times until the latter half of the 20th century. In 1933, efforts were made to construct a port in the village of Agia Pelagia, yet financial and governmental problems meant that decades later that one was built. That small port of Agia Pelagia (currently being renovated from a ferry dock to a tourist/recreational boat dock) was the island's main port until the mid-1990s. Around that time the new port of Diakofti, the site originally chosen by the island's British rulers in the 19th century, was constructed along with a modern wider road, aiming to support larger cargo and passenger vessels. The port of Diakofti currently serves scheduled routes to/from Gythion, Kalamata, Antikythera, [[Piraeus]], [[Crete]] & Neapolis - Vatika. Proposals have been made to attach a Marina to the south side of the port, however no plans or timetables have been produced. Additionally, the harbour of Agia Patrikia (north of Agia Pelagia) is the primary fishing boat harbour, housing two wide boatramps and a boat repair facility.

===Airport===
The island's primary airport is the [[Kithira Island National Airport]], located in the region between the village of Friligiannika and Diakofti, about {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} from the capital. The airport was revamped and extended at the turn of the 21st century, largely by private funds provided by the local population. The island is served by [[Olympic Air]] flights.

''' SETI@home''' ("SETI at home") is an Internet-based public [[volunteer computing]] project employing the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing|BOINC]] software platform, hosted by the [[Space Sciences Laboratory]], at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in the [[United States]]. ''SETI'' is an acronym for the [[SETI|Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence]]. Its purpose is to analyze radio signals, searching for signs of extra terrestrial intelligence, and is one of many activities undertaken as part of [[SETI]].

SETI@home was released to the public on May 17, 1999,<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=2006-10-06}}</ref> making it the second large-scale use of [[distributed computing]] over the Internet for research purposes, as [[Distributed.net]] was launched in 1997. Along with [[MilkyWay@home]] and [[Einstein@home]], it is the third major computing project of this type that has the investigation of phenomena in interstellar space as its primary purpose.

==Scientific research==
The two original goals of SETI@home were:
# to do useful scientific work by supporting an observational analysis to detect intelligent life outside Earth, and
# to prove the viability and practicality of the 'volunteer computing' concept.

The second of these goals is generally considered to have succeeded completely. The current [[BOINC]] environment, a development of the original SETI@home, is providing support for many computationally intensive projects in a wide range of disciplines.

The first of these goals has to date yielded no conclusive results: no evidence for ETI signals has been shown via SETI@home. However, ongoing continuation is predicated on the assumption that the observational analysis is not an 'ill-posed' one. The remainder of this article deals specifically with the original SETI@home observations/analysis.  The vast majority of the sky (over 98%) has yet to be surveyed, and each point in the sky must be surveyed many times to exclude even a subset of possibilities.

==Procedure details==
SETI@home searches for possible evidence of [[radio]] transmissions from [[extraterrestrial intelligence]] using observational data from the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo radio telescope]]. The data is taken 'piggyback' or 'passively' while the telescope is used for other scientific programs. The data is digitized, stored, and sent to the SETI@home facility. The data is then parsed into small chunks in frequency and time, and analyzed, using software, to search for any signals—that is, variations which cannot be ascribed to noise, and hence contain information. Using distributed computing, SETI@home sends the millions of chunks of data to be analyzed off-site by home computers, and then have those computers report back the results. Thus what appears an onerous problem in data analysis is reduced to a reasonable one by aid from a large, Internet-based community of borrowed computer resources.

The software searches for five types of signals that distinguish them from [[Electromagnetic interference|noise]]:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/about_seti/about_seti_at_home_4.html |title=How SETI@Home Works  - What is SETI@home Looking For? |publisher=SETI@Home Classic |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref>
* Spikes in [[power spectrum|power spectra]]
* [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]] rises and falls in transmission power, possibly representing the telescope beam's [[main lobe]] passing over a radio source
* Triplets&nbsp;— three power spikes in a row
* [[Pulse (signal processing)|Pulsing]] signals that possibly represent a [[narrowband]] digital-style transmission
* [[Autocorrelation]] detects signal waveforms.

There are many variations on how an ETI signal may be affected by the interstellar medium, and by relative motion of its origin compared to Earth. The  potential 'signal' is thus processed in a number  of ways (although not testing all detection methods nor scenarios) to ensure the highest likelihood of distinguishing it from the scintillating noise already present in all directions of outer space. For instance, another planet is very likely to be moving at a speed and acceleration with respect to Earth, and that will shift the frequency, over time, of the potential 'signal'. Checking for this through processing is done, to an extent, in the SETI@home software.

The process is somewhat like tuning a [[radio]] to various [[Channel (communications)|channels]], and looking at the signal strength meter. If the strength of the signal goes up, that gets attention. More technically, it involves a lot of digital signal processing, mostly [[discrete Fourier transform]]s at various [[chirp]] rates and durations.

==Results==
To date, the project has not confirmed the detection of any ETI signals (see [[extraterrestrial intelligence]]). However, it has identified several candidate targets (sky positions), where the spike in intensity is not easily explained as noisespots,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/candidates.html |title=Signal Candidate |publisher=Classic SETI@home |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref> for further analysis. The most significant candidate signal to date was announced on September 1, 2004, named [[Radio source SHGb02+14a]].

While the project has not reached the stated primary goal of finding extraterrestrial intelligence, it has proved to the scientific community that distributed computing projects using Internet-connected computers can succeed as a viable analysis tool, and even beat the largest supercomputers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boincstats.com/en/stats/-1/project/detail |publisher=BOINCstats |title=BOINC combined - Credit overview |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref> However, it has not been demonstrated that the order of magnitude excess in computers used, many outside the home (the original intent was to use 50,000-100,000 "home" computers),<ref name="Sullivan">{{cite web|url=http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/woody_paper.html |title=Sullivan, et al.: Seti@Home |publisher=Seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2009-05-17}}</ref>  has benefited the project scientifically. (For more on this, see 'Challenges to the project' below.)

[[Astronomer]] [[Seth Shostak]] stated in 2004 that he expects to get a conclusive signal and proof of alien contact between 2020 and 2025, based on the [[Drake equation]].<ref>{{cite news | publisher = Space Daily | title = First Contact Within 20 Years: Shostak | url = http://www.spacedaily.com/news/seti-04e.html | date = 2004-07-22 | last = Shostak | first = Seth | authorlink = Seth Shostak | accessdate = 2006-06-12}}</ref> This implies that a prolonged effort may benefit SETI@home, despite its (present) fourteen-year run without success in ETI detection.

==Technology==

Anybody with an at least intermittently Internet-connected computer can participate in SETI@home by running a free program that downloads and analyzes [[radio telescope]] data.

Observational [[Data]] are recorded on 2 [[Terabyte]] [[SATA]] hard disk drives at the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in [[Puerto Rico]], each holding about 2.5 days of observations, which are then mailed to [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]].<ref name="Korpela">{{cite journal | title = SETI@home&nbsp;— Massively Distributed Computing for SETI | first = Eric | last = Korpela | coauthors = Dan Werthimer, David Anderson, Jeff Cobb and Matt Lebofsky | journal = Computing in Science & Engineering |date=January 2001 | pages = 78–83 | url=http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/~korpela/papers/CISE.pdf | doi = 10.1109/5992.895191 | volume = 3}}</ref> [[Arecibo]] does not have a high [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] Internet connection, so data must go by [[mail|postal mail]] to Berkeley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/about_seti/about_seti_at_home_2.html |title=About SETI@home page 2 |publisher=Seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2009-05-17}}</ref> Once there, it is divided in both [[time domain|time]] and [[frequency domain]]s ''work units'' of 107 seconds of data,<ref>{{cite web | title = The SETI@home Sky Survey | url = http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/sciencepaper.html | author = SETI@home | year=2001<!–– no valid last modified available ––> |

The analysis software can search for signals with about one-tenth the strength of those sought in previous surveys, because it makes use of a computationally intensive [[algorithm]] called ''[[coherent integration]]''<!-- this is really not true&nbsp;— see the talk page&nbsp;— need to fix--> that no one else has had the computing power to implement.

Data is merged into a [[database]] using SETI@home computers in Berkeley. [[Interference (communication)|Interference]] is rejected, and various pattern-detection algorithms are applied to search for the most interesting signals.

===Software===
[[Image:Setiathomeversion3point07.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Screenshot of SETI@home Classic Screensaver (v3.07)]]
<!--Generally needs to go much deeper about how the software works internally rather than how it appears to a non-technical participant. Maybe put this in how it section and make this a history section?-->

The SETI@home distributed computing [[software]] runs either as a [[screensaver]] or continuously while a user works, making use of processor time that would otherwise be unused.

The initial software platform, now referred to as "SETI@home Classic", ran from May 17, 1999 to December 15, 2005. This program was only capable of running SETI@home; it was replaced by [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] (BOINC), which also allows users to contribute to other distributed computing projects at the same time as running SETI@home. The BOINC platform will also allow testing for more types of signals.

The discontinuation of the SETI@home Classic platform has rendered older [[Macintosh]] computers running pre-Mac OS X versions of the [[Mac OS]] unsuitable for participating in the project.

SETI@home is available for the Sony [[PlayStation 3]] console.<ref>http://www.dotsch.de/boinc/SETI@home%20applications.html</ref>

On May 3, 2006, new work units for a new version of SETI@home called "SETI@home Enhanced" started distribution. Since computers now have the power for more computationally intensive work than when the project began, this new version is more sensitive by a factor of two with respect to Gaussian signals and to some kinds of pulsed signals than the original SETI@home (BOINC) software. This new application has been optimized to the point where it will run faster on some workunits than earlier versions. However, some workunits (the best workunits, scientifically speaking) will take significantly longer.

In addition, some distributions of the SETI@home applications have been optimized for a particular type of CPU. They are referred to as "optimized executables" and have been found to run faster on systems specific for that CPU. {{As of|2007}}, most of these applications are optimized for [[Intel]] processors (and their corresponding instruction sets).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lunatics.kwsn.net |title=Seti@Home optimized science apps and information |publisher=Lunatics.kwsn.net |accessdate=2009-05-17}}</ref>

The results of the data processing are normally automatically transmitted when the computer is next connected to the Internet; it can also be instructed to connect to the Internet as needed.

==Statistics==
With over 5.2 million participants worldwide, the project is the distributed computing project with the most participants to date{{when?|date=March 2014}}. The original intent of SETI@home was to utilize 50,000-100,000 home computers.<ref name="Sullivan" /> Since its launch on May 17, 1999, the project has logged over two million years of aggregate computing time.{{as of?|date=May 2012}} On September 26, 2001, SETI@home had performed a total of 10<sup>21</sup> [[floating point]] operations. It is acknowledged by the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the largest computation in history.<ref>{{cite web | title = Largest Computation | url = http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/index.asp?id=53519 | work = Guinness World Records | author = Newport, Stuart (editor) | year = 2005 <!–– no valid last modified available ––> | publisher = HCI Entertainment | accessdate = 2005-12-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051128165405/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/index.asp?id=53519 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2005-11-28}}</ref> With over 145,000 active computers in the system (1.4 million total) in 233 countries, {{As of|2013|06|23|lc=on}}, SETI@home had the ability to compute over 668 [[teraFLOPS]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boincstats.com/en/stats/0/project/detail |title=SETI@Home Project |publisher=BOINC Stats |accessdate=2013-06-23}}</ref> For comparison, the [[Tianhe-2]] computer, which {{As of|2013|06|23|lc=on}} was the world's [[Top500|fastest]] [[supercomputer]], was able to compute 33.86 [[petaFLOPS]] (approximately 50 times greater).

==Project future==
There were future plans to get data from the [[Parkes Observatory]] in [[Australia]] to analyse the southern hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/setifuture.html#southern |title=Southern Hemisphere Search - increasing SETI@home's sky coverage in the "Future directions of SETI@home" |publisher=Classic SETI@home website |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref> However, {{As of|2009|03|09|lc=on}}, these plans were not mentioned in the project's website. Other plans include a Multi-Beam Data Recorder, a Near Time Persistency Checker and [[Astropulse]] (an application that uses coherent dedispersion to search for pulsed signals).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/sah_plans.php |title=SETI@home Plans |publisher=SETI@home |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref> Astropulse will team with the original Seti@Home to detect other sources, such as rapidly rotating pulsars, exploding primordial black holes, or as-yet unknown astrophysical phenomena.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/ap_faq.php |title=Astropulse FAQ |publisher=Setiathome.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2009-05-17}}</ref> Beta testing of the final public release version of Astropulse was completed in July 2008 and the distribution of work units to higher spec machines capable of processing the more CPU intensive work units started in mid July 2008.

==Competitive aspect==
SETI@home users quickly started to compete with one another in an effort to process the maximum number of work units. Teams were formed to combine the efforts of individual users. The competition continued, and grew larger with the introduction of BOINC.

As with any competition, attempts have been made to 'cheat' the system and claim credit for work that has not been performed. To combat cheats, the SETI@Home system sends every workunit to multiple computers, a value known as "initial replication" (currently '''2'''). Credit is only granted for each returned workunit once a minimum number of results have been returned and the results agree, a value known as "minimum quorum" (currently '''2'''). If, due to computation errors or cheating by submitting false data, not enough results agree, more identical workunits are sent out until the minimum quorum can be reached. The final credit granted to all machines which returned the correct result is the same, and is the lowest of the values claimed by each machine. The claimed credit by each machine for an identical workunit often varies due to very minor differences in floating point arithmetic on different processors.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Some users have installed and run SETI@home on computers at their workplaces&nbsp;— an act known as
'Borging', after the assimilation-driven [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] of ''[[Star Trek]]''. In some cases, SETI@home users have misused company resources to gain work-unit results&nbsp;— with at least two individuals getting fired for running SETI@home on an enterprise production system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1782050.stm |title=BBC 2002 |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-01-28 |accessdate=2009-05-17}}</ref> <!-- First firing was much earlier, but needs citation finding before one can use that information-->There is a thread in the newsgroup alt.sci.seti which bears the title "Anyone fired for SETI screensaver" and ran starting as early as September 14, 1999.

Other users collect large quantities of equipment together at home to create "SETI farms", which typically consist of a number of computers consisting of only a [[motherboard]], [[Central processing unit|CPU]], [[RAM]] and [[power supply]] that are arranged on shelves as diskless [[Workstation (computer hardware)|workstations]] running either [[Linux]] or old versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] "headless" (without a monitor).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bhs.broo.k12.wv.us/homepage/staff/seti/farms.htm |title=SETI Stack and farm systems |publisher=Bhs.broo.k12.wv.us |accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>

== Global warming effect ==

Some critics{{who|date=May 2014}} of SETI@home and distributed computing project in general are concerned that the project may contribute to global warming. Critics{{who|date=May 2014}} also claim that distributive computing projects, like SETI@home, are equivalent to [[data center]]s. The environmental activist group [[Greenpeace]], worries that emissions of  [[greenhouse gas]]es by computing environments, such as [[data center]]s and [[cloud computing]], increase [[greenhouse gas]]es and therefore global warming, and have launched political campaigns <ref>{{cite news| url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/01/data-centers-are-becoming-big-polluters-study-finds/ | work=The New York Times | first=Steve | last=Lohr | title=Data Centers Are Becoming Big Polluters, Study Finds | date=May 1, 2008}}</ref> against [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Amazon.com]], [[Microsoft]] and [[HP]] in 2012<ref>http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Apple+Twitter+Microsoft+using+dirty+cloud+technology+Greenpeace/6472665/story.html</ref>). However, this assertion that distributive computing projects like SETI@home are equivalent to [[data center]]s may not bear up under scrutiny because distributive computing projects like SETI@home were created specifically to be different from [[data center]]s as indicated by their respective names.  A [[data center]] is a facility used to house computer systems and associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems in a centralized location, hence data''center'', where distributive computing, the distribution of processing tasks to multiple remote personal computer class (versus server class) computers, is decentralized by its very nature.  Also, [[data center]]s typically require and use greater resources due to the stress on performance versus the desire to be economical with the use of server class computers.  [[Data center]]s require large sources of power due to highly intense computing, which distributive computing environments, which rely usually on normal residential power supply, do not require and [[data center]]s require significant cooling implementations which distributive computing does not require.

==Challenges to the project ==

There are other challenges to the project's future viability.  {{Wikinews|Searching for asteroids, extraterrestrial life a little more rocky: Budget cuts threaten to close Arecibo, world's largest radio telescope}}
Like any project of prolonged duration, there are factors that may result in its termination. Some of these are detailed below:

===Potential closure of Arecibo Observatory===

At present, SETI@home procures its data from the [[Arecibo Observatory]] facility operated by the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center and administered by [[Cornell University]].

The decreasing operating budget for the observatory has created a shortfall of funds which has not been made up from other sources such as private donors, [[NASA]], other foreign research institutions, nor private non-profit organizations such as SETI@home.

However, in the overall longterm views held by many involved with the SETI project, any usable radio telescope could take over from Arecibo, as all the SETI systems are portable and relocatable.

===Alternative distributed computing projects===
When the project was launched there were few alternative ways of donating computer time to research projects. However, there are now [[List of distributed computing projects|many other projects]] that are competing for such time.

===More restrictive computer use policies in businesses===
In one documented case, an individual was fired for explicitly importing and using the SETI@home software on computers used for the U.S. state of Ohio.<ref>{{cite web |date=2004-10-09  |author=John Adams |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/databases/blog/2004/10/knock_down_then_kick.html |title=Knock Down, Then Kick - O'Reilly Databases |publisher=Oreillynet.com |accessdate=2009-05-17}}</ref> In another incident a school IT director resigned after his installation reportedly cost his school district $1 million in removal costs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,578993,00.html?test=latestnews |title=Arizona School Employee Loses Job Searching for Aliens |publisher=FoxNews.com |date=2004-10-09 |accessdate=2009-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/education/admin-fired-for-incompetence-not-alien-search/3408 |title=Admin fired for incompetence, not alien search |publisher=ZDnet.com |date=2009-12-02 |accessdate=2013-11-20}}</ref> Police are investigating the incident.

{{As of|2005|10|16}}, approximately one third of the processing for the non-BOINC version of the software was performed on work or school based machines.<ref>{{cite web | author = SETI@home | year = 2005 | url = http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/stats/venues.html | title = SETI@home computer venues | accessdate = 2006-06-12}}</ref> As many of these computers will give reduced privileges to ordinary users, it is possible that much of this has been done by [[network administrator]]s.

To some extent, this may be offset by better connectivity to home machines and increasing performance of home computers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

===Funding===
There is currently no government [[funding]] for SETI research, and private funding is always limited.  Berkeley Space Science Lab has found ways of working with small budgets and the project has received donations allowing it to go well beyond its original planned duration, but it still has to compete for limited funds with other SETI projects and other space sciences projects.

In a December 16, 2007 plea for donations, SETI@home stated its present modest state and urged donations for $476,000 needed for continuation into 2008.

===Unofficial clients===
A number of individuals and companies made unofficial changes to the distributed part of the software to try to produce faster results, but this compromised the integrity of all the results.<ref>{{cite journal | title = The SETI@Home Problem | journal = Crossroads | year = 2000 | first = David | last = Molnar | volume = 7 | issue = 1| id = | url = http://oldwww.acm.org/crossroads/xrds7-1/september2000.html | accessdate = 2011-01-30}}</ref> As a result, the software had to be updated to make it easier to detect such changes, and discover unreliable clients.  [[BOINC]] will run on unofficial clients; however, clients that return different and therefore incorrect data are not allowed, so corrupting the result database is avoided.
BOINC relies on cross-checking to validate data<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/SecurityIssues |title=SecurityIssues - BOINC - Trac |publisher=Boinc.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2009-05-17}}</ref> but unreliable clients need to be identified, to avoid situations when two of these report the same invalid data and therefore corrupt the database.
A very popular unofficial client (lunatic) allows users to take advantage of the special features provided by their processor(s) such as [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]], [[SSE2]], [[SSE3]], [[SSSE3]] and [[SSE4|SSE4.1]] to allow for faster processing. The only downside to this is that if the user selects features that their processor(s) do not support, the chances of bad results and crashes rise significantly. {{Citation Needed|date=October 2014}} Tools (such as [[CPU-Z]]) are freely available to tell users what features are supported by their processor(s).

===Hardware and database failures===
Currently{{when|date=May 2014}} SETI@home is a test bed for further development not only of [[BOINC]] but of other hardware and software (database) technology. Under SETI@home processing loads these experimental technologies can be more challenging than expected, as SETI databases don't have typical accounting and business data or relational structures. Non-traditional database uses often do incur greater processing overheads and risk of database corruption and outright database failure. Hardware, software and database failures can (and do) cause dips in project participation.

The project has had to shut down several times to change over to new databases capable of handling larger datasets. Hardware failure has proven to be a substantial source of project shutdowns—as hardware failure is often coupled with database corruption.

The '''real de a ocho''', also known as the '''Spanish dollar''', the '''eight-real coin''', or the '''[[coin|piece]] of eight''' (Spanish ''[[peso]] de ocho''), is a [[silver]] [[coin]], of approximately 38&nbsp;mm diameter, worth eight [[Spanish real|reales]], that was minted in the [[Spanish Empire]] after a Spanish currency reform in 1497. Its purpose was to correspond to the German [[thaler]].

The Spanish dollar was widely used by many countries as international currency because of its uniformity in standard and milling characteristics. Some countries countersigned the Spanish dollar so it could be used as their local currency.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124716/coin/16030/Dissemination-of-Hispanic-American-coinage|title= Dissemination of Hispanic-American coinage|publisher= Enclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2012-02-07}}</ref>

The Spanish dollar was the coin upon which the original [[United States dollar]] was based, and it remained [[legal tender]] in the [[United States]] until the [[Coinage Act of 1857]]. Because it was widely used in [[Europe]], the [[Americas]], and the [[Far East]], it became the first [[world currency]] by the late 18th century.<ref name="Woodcock2009">{{cite book|author=Ray Woodcock|title=Globalization from Genesis to Geneva: A Confluence of Humanity|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N_75TAjONToC|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4251-8853-5|pages=104–105}}</ref><ref name="Osborne2012">{{cite book|author=Thomas J.

Diverse theories link the origin of the [[Dollar sign|"$" symbol]] to the columns and stripes that appear on one side of the Spanish dollar.

The term [[peso]] was used in Spanish to refer to this denomination, and it became the basis for many of the currencies in the former Spanish colonies, including the [[Argentine peso|Argentine]], [[Bolivian peso|Bolivian]], [[Chilean peso|Chilean]], [[Colombian peso|Colombian]], [[Costa Rican peso|Costa Rican]], [[Cuban peso|Cuban]], [[Dominican peso|Dominican]], [[Ecuadorian peso|Ecuadorian]], [[Guatemalan peso|Guatemalan]], [[Honduran peso|Honduran]], [[Mexican peso|Mexican]], [[Nicaraguan peso|Nicaraguan]], [[Paraguayan peso|Paraguayan]], [[Philippine peso|Philippines]], [[Puerto Rican peso|Puerto Rican]], [[Peruvian real|Peruvian]], [[Salvadoran peso|Salvadoran]], [[Uruguayan peso|Uruguayan]], and [[Venezuelan peso|Venezuelan]] pesos.

Millions of Spanish [[dollar]]s were minted over the course of several centuries. They were among the most widely circulating [[coin]]s of the colonial period in the Americas, and were still in use in [[North America]] and in [[South-East Asia]] in the 19th century.

==History==
{{main|Currency of Spanish America}}

===Etymology of dollar===
In the 16th century, Count [[Hieronymus Schlick]] of [[Bohemia]] began minting coins known as ''[[Joachimsthaler]]s'' (from German ''thal,'' or nowadays usually ''Tal,'' "valley", cognate with "[[dale (landform)|dale]]" in English), named for [[Joachimsthal]], the valley in the [[Ore Mountains]] where the silver was mined (St. Joachim's Valley, now [[Jáchymov]]; then part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], now part of the Czech Republic).<ref name="NatGeo">National Geographic. June 2002. p. 1. ''Ask Us''.</ref> Joachimstaler was later shortened to ''taler'', a word that eventually found its way into Norwegian, Danish and Swedish as ''daler'', Czech and Slovene as ''tolar'', Polish as ''talar'', Dutch as ''daalder'', Amharic as ''talari'', Hungarian as ''tallér'', Italian as ''tallero'', Greek as ''taliro'' (??????), and English as ''dollar''.<ref name="NatGeo"/>

The Joachimsthalers weighed 451 [[Troy grain]]s (29.2 g) of silver. So successful were these coins that similar thalers were minted in [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and France. The Burgundian Cross Thaler depicted the [[Cross of Burgundy]] and was prevalent in the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] that were revolting against the Spanish king and Duke of Burgundy [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]. After 1575, the [[Seven United Provinces|Dutch revolting provinces]] replaced the currency with a [[Thaler#Dutch_daalder|daalder]] depicting a lion, hence its Dutch name leeuwendaalder.

Specifically to facilitate export trade, the leeuwendaalder was authorized to contain 427.16 grains of .750 fine silver, lighter than the large denomination coins then in circulation. Clearly it was more advantageous for a Dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in leeuwendaalders rather than in other heavier, more costly coins. Thus, the leeuwendaalder or ''lion dollar'' became the coin of choice for foreign trade. It became popular in the Middle East, and colonies in the east and west.

They also circulated throughout the English colonies during the Seventeenth and early Eighteenth centuries. From [[New Netherland]] (New York) the lion dollar spread to all [[thirteen colonies]] in the west. English speakers began to apply the word "dollar" also to the Spanish peso or "piece of eight" by 1581, which was also widely used in the British North American colonies at the time of the American Revolution, hence adopted as the name of the US monetary unit in the late 18th century.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', entry on "dollar," definition 2 ("The English name for the peso or piece of eight (i.e. eight reales), formerly current in Spain and the Spanish American colonies").</ref><ref>http://www.coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIntros/DutchCoins.html</ref><ref>http://www.coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIntros/Lion-Dollar.intro.html</ref>

===Spain===
After the introduction of the [[Guldengroschen]] in [[Austria]] in 1486, the concept of a large silver coin with high purity (sometimes known as "specie" coinage) eventually spread throughout the rest of Europe. Monetary reform in Spain brought about the introduction of an 8-real coin in 1497. In 1537 the Spanish Escudo Gold Coin was introduced, which was worth 16 reales. The later Gold Doubloon was worth 32 reales or 2 escudos.  It is this divisibility into 8 which caused the silver coins to be names "Pieces of Eight".

[[File:17th Century Spanish Treasure Silver 8 Reales Cob Coin.jpg|thumb|left|A silver Spanish 8-Reales coin minted in México c1650]]In the following centuries, and into the 19th century, the coin was minted with several different designs at various mints in Spain and the [[New World]], having gained wide acceptance beyond Spain's borders. Thanks to the vast silver deposits that were found in Mexico (for example, at [[Taxco, Guerrero|Taxco]] and [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]]) and [[Potosí]] in modern-day [[Bolivia]], and to silver from Spain's possessions throughout the [[Americas]], mints in Mexico and [[Peru]] also began to strike the coin. The main New World mints for Spanish dollars were at Potosí, [[Lima]], and [[Mexico City]] (with minor mints at [[Bogotá]], [[Guatemala City]], and [[Santiago]]), and silver dollars from these mints could be distinguished from those minted in Spain by the Pillars of Hercules design on the reverse. In the 19th century, the coin's denomination was changed to 20 reales (based on 20 ''reales de vellón'') and finally 2 escudos.

Spain's adoption of the [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] in 1869 and its joining the [[Latin Monetary Union]] meant the effective end of the last vestiges of the Spanish dollar in Spain itself. However, the 5-peseta coin (or ''duro'') was slightly smaller and lighter but was also of high purity (90%) silver.

In the 1990s, commemorative 2000-peseta coins were minted, similar in size and weight to the 8 reales and also with high fineness.

===Mexico===
Following independence in 1821, Mexican coinage of silver reales and gold escudos followed that of Spanish lines until [[decimalization]] and the introduction of the peso. The Mexican 8-reales coin (eventually becoming a 1-peso coin) continued to be a popular international trading coin throughout the 19th century.

After 1918, the peso was reduced in size and fineness, with further reductions in the 1940s and 1950s. However, 2- (1921), 5- (1947) and 10- (1955) peso coins were minted during the same period with sizes and fineness similar to the old peso.

===Ireland and British colonies===
The term ''cob'' was used in Ireland and the British colonies to mean a piece of eight or a Spanish-American dollar, because Spanish-American gold and silver coins were irregularly shaped and crudely struck during this period.

===Australia===
When the [[colony of New South Wales]] was founded in [[Australia]] in 1788, it ran into the problem of a lack of coinage. In 1812, Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] took the initiative of using £10,000 in Spanish dollars sent by the British government. To prohibit use outside the colony and to double the number of coins, they simply punched out the centers of the coins. Both the central plug (known as the "dump") and rims (known as [[Holey dollar|"holey dollars"]]) were stamped with a sunburst. The punched centers were valued at 15 [[British One Penny coin (pre-decimal)|pence]] and the outer rims became five-[[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] pieces. The mutilated coins became the first official currency produced specifically for circulation in Australia.<ref>[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/highlights/holey_dollar National Museum of Australia collection highlights: Holey dollar]</ref>

===United States===
The [[Coinage Act of 1792]] created the [[United States Mint]], but the first U.S. dollars were not as popular as the Spanish dollars, which were heavier and were made of finer [[silver]]. Indeed:

<blockquote>
By far the leading specie coin circulating in America was the Spanish silver dollar, defined as consisting of 387 grains of pure silver. The dollar was divided into "pieces of eight," or "bits," each consisting of one-eighth of a dollar. Spanish dollars came into the North American colonies through lucrative trade with the West Indies. The Spanish silver dollar had been the world's outstanding coin since the early 16th century, and was spread partially by dint of the vast silver output of the Spanish colonies in Latin America. More important, however, was that the Spanish dollar, from the 16th to the 19th century, was relatively the most stable and least debased coin in the Western world
<ref name=Rothbard>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]], [http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard260.html Commodity Money in Colonial America], ''[[LewRockwell.com]]''</ref>
</blockquote>

An eight-real coin nominally weighed 550.209 Spanish grains, which is 423.900 troy/avoirdupois [[grain (measure)|grain]]s ({{convert|0.883125|ozt|g|3|lk=in|disp=or}}), 0.93055 fine, so contained {{convert|0.821791|ozt|g|3}} or 394.460 grains fine silver. Its weight and purity varied significantly between mints and over the centuries. In contrast, the [[Coinage Act of 1792]] specified that the U.S. dollar would contain 371 {{frac|4|16}} grain (24.1&nbsp;g) pure or 416 grain (27.0&nbsp;g) standard silver. This specification was based on the average weight of a random selection of worn Spanish dollars which [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]] caused to be weighed at the Treasury.

The coins had a nominal value of eight ''reales'' ("royals").

Before the [[American Revolution]], owing to British [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies, there was a chronic shortage of British currency in Britain's colonies. Trade was often conducted with Spanish dollars that had been obtained through illicit trade with the [[West Indies]]. Spanish coinage was legal tender in the United States until the [[Coinage Act of 1857]] discontinued the practice. The pricing of equities on U.S. stock exchanges in ?-dollar denominations persisted until the [[New York Stock Exchange]] converted first to pricing in sixteenths of a dollar on June 24, 1997, and shortly after that, to decimal pricing.

===Asia===
[[File:1888 México 8 Reals Trade Coin Silver.jpg|thumb|left|1888 Mexican 8 Real coin with Chinese "chop" marks]]Long tied to the lore of [[pirate|piracy]], "pieces of eight" were manufactured in the Americas and [[Spanish treasure fleet|transported]] in bulk back to Spain, making them a very tempting target for seagoing pirates. The [[Manila galleon]]s transported Mexican silver to [[Manila]] in the Spanish [[Philippines]], where it would be exchanged for Philippine and Chinese goods, since silver was the only foreign commodity China would accept. In Oriental trade, Spanish dollars were often stamped with Chinese characters known as "chop marks" which indicated that particular coin had been [[Metallurgical assay|assay]]ed by a well-known merchant and determined to be genuine. The specifications of the Spanish dollar became a standard for trade in the Far East, with later Western powers issuing [[trade dollar]]s, and colonial currencies such as the [[Hong Kong dollar]], to the same specifications.

The first [[Chinese yuan]] coins had the same specification as a Spanish dollar, leading to a continuing equivalence in some respects between the names "yuan" and "dollar" in the [[Chinese language]].

==Fiction==
In modern pop culture and fiction, "Pieces of Eight" are most often associated with [[Pirates in popular culture|the popular notion of pirates]].

===Fictional portrayals===
* In [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Treasure Island]]'', [[Long John Silver]]'s [[parrot]] had apparently been trained to cry out, "Pieces of eight!" This use tied the coin (and parrots) to [[pirates in popular culture|fictional depictions of pirates]]. Deriving from the wide popularity of this book, "Pieces of eight" is sometimes used to mean "money" or "a lot of money", regardless of specific denomination.
** In one episode of [[The Book of Pooh]], they play pirates, in this game, Kessie the bluebird plays the part of the captain's parrot, and instead of squawking, "Pieces of eight!" She would squawk, "Pizzas at eight" in order to "remind us when dinner is," as Captain Tigger ordered.
** In [[Terry Pratchett|Terry Pratchett's]] [[Going Postal]], Reacher Gilt's cockatoo says 'Twelve and a half percent!'
* In ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' the Pirate Lords must meet together by presenting the "Nine Pieces of Eight", since these Pieces were used to seal the goddess [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]] in [[Tia Dalma|her human form]] by the first Brethren Court. As the Pirate Lords were, at the time of sealing Calypso into her human form, too poor to offer real Spanish dollars, they opted to use personal talismans instead, except for the "ninth piece of eight" ([[Jack Sparrow|Jack Sparrow's]]), which was an actual piece of eight that is hanging off his bandana in all movies.
* In [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[The Baroque Cycle]]'' numismatics, gold and pieces of eight are an integral part of the plot.
* In [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', Pieces of Eight are also mentioned among the types of currency that the title character encounters.
*Pieces of eight are used as currency in the ''[[Monkey Island (series)|Monkey Island]]'' series of video games.
*Pieces of eight are the currency used in the video game ''[[Puzzle Pirates]]''.
*[[Pieces of Eight]] is the eighth studio album and second concept album by [[Styx (band)|Styx]], released on September 1, 1978.
*Pieces of Eight is a palour spelling game popular in America during the 1940s-50's, where small letter tiles are used competitively to spell answers to questions presented to a group.

WARN  - 2014-11-30 14:43:06.311; org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.SolrWriter; Error creating document : SolrInputDocument(fields: [contents={{Central Asian music}}The '''[[music]]''' of the [[nomad]]ic and [[rural]] '''[[Turkmen people]]''' is closely related to [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz]] and [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] [[folk music|folk forms]]. Important musical traditions in Turkmen music include traveling [[singer]]s and [[shaman]]s called ''[[bakshy]]'', who act as [[Faith healing|healer]]s and [[Magician (paranormal)|magicians]] and sing either [[a cappella]] or with instruments such as the two-stringed [[lute]] called [[dutar]].

Turkmenistan's national poet is [[Magtumguly Pyragy]], from the 18th century, who wrote four line [[goshuk]] lyrics. The [[Central Asian classical music]] tradition [[mugam]] is also present in Turkmenistan by name as the [[mukamlar]] [http://www.hauntedink.com/almaty/photos8.html].

==National anthem==

As a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republic]], Turkmenistan's [[national anthem]] was "Turkmenistan", composed by [[Veli Mukhatov]] with words by [[Aman Kekilov]]. In 1997 (well after independence), the anthem was changed to "[[Independent, Neutral, Turkmenistan State Anthem]]", the music and lyrics of which were written by President-for-Life [[Saparmurat Niyazov]].

==Dutar==
{{main|Dutar}}
The dutar is the most representative instrument of Turkmen folk music. It is used in many styles, ranging from the [[mukamlar]] and [[salt?klar]] to the [[kirklar]] and [[navoi]]. These are performed by professional musicians called ''sazanda''.

==Tuiduk==
{{main|Zurna}}
Tuiduk is a wind instrument (similar to [[Zurna]]). Turkmen say that Adam who was moulded from clay had no soul. It was only due to the melodious tuiduk playing Archangel Gabriel could breathe life into him. According to a Turkmen legend the main role in tuiduk invention was played by the devil. There is a ritual of inviting guests for a celebration which has survived from ancient times. Two tuiduk players stand in front each other, point their instruments upwards and play in unison. While doing this they perform magic circular movements which remind that this ritual used to be linked to [[shamanism]].

==Dili tuiduk==
{{main|Dili tuiduk}}
The '''Dili tuiduk''' is a [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] [[woodwind instrument]].  It is a [[clarinet]]-like, [[single-reed instrument]] used mainly in Turkmen folk music. 
The instrument's range is greater than its six finger holes would suggest, the upper registers being attained by breath control.
Dili tuiduk of the Turkmen can be carved in a couple of minutes by a shepherd in the springtime, when reeds grow tall, but a set of brass instruments for a police band needs an investment of money and time to arrive in town.
*http://afghanistan.wesleyan.edu/instruments/images/image6.jpg

==Gagri tuiduk==

{{main|Ney}}
Gargy-tuyduk this is a long reed flute whose origin, according to legend, is connected with Alexander of Macedonia, and a similar instrument existed in ancient Egypt.  Attention has been drawn to the possible origin of the instrument's name, gargy, from gargysh, gargamak, gargysha galmak and gargysh etmek among the Turkic people meaning "curse".  There is also said to be a connection with Kargyra and Kharkhira, the style of guttural singing for two voices of the northern Turkic-speaking peoples (Khakass, Yakut and Tuva peoples).  The sound of the gargy-tuyduk has much in common with the two-voiced kargyra.

==Bakshy==
{{main|Bakshy}}
Bakshy were formerly the most important musicians in Turkmen society, along with ''[[tuidukist]]s''. They played the dutar to celebrate [[wedding]]s, [[childbirth|births]], and other events.

==Mugam==
{{main|Mugam}}
Mugam is a pan-Central Asian style of classical music, performed in Turkmenistan by a dutarist and [[gidjakist]], or by an ensemble of just dutarists [http://intangiblenet.freenet.uz/en/tur/tur332.htm].

[[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyzstani]] music is [[nomad]]ic and rural, and is closely related to [[Turkmenistan|Turkmen]] and [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] [[folk music|folk forms]]. Kyrgyz folk music is characterized by the use of long, sustained pitches, with [[Ethnic Russian music|Russian]] elements also prominent.

==Traditional music==
Travelling musicians and [[shaman]]s called [[manaschi]] are popular for their singing and [[komuz]]-playing. Their music is typically heroic [[Epic poetry|epics]], such as the most famous story, the ''[[Epic of Manas|Manas epic]]'' (20 times longer than [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]]), which is the patriotic tale of a warrior named [[Epic of Manas|Manas]], and his descendants, who fight with the [[Chinese people|Chinese]].<ref name="roughguide">Broughton, Simon and Sultanova, Razia. "Bards of the Golden Road". 2000. In Broughton, Simon and Ellingham, Mark with McConnachie, James and Duane, Orla (Ed.), ''World Music, Vol. 2: Latin & North America, Caribbean, India, Asia and Pacific'', pp 24-31. Rough Guides Ltd, Penguin Books. ISBN 1-85828-636-0</ref> There are modern reciters of the ''Manas'' who are very popular, such as [[Rysbek Jumabaev]] and [[Sayaqbay Karalaev]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Almaty or Bust|work=Central Asia in Words and Pictures|accessdate=September 27, 2005 |url=http://www.hauntedink.com/almaty/photos4a.html}}</ref>

Aside from the komuz, Kyrgyz folk instruments include the [[kyl kiak]] (qyl-qyiyak), a two-stringed upright bow instrument (cf. [[fiddle]]), [[sybyzgy]], a side-blown [[flute]], [[chopo-choor]] and the [[temir ooz komuz]] (mouth komuz), also known as [[jaw harp]] in some countries. The komuz is the national instrument of Kyrgyzstan. It is a plucked string instrument. The kyl kiak, however, is also an important symbol of Kyrgyz identity. It is a string instrument, related to the Mongolian [[morin khuur]], and is associated with horses and the vital role they play in Kyrgyz culture.<ref name="com" />  [[Shaman]]istic elements of Kyrgyz folk culture remain, including the [[dobulba]] (a [[frame drum]]), the [[asa-tayak]] (a wooden device decorated with bells and other objects) and the earlier mentioned [[kyl kiak]].

A widespread variety of instrumental music called ''[[kui]]'' (or ''küü'') tells narratives that revolve around a musical journey.<ref name="roughguide" /> The narrative, which is entirely expressed without words, is sometimes punctuated with exaggerated gestures to mark important parts of the story.<ref name="com" />

The modern state of [[Kazakhstan]] is home to the Kazakh State Kurmangazy Orchestra of Folk Instruments, the Kazakh State Philharmonic Orchestra, the Kazakh National Opera and the Kazakh State Chamber Orchestra. The folk instrument orchestra was named after [[Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly]], a famous composer and [[dombra]] player from the 19th century.

==Traditional music==
[[File:Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly monument in Almaty.JPG|right|280 px|thumb| Kurmangazy Sagyrbay-uly's statue in Almaty]]
When referring to traditional Kazakh music, authentic folklore must be separated from "folklorism". The latter denotes music executed by academically trained performers who aim at preserving the traditional music for coming generations. 
As far as can be reconstructed, the music of Kazakhstan from the period before a strong Russian influence consists of following genres:
* '''Instrumental music''', with the pieces ("Küy") being performed by soloists. Text is often seen in the background (or "program") for the music, as a lot of Küy titles refer to stories.
* '''Vocal music''', either as part of a ceremony such as a wedding (mainly performed by women), or as part of a feast. Here we might divide into sub genres: epic singing, containing not only historical facts, but as well the tribe's genealogy, love songs, didactic verses; and as a special form the composition of two or more singers in public (Aitys), of dialogue character and usually unexpectedly frankly in content.

==Russian and Soviet-era music==
[[Image:Dombra.png|thumb|right|170px|Postage stamp depicting a ''dombra'', the most popular traditional musical instrument of Kazakhstan]]
{{See also|Soviet music}}

The Russian influence on the music life in Kazakhstan can be seen in two spheres:
First, the introduction of musical academic institutions such as concert houses with opera stages, conservatories, where the European music was performed and taught, second, by trying to incorporate Kazakh traditional music into these academic structures.
Controlled by the [[Russian Empire]] and then the [[Soviet Union]], Kazakhstan's folk and classical traditions became connected with [[ethnic Russian music]] and Western European music.  Prior to the 20th century, Kazakh folk music was collected and studied by [[ethnography|ethnographic]] research teams including [[composer]]s, [[music critic]]s and [[musicology|musicologist]]s.  In the first part of the 19th century, Kazakh music was transcribed in linear [[musical notation|notation]].  Some composers of this era set Kazakh folk songs to Russian-style [[European classical music]].

The Kazakhs themselves, however, did not write their own music in notation until 1931.  Later, as part of the Soviet Union, Kazakh folk culture was encouraged in a sanitized manner designed to avoid political and social unrest.  The result was a bland derivative of real Kazakh folk music.  In 1920, [[Aleksandr Zatayevich]], a Russian official, created major works of art music with melodies and other elements of Kazakh folk music.  Beginning in 1928 and accelerating in the 1930s, he also adapted traditional Kazakh instruments for use in Russian-style ensembles, such as by increasing the number of [[fret]]s and [[strings (music)|strings]].  Soon, these styles of modern orchestral playing became the only way for musicians to officially play; Kazakh folk was turned into patriotic, professional and socialist endeavors [http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/publictn/46/touda/touda-eng.html].

==Musical institutions==
The Musical-Dramatic Training College, founded in 1931, was the first institute of higher education for music. Two years later, the Orchestra of Kazakh Folk Musical Instruments was formed [http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/publictn/46/touda/touda-eng.html].
The Foundation Asyl Mura is archivating and publishing historical recordings of geat samples of Kazakh music both traditional and classical.
The leading Conservatoire is in Almaty, the Qurmanghazy Conservatoire. It currently competes with the national conservatoire in Astana, Kazakhstans capital.

==Musical traditional instruments==
{{main|Kazakh national musical instruments}}
[[File:1990 CPA 6247.jpg|right|300 px|thumb| Traditional instruments of Kazakhstan ]]
The most popular traditional instruments are string instruments. First of them is the Dombra, the most popular and the oldest Kazakh music instrument. Some argue that nomands have used similar two-string instruments more than two thousand years ago.<ref>[http://musicheritage.nlrk.kz/index.php/ru/page/show/102 Musical Heritage of Kazakhstan]</ref>  The dombra is a long-necked lute with two strings tuned in the interval of a fourth or sometimes a fifth. The strings are plucked or strummed by the right hand without a plectrum.
 
The other instrument playing an important role is the Qobyz, which is a bowed instrument held between the legs. It is made of carved wood for the body, animal skin for the resonator, and horse hair for the strings, and the bow. The Qobyz is said to have been invented by the legendary shaman Qorqyt, long before the medieval ages.
The "Zhetigen" ("Seven strings") could be seen as a member of the cither family, finding equivalents in China, with the strings being divided each in two parts of different lengths, the bridge being movable and consisting of small bone.

For more information on individual instruments, see:

* [[Dombra]]
* [[Kobyz]]
* [[Jew's harp]] (temir komuz)

==The contemporary situation: Revival==
The current situation could be described as the effort to rediscover the traditional music as it had been practiced before the heavy influence of European musical styles.  Although the quality of the performances and the striving for authenticity cannot be ignored, it is for methodological reasons important to remember that the contemporary musicians performing among traditional folk music are all well trained professionals (Rauchan Orazbaeva, Ramazan Stamgazi).

Another very challenging aspect arises from the young composers generation, and the rock and jazz musicians, as they aim to incorporate their traditional heritage into the music they learned from the western cultures, thus forming a new stage of "ethnic contemporary classics", respectively ethnic rock or jazz music that sounds distinctly Kazakh. For the classical sector outstanding: Aqtoty Raimkulova, for jazz: "Magic of Nomads", Rock: Roksonaki, Urker, Ulytau, Aldaspan.

The emergence of opera and ballet in Azerbaijan is associated with the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] and [[Azerbaijan SSR|Soviet era]] of Azerbaijani history when Azerbaijani musicians became exposed to European music traditions first-hand. The very first documented performance of an opera in Baku took place in May 1889 when [[Alexey Verstovsky]]'s opera ''[[Askold's Grave (opera)|Askold's grave]]'' was staged at a circus arena in Baku (on the site of the current [[Azerbaijan Carpet Museum]] building), accompanied by the folk choir of Dmitry Agrenev-Slavyanski. Beginning in 1900, opera troupes toured Baku on a yearly basis (except 1901 and 1913), featuring prominent singers of the time such as [[Natalia Ermolenko-Yuzhina]] and [[Antonina Nezhdanova]].

Prominent Azerbaijani opera singers such as [[Bulbul]], [[Shovkat Mammadova]], [[Fatma Mukhtarova]], [[Huseyngulu Sarabski]], [[Hagigat Rzayeva]], [[Rashid Behbudov]], [[Rauf Atakishiyev]], [[Muslim Magomayev (musician)|Muslim Magomayev]], [[Lutfiyar Imanov]], [[Fidan Gasimova|Fidan]] and [[Khuraman Gasimova]]s, [[Rubaba Muradova]], [[Zeynab Khanlarova]] and many other singers gained world fame.<ref>{{Cite news| title = ?????? ??????????????? ?????| url=http://azcongress.info/stati-2013/159-vypusk-2-298-25-yanvarya-2013-goda/8454-zvezdy-azerbajdzhanskoj-opery| publisher=????????????? ??????????????? ????????| date= | accessdate = }}</ref>

== Folk music ==
{{Main|Azerbaijani folk music}}

Most songs recount stories of real life events and [[Azerbaijani folklore]], or have developed through song contests between troubadour poets.<ref>Broughton, Simon and Sultanova, Razia. "Bards of the Golden Road". 2000.  In Broughton, Simon and Ellingham, Mark with McConnachie, James and Duane, Orla (Ed.), ''World Music, Vol. 2: Latin & North America, Caribbean, India, Asia and Pacific'', pp 24–31. Rough Guides Ltd, Penguin Books. ISBN 978-1-85828-636-5</ref> Corresponding to their origins, folk songs are usually played at weddings, funerals and special festivals.

Regional folk music generally accompanies folk dances, which vary significantly across regions. The regional mood also affects the subject of the folk songs, e.g. folk songs from the [[Caspian Sea]] are lively in general and express the customs of the region. Songs about betrayal have an air of defiance about them instead of sadness, whereas the further south travelled in Azerbaijan the more the melodies resemble a [[lament]].<ref name="folkmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/music/folk.html|title=Folk Music: Story of a Nation|work=Turkishculture.org|accessdate=November 10, 2003 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030810193354/http://www.turkishculture.org/music/folk.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = August 10, 2003}}</ref>

As this genre is viewed as a music of the people, musicians in socialist movements began to adapt folk music with contemporary sounds and arrangements in the form of [[Protest song|protest music]].

=== Folk instruments ===
[[File:Azerbaijan tradition.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Traditional Azerbaijani clothing and musical instruments.]]
{{See also|Azerbaijani musical instruments|Tar (Azerbaijani instrument)}}
Instruments used in traditional Azeri music include the stringed instruments ''[[Tar (lute)|tar]]'' (skin faced lute), the ''[[kamancha]]'' (skin faced spike fiddle), the ''[[oud]]'', originally ''barbat'', and the ''[[baglama|saz]]'' (long necked lute); the double-reed wind instrument ''[[Balaban (instrument)|balaban]]'', the [[frame drum]] ''[[ghaval]]'', the cylindrical double faced drum ''[[nagara (drum)|nagara]]'' (''[[davul]]''), and the ''[[naqareh|gosha nagara]]'' (pair of small kettle drums). Other instruments include the ''[[garmon]]'' (small accordion), ''[[Dilli kaval|tutek]]'' (whistle flute), and ''[[daf]]'' (frame drum).

Due to the cultural crossbreeding prevalent during the Ottoman Empire, the tutek has influenced various cultures in the Caucasus region, e.g. the [[duduk]]s. The [[zurna]] and naghara duo is also popular in rural areas, and played at [[wedding]]s and other local celebrations.<ref>{{cite web|title=??????????????? ???????|url=http://furorika.ru/svadebnye-obychai-i-tradicii/azerbajdzhanskaja-svadba.html|website=furorika.ru|accessdate=26 June 2014|language=Russian}}</ref>

===Ashiqs===
{{main|Ashiqs of Azerbaijan}}

[[Ashiq]]s are traveling bards who sing and play the [[baglama|saz]], a form of [[lute]].  Their songs are semi-[[improvisation|improvised]] around a common base.

The choice of a particular mugham and a style of performance fits a specific event.<ref name=kent /> The dramatic unfolding in performance is typically associated with increasing intensity and rising pitches,  and a form of poetic-musical communication between performers and initiated listeners.<ref name=kent />

Three major schools of mugham performance existed from the late 19th and early 20th centuries - the region of Garabagh, Shirvan, and Baku. The town of [[Shusha]] of [[Karabakh]] was particularly renowned for this art.

== Popular music ==
Popular music is distinguished from the traditional genres as those styles that entered the Azerbaijani musicality after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], either due to attempts of national modernization from 1918 onwards, the opening of the republic to Western musical influences or modern fusions and innovations from artists themselves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musiqi tarixi|url=http://www.azerbaijans.com/content_281_az.html|website=www.azerbaijans.com|accessdate=26 June 2014|language=Azerbaijani}}</ref>

{{Main|Azerbaijani rock}}

The Azerbaijani rock scene began in the mid-to late 1960s, when popular [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] bands became well-known. Soon, a distinctively Azerbaijani fusion of rock and folk emerged; this was called Azerbaijani rock, a term which nowadays may be generically ascribed to most of Azerbaijani rock.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Azerbaijani Rock|url=http://azerbaijans.com/content_289_en.html|website=azerbaijans.com|accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref> [[Coldünya]] and [[Yuxu]] are the best known group of older classical Azerbaijani rock music.

The '''music of [[Uzbekistan]]''' has reflected the diverse influences that have shaped the country. It is very similar to the music of the [[Middle East]] and is characterized by complicated [[rhythm]]s and [[Meter (music)|meter]]s.<ref>Fierman, William. "Uzbekistan." Microsoft Student 2009 [DVD].

== Classical music of Uzbekistan ==
The music of what is now Uzbekistan has a very long and rich history.<ref>{{cite book|last=Broughton|first=Simon|title=World Music, Vol. 2: Latin & North America, Caribbean, India, Asia and Pacific|year=2000|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=1-85828-636-0|pages=24–31|chapter=Bards of the Golden Road|author2=Razia Sultanova|editor=Simon Broughton, Mark Ellingham, James McConnachie, and Orla Duane}}</ref> [[Shashmaqam]], a Central Asian classical music style, is believed to have arisen in the cities of [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarqand]] in the late 16th century. The term "shashmaqam" translates as ''six maqams'' and refers to the structure of music with six sections in different [[musical mode]]s, similar to classical [[Persian traditional music]]. Interludes of spoken [[Sufi poetry]] interrupt the music, typically beginning at a low [[Register (music)|register]] and gradually ascending to a climax before calming back down to the beginning tone.

After [[Turkestan]] became part of [[tsarist Russia]] in the 19th century, first attempts were taken to record national melodies of Turkestan. Russian musicians helped preserve these melodies by introducing [[musical notation]] in the region. 

In the 1950s, Uzbek folk music became less popular, and the genre was barred from radio stations by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]]. They did not completely dispel the music. Although banned, folk musical groups continued to play their music in their own ways and spread it individually.<ref>{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Theodore|title=The Hundred Thousand Fools of God: Musical Travels in Central Asia (and Queens, New York|year=1997|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253332066}}</ref> After [[Uzbekistan]] gained independence from the [[USSR]] in the early 1990s, public interest revived in traditional Uzbek music. Nowadays Uzbek television and radio stations regularly play traditional music.

The people's Artist of Uzbekistan [[Turgun Alimatov]] is considered by broad musical public and [[ethnomusicologists]] as the first virtuous of Shashmaqam, Uzbek classical and folklore composer, and skilled [[tanbur]], [[dutar]], and [[sato (instrument)|sato]] player. He has gained widespread popularity not only in Uzbekistan, but around the world with his unparalleled mastery in his performances and compositions. His most famous compositions include "Segah", "Chorgoh", "Buzruk", "Navo", and "Tanovar". His image is associated with national pride and has been presented as the symbol of Uzbek classical music to the world.<ref>Matyakubov, O. "A Traditional Musician in Modern Society: A Case Study of Turgun Alimatov's Art". ''[[Yearbook for Traditional Music]]'' 25 (1993), pp. 60-66.</ref> 

Another well-known Uzbek composer is Muhammadjon Mirzayev. His most famous compositions include "Bahor valsi" ("The Spring Waltz") and "Sarvinoz." "Bahor valsi" is played on Uzbek television and radio channels every spring. 

Currently [[Sherali Jo?rayev]] is probably the most famous and influential singer of traditional Uzbek music in Uzbekistan. However, he has fallen out of favor with the [[Uzbek government]] and the latter has banned his performances on all Uzbek TV channels as well as his public performances since 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tol.org/client/article/20832-the-art-of-propaganda.html |title= The Art of Propaganda |date=7 October 2009 |work=EurasiaNet|accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fergananews.com/article.php?id=5089 |title=Uzbekistan: National Singer Sherali Jo?rayev is Sixty.

In recent years, singers such as [[Yulduz Usmonova]] and [[Sevara Nazarkhan]] have brought Uzbek music to global audiences by mixing traditional melodies with modern rhythms and instrumentation.<ref name="NG"/> In the late 2000s, [[Ozodbek Nazarbekov]] emerged as a new popular singer who mixes contemporary music with elements of traditional Uzbek music.

== Contemporary music of Uzbekistan ==
Many forms of popular music, including [[folk music]], [[Pop music|pop]], and [[rock music]], have particularly flourished in Uzbekistan since the early 1990s. Uzbek pop music is well developed, and enjoys mainstream success via pop music media and various radio stations. 

Many Uzbek singers such as [[Shahzoda]] and [[Sogdiana Fedorinskaya]] have achieved commercial success not only in Uzbekistan but also in other [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries such as [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]], and [[Tajikistan]].

===Rock===
[[File:All Tomorrow's Parties at IlkhomRockFest, June 22, 2013..jpg|thumb|All Tomorrow's Parties performing live at IlkhomRockFest, June 22, 2013.]]
Currently [[rock music]] enjoys less popularity than [[pop music]] in Uzbekistan. [[Davron G?oipov]] is one of the most influential [[rock-n-roll]] singers that have contributed to the development of Uzbek rock music. He had a big impact on the successful [[pop-rock]] band [[Bolalar]]. [[Sahar (band)|Sahar]] is another successful rock band that came to prominence in the early 2000s. 

An Uzbekistani [[metal (music)|metal]] band who has some degree of recognition is [[Night Wind]], a [[folk metal]] group.

And, according to a related logic, the musicians themselves speak predictably enough of some local challenges in a recent interview: «Tashkent has its own, unique problems.

===Rap===
[[Rap music]] has become popular among Uzbek youth. Rappers such as [[Shoxrux]] and [[Shahryor]] became very popular among young people in the 2000s. However, the Uzbek government censors rap music. It has set up a special body to censor rap music because it believes this type of music does not fit the Uzbek musical culture.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Catherine|title=Uzbek Government Censors Rap Music|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/63340|accessdate=25 October 2012|newspaper=Euriasianet|date=21 April 2011}}</ref>

'''New Jersey Transit''' (usually shortened to '''NJ Transit''' or '''NJT''') is a New Jersey State-owned [[public transportation]] system serving the [[United States|US]] [[U.S. state|state]] of [[New Jersey]]; [[Manhattan|New York]], [[Orange County, New York|Orange]], and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] counties in [[New York|New York State]]; and [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia County]] in [[Pennsylvania]]. It operates [[bus]], [[light rail]], and [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] services throughout the state, notably connecting to major commercial and employment centers both within the state and in the adjacent cities of [[New York City|New York]] and [[Philadelphia]].

Covering a service area of {{convert|5325|sqmi|km2}}, NJT is the largest statewide public transit system and the third largest provider of bus, rail, and light rail transit by ridership in the United States, linking major points in New Jersey, New York, and Philadelphia.<ref>Vantuono, William C. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1215/is_4_205/ai_n6015709 "New Jersey's innovators: New Jersey Transit's billion-dollar capital budget is focused on creating a unified, statewide network of commuter and light rail lines. New technologies are a key part of that strategy"], ''[[Railway Age]]'', April 2004. Accessed August 22, 2007. "In late 2003, 20 years after portions of the Pennsylvania, Erie-Lackawanna, Jersey Central, and Lehigh Valley railroads or their successors were combined to form the nation's third-largest commuter rail system, Secaucus Junction opened."</ref>

NJT also acts as a purchasing agency for many private operators in New Jersey, with numerous private operators receiving equipment from NJT (primarily buses) for route service within the state not controlled by NJT.

==History==
{{multiple issues|section=yes|
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
{{Expand section|date=January 2007}}
}}
[[File:South Amboy Station 1981.jpg|thumb|left|A [[PRR GG1]], built for the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] in the 1930s–1940s, hauls a commuter train into [[South Amboy (NJT station)|South Amboy]] in 1981.]]
NJT was founded on July 17, 1979, an offspring of the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] (NJDOT), mandated by the state government to address many then-pressing transportation issues.<ref>[http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/an_fi_annual_report_2004.pdf New Jersey Transit 2004 Annual Report, Page 6 ]</ref> It came into being with the passage of the Public Transportation Act of 1979 to "acquire, operate, and contract for transportation service in the public interest."  NJT originally acquired and managed a number of private bus services, one of the largest being those operated by the state's largest electric company, [[Public Service Enterprise Group]].  It gradually acquired most of the state's bus services. In northern New Jersey, many of the bus routes are arranged in a web. In southern New Jersey, most routes are arranged in a "spoke-and-hub" fashion, with routes emanating from [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], and [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]. In addition to routes run by NJT, it subsidizes and provides buses for most of the state's private operators providing fixed route or commuter service, such as [[Coach USA]], [[DeCamp Bus Lines|DeCamp]], [[Lakeland Bus Lines|Lakeland]], and [[Academy Bus|Academy]].

In 1983, NJT assumed operation of all commuter rail service in New Jersey from [[Conrail]], which had been formed in 1976 through the merging of a number of financially troubled railroads and operated commuter railroad service under contract from the NJDOT. It now operates every passenger and commuter rail line in the state except for [[Amtrak]]; the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson]] (PATH), which is owned by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]; the [[PATCO Speedline]], which is owned by the [[Delaware River Port Authority]]; two [[SEPTA]] [[SEPTA Regional Rail|Regional Rail]] lines, the [[West Trenton Line (SEPTA)|West Trenton Line]] and the [[Trenton Line (SEPTA)|Trenton Line]]; and a handful of tourist trains in the southern and northwestern parts of New Jersey.  Since inception, rail ridership has quadrupled.

In the 1990s the rail system expanded, with new [[Midtown Direct]] service to [[New York City]] and new equipment. On October 21, 2001, it opened [[Newark Liberty International Airport (NJT station)|a new station]] at [[Newark Liberty International Airport]]. On December 15, 2003, it opened the [[Secaucus Junction]] transfer station, connecting two major portions of the system, allowing passengers on trains to [[Hoboken Terminal]] to transfer to trains to [[Midtown Manhattan]], saving an estimated 15 minutes over connecting with [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] trains at Hoboken. On October 31, 2005, NJT took over [[Clocker (Amtrak)|Clocker]] (NY-Philadelphia) service from [[Amtrak]].  Four new trains were added to the schedule, but cut back to [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]].

During [[Hurricane Sandy]] in October 2012, the rail operations center of New Jersey Transit was flooded by {{convert|8|ft|m}} of water and an emergency generator submerged. Floodwater damaged at least 65 locomotive engines and 257 rail cars. It was expected to be several weeks before the resumption of service.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sandy pummels West Virginia as grueling recovery begins on East Coast|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/31/us/tropical-weather-sandy/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref>

===Ongoing projects===

====Repair, recovery and resiliency projects====
[[Superstorm Sandy]], on October 29, 2012, caused a 13-foot tidal surge that inundated many coastal communities. A report released in December 2013 by [[Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service]] found that NJT ignored flood warnings and did not follow its own damage mitigation plans.<ref>{{cite news   | title = New Jersey Transit Corporation's After Hurricane Sandy Action Report   | publisher = Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service   | date = December 2013   | url = http://superstormsandyrecovery.com/img/documents/TEEX%20After%20Action%20Report.pdf   | accessdate = 2013-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web   | last = McGrath   | first = Matthew   |author2=Hayes, Melissa    | title = NJ Transit ignored flood warning before Superstorm Sandy, report confirms   | publisher = The Record   | date = December 24, 2013   | url = http://www.northjersey.com/news/transportation/Report_on_NJ_Transit_Sandy_performance_released.html   | accessdate = 2014-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite news   | last = Frassinelli   | first = Mike   | title = Review of NJ Transit's response to Sandy finds need for more coordination, places to shelter trains   | publisher = The Star-Ledger   | date = December 24, 2013   | url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/12/review_of_nj_transits_response_to_sandy_finds_need_for_better_coordination_more_places_to_store_trai.html   | accessdate = 2014-01-07}}</ref> The storm's aftermath left washed-out track; movement of bridge girders; flooded rail stations; fallen catenary and damage to more than 300 pieces of rail equipment left in low-lying areas.

====Bus rapid transit====
{{main|Bus rapid transit in New Jersey}}
Bus rapid transit in New Jersey includes [[limited stop]] bus lines, exclusive bus lanes (XBL) and [[Shoulder (road)#Use as bus-only shoulder|bus bypass shoulders]] (BBS). ''Next Generation Bus''<ref name = nextgen>{{cite web   | last =    | first =    | title = NJ Transit Bus Service: The Next Generation   | work = Presentation APTA   | publisher = New Jersey Transit   | date = April 10, 2010   | url = http://www.apta.com/mc/multimodal/previous/2010/Presentations/New-Jersey-Transit-BRT-Initiatives-Go-Bus28-and-Reuse-of-a-Right-of-way-in-Union-County.pdf   | accessdate = 2012-03-03 }}</ref><ref name = nextgenbrt>{{cite web   | title = Evaluation of Next Generation Bus (BRT- type) Service in the NJTPA Region   | publisher = NPTPA   | url = http://www.njtpa.org/Plan/Studies/next_gen_brt_study.aspx   | accessdate = 2012-04-30}}</ref> is the term used by NJT to refer to the development of numerous [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) systems across the state which are being studied by the agency, [[New Jersey Department of Transportation|NJDOT]],  the [[metropolitan planning organizations of New Jersey]] (MPO), and contract bus carriers. In 2011, NJT announced that it would equip its entire [[New Jersey Transit bus fleet|bus fleet]] with [[Real-time locating system|real-time location]], creating the basis for "next bus" scheduling information at [[bus shelter]]s and web-abled devices and considered an important feature of BRT.

====Northern Branch====
{{main|Northern Branch Corridor Project}}
NJT is planning to extend the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail to [[Englewood, New Jersey|Englewood]] or [[Tenafly, New Jersey|Tenafly]] along the [[Northern Branch]], a freight rail line.<ref>{{cite news | last = Rouse | first = Karen | title = Going with electric trains  | publisher = The Record | date = 2009-07-19 | url = http://www.northjersey.com/news/transportation/bridges_tunnels/Going_with_electric_trains.html | accessdate = 2009-07-19}}</ref> As of 2012, a draft [[environmental impact statement]] has been released, but no funding has been identified.

====Lackawanna Cut-Off====
{{main|Lackawanna Cut-Off (NJ Transit)}}
In May 2001, the State of New Jersey acquired the right-of-way of the [[Lackawanna Cut-Off]].  Constructed by the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] between 1908 and 1911, this provided a direct route with minimal curves and grades between [[Slateford Junction]], two miles (3.25&nbsp;km) below the [[Delaware Water Gap]], and the crest of the [[Water divide|watershed]] at [[Lake Hopatcong]] ([[Port Morris Junction]]), the connection with NJT's [[Montclair-Boonton Line]].  This would restore long-distance service that the [[Erie Lackawanna]] last provided with the ''[[Lake Cities (train)|Lake Cities]]'' in 1970.

At the time of the Cut-Off's construction, the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|DL&W]] had extensive experience with concrete construction, but not on the scale that would be employed on the Cut-Off.  All structures, including stations, bridges, interlocking towers and two large viaducts and thousands of fence posts, were made of concrete.  Despite the lack of maintenance on these structures over the past four decades (and in some cases much longer), most are still in operational or near-operational condition.  A 2004 study by NJT estimated that bringing the line back into operation to [[Scranton, PA]] would cost approximately $350 million.

In 2011, the [[Lackawanna Cut-Off (NJ Transit)|retracking of the Cut-Off]] from Port Morris to [[Andover, NJ|Andover]], a distance of 7.3 miles (11.8&nbsp;km), began.  Re-opening that section is currently slated for 2014. The proposed rehabilitation west of Andover, which has not yet been funded, would provide commuter rail service between [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] and [[Hoboken Terminal]], with connecting service to [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York's Penn Station]]), serving the growing [[Commuter town|exurban]] communities in [[Monroe County, Pennsylvania|Monroe County]] in [[the Poconos]], and in upper [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]] and lower [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]].<ref name="EA report">[http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/Lackawanna%20Draft%20EA.pdf NJ Transit – New Jersey-Pennsylvania Lackawanna Cut-off Passenger Rail Restoration Project Draft Environmental Assessment]</ref>

====Glassboro–Camden Line====
{{main|Glassboro–Camden Line}}
The Glassboro–Camden Line is a {{convert|18|mi|km|2|adj=on}} [[diesel multiple unit]] (DMU) [[light rail]] system planned for [[South Jersey|southwestern part of New Jersey]] in the United States. At its northern end  in [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] it will connect with the [[River LINE]] with which its infrastructure and vehicles will be compatible. At the northern terminus, the [[Walter Rand Transportation Center]], paid transfers will be possible to the [[PATCO Speedline]].<ref name = facts2013>{{cite web   | title = Fact Sheet 2013   | work = Glassboro-Camden Line   | publisher = DVPA & PATCO   | url = http://www.glassborocamdenline.com/images/uploads/GCL_FACTSHEET_2013.pdf   | accessdate = 2012-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release   | title = NJ Transit Board Advances South Jersey Transportation Projects   | work =    | publisher = New Jersey Transit   | date = December 9, 2009   | url = http://www.njtransit.com/tm/tm_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=PressReleaseTo&PRESS_RELEASE_ID=2571   | accessdate = 2012-04-08}}</ref>

===Proposed projects===
{{update|type=section|date=December 2013}}

====West Trenton====
{{main|West Trenton Line (NJ Transit)}}
The West Trenton Line is a proposed service connecting [[West Trenton (SEPTA station)|West Trenton Station]] with [[Pennsylvania Station (Newark)|Newark Penn Station]], connecting with the Raritan Valley Line at [[Bridgewater (NJT station)|Bridgewater]]. As of 2004, NJT's estimate of the cost was $197 million.<ref name=Project016To>[http://www.njtransit.com/tm/tm_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=Project016To West Trenton Line], accessed December 21, 2006</ref>  To date, no funding has been secured.<ref name=Project016To /> Service ran on the line prior to 1983.

====West Shore Commuter Rail Line====
While the Northern Branch has proceeded to the EIS Stage, The West Shore Route is still proposed.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
The route holds great promise since it travels through the heart of NJ Transit Bus Operations Midtown "commutershed", with four bus routes (165,167, 168 & 177) running well beyond capacity.The right-of-way has space for four tracks from Croxton Yard northwards to Dumont. Issues in starting commuter rail service are:
* CSX owns the trackage and uses them heavily to link the NYC area to their national network at Selkirk Yard in upstate New York.
* CSX offered to allow NJ Transit use of the ROW if the agency constructed sound barriers along the entire length of track for commuter operations.
* A city terminal is not connected to this line, since the Weehawken & Pavonia Terminals were demolished decades ago. A loop connecting this line with the North River Tunnels into New York Penn Station where the [https://www.google.com/maps?q=40.772366,-74.044548&num=1&t=h&z=18 West Shore Tracks pass under the Northeast Corridor just south of NJ Route 3 and Tonnelle Ave] would directly connect this line into New York Penn Station. This configuration would provide a 25 minute travel time to New York Penn Station, but would bypass Secaucus Junction, leaving the West Shore with no transfer connection to the rest of New Jersey other than a possible transfer station on Tonnelle Ave with the Hudson Bergen Light Rail.

With these considerable construction issues, as well as no available space in New York Penn Station for West Shore Line trains, this proposal was put on hold until capacity into New York is increased.

====Passaic-Bergen Rail Line====
{{main|Passaic-Bergen Rail Line}}
The '''Passaic-Bergen Passenger Rail Project''' would reintroduce passenger service on the [[New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway]] [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] between [[Hawthorne, New Jersey|Hawthorne]] and [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] using new [[Diesel Multiple Unit]] rail cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njtransit.com/tm/tm_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=PressReleaseTo&PRESS_RELEASE_ID=2313 |title=New Jersey Transit |publisher=Njtransit.com |date=2007-04-18 |accessdate=2013-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/bergen/NJ_Transit_to_expand_passenger_train_service.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090519184758/http://www.northjersey.com/bergen/NJ_Transit_to_expand_passenger_train_service.html |archivedate = May 19, 2009 |title=NJ Transit to expand passenger train service |publisher=[[NorthJersey.com]] |accessdate=2013-04-19}}</ref>

Retrieved on 2014-06-23.</ref><ref>[http://www.planning.co.ocean.nj.us/mom/mapofalternatives.htm MOM Map of Alternatives]</ref> line is a proposed south and central New Jersey commuter rail route to [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], Newark and New York's Penn Station. This would restore service previously provided by the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]]. The line was originally proposed by the [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean County]] [[Board of Chosen Freeholders]] in March 1980. It would run on a 40.1-mile rail corridor and would provide diesel commuter rail service from [[Monmouth junction|Monmouth Junction]] ([[South Brunswick, New Jersey|South Brunswick]]), where the Jamesburg Branch partially joins the [[Northeast Corridor]] (NEC), south to [[Lakehurst, New Jersey|Lakehurst]] in the interior of northern [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean County]]. As of 2006, the line was opposed by Jamesburg and Monroe Township.<ref>[http://ebs.gmnews.com/news/2006/0302/Front_page/003.html New tunnel may add riders to MOM Line]</ref>

From [[Monmouth junction|Monmouth Junction]] the line would continue southeast to [[Jamesburg, New Jersey|Jamesburg]], [[Monroe Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey|Monroe]], [[Englishtown, New Jersey|Englishtown]], [[Manalapan, New Jersey|Manalapan]], [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold Borough]], [[Freehold Township, New Jersey|Freehold Township]], [[Howell, New Jersey|Howell]] and [[Farmingdale, New Jersey|Farmingdale]]. A new rail connection would be required in Farmingdale. It would proceed southward from Farmingdale to Lakehurst, passing through Howell, [[Lakewood, New Jersey|Lakewood]], [[Jackson, New Jersey|Jackson]], [[Toms River, New Jersey|Toms River Township]], and Lakehurst/[[Manchester, New Jersey|Manchester]]. Trains would also operate on the NEC between Monmouth Junction and Newark. Passengers for [[New York]] would transfer at Newark. Eight new stations and a train storage yard would be constructed.

In mid-February 2008, New Jersey Governor [[Jon Corzine]] withdrew the Monmouth Junction alignment from the MOM Plan. Corzine opted to endorse the two remaining alternate alignments (via Red Bank or Matawan-Freehold, the latter which is currently part of the [[Henry Hudson Trail|Henry Hudson rail trail]]. NJT is still planning to study all the routes as to not delay action further on the EIS, and says all three routes are still up for evaluation, although it will take the Governor's comments into consideration.

In late May 2009 representatives of the three counties agreed to back one potential route from Ocean County to Red Bank, instead of to Monmouth Junction, ending years of stalemate. Under that compromise, the line’s southern terminus would be in Lakehurst, and it would run through Lakewood along existing freight tracks to join the North Jersey Coast Line in Red Bank. It also includes the possibility of a spur between Freehold and Farmingdale.<ref>[http://www.app.com/article/20140409/NJNEWS10/304090025/Transit-advocates-push-MOM-commuter-rail-line New Jersey News | The Asbury Park Press NJ]. app.com.

====Lehigh Valley====
In November 2008, the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation (LVEDC), along with both [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh]] and [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton]] counties, commissioned a study to explore extending the Raritan Valley Line to the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of eastern Pennsylvania, which would potentially include stops in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]] and [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]].<ref>[http://www.mcall.com/news/local/all-b4_3norco.6662428nov07,0,7752769.story "County eyes N.J. rail extension to area," ''The Morning Call'', November 7, 2008.]</ref> This would resume passenger service previously provided jointly by the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] and the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]].

===Cancelled projects===

====Access to the Region's Core====
{{main|Access to the Region's Core}}
NJT intended to construct a new two-track Hudson River tunnel adjacent to the two single-track Northeast Corridor tunnels built in the early 20th century by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. NJT referred to the project as '''Access to the Region's Core''', which would have used dual-power locomotives and a new [[rail junction]] at Secaucus, allowing for a one-train ride between the [[Port Jervis Line (Metro-North)|Port Jervis]], [[Main Line (NJ Transit)|Main]], [[Bergen County Line|Bergen County]], [[Pascack Valley Line|Pascack Valley]], and [[Raritan Valley Line|Raritan Valley]] lines and New York Penn Station. The Lehigh and the West Trenton extension plans would require added capacity and the ARC project would provide that capacity.

The project broke ground in June 2009.<ref>[http://www.njtransit.com/nn_press_release.jsp?PRESS_RELEASE_ID=2212 GOVERNOR CORZINE MAKES CAPITAL COMMITMENT FOR NEW TRANS-HUDSON COMMUTER RAIL TUNNEL: Applauds united support from New Jersey and New York senators], press release, dated May 10, 2006</ref> Both the Federal Transit Administration and the Port Authority  made public commitments of $3 billion to the project. However, the project was suspended on October 7, 2010 due to concerns that the State of New Jersey would be solely responsible for projected $5 billion in overruns. On October 27, 2010, Governor [[Chris Christie]] made a final decision to cancel the project. [[Amtrak]] later unveiled the [[Gateway Project]], which addresses some of the issues ARC was meant to resolve.

====Newark-Elizabeth Rail Link====
{{main|Newark-Elizabeth Rail Link}}
Planned to connect [[Downtown Newark]] and [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]] via [[Newark Liberty International Airport]], NJT is no longer pursuing the Newark-Elizabeth Rail Link. The airport has a monorail link to the [[Northeast Corridor]], which runs to both Newark and Elizabeth.

[[File:Weimar Constitution.jpg|thumb|The Weimar Constitution in booklet form. The constitution itself required that it be provided to school children at the time of their graduation.]]
The '''Constitution of the German Reich''' ({{lang-de|Die Verfassung des Deutschen Reichs}}), usually known as the '''Weimar Constitution''' (''Weimarer Verfassung'') was the [[constitution]] that governed [[Germany]] during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–1933). The constitution declared Germany to be a democratic [[parliament]]ary Republic with a parliament elected using [[proportional representation]]. [[Universal suffrage]] was established, with a minimum voting age of 20.

It technically remained in effect throughout the existence of the [[Third Reich]] from 1933 to 1945.

The constitution's title was the same as the [[Constitution of the German Empire]] that preceded it.  The German state's official name was ''Deutsches Reich'' until the adoption of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|1949 Basic Law]].

== Origin ==
Following the end of [[World War I]], a [[German National Assembly]] gathered in the town of [[Weimar]], in the state of [[Thuringia]], in January 1919 to write a constitution for the ''[[Reich]]''. The nation was to be a democratic [[federal republic]], governed by a [[President of Germany (1919–1945)|president]] and [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|parliament]].

The constitution was drafted by the lawyer and liberal politician [[Hugo Preuss]], who was then state secretary in the Ministry of the Interior, and later became Minister of the Interior. Preuss criticized the [[Triple Entente]] decision to prohibit the incorporation of post-[[Austro-Hungarian]]-dissolution [[German Austria]] into the nascent German republic, saying it was a contradiction of the [[Wilsonian]] principle of [[self-determination]] of peoples.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E04EFDD153AE03ABC4C52DFBF668382609EDE&scp=1&sq=%22german+democratic+republic%22&st=p PREUSS DENOUNCES DEMAND OF ALLIES], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 14, 1919</ref>

Disagreements arose between the delegates over issues such as the national flag, religious education for youth, and the rights of the provinces (''Länder'')  that made up the [[Reich]]. These disagreements were resolved by August 1919, though sixty-seven delegates abstained from voting to adopt the Weimar Constitution.

The Republic's first [[President of Germany|President]], [[Friedrich Ebert]], signed the new German constitution into law on August 11, 1919. The constitution is named after Weimar although it was signed into law by Friedrich Ebert in [[Schwarzburg (municipality)|Schwarzburg]]. This is due to the fact that Ebert was on holiday in Schwarzburg, while the parliament working out the constitution was gathered in Weimar.

[[Gerhard Anschütz]] (1867–1948), a noted German teacher of constitutional law, was the leading commentator of the Weimar Constitution.

== Provisions and organization ==
The Weimar Constitution was divided into 5 main parts ''(Hauptteile)''. The two parts were divided into seven and five sections, respectively.  In all, there were over 180 articles in the Constitution.

Some of the more noteworthy provisions are described below, including those provisions which proved significant in the demise of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the rise of the [[Third Reich]].

The [[preamble]] to the Constitution reads:

: ''Das Deutsche Volk einig in seinen Stämmen und von dem Willen beseelt, sein Reich in Freiheit und Gerechtigkeit zu erneuen und zu festigen, dem inneren und dem äußeren Frieden zu dienen und den gesellschaftlichen Fortschritt zu fördern, hat sich diese Verfassung gegeben.''

In English, this can be translated to:

: The German people united in its tribes and inspired with the will to renew and strengthen the Reich in liberty and justice, to serve internal and external tranquility, and to promote social progress, has adopted this Constitution.

=== Main Part I: Composition of the Reich and its Responsibility ===

The first part (''Erster Hauptteil'') of the Constitution specified the organization of the various components of the Reich government.

==== Section 1: The Reich and its States ====

Section 1 consisted of Articles 1 to 19 and established the German Reich as a republic whose power derived from the people. ("The power of the state emanates from the people.") The Reich was defined as the region encompassed by the German states (''Länder''), and other regions could join the Reich based on popular self-determination and Reich legislation.

Section 1 also established that generally recognized principles of international law were binding on Germany and gave the Reich government  exclusive jurisdiction of:
* foreign relations, colonial affairs, citizenship
* freedom of movement
* immigration, emigration, and extradition.
* defense
* customs and trade
* currency and coinage
* postal, telegraph, and telephone service

With the exceptions of the subjects for which the Reich government had exclusive jurisdiction, the states could govern their respective territories as they saw fit.  However, Reich law superseded or nullified state law in the event of a conflict. Adjudication of conflicts between the ''Länder'' and the Reich government was the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

State authorities were required to enforce Reich law and must have a constitution on free state principles. Each state parliament (''[[Landtag]]'') was to be elected by an equal and secret ballot according to representative election. Each state government could serve only so long as it had the confidence of the respective state parliament.

 
=== Section 2: The Reichstag and the Reich Government ===


Articles 20 to 40 described the national [[parliament]], the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'', which was seated in the capital, [[Berlin]].  The Reichstag was composed of representatives elected by the German people by an equal and secret ballot open to all Germans aged 20 or older.  [[Proportional representation]] principles governed Reichstag elections.

Members of the Reichstag represented the entire nation and were bound only to their own conscience.  Members served for four years. The Reichstag could be dissolved by the Reich president and new elections held not more than 60 days after the date of dissolution.

Members of the Reichstag and of each state parliament (''Landtag'') were immune from arrest or investigation of a criminal offense except with the approval of the legislative body to which the person  belonged. The same approval was required for any other restriction on personal freedom which might harm the member's ability to fulfil his duties. (Article 37)

The President served a term of seven years and could be re-elected once. He could be removed from office by [[plebiscite]] upon the vote of two-thirds of the Reichstag. Rejection of the measure by the voters would act as a re-election of the president and causes the Reichstag to be dissolved.  If a state failed to fulfill its obligations under the constitution or Reich law, the president could use armed force to compel the state to do so.  Furthermore, the infamous [[Article 48]] gave the President the power to take measures &mdash; including the use of armed force and/or the suspension of civil rights &mdash; to restore law and order in the event of a serious threat to public safety or Reich security.  The president was required to inform the Reichstag of these measures and the Reichstag could nullify such a presidential decree. ([[Adolf Hitler]] later used this Article to legally sweep away the civil liberties granted in the constitution and facilitate the establishment of a dictatorship.)

The Reich chancellor determined the political guidelines of his government and was responsible to the Reichstag. The chancellor and ministers were compelled to resign in the event the Reichstag passed a [[vote of no confidence]].  The Reich government (cabinet) formulated decisions by majority vote; in the case of a tie, the Reich president's vote was decisive. The Reichstag could accuse the Reich president, chancellor, or any minister of willful violation of the Constitution or Reich law, said case to be tried in the Supreme Court.

=== Section 3: The President of the Reich and the National Ministry ===
Articles 41 to 59 describe the duties of the President, including criteria for the office. Furthermore, they also further explain his relationship to the National Ministry and its relation to the Chancellor.

==== Section 4: The Reichsrat ====

Section 4 consisted of Articles 60 to 67 and established the ''Reichsrat'' (State Council). The Reichsrat was the means by which the states could participate in the making of legislation at the national level. Members of the Reichsrat were members or representatives of the state parliaments, and were bound by the instructions of their respective state governments. Government ministers were required to inform the Reichsrat of proposed legislation or administrative regulations to permit the Reichsrat to voice objections.

==== Section 5: Reich Legislation ====

Articles 68 to 77 specified how legislation is to be passed into law. Laws could be proposed by a member of the Reichstag or by the Reich government and were passed on the majority vote of the Reichstag. Proposed legislation had to be presented to the Reichsrat, and the latter body's objections were required to be presented to the Reichstag.

The Reich president had the power to decree that a proposed law be presented to the voters as a [[plebiscite]] before taking effect.

The Reichsrat was entitled to object to laws passed by the Reichstag. If this objection could not be resolved, the Reich president at his discretion could call for a plebiscite or let the proposed law die. If the Reichstag voted to overrule the Reichsrat's objection by a two-thirds majority, the Reich president was obligated to either proclaim the law into force or to call for a plebiscite.

Constitutional amendments were proposed as ordinary legislation, but for such an amendment to take effect, it was required that two thirds or more of the Reichstag members be present, and that at least two-thirds of the members present voted in favor of the legislation.

The Reich government had the authority to establish administrative regulations unless Reich law specified otherwise.

==== Section 6: Reich Administration ====

Articles 78 to 101 described the methods by which the Reich government administered the constitution and laws, particularly in the areas where the Reich government had exclusive jurisdiction &mdash; foreign relations, colonial affairs, defence, taxation and customs, merchant shipping and waterways, railroads, and so forth.

==== Section 7: Justice ====

Articles 102 to 108 established the justice system of the Weimar Republic. The principal provision established [[judicial independence]] &mdash; judges were subject only to the law.

This section established a Supreme Court and also established administrative courts to adjudicate disputes between citizens and administrative offices of the state.

=== Main Part 2: Basic Rights and Obligations of Germans ===

The second part (''Zweiter Hauptteil'') of the Weimar Constitution laid out the basic rights (''Grundrechte'') and basic obligations (''Grundpflichten'') of Germans.

The [[constitution]] guaranteed individual rights such as the freedom of speech and assembly to each citizen. These were based on the provisions of the earlier [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|constitution of 1848]].

==== Section 1: The Individual ====

Articles 109 to 118 set forth individual rights of Germans, the principal tenet being that every German was equal before the law. Both genders had the same rights and obligations. Privileges based on birth or social status were abolished. Titles of [[nobility]] were abolished.

A citizen of any of the German provinces was likewise a citizen of the Reich.  Germans had the right of mobility and residence, and the right to acquire property and pursue a trade. They had the right to immigrate or emigrate, and the right to Reich protection against foreign authorities.

The "national identity" of foreign language communities in Germany was protected, including the right to use their native language in education, administration, and the judicial system.

Other specific articles stated that:

<div id="article_114">
* The rights of the individual are inviolable. Individual liberties may be limited or deprived only on the basis of law.  Persons have the right to be notified within a day of their arrest or detention as to the authority and reasons for their detention and be given the opportunity to object. This is equivalent to the principle of [[habeas corpus]] in the [[common law]] of England and elsewhere. (Article 114){{Ref label|Article_48|†|}}</div>
<div id="article_115">
* A German's home is an asylum and is inviolable.(Article 115){{Ref label|Article_48|†|}}</div>
<div id="article_117">
* [[Privacy of correspondence]], of mail, telegraph, and telephone are inviolable. (Article 117){{Ref label|Article_48|†|}}</div>
<div id="article_118">
* Germans are entitled to free expression of opinion in word, writing, print, image, etc. This right cannot be obstructed by job contract, nor can exercise of this right create a disadvantage. Censorship is prohibited. (Article 118){{Ref label|Article_48|†|}}</div>

==== Section 2: Community Life ====

Articles 119 to 134 guided Germans' interaction with the community and established, among other things, that:
<div id="article_123">
* Germans had the right to assemble peacefully and unarmed without prior permission. (Article 123){{Ref label|Article_48|†|}}</div>
<div id="article_124">
* Germans were entitled to form clubs or societies, which were permitted to acquire legal status. This status could not be denied because of the organization's political, socio-political or religious goals. (Article 124){{Ref label|Article_48|†|}}</div>
* Free and secret elections were guaranteed. (Article 125)
* All citizens were eligible for public office, without discrimination, based on their abilities. [[Gender discrimination]] toward female civil servants was abolished. (Article 126) This allowed the first women, like [[Anita Augspurg]] to practice law.
* Civil servants served the whole nation, not a specific party.  They enjoyed freedom of political opinion. (Article 130)
* Citizens could be required to provide services to the state and community, including compulsory military service under regulations set by Reich law.

==== Section 3: Religion and Religious Communities  ====

The religious rights of Germans were enumerated in Articles 135 to 141. Residents of the Reich were granted freedom of belief and conscience. Free practice of religion was guaranteed by the constitution and protected by the state, and no state church was established.

Furthermore, the exercise of civil and civic rights and admission to state office were independent of one's religious beliefs. Public declaration of religious beliefs were not required, and no one was forced to join in a religious act or swear a religious oath.

Five articles from this section of the Constitution (Nos. 136-139 and 141) were explicitly incorporated into the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany]] (passed in 1949),<ref>[http://www.bundestag.de/interakt/infomat/fremdsprachiges_material/downloads/ggEn_download.pdf Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany], article 140</ref> and so remain Constitutional Law in Germany today.

==== Section 4: Education and School ====

Articles 142 to 150 guided the operation of educational institutions within the Reich. Public education was provided by state institutions and regulated by the government, with cooperation between the Reich, the province, and the local community. Primary school was compulsory, with advanced schooling available to age 18 free of charge.

The constitution also provided for private schooling, which was likewise regulated by the government.
In private schools operated by religious communities, religious instruction could be taught in accordance with the religious community's principles.

==== Section 5: The Economy ====

Constitutional provisions about economic affairs were given in Articles 151 to 165. One of the fundamental principles was that economic life should conform to the principles of justice, with the goal of achieving a dignified life for all and securing the [[economic freedom]] of the individual.
<div id="article_153">
The right to property was guaranteed by Article 153. [[Nationalization|Expropriation]] of property could be made only on the basis of law and for the public welfare, with appropriate compensation.{{Ref label|Article_48|†|}}</div>

The Reich protected labor, intellectual creation, and the rights of authors, inventors, and artists. The right to form unions and to improve working conditions was guaranteed to every individual and to all occupations, and protection of the self-employed was established.
Workers and employees were given the right to participate, on an equal footing with employers, in the regulation of wages and working conditions as well as in economic development.

==== Transition and Final Clauses ====

The final 16 articles (Articles 166 to 181) of the Weimar Constitution provided for the orderly transition to the new constitution, and stipulated in some cases when the various provisions of the new constitution take effect. In cases where legislation had yet to be passed (such as the laws governing the new Supreme Court), these articles stipulated how the constitutional authority would be exercised in the interim by existing institutions. This section also stipulated that new bodies established by the constitution took the place of obsolete bodies (such as the National Assembly) where those bodies were referred to by name in old laws or decrees.

It was mandated that public servants and members of the armed forces are to take an oath on this constitution.
The previous constitution dated April 15, 1871 was suspended, but other Reich laws and decrees that didn't contradict the new constitution remained in force. Other official decrees based on hitherto-valid law remained valid until superseded by law or by decree.

The National Assembly was regarded as the Reichstag until the first Reichstag was elected and convened, and the Reich president elected by the National Assembly was to serve until June 30, 1925.

==Weaknesses ==
In his book ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'', historian [[William Shirer]] described the Weimar Constitution as "on paper, the most liberal and democratic document of its kind the twentieth century had ever seen&nbsp;... full of ingenious and admirable devices which seemed to guarantee the working of an almost flawless democracy."  Yet, the Weimar Constitution had serious problems.

The use of an excessively [[Proportional representation|proportional electoral system]] was one such problem. This system, intended to avoid the [[wasted vote|wasting of votes]], allowed the rise of a multitude of splinter parties, many of which represented the extreme ends of the political spectrum.  This in turn made it difficult for ''any'' party to establish and maintain a workable parliamentary majority. This factionalism was one contributing factor in the frequent changes in government. Shirer cites the presence of some 28 political parties in the 1930 national elections; Otto Friedrich cites 40 different groups in the Reichstag in 1933.  There was no [[election threshold|threshold]] to win representation in the Reichstag, and hence no safeguard against a quick rise of an extremist party.  It was possible to win a seat in the chamber with as little as 0.4 percent of the vote.  In the 1924 elections where the Bavarian Peasants' League got just 0.7% of the vote, enough for three seats in the Reichstag.

The allocation of presidential powers was also deeply problematic.  The Weimar Constitution allowed the president to dismiss the chancellor, even if the chancellor retained the confidence of the Reichstag. Similarly, the president could appoint a chancellor who didn't have the support of the Reichstag.  Further, the government structure was [[Semi-presidential|a mix of presidential and parliamentary]] systems, with the president acting as a "[[Ersatz|replacement]] [[Kaiser]]" and assuming some of the powers the monarch would have wielded.  [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]], the so-called ''Notverordnung'' (emergency decree) provision, gave the president broad powers to suspend civil liberties with an insufficient system of [[checks and balances]]. This presented an opportunity that [[Adolf Hitler]] was quick to seize once he became [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|chancellor]]. (see [[Reichstag Fire]]).

Even without these problems, it should be noted the Weimar Constitution was established and in force under disadvantageous social, political, and economic conditions. In his book ''[[The Coming of the Third Reich]]'', historian [[Richard J. Evans]] argues that "all in all, Weimar's constitution was no worse than the constitutions of most other countries in the 1920s, and a good deal more democratic than many. Its more problematical provisions might not have mattered so much had the circumstances been different. But the fatal lack of legitimacy from which the Republic suffered magnified the constitution's faults many times over."<ref>Evans, Richard J (2004): ''The Coming of the Third Reich''; New York, The Penguin Press, page 88.</ref>

== Hitler's subversion of the Weimar Constitution ==

Less than a month after [[Adolf Hitler]]’s appointment as chancellor in 1933, the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] invoked [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the Weimar Constitution, suspending several constitutional protections on [[civil rights]].  The articles affected were [[#article 114|114 (habeas corpus)]], [[#article 115|115 (inviolability of residence)]], [[#article 117|117 (correspondence privacy)]], [[#article 118|118 (freedom of expression /censorship)]], [[#article 123|123 (assembly)]], [[#article 124|124 (associations)]], and [[#article 153|153 (expropriation)]].

The subsequent [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], passed by the Reichstag on March 23, 1933, stated that, in addition to the traditional method of the Reichstag passing legislation, the Reich government could also pass legislation. It further stated that the powers of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], [[Reichsrat (Germany)|Reichsrat]] and Reich President were not affected. The normal legislative procedures outlined in Articles 68 to 77 of the constitution did not apply to legislation promulgated by the Reich government.

The Enabling Act was effectively a constitutional amendment because of the foregoing alterations to the normal legislative process. The act met the constitutional requirements (two-thirds of the Reichstag's members were present, and two-thirds of the members present voted in favor of the measure).  The Act did not explicitly amend the Weimar Constitution, but there was explicit mention to the fact that the procedure sufficient for constitutional reform was followed.  The constitution of 1919 was never formally repealed, but the Enabling Act meant that all its other provisions were a dead letter.

Two of the penultimate acts Hitler took to consolidate his power in 1934 actually violated the Enabling Act. Article 2 of the act stated that
<blockquote>'Laws enacted by the government of the Reich may deviate from the constitution as long as they do not affect the institutions of the Reichstag and the Reichsrat. The rights of the President remain undisturbed.'</blockquote>

Hindenburg died on 2 August, and Hitler appropriated the president's powers for himself in accordance with a law passed the previous day. However, in 1932 the constitution had been amended to make the president of the High Court of Justice, not the chancellor, acting president pending new elections. Nonetheless, the Enabling Act did not specify any recourse that could be taken if the chancellor violated Article 2, and no legal challenge was ever mounted.

==Legacy ==
After the passage of the Enabling Act, the constitution was largely forgotten. Nonetheless, Hitler used it to give his dictatorship the appearance of legality. Three Reichstag elections were held during his rule. However, voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and "guest candidates," and voting was not secret. Thousands of his decrees were based explicitly on the Reichstag Fire Decree, and hence on Article 48.

In Hitler's 1945 [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler#Testament|political testament]] (written shortly before his suicide) he appointed Admiral [[Karl Doenitz]] to succeed him.  However, he named Doenitz as President, not Fuehrer, thereby re-establishing a constitutional office which had lain dormant since Hindenburg's death ten years earlier. On 30 April 1945, Doenitz formed what became known as the [[Flensburg government]], which controlled only a tiny area of Germany near the Danish border, including the town of [[Flensburg]]. It was dissolved by the Allies on the 23rd of May. On the 5th of June, the Allied [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Berlin Declaration]] abolished all the institutions of German civil government, and this established that the constitution no longer held any legal force.

The 1949 [[Constitution of the German Democratic Republic]] contained many passages that were directly copied from the 1919 constitution.<ref>http://web.wm.edu/law/publications/lawreview/documents/Vol49-4_Markovits.pdf?svr=law</ref> It was intended to be the constitution of a united Germany, and was thus a compromise between liberal-democratic and Marxist-Leninist ideologies. It was replaced by a new, explicitly Communist constitution in 1968, which remained in force until [[German reunification|the reunification of East and West]] in 1990.

The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], enacted in 1949, said 'provisions of Articles 136, 137, 138, 139 and 141 of the German Constitution of 11 August 1919 shall be an integral part of this Basic Law'.<ref>Article 140 of the Basic Law. http://www.bundestag.de/interakt/infomat/fremdsprachiges_material/downloads/ggEn_downloand.pdf</ref> These articles of the Weimar constitution (which dealt with the state's relationship to the different Christian denominations) remain part of the German Basic Law.

In the judicial system based on the Basic Law, the Weimar constitution initially retained the force of law (with the exception of the Church articles on a non-constitutional level), where the Basic Law contained nothing to the contrary. These norms were, however, largely redundant or dealing with matters reserved to the ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]'', and as such officially set out of force within two decades; aside from the Church articles, the rule that [[Nobility in Germany|titles of nobility]] are to be considered part of the name and must no longer be bestowed (Art. 109 III) is the only one left in force.<ref>[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/wrv/index.html#BJNR013830919BJNE000200314 as here on the internet service presenting German laws]</ref>

The first official constitution of the [[Republic of Korea]] was originally based on the Weimar Constitution.<ref>{{cite journal | title = The Idea Behind the Constitution: an interview with Chaihark Hahm | journal = Neatherlands Institute For Advanced Study In The Humanities And Social Science | first = Johan | last = Kwantes | issue = 43| id = | url = http://www.hiil.org/assets/782/The_confused_Korean_Constitutional_Identity-article_in_NIAS_newsletter_2_.pdf | accessdate = 2010-12-30}}</ref>

==Notes==
† {{note label|Article_48|||}} Protections provided by Articles [[#article 114|114]], [[#article 115|115]], [[#article 117|117]], [[#article 118|118]], [[#article 123|123]], [[#article 124|124]], and [[#article 153|153]] could be suspended or restricted by the President through invocation of his authority granted under [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the Weimar Constitution.

'''''Puddle Lane''''' (or '''''Tales from Puddle Lane''''') is a 1980s British [[pre-school]] children's [[television]] programme written by [[Rick Vanes]] with animated stories written by [[Sheila K. McCullagh]], author of [[Tim and the Hidden People]]. A long series of books based on the stories was produced by [[Ladybird Books]], also under the title '''Puddle Lane'''. 

==TV programme==
The programme was made by [[Yorkshire Television]] in [[Leeds]] for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and ran on from 1985 (as a replacement for [[Mooncat]]) until 1989. The main characters were the Magician (played by [[Neil Innes]], who also composed music for the programme), and a Spell Dragon named Toby (voiced by [[Richard Robinson (puppeteer)|Richard Robinson]]); the Magician told Toby stories by moving his finger around in a puddle (when using the interior set) and a bird bath (when using the exterior set) and producing images.  He also had a cauldron inside and water barrel outside, both of which could talk. The stories he told were presented as animations, narrated by Kate Lee (who also played a minor character, Aunt Flo). The Magician lived in a large house at the end of Puddle Lane, hence the name of the programme.

==Transmission guide==

*Series 1: 26 editions from 3 October 1985 - 1 May 1986
*Series 2: 26 editions from 16 October 1986 - 23 April 1987
*Series 3: 24 editions from 29 October 1987 - 21 April 1988

==Books==
{{See also|List of Puddle Lane books}}
A series of 54 books (plus two standalone volumes) was produced for Puddle Lane, published by [[Ladybird Books]]. The texts, based on the animated stories, were written by Sheila McCullagh. Illustrations for the books were provided by several different artists ([[Tony Morris]], [[Gavin Rowe]] and others). There were five sets of books (different cover colour for each set), the first set (Stage 1) being the easiest to read and the last set (Stage 5) being the hardest. Since they were intended for children who are learning to read, the books with lower reading stages would present the text in two versions: the left page contained the full version, to be read aloud by the parent, while the right page contained a simplified version for the child. The books are currently out of print.

==Miscellany==
Other Puddle Lane merchandise included  audio tapes supplied for the books, [[jigsaw puzzle]]s, dominoes, picture word cards, and several educational products: ''The Magician's Activity Book'', ''The Griffle's Activity Book'' and ''Puddle Lane Fun Frieze''.

The band formed as a project of Ronny Moorings and [[Anka Wolbert]] in [[Nijmegen]], Netherlands in 1981, before moving to [[Amsterdam]] and joining [[Frank Weyzig]] and [[Pieter Nooten]] who added their own contributions.<ref>http://www.billboard.com/artist/299365/clan-xymox/biography</ref>  Assuming the name "Xymox", the group<ref name="strong"/><ref name="bonini"/> released a mini-album, ''[[Subsequent Pleasures (album)|Subsequent Pleasures]]'', in 1983.<ref name="strong">{{cite book|last=Strong|first=Martin Charles|title=The great indie discography|year=2003|publisher=Cannongate|isbn=978-1-84195-335-9|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HJfGtREyuSAC&pg=RA12-PT360}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.unruhr.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3019:clan-of-xymox-subsequent-pleasures-1982-1985-biographie-teil-1&catid=35&Itemid=46 | title = (Clan of) XYMOX – Subsequent Pleasures 1983–1985 (Biographie Teil 1/5) | author=Mic | date = 7 March 2011 | accessdate =3 Aug 2011 | publisher=Unruhr}}</ref> They were invited by [[Brendan Perry]] to support [[Dead Can Dance]] on a UK tour and were signed to the indie label [[4AD]], which released their eponymous debut album in 1985.<ref name="strong"/><ref name="sutton">{{cite web|last=Sutton|first=Michael|title=Clan of Xymox: Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/clan-of-xymox-p3905/biography/|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref> The track ''7th Time'', with Anka Wolbert on lead vocals, was picked up by [[John Peel]], leading to the band recording two of the [[List of Peel sessions#C|Peel Sessions at the BBC]], in June and November 1985. Peel referred to the band's dark and melancholic sound as "darkwave".<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC – Radio 1 – Keeping It Peel – 04/06/1985 Xymox|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1980s/1985/Jun04xymox/|publisher=[[BBC Radio 1]]|accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=BBC – Radio 1 – Keeping It Peel – 03/11/1985 Xymox (2) – Xymox|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1980s/1985/Nov03xymox/|publisher=[[BBC Radio 1]]|accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref>

===PolyGram and International Success (1988–1991)===

Now abbreviated as Xymox, the band's third album, ''[[Twist of Shadows]]'', was released in 1989. This album, and its successor ''[[Phoenix (Clan of Xymox album)|Phoenix]]'', were released by [[Wing Records]], a subsidiary of [[Polydor Records]]/[[PolyGram]]. In the United States, these two albums created a cult following for the band.<ref name="metropolis"/> The first two singles taken from the Twist of Shadows album, ''Blind Hearts'' and ''Obsession'' proved college and club hits in the United States with ''Obsession'' charting on ''Billboard'''s [[Alternative Songs]] chart<ref>{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Jane|title=Chance meeting leads to Xymox|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/57824173@N05/5322022578/sizes/l/in/photostream/|accessdate=4 January 2011|newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=30 June 1989}}</ref><ref name="obsession">{{cite web | url = {{BillboardURLbyName|artist=xymox|chart=all}} | title = Chart History Obsession |work=Billboard | accessdate =2 Aug 2011}}</ref> and both tracks hitting the Billboard [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Club Play Chart]].<ref name="obsession"/><ref>{{cite web | url = {{BillboardURLbyName|artist=xymox|chart=all}} | title = Chart History Blind Hearts |work=Billboard | accessdate =2 Aug 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Coleman|first=Bill|title=New on the Charts|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/57824173@N05/5321420083/sizes/l/in/photostream/|accessdate=4 January 2011|newspaper=[[Billboard (magazine){{!}}Billboard]]|date=29 April 1989}}</ref>

===Independent Labels and Move to Germany (1991–2014)===

[[File:Ronny Moorings - Clan of Xymox - 2008 - 8154.jpg|thumb|240px|Ronny Moorings of Clan of Xymox in concert in 2008, in Orlando, Florida]]

Xymox, without Nooten and Wolbert, left PolyGram to release the UK [[acid house]] inspired LPs ''Metamorphosis'' (1992) and ''Headclouds'' (1993) independently.<ref name="strong"/> These albums marked a break from the darkwave sound of the 1980s and met with poor record sales in the United States which had moved towards a markedly different [[grunge]] sound at the time.  Ronny Moorings toured under the banner of Xymox until 1994 with an evolving cast of live musicians, including girlfriend and future band member Mojca Zugna.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.premonition.org/premor.php3?lien=actu/actu.php3X1Xactuid=219003&ta=10 | title = Clan of Xymox | work=Premonition | date = August 2003 | accessdate =26 January 2011 | last = Labussière | first = Christophe}}</ref> Frank Weyzig - the last of the original lineup - parted ways with Moorings after the 1994 tour, after which Moorings moved back to the Netherlands and took a three year hiatus from music writing.<ref>http://www.unruhr.de/musik/revue/3022-clan-of-xymox-metamorphosis-biographie-teil-4</ref>

Capitalizing on a resurgence in the popularity of [[gothic rock]] and the success of bands such as [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Rammstein]], 1997 saw Moorings reverting the name to Clan of Xymox and moving to Germany - then the center of the burgeoning [[industrial music]] scene - to resume songwriting. Moorings recruited new live members and signed with the independent US label Tess Records in 1997 then with Metropolis in 1998.<ref name="metropolis">{{cite news|last=Richards|first=David|title=Metropolis is Home For 'Creatures' From Electronica Group Clan of Xymox|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6QwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14|accessdate=2 January 2011|newspaper=[[Billboard (magazine){{!}}Billboard]]|date=10 April 1999}}</ref> The LPs ''Hidden Faces'' (1997), ''Creatures'' (1999) and ''Notes from the Underground'' (2001) reflect an increasingly ''electro'' sound while maintaining the distinctive dance rhythms associated with the Clan of Xymox catalog.<ref name="metropolis"/> In 1998, 4AD re-released ''Clan of Xymox'' and ''Medusa'' in the USA, and Xymox toured the United States the following year.<ref name="metropolis"/> 2003's ''FareWell'', featured several charting tracks internationally.  Most recently, the LP "Matters of Mind, Body, and Soul" was released on Trisol, Metropolis, and Gravitator record labels for European, American, and Russian distribution, respectively in February 2014.

In addition to intermittent original releases, Clan of Xymox has contributed to a number of compilations and side projects since conception. In 1987, the track Moscoviet Mosquito was re-recorded and released on the 4AD compilation album [[Lonely Is an Eyesore]].<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/album/lonely-is-an-eyesore-mw0000041022</ref> In October 2000 the band released ''Live'',<ref name="strong"/> a double CD with nineteen tracks and two videos featuring live performances of Xymox songs from the 4AD, Polygram, and independent eras.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-main-entry-r502487 | title = ''Live'' | publisher=AMG | accessdate =26 January 2011}}</ref> In September 2004, a ''Best Of Clan of Xymox'' album was released with re-recorded versions of early hits as well as later offerings.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-clan-of-xymox-r707163/review | title = ''The Best of Clan of Xymox'' | publisher=AMG | accessdate =26 January 2011}}</ref> In 2011, the track "In Your Arms Again" from the LP "Darkest Hour" was included on the soundtrack to [[David Fincher]]'s "[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011 film)]]".<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568346/soundtrack</ref> In 2012 the band released a cover album, ''Kindred Spirits'', (Metropolis Records 2012) featuring covers of several influential postpunk and new wave groups in Mooring's own musical styling.  Social media and Mooring's fluency in several languages has also allowed for broad international visibility of the band.

In a touring capacity, Clan of Xymox is best known as a headlining act for several annual international alternative music festivals, including [[M'era Luna Festival]] in Hildesheim, Germany, Triton Festival in New York City, [[Summer Darkness]] in Utrecht, Netherlands, [[Whitby Gothic Weekend]] in Whitby, England, and the largest - [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]], in Moorings' current home of Leipzig, Germany.

This creates an imbalance of power in transactions which can sometimes cause the transactions to go awry, a kind of [[market failure]] in the worst case. Examples of this problem are [[adverse selection]],<ref>Charles Wilson (2008). "adverse selection," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'' 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_A000040&edition=&field=keyword&q=asymmetric%20information&topicid=&result_number=7 Abstract.]</ref> [[moral hazard]], and information monopoly.<ref>John O.

Most commonly, information asymmetries are studied in the context of [[principal–agent problem]]s. Information asymmetry causes [[misinformation|misinforming]] and is essential in every [[communication]] process.<ref>Christozov D., Chukova S., Mateev P., Chapter 11. Informing Processes, Risks, Evaluation of the Risk of Misinforming, in [http://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&id=3qtlYfQut1wC Foundations of Informing Science], ISI, 2009, pp. 323-356</ref>  Information asymmetry is in contrast to [[perfect information]] which is a key assumption in [[neo-classical economics]].<ref>http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2001/stiglitz-lecture.pdf</ref> In 2001 the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]] was awarded  to [[George Akerlof]], [[Michael Spence]], and [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] for their "analyses of markets with asymmetric information".<ref name="officialpressrelease">[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2001/press.html "The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2001: Information for the Public"], press release from the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], [[Nobel Foundation]], ''nobelprize.org'', October 2001, accessed November 12, 2007.</ref>

==Information asymmetry models==
Information asymmetry models assume that at least one party to a transaction has relevant information whereas the other(s) do not. Some asymmetric information models can also be used in situations where at least one party can enforce, or effectively retaliate for breaches of, certain parts of an agreement whereas the other(s) cannot.

In [[adverse selection]] models, the ignorant party lacks information while negotiating an agreed understanding of or contract to the transaction, whereas in [[moral hazard]] the ignorant party lacks information about performance of the agreed-upon transaction or lacks the ability to retaliate for a breach of the agreement.  An example of adverse selection is when people who are high risk are more likely to buy [[insurance]], because the insurance company cannot effectively discriminate against them, usually due to lack of information about the particular individual's risk but also sometimes by force of law or other constraints. An example of moral hazard is when people are more likely to behave recklessly after becoming insured, either because the insurer cannot observe this behavior or cannot effectively retaliate against it, for example by failing to renew the insurance.

==Adverse selection==
The classic paper on [[adverse selection]] is [[George Akerlof]]'s "[[The Market for Lemons]]" from 1970, which brought informational issues at the forefront of economic theory. It discusses two primary solutions to this problem, [[Signaling (economics)|signaling]] and [[Screening (economics)|screening]].<ref>Johannes Hörne (2008). "signalling and screening" ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000129&edition=&field=keyword&q=asymmetric%20information&topicid=&result_number=12 Abstract.]</ref>

===Signaling===
[[Michael Spence]] originally proposed the idea of [[Signalling (economics)|signaling]].  He proposed that in a situation with information asymmetry, it is possible for people to signal their type, thus believably transferring information to the other party and resolving the asymmetry.

This idea was originally studied in the context of looking for a job.  An employer is interested in hiring a new employee who is "skilled in learning."  Of course, all prospective employees will claim to be "skilled at learning", but only they know if they really are.   This is an information asymmetry.  Skill in learning is malleable, and depends upon many factors, including diet, exercise and money.

Spence proposes, for example, that going to college can function as a credible signal of an ability to learn.  Assuming that people who are skilled in learning can finish college more easily than people who are unskilled, then by finishing college the skilled people signal their skill to prospective employers.  No matter how much or how little they may have learned in college or what they studied, finishing functions as a signal of their capacity for learning.  However, finishing college may merely function as a signal of their ability to pay for college, it may signal the willingness of individuals to adhere to orthodox views, or it may signal a willingness to comply with authority.

===Screening===
[[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] pioneered the theory of [[Screening (economics)|screening]]. In this way the underinformed party can induce the other party to reveal their information. They can provide a menu of choices in such a way that the choice depends on the private information of the other party.

Examples of situations where the seller usually has better information than the buyer are numerous but include [[used-car salespeople]], [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] brokers and loan originators, [[stockbroker]]s and [[real estate agent]]s.

Examples of situations where the buyer usually has better information than the seller include [[estate sale]]s as specified in a [[last will and testament]], [[life insurance]], or sales of old [[art]] pieces without prior professional [[assessor (property)|assessment]] of their value. This situation was first described by [[Kenneth J. Arrow]] in an article on health care in 1963.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Arrow |first=Kenneth J. |author-link= |year=1963 |title=Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care |periodical=American Economic Review |volume=53 |issue=5 |pages=941–973 |jstor= 1812044|issn= |doi= |publisher=American Economic Association }}</ref>

[[George Akerlof]] in ''[[The Market for Lemons]]'' notices that, in such a market, the average value of the [[commodity]] tends to go down, even for those of perfectly good [[Quality (business)|quality]]. Because of information asymmetry, unscrupulous sellers can "[[Forgery|spoof]]" items (like replica goods such as watches) and defraud the buyer. As a result, many people not willing to risk getting ripped off will avoid certain types of purchases, or will not spend as much for a given item. It is even possible for the [[Market (economics)|market]] to decay to the point of nonexistence.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Application of information asymmetry in research==
Since the seminal contributions of Akerlof, Spence, and Stiglitz, the pervasive effects of information asymmetry in markets have been documented and studied in numerous contexts.  In particular, a substantial portion of research in the field of accounting can be framed in terms of information asymmetry, since accounting involves the transmission of an enterprise's information from those who have it to those who need it for decision-making. Likewise, financial economists apply information asymmetry in studies of differentially informed financial market participants (insiders, stock analysts, investors, etc.).  Information asymmetry has also seen some use in behavioral economics as well.

==Sources of information asymmetry==
Information asymmetry within societies can be created and maintained in several ways. Firstly, media outlets, due to their ownership structure or political influences, may fail to disseminate certain viewpoints or engage in propaganda campaigns. Furthermore, an educational system relying on substantial tuition fees can generate information imbalances between the poor and the affluent. Imbalances can also be fortified by certain organizational and legal measures, such as document classification procedures or non-disclosure clauses. Exclusive information networks that are operational around the world further contribute to the asymmetry. Lastly, mass surveillance helps the political and industrial leaders to amass large volumes of information, which is typically not shared with the rest of the society.<ref>The tools used to create information asymmetries are described in the following article http://ssrn.com/abstract=2383166</ref>

==Effect of blogging on information asymmetry==
Blogging is playing a more central role in reducing the effects of insider trading. According to Saxton and Anker, financial blogs provide figures reducing information asymmetry between corporate insiders and insider trading.<ref name="Saxton, G. D 2013">Saxton, G. D. and A. E. Anker (2013). "The Aggregate Effects of Decentralized Knowledge Production: Financial Bloggers and Information Asymmetries in the Stock Market." Journal of Communication 63(6): 1054-1069.</ref> Blogging on financial websites such as Seeking Alpha and The Kirk Report provide bottom up communication from investors, analysts, journalists, and academics. Financial blogs prevent people in power from withholding financial information from the general public. The results of Saxton and Anker’s study finds that more participation on blogging sites from credible individuals reduces information asymmetry between corporate insiders as well as insider trading.<ref name="Saxton, G. D 2013"/> Compared to traditional forms of media such as newspapers and magazines, blogging provides an easy venue to provide information to the public.

'''''Remain in Light''''' is the fourth studio album by American [[New wave music|new&nbsp;wave]] band [[Talking Heads|Talking&nbsp;Heads]], released on October 8, 1980, on [[Sire Records|Sire&nbsp;Records]]. It was recorded at locations in the Bahamas and the United States between July and August 1980 and was [[record producer|produced]] by the quartet's long-time collaborator [[Brian Eno]]. The album peaked at number&nbsp;19 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the US and at number&nbsp;21 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Two [[single (music)|singles]] were released from ''Remain in Light'': "[[Once in a Lifetime (Talking Heads song)|Once in a Lifetime]]" and "[[Houses in Motion]]" as well as promotional single "[[Crosseyed and Painless]]". The record was certified [[Gold record|Gold]] in the US and in Canada during the 1980s.

The members of Talking&nbsp;Heads wanted to make an album that dispelled notions of [[frontman]] and chief lyricist [[David Byrne]] leading a back-up band. They decided to experiment with African [[polyrhythms]] and, with Eno, recorded the instrumental tracks as a series of [[sample (music)|samples]] and [[loop (music)|loops]], a novel idea at the time. Additional musicians were frequently used throughout the studio sessions. The lyric writing process slowed ''Remain in Light''{{'}}s progress, but was concluded after Byrne drew inspiration from academic literature on Africa. The artwork was crafted with the help of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s computers and designing company M&Co. Following the album's completion, Talking&nbsp;Heads expanded to nine members for promotional concerts.

''Remain in Light'' was widely acclaimed by critics. Praise centred on its cohesive merging of disparate genres and sonic experimentation. The record has been featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1980s and the best albums of all time, and it is often considered Talking&nbsp;Heads' [[magnum opus]]. In 2006, it was [[remastered]] and reissued with the addition of four unfinished [[outtake#In music|outtakes]].

== Origins ==
In January 1980, the members of Talking&nbsp;Heads returned to New York City after the tours in support of their 1979 critically acclaimed third album, ''[[Fear of Music (album)|Fear of Music]]'', and decided to take time off to pursue personal interests. Byrne worked with Eno, the record's producer, on an [[experimental music|experimental]] collaboration named ''[[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|My Life in the Bush of Ghosts]]''.<ref name=shakers/> [[Jerry Harrison]] produced an album for [[soul music|soul]] singer [[Nona Hendryx]] at the [[Sigma Sound Studios]] branch in New York City; the singer and the location were later used during the recording of ''Remain in Light'' on Harrison's advice.<ref name=bowman165>Bowman, p. 165</ref> Husband and wife [[Chris Frantz]] and [[Tina Weymouth]] discussed the possibility of leaving the band after the latter suggested that Byrne's level of control was excessive.<ref>Bowman, p. 164</ref> Frantz was not open to the idea of ending Talking&nbsp;Heads, and the two decided to take a long vacation in the Caribbean to ponder the state of the band and their marriage. During the trip, the couple became involved in [[Haitian Vodou]] religious ceremonies and practised with several types of native [[percussion]] instruments. In Jamaica, they socialised with the famous [[reggae]] [[rhythm section]] of [[Sly and Robbie]].<ref name=bowman165/>

Frantz and Weymouth ended their holiday by purchasing an apartment above [[Compass Point Studios]] in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], the Bahamas, where the band had recorded their second album ''[[More Songs About Buildings and Food]]''.<ref name=bowman165/> Byrne joined the duo and Harrison there in the spring of 1980.<ref name=bowman167>Bowman, p. 167</ref> The band members realised that it had been solely up to Byrne to bear the creative burden of crafting songs even though the tracks were performed as a quartet. The conception of ''Remain in Light'' occurred partly because they tired of the notion of a singer leading a back-up band; the ideal they aimed for, according to Byrne, was "sacrificing our egos for mutual cooperation".<ref name=paredes38>Pareles, p. 38</ref> The frontman additionally wanted to escape "the psychological paranoia and personal torment" of what he had been writing and feeling in 1970s New York City.<ref name=TGINT/> Instead of the band writing music to Byrne's lyrics, Talking&nbsp;Heads performed instrumental [[jam (music)|jam]] sessions without words using the ''Fear of Music'' song "[[I Zimbra]]" as a starting point.<ref name=bowman167/>

Eno arrived in the Bahamas three weeks after Byrne and was at first reluctant to work with the band again after collaborating on the previous two full-length releases. He changed his mind after hearing the instrumental demo tapes and noted, "I absolutely love the direction you're going in."<ref name=bowman167/> Both parties decided to experiment with the communal African way of making music, in which individual parts mesh as polyrhythms to create a cohesive whole.<ref name=paredes38/> ''Afrodisiac'', the 1973 [[Afrobeat]] record from Nigerian musician [[Fela Kuti]], became the template for the album.<ref name=TGINT/> Weymouth has commented that the advent of the 1980s marked the beginnings of [[hip-hop music]], which made Talking&nbsp;Heads realise that the musical landscape was changing.<ref name=NPR/> Before the studio sessions, long-time friend [[David Gans (musician)|David Gans]] instructed the band members that "the things one doesn't intend are the seeds for a more interesting future". He encouraged them to experiment and improvise when recording and to make use of "mistakes".<ref name=brog167/>

== Recording and production ==
[[File:B.eno.PNG|thumb|alt=A bald man speaking into a microphone is standing in front of an abstract painting containing blotches of orange and lime green and corrugated lines.|Eno, here photographed in 2007, produced ''Remain in Light'' using stylised methods and sonic experiments.]]
Recording sessions started at Compass Point Studios in July 1980. The album's creation required the use of additional musicians, particularly extra [[percussionist]]s.<ref name="inlay">{{cite AV media notes|title=Remain in Light|others=[[Talking Heads]]|year=1980|type=LP sleeve|publisher=[[Sire Records]]|location=London}}</ref> Talking&nbsp;Heads used the [[working title]] ''Melody Attack'' throughout the studio process after watching a Japanese game show of the same name.<ref name=bowman169>Bowman, p. 169</ref> Harrison has commented that the ambition was to blend rock and African genres, rather than simply imitate [[African music]].<ref name=paredes39/> Eno's production techniques and personal approach were key to the record's conception. The process was geared to promote the expression of instinct and spontaneity without overtly focusing on the sound of the final product.<ref name=brog166/> Sections and instrumentals were recorded one at a time in a discontinuous process.<ref name=RSLIST/> Samples and loops played a key part at a time when computer programs could not yet adequately perform such functions. The band's performances and jam sessions acted as sampling and looping mechanisms. Eno has compared the creative process to "looking out to the world and saying, 'What a fantastic place we live in. Let's celebrate it.'"<ref name=NPR/>

After a few sessions in the Bahamas, [[audio engineer|engineer]] [[Rhett Davies]] left following an argument with the producer over the fast speed of recording. [[Steven Stanley]], who since the age of&nbsp;17 had engineered for musicians such as [[Bob Marley]], stepped in to cover the workload.<ref name=bowman168>Bowman, p. 168</ref> He is credited by Frantz for helping create the future single "Once in a Lifetime".<ref name=quiet/> A [[Lexicon (company)|Lexicon]]&nbsp;224 digital [[reverb]] effects unit was used on the album. It was obtained by engineer and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixer]] [[Dave Jerden]];<ref>{{cite book |author= Droney, Maureen|title=Mix Masters Platinum: Engineers Reveal Their Secrets to Success|year=2003 |publisher=[[Berklee College of Music|Berklee Press]]|isbn=0-87639-019-X |page=51}}</ref> the machine was one of the first of its kind and able to simulate environments such as chambers and rooms through interchangeable programs..<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mixonline.com/TECnology-Hall-of-Fame/lexicon-digital-reverb-090106/|title=1978 Lexicon 224 Digital Reverb|work=[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]]|accessdate=August 25, 2009}}</ref> Like Davies, Jerden was unhappy at the quick pace Eno wanted to record sonically complicated compositions, but did not complain. The basic tracks focused wholly on rhythms and were all performed in a minimalist method using only one [[chord (music)|chord]]. Each section was recorded as a long loop to enable the creation of compositions through the positioning or merging loops in different ways.<ref name=bowman168/>

The tracks made Byrne rethink his vocal style and he tried singing to the instrumental songs, but sounded "stilted". Few vocal sections were recorded in the Bahamas.<ref name=bowman169/> The writing process for the lyrics occurred when the band returned to the US and was split between New York City and California.<ref name=bowman374>Bowman, p. 374</ref> Harrison booked Talking&nbsp;Heads into Sigma Sound, which focused primarily on [[R&B]] music, after convincing the owners that the band's work could bring them a new type of clientele. In New York City, Byrne struggled with [[writer's block]].<ref name=bowman169/> Harrison and Eno spent their time tweaking the compositions recorded in the Bahamas, while Frantz and Weymouth often did not show up at the studio. Doubts began to surface about whether the album would be completed. The recording sessions only built up pace after the recruitment of guitarist [[Adrian Belew]] at the request of Byrne, Harrison, and Eno. He was advised to add [[guitar solo]]s to the Compass Point tracks, making use of a [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[guitar synthesiser]].<ref name=bowman170>Bowman, p. 170</ref>

Byrne recorded all the tracks, as they were after Belew had performed, in a cassette and looked to Africa to break his writer's block. He realised that, when African musicians forget words, they often improvise and make new ones up. The lyricist used a portable tape recorder and tried to create [[onomatopoeic]] rhymes in the style of Eno, who believed that lyrics were never the center of a song's meaning. Byrne continuously listened to his recorded [[scatting]] until convinced that he was no longer "hearing nonsense".<ref name=bowman171>Bowman, p. 171</ref> After the frontman was satisfied, Harrison invited Nona Hendryx to Sigma Sound to record [[backing vocals]] for the album. She was advised extensively on her vocal delivery by Byrne, Frantz, and Weymouth, and often sang in a trio with Byrne and Eno.<ref name=bowman175>Bowman, p. 175</ref> The voice sessions were followed by the [[overdubbing]] process. [[Brass (instrument)|Brass]] player [[Jon Hassell]], who had been working on parts of ''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'', was hired to perform [[trumpet]] and [[horn (instrument)|horn]] sections.<ref name=bowman176/> In August 1980, half of the album was mixed by Eno and engineer John Potoker in New York City with the assistance of Harrison, while the other half was mixed by Byrne and Jerden at [[Eldorado Recording Studios|Eldorado Studios]] in Los Angeles.<ref name=bowman179>Bowman, p. 179</ref>

== Packaging and title ==
[[File:Grummannavy.PNG|thumb|upright|alt=Black-and-white aerial shot of four planes (with white stars on each wing and the body) flying in formation adjacent to each other over clouds.|Grumman Avengers used by the US Navy, where Weymouth's father had served, inspired the initial cover art, later used on the back of the LP sleeve after the album name change.]]
The cover art was conceived by Weymouth and Frantz with the help of Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher [[Walter Bender]] and his [[MIT Media Lab]] team.<ref name=bowman176/><ref name=kalman415/> Using ''Melody Attack'' as inspiration, the couple created a collage of red warplanes flying in [[Formation (military)#Commands, formations, and units|formation]] over the [[Himalayas]].<ref name=bowman176/> The planes are an artistic depiction of [[Grumman Avenger]] planes in honour of Weymouth's father, Ralph Weymouth, who was a [[US Navy]] [[Admiral]].<ref name=bowman183/> The idea for the back cover included simple portraits of the band members. Weymouth attended MIT regularly during the summer of 1980 and worked with Bender's colleague, [[Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher]], on the computer renditions of the ideas. The process was tortuous because computer power was limited in the early 1980s and the [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] alone took up several rooms.<ref name=bowman176>Bowman, p. 176</ref> Weymouth and Fisher shared a passion for masks and used the concept to experiment with the portraits. The faces (except for eyes, noses and mouths) were blotted out with blocks of red colour. Weymouth considered superimposing Eno's face on top of all four portraits to insinuate his egotism—the producer wanted to be on the cover art together with Talking&nbsp;Heads—but decided against it in the end.<ref name=bowman177>Bowman, p. 177</ref>

The rest of the artwork and the [[liner notes]] were crafted by the [[graphic design]]er [[Tibor Kalman]] and his company M&Co.<ref name=kalman415/><ref name=bowman177/> Kalman was a fervent critic of [[formalism (art)|formalism]] and professional design in art and advertisements.<ref name=bowman174>Bowman, p. 174</ref> He offered his services for free to create publicity, and discussed using unconventional materials such as [[sandpaper]] and [[velour]] for the LP sleeve. Weymouth, who was sceptical of hiring a designing firm, vetoed Kalman's ideas and held firm on the MIT computerised images. The designing process made the band members realise that the title ''Melody Attack'' was "too flippant" for the music recorded, and they adopted ''Remain in Light'' instead.<ref name=bowman177/> Byrne has noted, "Besides not being all that melodic, the music had something to say that at the time seemed new, transcendent, and maybe even revolutionary, at least for funk rock songs." The image of the warplanes was relegated to the back of the sleeve and the doctored portraits became the front cover. Kalman later suggested that the planes were not removed altogether because they seemed appropriate during the [[Iranian hostage crisis]] of 1979–81.<ref name=bowman178/>

Weymouth advised Kalman that she wanted simple [[typography]] in a bold [[sans serif]] font. M&Co. followed the instructions and came up with the idea of inverting the "A"s in "TALKING HEADS". Weymouth and Frantz decided to use the joint credit acronym C/T for the artwork, while Bender and Fisher used initials and code names because the project was not an official MIT venture.<ref name=bowman178>Bowman, p. 178</ref> The design credits read "HCL, JPT, DDD, WALTER GP, PAUL, C/T".<ref name=bowman183/> The final mass-produced version of ''Remain in Light'' boasted one of the first computer-designed record jackets in the history of music.<ref name="NPR">{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1072131|title='Once In A Lifetime'|author=Karr, Rick|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=March 27, 2000|accessdate=August 25, 2009}}</ref> [[Psychoanalyst]] Michael A. Brog has called its front cover a "disarming image, which suggests both splitting and obliteration of identity" and which introduces the listener to the album's recurring theme of "identity disturbance"; he states, "The image is in bleak contrast to the title with the obscured images of the band members unable to 'remain in light'."<ref name=brog167>Brog, p. 167</ref>

== Promotion and release ==
[[File:Talking Heads band1.jpg|thumb|alt=A guitarist, a drummer, and a keyboardist are performing a song live in concert.|Talking Heads hired five additional musicians for the ''Remain in Light'' promotional tours]]

Brian Eno advised Talking&nbsp;Heads that the music on ''Remain in Light'' was too dense for a quartet to perform.<ref name=bowman179/> The band expanded to nine musicians for the tours in support of the album.

''Remain in Light'' was released worldwide on October 8, 1980. Talking&nbsp;Heads and Eno originally agreed to credit all songs in alphabetical order to "David Byrne, Brian Eno, Chris Frantz, Jerry Harrison and Tina Weymouth" after failing to devise an accurate mathematical formula for the split,<ref name=bowman177/> but the album was released with the credits "David Byrne, Brian Eno, Talking&nbsp;Heads".<ref name=inlay/> Frantz, Harrison, and Weymouth disputed Byrne and Eno's attempt to claim sole credits, especially for a process they had partly funded.<ref name="quiet">{{cite web |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/01782-tom-tom-club-chris-frantz-talking-heads-interview|title=Tom Tom Club's Chris Frantz On David Byrne, Brian Eno And Lee 'Scratch' Perry |author=Marszalek, Julian|publisher=[[The Quietus]]|date=June 3, 2009|accessdate=August 25, 2009}}</ref> According to Weymouth, Byrne told Kalman to doctor the credits on Eno's advice.<ref name=bowman183>Bowman, p. 183</ref> Later editions rectified the error.<ref name="inlay2006">{{cite AV media notes|title=Remain in Light|others=[[Talking Heads]]|year=2006|type=CD booklet and case back cover|publisher=[[Warner Music Group|Warner]]|location=London}}</ref> ''Remain in Light'' received its world premiere airing in its entirety on 10&nbsp;October 1980 on [[WPSU (FM)|WDFM]].<ref name="AIR">{{Cite news |title=WDFM to air premiere of Talking Heads' newest|work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]|page=18|date=October 10, 1980}}</ref> It was certified Gold by the [[Canadian Recording Industry Association]] in February 1981 after shipping 50,000&nbsp;copies,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cria.ca/cert_db_search.php|title=CRIA: Search Certification Database|publisher=[[Canadian Recording Industry Association]]| accessdate=September 15, 2009}} ''Note: User search required.''</ref> and by [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in September 1985 after shipping 500,000&nbsp;copies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php |title=RIAA: Gold & Platinum |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]| accessdate=May 18, 2008}} ''Note: User search required.''</ref> Over one million copies have been sold worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Ronstadt will return to Broadway stage|author=Robinson, Lisa|work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]|page=45|date=June 18, 1981}}</ref>

=== Lyrics ===
[[File:Dean 30-0124a.gif|alt=|thumb|upright|The testimony of [[Watergate scandal]] conspirator [[John Dean]] was one of several inspirations for the lyrics on ''Remain in Light'']]
''Remain in Light'' contains eight songs that possess a "striking [[free association (psychology)|free-associative]] feel" according to psychoanalyst Michael A. Brog, in that there is no long-lasting coherent thought process that can be followed in the [[stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]] lyrics. David Gans instructed Byrne to be freer with his lyrical content by advising him that "rational thinking has its limits".<ref name=brog166>Brog, p. 166</ref> The frontman included a bibliography with the album press kit along with a statement that explained how the album was inspired by African [[mythologies]] and rhythms. The release stressed that the major inspiration to the lyrics was Professor John Miller Chernoff's ''African Rhythm and African Sensibility'',<ref>Bowman, p. 182</ref> which examined the musical enhancement of life in the continent's rural communities.<ref name=bowman183/> The academic travelled to Ghana in 1970 to study native percussion and wrote about how Africans have complicated conversations through drum patterns.<ref name=bowman173>Bowman, p. 173</ref> One of the songs, "The Great Curve", exemplifies the African theme by including the line "The world moves on a woman's hips", which Byrne used after reading Professor [[Robert Farris Thompson]]'s book ''African Art in Motion''.<ref name=bowman374/> He additionally studied straight speech, from [[John Dean]]'s [[Watergate]] testimony to the stories of [[African American]] former slaves.<ref name=bowman172/>

Like all the other tracks, album opener "[[Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)]]" borrows from "preaching, shouting and ranting".<ref name=TGINT>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/mar/27/brian-eno-david-byrne|title='The business is an exciting mess'|author=Helmore, Edward|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=March 27, 2009|accessdate=August 25, 2009}}</ref> The expression "And the Heat Goes On", used in the title and repeated in the chorus, is based on a ''[[New York Post]]'' headline Eno read in the summer of 1980 whilst Byrne rewrote the song title "Don't Worry About the Government" from Talking&nbsp;Heads' debut album, ''[[Talking Heads: 77]]'', into the lyric "Look at the hands of a government man".<ref name=bowman171/>  The "rhythmical rant" in "Crosseyed and Painless"—"Facts are simple and facts are straight. Facts are lazy and facts are late."—is influenced by [[old school rap]], specifically [[Kurtis Blow]]'s "[[The Breaks]]" given to Byrne by Frantz. "Once in a Lifetime" borrows heavily from preachers' diatribes.<ref name=bowman172>Bowman, p. 172</ref> Some critics have suggested that the song is "a kind of prescient jab at the excesses of the 1980s". Byrne disagreed with the categorisation and commented that its lyrics are meant to be taken literally; he stated, "We're largely unconscious. You know, we operate half awake or on autopilot and end up, whatever, with a house and family and job and everything else, and we haven't really stopped to ask ourselves, 'How did I get here?'."<ref name=NPR/>

=== Music ===
{{Listen
 |filename = Greatcurve.ogg
 |title = "The Great Curve"
 |description = "The Great Curve" includes Belew's synthesiser-treated guitar, African-inspired percussion, and brass interludes.<ref name=bowman170/> It features the line "The world moves on a woman's hips", inspired by ''African Art in Motion''.<ref name=bowman374/>
}}

Byrne has described the album's final mix as a "spiritual" piece of work, "joyous and ecstatic and yet it's serious"; he has pointed out that, in the end, there was "less Africanism in ''Remain in Light'' that we implied ... but the African ideas were far more important to get across than specific rhythms".<ref name=paredes39>Pareles, p. 39</ref> According to Eno, the record uniquely blends [[funk]] and [[punk rock]] or [[new wave music]].<ref name=TGINT/> None of the compositions include chord changes and instead rely on the use of different [[harmonics]] and [[note (music)|notes]].<ref name=bowman171/> "Spidery riffs" and layered tracks of bass and percussion are used extensively throughout the album.<ref name=bowman169/> The first side contains the more rhythmic songs recorded—"Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)", "Crosseyed and Painless", and "The Great Curve"—which include long instrumental interludes.<ref name=bowman178/> The last-named track contains extended guitar solos from Adrian Belew.<ref name=bowman170/>

The second side of ''Remain in Light'' features more introspective songs.<ref name=bowman178/> "Once in a Lifetime" pays homage to early [[rap]] techniques and the music of [[art rock]] band [[The Velvet Underground]].<ref name=NPR/> The track was originally called "Weird Guitar Riff Song" because of its composition.<ref name=bowman172/> It was conceived as a single [[riff]] before the band added a second, boosted riff over the top of the first. Eno alternated eight [[bar (music)|bars]] of each riff with corresponding bars of its counterpart.<ref name=bowman169/> "Houses in Motion" incorporates lengthy brass performances from Jon Hassell, while "Listening Wind" features [[Arabic music]] elements. The final track on the album, "The Overload," was Talking&nbsp;Heads' attempt to emulate the sound of British post-punk band [[Joy Division]]. The song was made despite no band member having heard the music of Joy Division; rather, it was based on an idea of what the British quartet ''might'' sound like based on descriptions in the music press. The track features "tribal-cum-[[industrial music|industrial]]" beats created primarily by Harrison and Byrne.<ref name=bowman178/>

=== Reviews ===
The album has attained widespread acclaim from media outlets since its release. Ken Tucker of ''Rolling Stone'' explained that it was a brave and absorbing attempt to locate a common ground in the early 1980s divergent and often hostile musical genres; he concluded, "''Remain in Light'' yields scary, funny music to which you can dance and think, think and dance, dance and think, ''[[ad infinitum]]''."<ref name="RS">{{cite journal | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/remain-in-light-19801211 | title=Remain In Light by Talking Heads | author=Tucker, Ken | journal=Rolling Stone |date=December 1980 | issue=332 | pages=55}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]], writing in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', described the record as one "in which David Byrne conquers his fear of music in a visionary [[Afrofunk]] synthesis—clear-eyed, detached, almost mystically optimistic".<ref name="christg">{{cite web |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=talking+heads|title=Talking Heads: Consumer Guide Reviews|author=Christgau, Robert|work=[[The Village Voice]]|publisher=[[Robert Christgau]]|accessdate=August 25, 2009}}</ref> Michael Kulp of ''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]'' commented that the album deserves the tag "classic" like each of the band's three previous full-length releases,<ref name="DCPS">{{Cite news |title=Talking Heads: new mixture of pop styles|author=Kulp, Michael|work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]|page=12|date=November 12, 1980}}</ref> while [[John Rockwell]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', suggested that it confirmed Talking&nbsp;Heads' position as "America's most venturesome rock band".<ref name="NYT">{{Cite news |title=New Territory for The Talking Heads|author=Rockwell, John|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=D24|date=October 5, 1980}}</ref> Sandy Robertson of ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' praised the record's innovative nature,<ref name="smag">{{Cite news |title=Talking Heads: Remain In Light|author=Robertson, Sandy|work=[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]|page=27|date=October 11, 1980}}</ref> while ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote, "Just about every LP Talking Heads has released in the last four years has wound up on virtually every critics' best of list.

PRI is the "managing partner" of '''American Public Radio''', which provides satellite radio programing via [[Sirius XM Satellite Radio]]. APR is composed of PRI, [[Chicago Public Radio]], [[WGBH (FM)]] in Boston, and [[WNYC]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/pri-facts.html|title=Public Radio International - PRI Fact Sheet|publisher=PRI|date=2010-04-15|accessdate=2011-06-26}}</ref>

==Background==
In the United States, PRI exclusively distributes such well-known programming to public radio stations. Among its  programs is the award-winning global news program ''[[The World (radio program)|The World]]'', which PRI co-produces with the [[BBC]] and [[WGBH (FM)|WGBH]] [[Boston]]. Programs on PRI—sometimes mis-attributed to [[National Public Radio]]—are produced by a variety of organizations, including PRI in the United States and other countries.<ref name="PRIFactSheet">{{cite web|title=PRI Fact Sheet|url=http://www.pri.org/pri-fact-sheet|publisher=Public Radio International|accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref> PRI, along with [[NPR]] and [[American Public Media]], is one of the largest program producers and distributors of public radio programming in the United States. PRI offers over 280 hours of programming each week to stations and listeners.<ref name="PRIFactSheet" /> According to their website, the mission of Public Radio International is to "serve audiences as a distinctive content source for information, insights and cultural experiences essential to living in our diverse, interconnected world." 

Approximately 900 radio station affiliates and other audio venues broadcast, stream and download PRI programs. According to the 2012 [[Arbitron]] ratings, 8.7 million people listened to PRI programming each week.

PRI's programs have won numerous awards for quality and innovation, including the [[DuPont-Columbia Award]],<ref>{{cite press release|title=PRI's ''The World'' Wins Prestigious 2006 duPont-Columbia Award|url=http://www2.pri.org/infosite/networknews/releases/tw_dupont.cfm|publisher=Public Radio International|date=15 December 2005|accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref> Scripps Howard Award for Excellence in Electronic Media/Radio,<ref>{{cite press release|title=PRI's 'The World' wins multiple awards, celebrates 10th year|url=http://www2.pri.org/infosite/networknews/releases/tw_awards_10th.cfm|publisher=Public Radio International|date=4 April 2006|accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref> [[Peabody Award|George M.

PRI programs are distributed through North America on [[satellite radio]]. PRI had its own 24-hour channel on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] channel 136, which was discontinued in September 2006. As a response, [[XM Radio]] added more PRI programming to its own public radio channel, [[XM Public Radio]]. PRI pursues its satellite radio strategy in concert with other public radio stations. In 2002, PRI formed American Public Radio, in partnership with [[Chicago Public Radio]], in order to better pursue strategies within the satellite radio realm. Not long after, [[WGBH (FM)|WGBH]] [[Boston]] joined the partnership. [[WNYC]] New York joined about a year later.<ref>{{cite press release|title=PRI and Chicago Public Radio Form New Programming Partnership|url=http://www2.pri.org/infosite/networknews/releases/pri_cpr.cfm|publisher=Public Radio International|date=2 April 2002|accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref>

PRI programming receives funding from station fees, corporate underwriting, and individual and corporate grants. Less than 2% of the overall [[operating budget]] comes from United States government agencies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==History==
PRI was founded in 1983 as American Public Radio as an alternative to [[NPR]] for [[public radio]] program distribution.<ref name="PRIFactSheet" /> Four stations established American Public Radio as a [[syndicate]]: the [[Minnesota Public Radio]] network, [[WGBH (FM)|WGBH]] in [[Boston]], [[WNYC]] in New York City, and [[KUSC]] in Los Angeles. The corporation changed its name to Public Radio International in 1994 to reflect its growing interest and involvement in international audio publishing, as typified by its many collaborations with the [[BBC]].

In the mid-1990s, PRI began to expand its purpose by producing programming in addition to distributing programming. This evolution in the company began with PRI's ''[[The World (radio program)|The World]]'', a co-production among PRI, the [[BBC World Service]], and WGBH. This daily global news program was one of the first news-oriented co-productions of the [[BBC World Service]] anywhere.

In 2012, the organization was purchased by [[WGBH (FM)|WGBH]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/business/bostons-wgbh-acquires-public-radio-international.html |title=Boston’s WGBH Buys Public Radio International|author=Ben Sisario |date=2012-07-27 |work=July 27, 2012 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 7, 2012}}</ref>

==Recent program launches and firsts==
In January 2007, PRI launched ''[[Fair Game (radio)|Fair Game]]'', "the strange love child between the ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[Morning Edition]]''." The program aims to experiment with web and audio programming hybrids and reach out to younger listeners. ''Fair Game'' uses humor as a lens to put the day's events in perspective, and features stand-up comedian (and [[Rhodes scholar]]) [[Faith Salie]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Stuart Miller|title=Loosey-Goosey Voice On, Yeah, Public Radio|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60A13FA3F540C708CDDAF0894DF404482 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 June 2007|accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref> On May 30, 2008, PRI ceased the broadcast component of the program and apparently has a web-only version of the program in the works.<ref>{{cite news |last=Jensen|first=Elizabeth|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/26/arts/26arts-RADIOSFAIRGA_BRF.html |title=Arts, Briefly - Radio's 'Fair Game' to Be Canceled - Brief |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2008-05-26|accessdate=2011-06-26}}</ref>

Also in January 2007, PRI announced its acquisition of ''[[WireTap (radio program)|WireTap]]'' from the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] for distribution in the United States. According to PRI's press release, ''WireTap'' is a weekly program of intimate and often hilarious telephone conversations between celebrated writer [[Jonathan Goldstein (author)|Jonathan Goldstein]], and people with real or imagined stories to tell.<ref>{{cite press release|title='WireTap' is newest innovative launch on Public Radio International |url=http://www2.pri.org/infosite/networknews/releases/wiretap_launch.cfm|publisher=Public Radio International|date=18 December 2006|accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref>

In March 2007, PRI announced its intention to co-produce a new morning program, involving WNYC New York, WGBH Boston, the BBC World Service, and [[New York Times Radio]]. The goals of the program are to provide choice in public radio mornings and to foster the growth of [[public radio]] audiences. This program launched nationally in April 2008. PRI began developing this idea more than five years ago and began cultivating partners not long after.

In June 2007, the company announced another distribution partnership, this time with ''[[The Sound of Young America]]'', featuring [[Jesse Thorn]].

In September, PRI and ''[[Symphony Space]]'' of New York City announced that PRI would become the national distribution partner of ''[[Selected Shorts]]'', which had previously been distributed by National Public Radio. The press release said, "The best public radio features compelling storytelling. ''Selected Shorts'' is an excellent example of how the human voice can engage listeners and take them to another place... PRI looks forward to partnering with ''Selected Shorts'' to chart an exciting new future for this kind of storytelling in public media."<ref>{{cite press release|title=PRI to partner with 'Selected Shorts' for national distribution|url=http://www2.pri.org/infosite/networknews/releases/sele_shorts_anct.cfm|publisher=Public Radio International|date=14 September 2007|accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref>

In January 2008, PRI and WNYC announced that the name of their new morning drive news program is ''[[The Takeaway]]'' with [[John Hockenberry]] and [[Adaora Udoji]]. This program's editorial partners include The BBC World Service, ''The New York Times'', and WGBH Radio Boston. The program successfully launched April 28, and full national launch is expected June/July 2008.

On May 1, 2008, PRI was the first major public media outlet to use [[digital cinema]]; and one of the first mass media companies overall. PRI conceived and spearheaded ''This American Life Live!''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.current.org/radio/radio0806thisamericanlife.shtml|title=Popcorn available with this Ira Glass show, 2008|publisher=Current.org|date=2008-04-07|accessdate=2011-06-26}}</ref> in partnership with Ira Glass and WBEZ Chicago. ''This American Life Live!'' was presented exclusively in select theatres by National CineMedia's (NCM) Fathom, in partnership with BY Experience and Chicago Public Radio, and in association with Public Radio International.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/About/press-releases/tal-live-release.html|title=This American Life - Live!|publisher=Pri.Org|date=April 4, 2008|accessdate=2011-06-26}}</ref> On March 21, 2014, the company announced the agreement to distribute ''This American Life'' would end July 1, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Public Radio International Dropping ‘This American Life’|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/03/public-radio-international-dropping-this-american-life/|publisher=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref>

==Public radio, PRI, NPR==
[[Public radio]] is a generic term for non-commercial radio stations or programming that are covered under the Public Broadcasting Act. Public radio organizations receive funding from corporate sponsors, public (e.g., [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]) and private foundation grants as well as donations and gifts from individuals. The mix of revenue differs by station, network and/or producer. PRI, NPR and American Public Media are the largest providers of public radio programming in the United States. They compete with each other for slots on public radio stations and the attention of listeners. Each has distinct missions and emphases in programming—PRI is focused on global journalism, providing diverse voices, and arts and cultural perspectives. Any given public radio station may be simultaneously both an NPR member and an affiliate of PRI and APM. PRI is a not-for-profit organization that has an independent governing board with an independent board of directors. NPR is a membership organization; its board is composed of public radio stations which run for seats on the board.

PRI is a younger organization than NPR, and focuses on pushing the sound of public radio forward through innovative programming strategies and leading media in its areas of focus—global news and cultural perspectives. (NPR was founded in 1970 and PRI in 1983.) Many PRI shows draw a younger overall audience than shows produced by NPR. PRI's stated purpose is to offer a wider range of voices than NPR programs.<ref>{{cite news |title=Is PBS Still Necessary |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/arts/television/17mcgr.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date= 2008-02-17| accessdate=2008-02-15 |first=Charles |last=McGrath}}</ref>

In recent years, there have been changes among distributors of numerous programs. Some programs that were formerly distributed by PRI, such as ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'', ''[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]]'', and ''[[American Routes]]'' are now distributed by [[American Public Media]].<ref>{{cite press release |title=American Public Media Acquires National Distribution of American Routes, Public Radio's Weekly Exploration of American Music : American Public Media is now second in weekly audience size to NPR. (Arbitron Nationwide, Spring 2007) |url=http://americanpublicmedia.publicradio.org/press/archive/pr_030207.html|publisher=American Public Media |date=2 March 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref> APM was formed by Minnesota Public Radio to distribute programs it owned and produced, thereby moving distribution from PRI to APM. 

In addition, PRI distributed ''[[World Cafe]]'' for many years, but in 2005, the show's distribution was switched to NPR. At the same time, PRI has also picked up the distribution of programs originally distributed by [[NPR]], including ''[[Michael Feldman's Whad'Ya Know?]]'', and, in 2006, ''[[Living on Earth]]''—[[public radio]]'s leading news and information program focused on the environment. In September 2007, PRI became the national distributor of ''[[Selected Shorts]]'' which was previously distributed by NPR. In January 2014, PRI became the national distributor of [[Science Friday|''Science Friday'']], also previously distributed by NPR.

The '''Kingdom of Thessalonica''' was a short-lived [[Crusader State]] founded after the [[Fourth Crusade]] over conquered Byzantine lands in [[Greek Macedonia]] and [[Thessaly]].

==History==

=== Background ===

After the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the crusaders in 1204, [[Boniface of Montferrat]], the leader of the crusade, was expected by both the Crusaders and the defeated [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] to become the new emperor. However, the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] felt that Boniface was too closely tied to the Byzantine Empire, as his brother [[Conrad of Montferrat|Conrad]] had married into the Byzantine royal family. The Venetians wanted an emperor whom they could control more easily, and with their influence, [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Baldwin of Flanders]] was elected as emperor of the new [[Latin Empire]].

=== Establishment ===

Boniface reluctantly accepted this, and set out to conquer [[Thessalonica]], the second-largest Byzantine city after Constantinople. At first he had to compete with Emperor Baldwin, who also wanted the city. He then went on to capture the city later in 1204 and set up a kingdom there, subordinate to Baldwin, although the title of "king" was never officially used. Late 13th and 14th century sources suggest that Boniface based his claim to Thessalonica on the statement that his younger brother [[Renier of Montferrat|Renier]] had been granted Thessalonica on his marriage to [[Maria Komnene (Porphyrogenita)|Maria Komnene]] in 1180.<ref>E.g. [[Salimbene de Adam]], ''Chronicle'', 1966 edition vol. 2 p. 790. Cf. {{Harv|Runciman|1951-1954|loc=vol. 3 p. 125}}, and for full discussion {{Harv|Haberstumpf|1995|pp=56–67}}.</ref>

The kingdom occupied land along the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast of [[Thrace]], [[Thessaly]], and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], but the interior borders were undefined as the kingdom was from the outset constantly at war with the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]ns, who wanted to capture the remnants of the Byzantine Empire for themselves, and the [[Despotate of Epirus]], one of the Byzantine successor states. The kingdom initially also faced attacks from the deposed [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Alexius III]], who had fled to [[Corinth]], although he was quickly defeated. After this victory Boniface captured the island of [[Euboea]], where a vassal [[Lordship of Negroponte|lordship]] was established, and helped some other Crusaders establish the [[Duchy of Athens]] and the [[Principality of Achaea]], which became vassal states of Thessalonica.

=== The Lombard Rebellion ===

Boniface's rule lasted less than two years before he was ambushed by Tsar [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]] and killed on September 4, 1207. The kingdom passed to Boniface's son [[Demetrius of Montferrat|Demetrius]], who was still a baby, so actual power was held by various minor nobles of [[Lombardy|Lombard]] origin. These nobles, under the regent [[Oberto II of Biandrate|Oberto]], began plotting to place [[William VI of Montferrat]], Boniface's elder son, on the throne, and openly defied the Latin Emperor [[Henry of Flanders]]. Henry marched against them in 1209 and forced their submission. As a result, Henry's brother Eustace then became regent for Demetrius.

=== War with Epirus and fall ===

Taking advantage of this situation, [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas|Michael I of Epirus]], a former ally of Boniface, attacked the kingdom in 1210, as did the Bulgarians. Henry of Flanders eventually defeated both, but after Michael's death in 1214, his brother and successor [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas|Theodore]] began anew the assault on the kingdom. Over the next nine years Theodore gradually conquered all of Thessalonica except the city itself, as the Latin Empire could spare no army to defend it while they were busy fighting the more powerful Byzantine [[Empire of Nicaea]] in Asia. In 1224, just as Demetrius had become old enough to take power for himself, Theodore finally captured Thessalonica and the kingdom became part of the Despotate of Epirus.

=== Titular claimants ===

The kingdom was claimed by titular kings of the house of [[Montferrat]] until 1284 and also by the [[Duke of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]]; [[Baldwin II of Constantinople]] had promised the title to Hugh IV should he regain the [[Latin Empire]].

Captain '''Donald MacDonald''' (c. 1724-1760) was a military officer who fought successively for [[France]], for [[Charles Edward Stuart]] in Scotland, and for [[Great Britain]] in [[Quebec]].

MacDonald (sometimes spelt MacDonell) was the second son of Ranald MacDonald, Chief of Clanranald.  When still young he was sent to France where he received a commission in the Royal-Ecossais Regiment of the French army.  In 1745 he was sent by King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] to assist Charles Edward Stuart in the [[Jacobite rising]]. MacDonald was wounded at the siege of [[Stirling Castle]] and imprisoned after the surrender of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] forces. As a French officer he was released from imprisonment and returned to France.

MacDonald took advantage of the amnesty which was granted by Britain to Jacobite officers, and on 12 January 1757 was gazetted a captain in the regiment raised by [[General Simon Fraser of Lovat|Simon Fraser]], the [[78th Fraser Highlanders]].  In 1758 MacDonald sailed to [[Louisbourg]] which was then under siege as part of the [[Seven Years' War]].  He was wounded there on the night of 21 July.

MacDonald participated in the subsequent siege of [[Quebec City|Quebec]]. On the night of 13 September 1759 he was part of the [[forlorn hope]], the twenty-four volunteers leading the British attempt to climb the cliffs rising above the [[St. Lawrence River]].  It was MacDonald who responded in French to the challenge of the French guards, buying time for enough men to gather and overpower the post.  This in turn allowed almost 5,000 British troops to climb the cliffs and mass on the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Plains of Abraham]].  During the subsequent winter, MacDonald was given several independent commands, constantly harassing the French outposts surrounding Quebec.

At the [[Battle of Sainte-Foy]], 28 April 1760, MacDonald commanded a company of volunteers on the left flank of the British army and was killed in the action.

There is significant evidence that MacDonald was a harsh officer disliked by his own men as well as by his opponents.  He received the nickname "Donald Goran" (Donald the Sinister).  There is some indication that his wounding at Louisbourg may have been at the hands of his own men.  When he was killed at Sillery, his body was hacked to pieces.

{{About|the psychology experiment|the American punk band |Stanford Prison Experiment (band)}}
The '''Stanford prison experiment''' ('''SPE''') was a study of the [[psychology|psychological]] effects of becoming a [[prisoner]] or [[prison guard]]. The experiment was conducted at [[Stanford University]] from August 14–20, 1971, by a team of researchers led by psychology professor [[Philip Zimbardo]].<ref>[http://www.prisonexp.org/psychology/41 The Stanford Prison Experiment – A Simulation Study of the Psychology of Imprisonment Conducted at Stanford University]</ref> It was funded by the [[Office of Naval Research|US Office of Naval Research]]<ref>[http://www.prisonexp.org/faq.htm FAQ on official site]</ref> and was of interest to both the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] as an investigation into the causes of conflict between military guards and prisoners. 

Twenty-four male students out of seventy-five were selected to take on randomly assigned roles of prisoners and guards in a mock prison situated in the basement of the Stanford psychology building. The participants adapted to their roles well beyond Zimbardo's expectations, as the guards enforced [[authoritarian]] measures and ultimately subjected some of the prisoners to [[psychological torture]]. Many of the prisoners passively accepted psychological abuse, and, at the request of the guards, readily harassed other prisoners who attempted to prevent it. The experiment even affected Zimbardo himself, who, in his role as the [[Superintendent (jail)|superintendent]], permitted the abuse to continue. Two of the prisoners quit the experiment early, and the entire experiment was abruptly stopped after only six days. Certain portions of the experiment were filmed, and excerpts of footage are publicly available.

== Goals and methods ==
Zimbardo and his team aimed to test the hypothesis that the inherent personality traits of prisoners and guards are the chief cause of abusive behavior in prison. Participants were recruited and told they would participate in a two-week prison simulation. Out of 75 respondents, Zimbardo and his team selected the 24 males whom they deemed to be the most psychologically stable and healthy.<ref>Smith, J. R., & Haslam, S. A. (Eds.). (2012). Social psychology: revisiting the classic studies. Sage.</ref> These participants were predominantly [[middle class|middle-class]].<ref>[http://www.prisonexp.org/slide-4.htm Slideshow on official site]</ref> The group was intentionally selected to exclude those with criminal background, psychological impairments or medical problems. They all agreed to participate in a 7–14-day period and received $15 per day (roughly equivalent to $85 in 2012).

The experiment was conducted in the basement of Jordan Hall (Stanford's psychology building). Twelve of the twenty-four participants were assigned the role of prisoner (nine plus three alternates), while the other twelve were assigned the role of guard (also nine plus three alternates). Zimbardo took on the role of the superintendent, and an undergraduate [[research assistant]] the role of the warden. Zimbardo designed the experiment in order to induce [[disorientation]], [[depersonalization]] and [[deindividualization]] in the participants.

The researchers held an orientation session for guards the day before the experiment, during which they instructed them not to physically harm the prisoners. In the footage of the study, Zimbardo can be seen talking to the guards: "You can create in the prisoners feelings of boredom, a sense of fear to some degree, you can create a notion of arbitrariness that their life is totally controlled by us, by the system, you, me, and they'll have no privacy ... We're going to take away their individuality in various ways. In general what all this leads to is a sense of powerlessness. That is, in this situation we'll have all the power and they'll have none."<ref>[http://www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/staff/msh/mh_teaching_site_files/a_lectures/C82SAD%20L07%20Social%20Influence%20II%20The%20BBC%20Prison%20Experiment%20(handout).doc C82SAD L07 Social Influence II The BBC Prison Experiment (handout).doc]</ref>

The researchers provided the guards with wooden [[Club (weapon)|batons]] to establish their status,<ref>[http://www.zimbardo.com/downloads/1973%20A%20Study%20of%20Prisoners%20and%20Guards,%20Naval%20Research%20Reviews.pdf Haney, C., Banks, W. C., & Zimbardo, P. G. 1973. ]</ref> clothing similar to that of an actual prison guard (khaki shirt and pants from a local [[surplus store|military surplus store]]), and [[Mirrorshades (fashion)|mirrored sunglasses]] to prevent [[eye contact]]. Prisoners wore uncomfortable ill-fitting smocks and stocking caps, as well as a chain around one ankle. Guards were instructed to call prisoners by their assigned numbers, sewn on their uniforms, instead of by name.

The prisoners were arrested at their homes and charged with armed robbery. The local Palo Alto police department assisted Zimbardo with the arrests and conducted full booking procedures on the prisoners, which included [[fingerprint]]ing and taking [[mug shot]]s. They were transported to the mock prison from the police station, where they were [[strip search]]ed and given their new identities.

The small mock prison cells were set up to hold three prisoners each. There was a small space for the prison yard, solitary confinement, and a bigger room across from the prisoners for the guards and warden. The prisoners were to stay in their cells all day and night until the end of the study. The guards worked in teams of three for eight-hour shifts. The guards did not have to stay on site after their shift.

== Results ==
{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}

After a relatively uneventful first day, on the second day the prisoners in Cell 1 blockaded their cell door with their beds and took off their stocking caps, refusing to come out or follow the guards' instructions. Guards from other shifts volunteered to work extra hours to assist in subduing the revolt, and subsequently attacked the prisoners with [[fire extinguisher]]s without being supervised by the research staff. Finding that handling nine cell mates with only three guards per shift was challenging, one of the guards suggested that they use psychological tactics to control them. They set up a "privilege cell" in which prisoners who were not involved in the riot were treated with special rewards, such as higher quality meals. The "privileged" inmates chose not to eat the meal in order to stay uniform with their fellow prisoners.
After only 36 hours, one prisoner began to act "crazy", as Zimbardo described: "#8612 then began to act crazy, to scream, to curse, to go into a rage that seemed out of control. It took quite a while before we became convinced that he was really suffering and that we had to release him."

Guards forced the prisoners to repeat their assigned numbers<ref>[http://www.prisonexp.org/psychology/11 The Stanford Prison Experiment Slide tour]</ref> to reinforce the idea that this was their new identity. Guards soon used these prisoner counts to harass the prisoners, using physical punishment such as protracted exercise for errors in the prisoner count. Sanitary conditions declined rapidly, exacerbated by the guards' refusal to allow some prisoners to urinate or defecate anywhere but in a bucket placed in their cell. As punishment, the guards would not let the prisoners empty the sanitation bucket. Mattresses were a valued item in the prison, so the guards would punish prisoners by removing their mattresses, leaving them to sleep on concrete. Some prisoners were forced to be naked as a method of degradation. Several guards became increasingly cruel as the experiment continued; experimenters reported that approximately one-third of the guards exhibited genuine sadistic tendencies. Most of the guards were upset when the experiment concluded after only six days.

Zimbardo mentions his own absorption in the experiment. On the fourth day, some of the guards stated that they heard a rumor that the released prisoner was going to come back with his friends and free the remaining inmates. Zimbardo and the guards disassembled the prison and moved it onto a different floor of the building. Zimbardo himself waited in the basement, in case the released prisoner showed up, and planned to tell him that the experiment had been terminated. The released prisoner never returned, and the prison was rebuilt in the basement once again.

Zimbardo argued that the prisoners had [[internalization|internalized]] their roles, since some had stated that they would accept "parole" even if it would mean forfeiting their pay, despite the fact that quitting would have achieved the same result without the delay involved in waiting for their parole requests to be granted or denied.<ref name="Zimbardo, P.G. 2007">Zimbardo, P.G. (2007). ''The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil''. New York: Random House.</ref> Zimbardo argued they had no reason for continued participation in the experiment after having lost all monetary compensation, yet they did, because they had internalized the prisoner identity.

Prisoner No. 416, a newly admitted stand-by prisoner, expressed concern over the treatment of the other prisoners. The guards responded with more abuse. When he refused to eat his sausages, saying he was on a hunger strike, guards confined him to "solitary confinement", a dark closet: "the guards then instructed the other prisoners to repeatedly punch on the door while shouting at 416."<ref name = "Lucifer">[http://www.lucifereffect.com ''The Lucifer Effect'' website]</ref> The guards stated that he would be released from solitary confinement only if the prisoners gave up their blankets and slept on their bare mattresses, which all but one refused to do.

Zimbardo aborted the experiment early when [[Christina Maslach]], a graduate student in psychology whom he was dating (and later married),<ref>[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/97/970108prisonexp.html Stanford University News Service – The Standard Prison Experiment]</ref> objected to the conditions of the prison after she was introduced to the experiment to conduct interviews. Zimbardo noted that, of more than fifty people who had observed the experiment, Maslach was the only one who questioned its morality. After only six days of a planned two weeks' duration, the Stanford prison experiment was discontinued.<ref name="Zimbardo, P.G. 2007"/>

== Conclusions ==
On August 20, 1971, Zimbardo announced the end of the experiment to the participants. The results of the experiment have been argued to demonstrate the impressionability and obedience of people when provided with a legitimizing ideology and social and institutional support. The experiment has also been used to illustrate [[cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance theory]] and the power of [[authority]].

The results of the experiment favor [[Attribution theory|situational attribution]] of behavior rather than [[dispositional attribution]] (a result caused by internal characteristics). In other words, it seemed that the situation, rather than their individual [[personality psychology|personalities]], caused the participants' behavior. Under this interpretation, the results are compatible with the results of the [[Milgram experiment]], in which ordinary people fulfilled orders to administer what appeared to be agonizing and dangerous [[electric shock]]s to a confederate of the experimenter.

Shortly after the study had been completed, there were bloody revolts at both the [[San Quentin]] and [[Attica Prison riots|Attica]] prison facilities, and Zimbardo reported his findings on the experiment to the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]].

== Criticism ==
The guards and prisoners adapted to their roles more than they were expected, stepping beyond predicted boundaries, leading to dangerous and psychologically damaging situations. One-third of the guards were judged to have exhibited "genuine sadistic tendencies", while many prisoners were emotionally traumatized, as five of them had to be removed from the experiment early. After Maslach confronted Zimbardo and forced him to realize that he had been passively allowing unethical acts to be performed under his supervision, Zimbardo concluded that both prisoners and guards had become grossly absorbed in their roles and realized that he had likewise become as grossly absorbed in his own, and he terminated the experiment.<ref>[http://www.prisonexp.org/slide-31.htm Stanford Prison Experiment – Conclusion]</ref> Ethical concerns surrounding the experiment often draw comparisons to the [[Milgram experiment]], which was conducted ten years earlier in 1961 at [[Yale University]] by [[Stanley Milgram]].

=== Peer-review ===
Because of the structure of the experiment, Zimbardo found it impossible to keep traditional [[scientific control]]s in place. He was unable to remain a [[Observation|neutral observer]], since he influenced the direction of the experiment as the prison's superintendent. Conclusions and observations drawn by the experimenters were largely [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]], and the experiment would be difficult for other researchers to [[reproducibility|reproduce]].

Critics such as [[Erich Fromm]] challenged the generalization of the experiment's results. Fromm specifically wrote that the personality of an individual does affect behavior when imprisoned, using historical examples from the [[Nazi concentration camps]]. This ran counter to the study's conclusion that the prison situation itself controls the individual's behavior. Fromm also argued that the amount of sadism in the "normal" subjects could not be determined with the methods employed to screen them.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/or/sociologyshop/frozim.html Fromm 1973, pg 76-90]</ref>

=== Ecological validity ===
The study has been criticized on the basis of [[ecological validity]]. Many of the conditions imposed in the experiment were arbitrary and may not have correlated with actual prison conditions, including blindfolding incoming prisoners, not allowing them to wear underwear, not allowing them to look out of windows and not allowing them to use their names. Zimbardo argued that prison is a confusing and dehumanizing experience and that it was necessary to enact these procedures to put the prisoners in the proper frame of mind; however, he conceded that it was difficult to know how similar the effects were to an actual prison, and that the experiment's methods would be difficult to reproduce exactly.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

=== Role-playing ===
Some of the experiment's critics argued that participants were merely engaging in [[role-playing]], basing their behavior on how they were expected to behave or modeling it after [[stereotype]]s about the behavior of prisoners and guards. In response, Zimbardo claimed that even if there was role-playing initially, participants [[internalization|internalized]] these roles as the experiment continued.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

=== Focus on a particular guard ===
Marco Reus said that the study placed undue emphasis on the cruelty of the guards, such as one who was nicknamed "John Wayne", and who said that he caused the escalation of events between guards and prisoners after he began to emulate a character from the [[Paul Newman]] film ''[[Cool Hand Luke]].'' He further intensified his actions because he was nicknamed "John Wayne", even though he was trying to mimic actor [[Strother Martin]], who had played the role of the sadistic Captain in the movie.<ref>"John Wayne" (name withheld). Interview. "The Science of Evil." Primetime. Basic Instincts. KATU. January 3, 2007.</ref>

=== Selection bias ===
Also, it has been argued that [[selection bias]] may have played a role in the results. Researchers from Western Kentucky University recruited students for a study using an advertisement similar to the one used in the Stanford Prison Experiment, with some ads saying "a psychological study" (the control group), and some with the words "prison life" as originally worded in Dr. Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment. It was found that students who responded to the classified advertisement for the "prison study" were higher in traits such as social dominance, aggression, authoritarianism, etc. and were lower in traits related to empathy and altruism when statistically compared to the control group participants. When attempting to recruit students using a 3rd classified advertisement geared towards "helping behaviors", not enough participants volunteered for the study to show any statistical significance.<ref name=revisitingSFE>{{Cite journal | first = Thomas | last = Carnahan |author2=Sam McFarland | year = 2007 | title = Revisiting the Stanford prison experiment: could participant self-selection have led to the cruelty? | quote = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 603–14 | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~bertsch/Carnahan.pdf}}</ref>

=== Demand characteristics ===
The study has been criticized for [[demand characteristics]]. Research has shown that participants in psychological experiments are highly motivated to do what they believe the researchers want them to do. Zimbardo essentially instructed the guards to be cruel.<ref>Peter Gray (2013), Freedom to Learn blog [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201310/why-zimbardo-s-prison-experiment-isn-t-in-my-textbook Why Zimbardo’s Prison Experiment Isn’t in My Textbook]</ref>

=== Other ===
Many other critiques have been expressed, including the following by the skeptic [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]]: "Most of the Stanford guards did not exhibit any cruel or unusual behavior, often being friendly and doing favors for the prisoners...The statistical validity of the sample of participants, 24 male Stanford students of about the same age, has been called into question as being too small and restrictive to be generally applicable to the population at large...(and the fact that) Zimbardo has dedicated much of his career to the promotion of the idea that bad environments drive bad behavior."<ref>{{cite podcast | title = What You Didn't Know about the Stanford Prison Experiment| url = http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4102 | publisher = [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]] | date = May 27, 2008 | accessdate = 2014-07-15}}</ref>

== Comparisons to Abu Ghraib ==

When [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|acts of prisoner torture and abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq]] were publicized in March 2004, [[Philip Zimbardo|Zimbardo]] himself, who paid close attention to the details of the story, was struck by the similarity with his own experiment. He was dismayed by official military and government representatives' shifting the blame for the torture and abuses in the [[Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]] American military prison on to "a few bad apples" rather than acknowledging it as possibly systemic problems of a formally established military incarceration system.

Eventually, Zimbardo became involved with the defense team of lawyers representing one of the Abu Ghraib prison guards, Staff Sergeant [[Ivan Frederick|Ivan "Chip" Frederick]]. He was granted full access to all investigation and background reports, and testified as an [[expert witness]] in SSG Frederick's [[court martial]], which resulted in an eight-year prison sentence for Frederick in October 2004.

Zimbardo drew from his participation in the Frederick case to write the book ''The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil,'' published by Random House in 2007, which deals with the striking similarities between his own Stanford Prison Experiment and the Abu Ghraib abuses.<ref name = "Lucifer"/>

=== BBC prison study ===
Psychologists [[Alex Haslam]] and [[Steve Reicher]] conducted the BBC Prison Study in 2006.<ref>[http://www.bbcprisonstudy.org The BBC Prison Study Official Site]</ref> This was a partial replication of the Stanford prison experiment conducted with the assistance of the [[BBC]], which broadcast events in the study in a documentary series called ''[[The Experiment]]''. Their results and conclusions differed from Zimbardo's and led to a number of publications on tyranny, [[stress (biology)|stress]], and leadership. Moreover, unlike results from the Stanford prison experiment, these were published in leading academic journals such as ''[[British Journal of Social Psychology]]'', ''[[Journal of Applied Psychology]]'', ''[[Social Psychology Quarterly]]'', and ''[[Personality and Social Psychology Review]]''. The BBC Prison Study is now taught as a core study on the UK [[A-level]] [[Psychology]] OCR syllabus.

While Haslam and Reicher's procedure was not a direct replication of Zimbardo's, their study casts further doubt on the generality of his conclusions. Specifically, it questions the notion that people slip mindlessly into role and the idea that the dynamics of evil are in any way banal. Their research also points to the importance of leadership in the emergence of tyranny of the form displayed by Zimbardo when briefing guards in the Stanford experiment.<ref>[http://education.guardian.co.uk/academicexperts/story/0,,1605313,00.html Interview of Alex Haslam] at ''The Guardian''</ref><ref>{{cite interview|last=Reicher|first=Steve|authorlink=Steve Reicher|last2=Haslam|first2=Alex|authorlink2=Alex Haslam|interviewer = Briggs, Pam |title=''Learning from the Experiment''|program=The Psychologist|url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/interviews/experiment.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221194634/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/interviews/experiment.htm| archivedate=2009-02-21}}</ref>

[[The Third Wave]] was a 1967 recreation of [[Nazi Party]] dynamics by high school teacher [[Ron Jones (teacher)|Ron Jones]] in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], California. Although the veracity of Jones' accounts has been questioned,<ref>[http://geniebusters.org/915/wave_statements.html "The Third Wave, Evidence from the people who were there."]</ref> several participants in the study have gone on record to confirm the events.<ref>[http://www.lessonplanmovie.com/ "A Look at the Original Students of The Third Wave and Their Teacher Ron Jones, 40 Years Later"]</ref>

== In popular culture ==

'''''Pretenders''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by the British-American band [[The Pretenders]], released on 19 January 1980 under Real Records ([[Sire Records]] in the [[United States]]). A combination of [[Rock music|rock]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[pop music]], this album made the band famous. The album features the singles  "[[Stop Your Sobbing#The Pretenders Version|Stop Your Sobbing]]" "[[Kid (Pretenders song)|Kid]]" and "[[Brass in Pocket]]".

[[Nick Lowe]] produced the Pretenders' first single, "[[Stop Your Sobbing#The Pretenders Version|Stop Your Sobbing]]", but decided not to work with them again as he thought the band "wasn't going anywhere".{{cite quote|date=June 2014}} [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] took over on the subsequent recording sessions.

''Pretenders'' debuted at number 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] in the week of its release and stayed there for four consecutive weeks. It also made the top 10 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified Platinum during 1982 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. ''Pretenders'' has been named one of the best albums of all time by [[VH1]] (#52). In 2003, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked the album number 155 on its list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]], and, in 1989, ranked it the 20th best album of the 1980s. The track "Private Life" was covered that same year by [[Grace Jones]], on her album ''[[Warm Leatherette (album)|Warm Leatherette]]''. In 2012, [[Slant Magazine]] listed the album at #64 on its list, "Best Albums of the 1980s".<ref>http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/feature/best-albums-of-the-1980s/308/page_4</ref>

''Pretenders'' was remastered and re-released in 2006 and included a bonus disc of demos, B-sides and live cuts, many previously unreleased. "Cuban Slide" and "Porcelain" originally appeared as B-sides to "Talk of the Town" and "Message of Love", while "Swinging London" and "Nervous But Shy" both appeared on the flip side of "Brass in Pocket". The Regents Park Demo of "Stop Your Sobbing" was included initially as a flexi-single in the May 1981 edition of ''[[Flexipop]]'' magazine. The tracks "Message of Love", "Talk of the Town", "Porcelain" and "Cuban Slide" alongside a live version of the album's opening track, "Precious", were released on a follow-up EP entitled ''[[Extended Play (The Pretenders EP)|Extended Play]]'' soon after. "Message of Love" contains the [[Oscar Wilde]] line "We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars" from the play ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]''.[http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/26036.html]

''Pretenders'' was also reissued in 2009 by Audio Fidelity as a limited edition, audiophile gold CD using the original master tapes. However, this remaster suffered from [[limiting]] supposedly applied ''after'' engineer [[Steve Hoffman (audio engineer)|Steve Hoffman]]'s digital master was created and approved. The song "The Phone Call" is missing some of the sound effects on this release because they were flown in after the master was completed for the song and, as a result, weren't on the original master tape.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} There were no bonus tracks included.

A shortened version of "Tequila" would be performed nearly fifteen years later on the ''[[Last of the Independents]]''. "Sabre Dance" features [[Chrissie Hynde]] singing portions of "Stop Your Sobbing" over lengthy solos by [[James Honeyman-Scott]] and [[Martin Chambers]]' insistent drumming, making it a truly unique version.

The song "[[Tattooed Love Boys]]" is featured as a playable track in the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox 360]] music video game ''[[Guitar Hero II]]''. The instrumental "Space Invader" contains sound effects from the video game ''[[Space Invaders]]''. "Private Life" is featured in ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories]]'' on fictional radio station Emotion 98.3. A cover version of "Brass in Pocket" and the master version of "Precious" are available as downloadable content for ''[[Rock Band]]''.

'''Feni'''  ({{lang-bn|???? ???? }}, ''Feni Jela'' also ''Feni Zila'') is a small southeastern district of [[Bangladesh]] bordering (clockwise from the north) Tripura in [India], [[Chittagong District|Chittagong district]], the Bay of Bengal, Noakhali district and Comilla district.<ref name=Banglapedia>{{cite book|year=2012|edition=Second|author=Tipu Sultan|chapter=Feni District|url=http://www.banglapedia.org/HT/F_0064.htm|title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh|editor=Sirajul Islam and Ahmed A. Jamal|publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> It comprises six sub-districts ("Upazilas"): [[Feni Sadar Upazila|Feni Sadar]], [[Chhagalnaiya]], [[Porshuram]], [[Fulgazi]] (variant of Phool Ghazi), [[Daganbhuiyan]] and [[Sonagazi]].

At British Indian period it was a sub district of [[Chittagong]]. Before becoming a full-fledged district in 1984, it was part of the [[Noakhali]] district. Feni has a moderate climate with a little high humidity and a rich history dating back almost 3000 years. Except agriculture, maximum people of Feni resides in [[Dhaka]] City, [[Chittagong]] City, [[Sylhet]] City engaged in all sorts of jobs and business ranging from menial labor to high profiled office jobs. It has a large contingent of its population residing in the Middle East and other parts of the world.A huge amount of foreign remittance receiving by the govt are sent by the people of this region.

The main highway of Bangladesh, Dhaka-Chittagong inter-district highway passes through Feni. Buses usually take 3–4 hours to travel on 165&nbsp;km highway from Dhaka and about 2.5 hours from Chittagong. There is a railway junction situated here called Feni junction. Panoramic landscape comprising the Tripura valley, [[Feni River]] estuarine and green paddy fields add to Feni district's scenic beauty. Feni is also important from strategic viewpoints, its position near the Indian border and the Bay of Bengal. Feni is also the only connecting link between the rest of the country and the districts of Chittagong (where the largest port of the country is situated), Cox's Bazar (the most important tourist destination of the country) and three Hill Districts: [[Rangamati]], [[Bandaraban]] and [[Khagrachari]].

One of the three Girls Cadet Colleges in [[Bangladesh]] is situated in Feni. The other two are in [[Mymensingh]] and [[Joypurhat]] districts. The country's only Government-run Computer Institute also is situated in Feni. Three private electricity plants supplying electricity are existing here.  There is also a pharmaceutical products producing factory. Zenith Pharmaceuticals Ltd. is one of the country's oldest pharmaceuticals company in Bangladesh.

==Administration==
Feni district was established on February 15, 1984. It has six upazillas, 45 union parishads, and approximately 570 villages. The upazillas are:

# [[Feni Sadar Upazila|Feni Sadar]]
# [[Sonagazi Upazila|Sonagazi]]
# [[Fulgazi Upazila|Fhulgazi]]
# [[Chhagalnaiya|Chagalnaiya]]

}}'''Visual IRC''' ('''ViRC''') is an [[open source]] [[Internet Relay Chat]] client for the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system. Unlike many other [[List of IRC clients|IRC client]]s, nearly all of the functionality in ViRC is driven by the included [[IRC script|script]], with the result that the program's behavior can be extended or changed without altering the [[source code]].

==History==
*Visual IRC (16-bit) - Released in 1995 for Windows 3.x, written by MeGALiTH. This [[computer program|program]] had many built-in features, but it was also scriptable with VPL ([[ViRC Programming Language]]), the predecessor to [[ViRCScript]] and [[Versus programming language|Versus]].

*Visual IRC '96 (and later Visual IRC '97, Visual IRC '98) - Released in 1996, written by MeGALiTH. This was the first 32-bit version of ViRC, written for Windows 9x/NT. Many of the features that were built into 16-bit ViRC were handled by the default script in ViRC '96. ViRC '98 contained some code contributed by [[Jesse McGrew]] AKA "Mr2001", particularly enhancements to the ViRCScript engine. The [[scripting programming language|scripting language]] was incompatible with the earlier version. In later versions, voice chat and video conferencing features were added.

:Development of the second incarnation slowed down, and by 2000, Visual IRC appeared to be dead. The original author MeGALiTH (Adrian Cable) passed the source code to a user, Mr2001 (Jesse McGrew), who had previously contributed some code, and who had secretly been developing a [[clone (computer science)|clone]] called [[Bisual IRC]] (BIRC). Rather than restarting development of the ViRC '98 code base, he merged some of ViRC '98's features into BIRC and released it as Visual IRC 2.

*Visual IRC 2 - First released by Mr2001, coincidentally in 2001, this version's [[Versus programming language|Versus]] scripting language is based on ViRCScript, but internally it has been almost totally rewritten. In fact, ViRC 2 only shares a few hundred lines of code with ViRC '98. The voice and video conferencing features were removed in this version because the [[library (computer science)|libraries]] used to implement them were no longer supported.

Much of the source code to BIRC, ViRC 2, and the related utilities has been released under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] through the project's web site and [[SourceForge]].

==Versus==
'''Versus''' is a [[scripting language]] originally developed for the [[IRC]] [[IRC client|client]] [[Bisual IRC]], and currently used with Visual IRC. It is similar in many ways to the scripting languages used by [[ircII]] and [[mIRC]], as well as [[Tcl]] and [[C (programming language)|C]].

The name "Versus" was chosen because it could be shortened to "VS", which was a common abbreviation for [[ViRCScript]], the language used by Visual IRC '96 through '98. Versus remained mostly [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with ViRCScript, so existing documentation and commentary that mentioned "VS" remained mostly accurate when applied to Versus. The name also alluded to BIRC's origins as a replacement for ViRC.

'''Object Versus''', or OVS, refers to the [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] features of Versus. Scripts can define [[class (computer science)|classes]] and work with objects and methods instead of textual data and [[IRC script|aliases]]; however, in practice, OVS is mostly used to manipulate the [[Visual Component Library|VCL]] objects that make up ViRC's interface.

===Script storage===

Scripts are stored in files, usually with a .vsc [[file extension]], though the .lib extension is sometimes used. A Versus script file simply contains [[statement (programming)|statement]]s to be interpreted when the script is loaded; any blocks defined in a script (see below) will replace blocks defined with the same name by previous scripts.

===Blocks that can be defined in a script===

*'''Aliases''' are [[subroutine]]s. They can be called from the command entry line of any window, or from other parts of the script. Aliases that return a value are called functions; an alias can determine whether it's expected to return a value, and then act as a function or a command appropriately.
*'''Classes''' are used in object-oriented scripting (OVS). Each class may contain [[property (computer science)|properties]], [[method (computer science)|method]]s, a [[constructor (computer science)|constructor]], and a [[destructor (computer science)|destructor]].
*'''Events''' are used to [[event handler|handle]] messages from the IRC [[Server (computing)|server]], as well as certain system- or client-level occurrences, such as completing a [[Direct Client-to-Client|file transfer]] or opening a new window.
**Server events use [[regular expression]]s or Versus's own [[wildcard character]]s to match messages from the server. If multiple server events match a particular message, only the one with the highest priority (calculated from the length of the pattern and the relative "value" of the wildcards therein) will be executed.
**Client events are identified by name: for example, &lt;OnCreateWindow_foo&gt; and &lt;OnCreateWindow_bar&gt; will both run when a new window is opened. They can also include patterns, which limit the particular occurrences that can trigger that event (for example, to only run when a new ''channel'' window is created).
*'''Menu trees''' and '''menu items''' define the [[context menu]]s that can appear for various elements of the client's interface, as well as the main menu which is always visible. Menu tree blocks define the menu's layout and set captions for each item; menu item blocks define the script code to be executed when an item is clicked.
*'''Toolbars''' and '''toolbar items''' are similar to menu tree and menu item blocks, but they define the [[toolbar]]s associated with each window. New toolbars can be added to the interface simply by choosing a unique name.

Aliases, methods (including constructors and destructors), events, menu items, and toolbar items are referred to as '''routines''' or code blocks.

=== Data storage ===
====Files====
*Scripts can access files with the functions $RandomRead() and $ReadLine(), and the commands CreateFile and AppendText.
*Scripts can also use the TStringList [[Visual Component Library|VCL]] class to read an entire text file into memory, manipulate it, and save it.

====Variables====
*All variables may contain up to 4 [[gibibyte|GiB]] of data.
*Variable names begin with a dollar sign ($) and an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or underscore.
*Variables may contain any characters, although they are usually used for printable text.
*'''Local variables''' are set with the <code>@L</code> command and only exist in the context of the routine that created them. They are deleted when the routine ends. Some local variables are predefined, such as $C for the current channel's name.
*'''Global variables''' are set with the <code>@</code> command and can be accessed from any routine. They are deleted when the client exits. Aliases may return a value by setting the global variable $fresult.
*'''Stored variables''' are set with the <code>@S</code> command and, like global variables, can be accessed anywhere. Their values are saved to persistent storage immediately, and restored the next time the client starts.

====Associative arrays====
*[[Associative array]]s map keys to values.
*Keys and values can contain up to 4 GiB of data with no limits on the allowed characters.
*Local, global, and stored array values can be set using the <code>@L</code>, <code>@</code>, and <code>@S</code> commands, and they behave just like the corresponding variables. When a stored array value is set, the entire array is saved.
*The syntax <code>$arrayname[key]</code> is used to set or retrieve the value for a particular key.
*The syntax <code>$arrayname</code> alone treats an array as a list of key-value pairs, allowing a script to set the entire contents of an array at once, or iterate through the keys that are already present.

====Pseudovariables====
*Pseudovariables (or pvars) are similar in syntax to variables, but their values cannot be changed.
*The pvars $0 through $9 contain the parameters that were passed to the current routine, in order. $0 contains the routine's name, $1 contains the first word of the parameter string, and so on.
*The pvars $0- through $9- contain the parameters that were passed to the current routine, plus all following parameters. $0- contains the routine's name and the entire parameter string, $1- contains all parameters, $2- contains all parameters after the first, and so on.
*The special sequence <code>$?="PROMPT STRING"</code> causes a dialog box to appear, prompting the user to enter a value.

=== Code examples ===

Here is the [[Hello World]] code example:

<pre>Alias HELLO
  TextOut > $C clBlack Hello, world!
EndAlias</pre>

Here is an example to count to ten:

'''Li Zicheng''' (<!-- DO NOT add the Chinese characters for his name here. They are already in the name box on the right side of this page. -->22 September 1606 – 1645), born '''Li Hongji''', nicknamed "'''Dashing King'''", was a Chinese rebel leader who overthrew the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1644 and ruled over China briefly as the [[Emperor of China|emperor]] of the short-lived [[Shun dynasty]] before his death a year later.

==Early years==
Li was born in [[Mizhi County]], [[Yulin, Shaanxi|Yulin]], [[Shaanxi]] in the late [[Ming dynasty]]. Initially a shepherd, he started learning horse riding and archery at the age of 20, and had also worked in a wine shop and as an blacksmith's apprentice.

According to folklore, in 1630, Li was put on public display in an iron collar and shackles for his failure to repay loans to a usurious magistrate, Ai. Ai struck a guard who offered shade and water to Li, whence a group of peasants tore apart Li's shackles, spirited him to a nearby hill, and proclaimed him their leader. Although they were only armed with wooden sticks, Li and his band managed to ambush a group of government soldiers sent to arrest them, and obtained their first real weapons.

==As a general under Gao Yingxiang==
At the same time, the [[Shaanxi]] region was hit by a famine, and the common people resented the Ming government. Li joined a rebel army led by [[Gao Yingxiang]], who was nicknamed "Dashing King".<!-- DO NOT insert the Chinese characters for "Dashing King" here. They are already in the name box on the right side of this page. --> He inherited Gao's nickname and command of the rebel army after Gao's death.

Within three years, Li succeeded in rallying more than 20,000 men to form a rebel army. They attacked and killed prominent government officials, such as [[Sun Chuanting]], in [[Henan]], [[Shanxi]] and [[Shaanxi]] provinces.

Some battles Li fought in this period
* Battle of Chexiang Pass
* Battle of Fengyang

==Battles of Luoyang, Nanyang and Kaifeng==
Li advocated the slogan of "dividing land equally and abolishing the grain taxes payment system" which won great support of peasants. The song of "killing cattle and sheep, preparing tasty wine and opening the city gate to welcome the Dashing King" was widely spread at that time.

Li declared himself the King of the [[Shun dynasty]] in [[Xi'an]], [[Shaanxi]].{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==From the Battle of Xiangyang to the creation of the Shun dynasty==
In 1642, Li captured [[Xiangyang]] and proclaimed himself "King Xinshun".

==Battle of Beijing and Battle of Shanhai Pass==

In April 1644, Li's rebels sacked the Ming capital of [[Beijing]], and the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] committed suicide. Li proclaimed himself the Emperor of the [[Shun dynasty]].

After Li's army was defeated on 27 May 1644 at the [[Battle of Shanhai Pass]] by the combined forces of the defecting Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] and the Manchus, Li fled from Beijing towards his base in Shaanxi.

==The decline and death of Li==
After a number of defeats Li Zicheng disappeared. In the long term, it led to the development of myths and legends concerning Li. The principal one being that he was a great hope. Some folktales hold that Li survived after his defeats and became a monk for the rest of his life. Li mysteriously disappeared and there were different theories about his death too, at the age of 40. Some suggested that he committed suicide by hanging himself on a lotus tree, while others thought that he was killed by pro-Ming militia during his escape in 1645. It is thought that in 1645, Li Zicheng was killed in battle at Mount Jiugong.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} He fled into the south, in present-day [[Hubei]].{{clarify|date=March 2014}}

==Historiography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}

Although the success of the [[Manchu conquest of China]] was attributed to the weakening of the [[Ming dynasty]] (exacerbated by Li Zicheng's rebellion), ironically, official historiography during the [[Qing dynasty]] regarded Li as an illegitimate usurper and outlaw. This view sought to discourage and demonize notions of rebellion against the Qing government, by propagating that the Manchus put an end to Li's illegitimate rule and restore peace to the empire, thus receiving the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to rule China. In 20th century China, the anti-[[Confucianism|Confucian]] and radical inclinations of the [[Communist Party of China]] viewed Li favourably, portraying him as an early revolutionary against [[feudalism]].

==In popular culture==
Li is featured as a character in some of the works of [[Hong Kong]] ''[[wuxia]]'' writer [[Jin Yong]] (Louis Cha). Li's rebellion against the [[Ming dynasty]] is featured in ''[[Sword Stained with Royal Blood]]'' and his personality is analysed from the point of view of [[List of Sword Stained with Royal Blood characters|Yuan Chengzhi]], the protagonist. In ''[[The Deer and the Cauldron]]'', set in the [[Qing dynasty]] during the early reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]], Li is revealed to have survived and fathered a daughter, [[List of The Deer and the Cauldron characters|A'ke]], with [[Chen Yuanyuan]]. Li is also briefly mentioned by name in ''[[Fox Volant of the Snowy Mountain]]'' and ''[[The Young Flying Fox]]''.

Li is the main character of the historical epic novel ''[[Li Zicheng (Novel)|Li Zicheng]]'' by [[Yao Xueyin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.danwei.org/books/an_updated_li_zicheng_for_cont.php |title=A tragic peasant rebellion, abridged for today's readers |first=Joel |last=Martinsen |publisher=Danwei |date= 17 January 2008}}</ref>

'''Judy Chicago''' (born '''Judith Sylvia Cohen'''; July 20, 1939 in [[Chicago, Illinois]]) is an American [[feminist art]]ist and writer known for her large collaborative [[art installation]] pieces which examine the role of women in history and culture. Born in Chicago, Illinois, as Judith Cohen, she changed her name after the death of her father and her first husband, choosing to disconnect from the idea of male dominated naming conventions. By the 1970s, Chicago had coined the term "[[feminist art]]" and had founded the first feminist art program in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates stereotypical women's artistic skills, such as [[needlework]], counterbalanced with stereotypical male skills such as [[welding]] and [[pyrotechnics]]. Chicago's masterpiece is ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', which is in the collection of the [[Brooklyn Museum]].

==Early personal life==

Judy Chicago was born Judith Sylvia Cohen<ref name="A305">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 305</ref> in 1939, to Arthur and May Cohen, in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Her father came from a twenty-three generation lineage of [[rabbi]]s, including the [[Vilna Gaon]]. Unlike his family predecessors, he would become a [[labor organization|labor organizer]] and a [[Marxist]].<ref name="F279"/> Arthur worked nights at a post office and during the day he would take care of Chicago, while May, who was a former dancer, worked as a [[medical secretary]].<ref name="A305"/><ref name="F279"/> Arthur's active participation in the [[American Communist Party]], liberal views towards women and support of worker's rights, strongly influenced Chicago's way of thinking and belief system.<ref name="A306">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 306</ref> During the 1950s [[McCarthyism]] era, he was investigated, which made it difficult for him to find work and caused the family much turmoil.<ref name="F279"/> In 1945, while home alone with her infant brother, Ben, an [[FBI]] agent visited the home. The agent began to ask the six-year-old Chicago questions about her father and his friends, but the agent was interrupted upon the return of May to the house.<ref name="A306"/> Arthur's health declined, and he died in 1953 from [[peritonitis]]. May would not discuss his death with her children and did not allow them to attend the funeral. Chicago did not come to terms with his death until she was an adult; in the early 1960s she was hospitalized for almost a month with a bleeding ulcer attributed to unresolved [[grief]].<ref name="F279">Felder and Rosen, 279.</ref>

May loved the arts, and instilled her passion for them in her children, as evident in Chicago's future as an artist, and brother Ben's eventual career as a [[pottery|potter]]. At age of three, Chicago began to draw and was sent to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] to attend classes.<ref name="F279"/><ref name="W5">Wydler and Lippard, 5.</ref> By the age of 5, Chicago knew that she "never wanted to do anything but make art"<ref name="W5"/> and started attending classes at the Art Institute of Chicago.<ref name="The Guardian" />  She applied but was denied admission to the Art Institute,<ref name="A306"/> and instead attended [[UCLA]] on a scholarship.<ref name="F279"/>

==Education and early career==

While at UCLA she became politically active, designing posters for the UCLA chapter [[NAACP]] and eventually became its corresponding secretary.<ref name="A306"/> In June 1959, she met and fell in love with Jerry Gerowitz. She left school and moved in with him, for the first time having her own studio space. The couple [[hitch hike]]d to New York in 1959, just as Chicago's mother and brother moved to Los Angeles to be closer to her.<ref name="A308">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 308</ref> The couple lived in [[Greenwich Village]] for a time, before returning in 1960 from Los Angeles to Chicago so she could finish her degree. Chicago married Gerowitz in 1961.<ref name="A311">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 311</ref> She graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] in 1962 and was a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]]. Gerowitz died in a car crash in 1963, devastating Chicago and causing her to suffer from an [[identity crisis]] until later that decade. She received her [[Master of Fine Arts]] from UCLA in 1964.<ref name="F279"/>

While in grad school, Chicago's created a series that was [[abstract art|abstract]], yet easily recognized as male and female [[sexual organs]]. These early works were called ''Bigamy,'' and represented the death of her husband. One depicted an abstract [[human penis|penis]] which was "stopped in flight" before it could unite with a [[vagina|vaginal form]]. Her professors, who were mainly men, were dismayed over these works.<ref name="A311"/> Despite the use of sexual organs in her work, Chicago refrained from using gender politics or identity as themes.

In 1965, Chicago displayed work in her first solo show, at the Rolf Nelson Gallery in Los Angeles; Chicago was one of only four female artists to take part in the show.<ref name="Illustrated Career History">{{cite web|last=Chicago|first=Judy|title=Illustrated Career History|url=http://www.judychicago.com/about/career-history.php}}</ref> In 1968, Chicago was asked why she did not participate in the "California Women in the Arts" exhibition at the [[Lytton Center]], to which she answered "I won't show in any group defined at Woman, Jewish, or California. Someday when we all grow up there will be no labels." Chicago began working in [[ice sculpture]], which represented "a metaphor for the preciousness of life," another reference towards her husband's death.<ref name="A314">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 314</ref>
[[File:Pasadenalifesaversstudy.jpg|thumb|right|''Study for Pasadena Lifesavers,'' prismacolor, 1968.]]

In 1969, the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] exhibited a series of Chicago's spherical acrylic plastic dome sculptures and drawings in an "experimental" gallery. ''[[Art in America]]'' noted that Chicago's work was at the forefront of the [[conceptual art]] movement, and the ''Los Angeles Times'' described the work as showing no signs of "theoretical New York type art."<ref name="A314"/> Chicago would describe her early artwork as [[minimalist]] and as her trying to be "one of the boys".<ref name="L455">Lewis and Lewis, 455.</ref> Chicago would also experiment with [[performance art]], using [[fireworks]] and [[pyrotechnics]] to create "atmospheres", which involved flashes of colored smoke being manipulated outdoors. Through this work she attempted to "feminize" and "soften" the landscape.<ref name="A315">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 315</ref>

During this time, Chicago also began exploring her own sexuality in her work. She created the ''Pasadena Lifesavers,'' which was a series of abstract paintings that placed [[acrylic paint]] on [[Plexiglas]]. The works blended colors to create an illusion that the shapes "turn, dissolve, open, close, vibrate, gesture, wiggle," representing her own discovery that "I was [[orgasm|multi-orgasmic]]." Chicago credited ''Pasadena Lifesavers,'' as being the major turning point in her work in relation to women's sexuality and representation.<ref name="A315"/>

===From Cohen to Gerowitz to Chicago: Name change===

As Chicago made a name for herself as an artist, and came to know herself as a woman, she no longer felt connected to her last name, Cohen. This was due to the late grief of the death of her father and the lost connection to her name through marriage, Judith Gerowitz, after her husband's death. She decided she wanted to change her last name to something independent of being connected to a man by marriage or heritage.<ref name="F279"/> During this time, she married sculptor [[Lloyd Hamrol]], in 1965. (They divorced in 1979.)<ref name="F280">Felder and Rosen, 280.</ref> Gallery owner [[Rolf Nelson]] nicknamed her "Judy Chicago"<ref name="F279"/> because of her strong personality and thick [[Chicago accent]]. She decided this would be her new name, and sought to change it legally. Chicago was described as being "appalled" by the fact that she had to have her new husband's signature on the paperwork to change her name legally.<ref name="F280"/> To celebrate the name change, she posed for the exhibition invitation dressed like a [[boxer]], wearing a [[sweatshirt]] with her new last name on it.<ref name="A315"/> She also posted a banner across the gallery at her 1970 solo show at [[California State University, Fullerton|California State University at Fullerton]], that read: "Judy Gerowitz hereby divests herself of all names imposed upon her through male social dominance and chooses her own name, Judy Chicago."<ref name="F280"/> An advertisement with the same statement was also placed in ''[[Artforum]]'s'' October 1970 issue.<ref name=Levin2007p139>[[#SrcLevin2007|Levin, ''Becoming Judy Chicago; A Biography of the Artist'', p. 139]]</ref>

==Artistic career==

===The feminist art movement and the 1970s===
In 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at [[Fresno State College]], hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work.<ref name="A317">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 317</ref> At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she would teach the fifteen students off campus to escape "the presence and hence, the expectations of men."<ref name="A318">Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 318</ref> It was at this time when Chicago would coin the term "[[feminist art]]"<ref name="W9">Wydler and Lippard, 9.</ref> and the class would be the first [[Feminist art movement#Feminist art.27s first steps in Fresno|feminist art program]] in the United States.<ref name="F280"/> Chicago is considered on of the "first-generation feminist artists," a group that also includes [[Mary Beth Edelson]], [[Carolee Schneeman]], and [[Rachel Rosenthal]]. They were part of the [[Feminist art movement]] in Europe and the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|United States]] in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art.<ref>{{cite book | author=Thomas Patin and Jennifer McLerran | title=Artwords: A Glossary of Contemporary Art Theory |location=Westport, CT | publisher=Greenwood | year=1997 |page=55 | url=http://www.questia.com/read/27960870 |accessdate=8 January 2014 }} via [[Questia]] (subscription required)</ref>

Chicago went on to become a teacher at the [[California Institute for the Arts]], and was a leader for the Feminist Art Program. In 1972, the program created [[Womanhouse]], alongside [[Miriam Schapiro]], which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art.<ref name="F280"/> With [[Arlene Raven]] and [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]], Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles [[Woman's Building]] in 1973.<ref name="AAA">{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Woman's Building records, 1970-1992 | work=[[Archives of American Art]] | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/womans-building-records-6347/more#biohist | accessdate=15 Aug 2011}}</ref> This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as “an experimental program in female education in the arts.  Our purpose is to develop a new concept of art, a new kind of artist and a new art community built from the lives, feelings, and needs of women.”  <ref name="L455"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Moravec|first=Michelle|title=Looking For Lyotard, Beyond the Genre of Feminist Manifesto|journal=Trespassing|date=2013|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://trespassingjournal.com/Issue2/TPJ_I2_Moravec_Article.pdf|accessdate=30 May 2014}}</ref> During this period, Chicago began creating spray-painted canvas, primarily abstract, with [[geometric]] forms on them. These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the "feminine". Chicago was strongly influenced by [[Gerda Lerner]], whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of [[women's history]] would continue to struggle independently and collectively.<ref name="F280"/>

In 1975, Chicago's first book, ''Through the Flower'', was published; it "chronicled her struggles to find her own identity as a woman artist."<ref name="Illustrated Career History" />

===''The Dinner Party''===
[[File:Judy Chicago The Dinner Party.JPG|thumb|right|''[[The Dinner Party]]'' as installed at the [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]
{{Main|The Dinner Party}}

Chicago decided to take Lerner's lesson to heart, and took action to teach women about ''their'' history. This action would become Chicago's [[masterpiece]], ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', now in the collection of the [[Brooklyn Museum]].<ref name="BM1">{{cite web | author= | year= | title=The Dinner Party | work=Elizabeth A.

The project came into fruition with the assistance of over 400 people, mainly women, who volunteered to assist in [[needlework]], creating sculptures and other aspects of the process.<ref name="F281">Felder and Rosen, 281.</ref>

===''The Birth Project'' and ''Powerplay''===

From 1980 until 1985, Chicago created ''The Birth Project''. The piece used images of [[childbirth]] to celebrate woman's role as mother. The installation reinterpreted the [[Genesis creation narrative]], which focused on the idea that a male [[god]] created a male human, [[Adam]], without the involvement of a woman.<ref name="F281"/> Chicago described the piece as revealing a "primordial female self hidden among the recesses of my soul...the birthing woman is part of the dawn of creation."<ref name="W5"/> 150 needleworkers from the United States, [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]] assisted in the project, working on 100 panels, by [[quilting]], [[macrame]], [[embroidery]] and other techniques. The size of the piece means it is rarely displayed in its entirety. The majority of the pieces from ''The Birth Project'' are held in the collection of the [[Albuquerque Museum]].<ref name="F281"/>

It is interesting to note that Chicago was not personally interested motherhood. While she admired the women who chose this path, she did not find it right for herself. As recently as 2012, she has said "There was no way on this earth I could have had children and the career I've had."<ref name="The Guardian">{{cite news|last=Cooke|first=Rachel|title=The art of Judy Chicago|url=http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/04/judy-chicago-art-feminism-britain|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 November 2012}}</ref>

After ''The Birth Project'', Chicago returned to independent studio work. She created ''Powerplay,'' a series of drawings, [[weaving]]s, paintings, [[cast paper]] and bronze [[reliefs]]. Through the series, Chicago replaced the male [[gaze]] with a feminist one, exploring the construct of masculinity and how power has affected men.<ref name="JVL">{{cite web | author= | year=2012 | title=Judy Chicago | work= | publisher=Jewish Virtual Library | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/jchicago.html | accessdate=15 Jan 2011}}</ref>

===A new kind of collaboration and ''The Holocaust Project''===

In the mid-1980s Chicago's interests "shifted beyond 'issues of female identity' to an exploration of masculine power and powerlessness in the context of the Holocaust."<ref name="Jewish Renaissance">{{cite journal | title=Judy Chicago in the UK | author=Galit Mana | journal=[[Jewish Renaissance]] |date=October 2012 | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=42–43}}</ref> Galit Mana argues that this topic is still interpreted through a feminist lens, encapsulated in Chicago's ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' (1985–93)<ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/> a collaboration with her husband, photographer [[Donald Woodman]], whom she married on [[New Year's Eve]] 1985. Although Chicago's previous husbands were both [[Jewish]], it wasn't until she met Woodman that she began to explore her own Jewish heritage.  Chicago met poet Harvey Mudd, who had written an [[epic poem]] about the [[Holocaust]]. Chicago was interested in illustrating the poem, but decided to create her own work instead, using her own art, visual and written. Chicago worked alongside her husband to complete the piece, which took eight years to finish.<ref name="F281"/> The piece, which documents victims of the Holocaust, was created during a time of personal loss in Chicago's life: the death of her brother Ben, from [[Lou Gehrig's disease]], and the death of her mother from [[cancer]].<ref name="F282">Felder and Rosen, 282.</ref>

To seek inspiration for the project, Chicago and Woodman watched the documentary ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', which comprises interviews with Holocaust survivors at [[concentration camps]] and other relevant Holocaust sites.<ref name="F282"/> They also explored photo archives and written pieces about the Holocaust.<ref name="W6"/> They followed this with two and a half months' traveling in Eastern Europe, visiting all the concentration camps and, finally, visiting [[Israel]]. This journey led Chicago and Woodman to regard the Holocaust as a global phenomenon<ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/> and Chicago brought other issues into the work, such as [[environmentalism]], [[Native American genocide]],<ref name="W5"/> and the [[Vietnam War]]. With these subjects Chicago sought to relate contemporary issues to the moral dilemma behind the Holocaust.<ref name="F282"/> This aspect of the work caused controversy within the Jewish community, due to the comparison of the Holocaust to these other historical and contemporary concerns.<ref name="W5"/> ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' consists of sixteen large scale works made of a variety of mediums including: [[tapestry]], [[stained glass]], metal work, wood work, photography, painting, and the [[sewing]] of [[Audrey Cowan]]. The exhibit ends with a piece that displays a Jewish couple at [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. The piece comprises 3000 square feet, providing a full exhibition experience for the viewer.<ref name="F282"/> ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' was exhibited for the first time in October 1993 at the [[Spertus Museum]] in Chicago.<ref name="F282"/> Most of the work from the piece is held at the [[Holocaust Center (Pittsburgh)|Holocaust Center]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.<ref name="F284">Felder and Rosen, 284.</ref>

Chicago devoted the next six years to creating work that highlighted concentration camp victims' experiences.<ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/> This included ''One Must Scream'', an image based on two survivors who emerged from the crematorium in [[Auschwitz-Birkenau|Birkenau]].<ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/> "This shift in focus", says Mana, "led Chicago to work on other projects with an emphasis on Jewish tradition" including ''Voices from the Song of Songs'' (1997), where Chicago "introduces feminism and female sexuality into her representation of strong biblical female characters.<ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/>

===Current work and life===

In 1985, Chicago was remarried, to photographer Donald Woodman. To celebrate the couple's 25th wedding anniversary, Chicago created a “Renewal Ketubah” in 2010.<ref name="Illustrated Career History" />

Chicago's archives are held at the [[Schlesinger Library]] at [[Radcliffe College]], and her collection of women's history and culture books are held in the collection of the [[University of New Mexico]]. In 1999, Chicago received the UCLA Alumni Professional Achievement Award, and has been awarded [[honorary degree]]s from [[Lehigh University]], [[Smith College]], [[Duke University]]<ref name="JWE">{{cite web | author=Debra Wacks | year=2012 | title=Judy Chicago | work= | publisher=Jewish Women's Archives | url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/chicago-judy | accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref> and [[Russell Sage College]].<ref name="F284"/> In 2004, Chicago received a Visionary Woman Award from [[Moore College of Art & Design]].<ref name=Moore>{{cite web|title=Visionary Woman Awards|url=http://www.moore.edu/support_moore/visionary_woman_awards|work=Support Moore|publisher=Moore College of Art & Design|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref>  Chicago was named a [[National Women's History Project]] honoree for [[Women's History Month]] in 2008.<ref name="NWHP">{{cite web | author= | year=2008 | title=Judy Chicago | work=2008 Honorees | publisher=National Women's History Month Project | url=http://nwhp.org/whm/chicago_bio.php | accessdate=15 Jan 2011}}</ref> Chicago donated her collection of feminist art educational materials to [[Penn State University]] in 2011. She lives in [[New Mexico]].<ref name="PSU">{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=Penn State Receives Judy Chicago Feminist Art Education Collections | work=Local News | publisher=Gant Daily | url=http://gantdaily.com/2011/06/12/penn-state-receives-judy-chicago-feminist-art-education-collections/ | accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref> In the fall of 2011, Chicago returned to Los Angeles for the opening of the "Concurrents" exhibition at the [[Getty Museum]]. For the exhibition, she returned to the [[Pomona College]] football field, where in the late 1960s she had held a firework-based installation, and performed the piece again.<ref name="LAT1">{{cite web | author=Jori Finkel | year=2011 | title=Q&A Judy Chicago | work=Censorship | publisher=Los Angeles Times | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/30/entertainment/la-ca-pst-judy-chicago-and-rebecca-mcgrew-2-20111030 | accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>

There is a renaissance of interest in the [[United Kingdom]] in Chicago's work with two solo exhibitions in 2012 in [[London]] and another in [[Liverpool]].<ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/> At the Liverpool exhibition in November 2012, Chicago launched an illustrated monograph, a tribute to Virginia Woolf. She says that while she had previously thought of it as secondary to her art, she now considers her significant body of writing, including nine books and the "Meger" poem (1979), as integral to her artistic practice.<ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/>

Chicago strives to push herself, exploring new directions for her art; she even attended car-body school to learn to air-brush and has recently began to work in glass.<ref name="The Guardian" /> Taking such risks is easier to do when one lives by Chicago's philosophy: "I'm not career driven. Damien Hirst's dots sold, so he made thousands of dots. I would, like, never do that! It wouldn't even occur to me."<ref name="The Guardian" /> Chicago's subject matter, however, has broadened from the focus of ''The Dinner Party''. In the words of the artist: "I guess you could say that my eyes were lifted from my vagina."<ref name="The Guardian" />

==Style and work==
Chicago trained herself in "macho arts," taking classes in auto body work, [[boat building]], and pyrotechnics. Through auto body work she learned [[spray painting]] techniques and the skill to fuse color and surface to any type of media, which would become a signature of her later work. The skills learned through boat building would be used in her sculpture work, and pyrotechnics would be used to create [[fireworks]] for performance pieces. These skills allowed Chicago to bring [[fiberglass]] and [[metal]] into her sculpture, and eventually she would become an apprentice under [[Mim Silinsky]] to learn the art of porcelain painting, which would be used to create works in ''The Dinner Party''. Chicago also added the skill of [[stained glass]] to her artistic tool belt, which she used for ''The Holocaust Project''.<ref name="F280"/> Photography became more present in Chicago's work as her relationship with photographer Donald Woodman developed.<ref name="W6">Wylder and Lippard, 6</ref>  Since 2003, Chicago has been working with [[glass]].<ref name="PSU"/>

Collaboration is a major aspect of Chicago's installation works. ''The Dinner Party'', ''The Birth Project'' and ''The Holocaust Project'' were all completed as a collaborative process with Chicago and hundreds of volunteer participants. Volunteer artisans skills vary, often connected to "stereotypical" women's arts such as [[textile arts]].<ref name="F280"/><ref name="F282"/> Chicago makes a point to acknowledge her assistants as collaborators, a task at which other artists have notably failed.<ref name="The Guardian" />

==Through the Flower==

In 1978, Chicago founded [[Through the Flower]], a non-profit feminist art organization. The organization seeks to educate the public about the importance of art and how it can be used as a tool to emphasize women's achievements. Through the Flower also serves as the maintainer of Chicago's works, having handled the storage of ''The Dinner Party,'' before it found a permanent home at the Brooklyn Museum. The organization also maintained The Dinner Party Curriculum, which serves as a "living curriculum" for education about feminist art ideas and [[pedagogy]]. The online aspect of the curriculum was donated to [[Penn State University]] in 2011.<ref name="PSU"/>

'''Phenelzine''' ('''Nardil, Nardelzine''') is a non-[[binding selectivity|selective]] and [[irreversible inhibition|irreversible]] [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] (MAOI) of the [[hydrazine]] class which is used as an [[antidepressant]] and [[anxiolytic]]. Along with [[tranylcypromine]] and [[isocarboxazid]], phenelzine is one of the few non-selective MAOIs still in widespread clinical use.  It is typically available in 15 mg tablets and doses usually range from 30-90 mg per day, with 15 mg every day or every other day suggested as a maintenance dose following a successful course of treatment.

== Indications ==

Phenelzine is used primarily in the [[therapy|treatment]] of [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD). Patients with depressive symptomology characterized as "atypical", "nonendogenous", and/or "neurotic" respond particularly well to phenelzine.<ref>Parke-Davis Division of Pfizer Inc. (2007). ''Nardil(R) (Phenelzine sulfate tablets, USP)'', labeling information. Retrieved December 14, 2009 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Web site: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2007/011909s038lbl.pdf</ref> The medication is also useful in patients who do not respond favorably to first and second-line treatments for depression, or are "[[Treatment-resistant depression|treatment-resistant]]".<ref>{{Cite pmid|15552546}}</ref> In addition to being a recognized treatment for major depressive disorder, phenelzine is effective in treating [[dysthymia]],<ref>{{Cite pmid|3446308}}</ref> [[bipolar depression]] (BD),<ref>{{Cite pmid|7028797}}</ref> [[panic disorder]] (PD),<ref>{{Cite pmid|3542985}}</ref> [[social anxiety disorder]] (SAD),<ref>{{Cite pmid|12900950}}</ref> [[bulimia]],<ref>{{Cite pmid|3282482}}</ref> and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).<ref>{{Cite pmid|3048121}}</ref>

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===

Phenelzine is a non-selective and [[Irreversible inhibition|irreversible inhibitor]] of the [[enzyme]] [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO). It inhibits both of the respective [[isoform]]s of MAO, [[MAO-A]] and [[MAO-B]], and does so almost equally, with slight preference for the former. By inhibiting MAO, phenelzine prevents the breakdown of the [[monoamine]] [[neurotransmitter]]s [[serotonin]], [[melatonin]], [[norepinephrine]], [[epinephrine]], and [[dopamine]], as well as the [[trace amine]] [[neuromodulator]]s such as [[phenethylamine]], [[tyramine]], [[octopamine]], and [[tryptamine]]. This leads to an increase in the [[extracellular]] [[concentration]]s of these [[neurochemical]]s and therefore an alteration in [[neurochemistry]] and [[neurotransmission]]. This action is thought to be the primary mediator in phenelzine's [[therapeutic benefit]]s.

Phenelzine and its metabolites also inhibit at least two other enzymes to a lesser extent, of which are [[alanine transaminase]] (ALA-T),<ref>{{Cite pmid|11775064}}</ref> and [[4-aminobutyrate—pyruvate transaminase|?-Aminobutyric acid transaminase]] (GABA-T),<ref>{{Cite pmid|7931216}}</ref> the latter of which is not caused by phenelzine itself, but by a phenelzine metabolite [[phenylethylidenehydrazine]] (PEH). By inhibiting ALA-T and GABA-T, phenelzine causes an increase in the [[alanine]] and [[GABA]] levels in the brain and body. GABA is the major [[inhibitory]] neurotransmitter in the [[mammalian]] [[central nervous system]], and is very important for the normal suppression of anxiety, stress, and depression. Phenelzine's action in increasing GABA concentrations may significantly contribute to its antidepressant, and especially, anxiolytic/antipanic properties, the latter of which have been considered superior to those of other antidepressants. As for ALA-T inhibition, though the consequences of disabling this enzyme are currently not well understood, there is some evidence to suggest that it is this action of the hydrazines (including phenelzine) which may be responsible for the occasional incidence of [[hepatitis]] and [[liver failure]]. 

Phenelzine has also been shown to metabolize to phenethylamine (PEA).<ref name="pmid4004908">{{cite journal | author = Dyck LE, Durden DA, Boulton AA | title = Formation of beta-phenylethylamine from the antidepressant, beta-phenylethylhydrazine | journal = [[Biochemical Pharmacology]] | volume = 34 | issue = 11 | pages = 1925–9 |date=June 1985 | pmid = 4004908 | doi = 10.1016/0006-2952(85)90310-7| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0006-2952(85)90310-7}}</ref> PEA acts as a [[releasing agent]] of norepinephrine and dopamine, and produces effects very similar to those of [[amphetamine]], though with markedly different pharmacokinetics such as a far shorter duration of action. Phenelzine's enhancement of PEA levels may contribute further to its overall antidepressant effects to some degree. In addition, phenethylamine is a substrate for MAO-B, and treatment with MAOIs that inhibit MAO-B such as phenelzine have been shown to consistently and significantly elevate its concentrations.

Like many other antidepressants, phenelzine usually requires several weeks of treatment to achieve full therapeutic effects. The reason for this delay is not fully understood, but it is believed to be due to many factors, including achieving steady-state levels of MAO inhibition and the resulting adaptations in mean neurotransmitter levels, the possibility of necessary [[downregulation|desensitization]] of [[autoreceptor]]s which normally inhibit the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, and also the upregulation of enzymes such as [[serotonin N-acetyltransferase]]. Typically, a therapeutic response to MAOIs is associated with an inhibition of at least 80-85% of monoamine oxidase activity.<ref>{{cite pmid|7231652}}</ref>

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

[[Image:NardilTablets.jpg|thumb|right|Phenelzine 15 mg tablets.]]

Phenelzine is administered orally in the form of phenelzine sulfate and is rapidly absorbed from the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. Time to peak plasma concentration is 43 minutes and half-life is 11.6 hours. Unlike most other drugs, phenelzine irreversibly disables MAO, and as a result, it does not necessarily need to be present in the blood at all times for its effects to be sustained. Because of this, upon phenelzine treatment being ceased, its effects typically do not actually wear off until the body replenishes its enzyme stores, a process which can take as long as 2–3 weeks.

Phenelzine is [[metabolized]] primarily in the liver and its [[metabolite]]s are excreted in the urine. Oxidation is the primary routine of metabolism, and the major metabolites are phenylacetic acid and parahydroxyphenylacetic acid, recovered as about 73% of the excreted dose of phenelzine in the urine over the course of 96 hours after single doses. Acetylation to N<sup>2</sup>-acetylphenelzine is a minor pathway. Phenelzine may also interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, inactivating these enzymes through formation of a heme adduct. Two other minor metabolites of phenelzine, as mentioned above, include phenylethylidenehydrazine and phenethylamine.

== Chemistry ==

Phenelzine is made relatively easily through the reaction of [[2-phenylethylbromide]] with [[hydrazine]].<ref>J.H. Biel, {{US patent|3,000,903}} (1961).</ref><ref>J.H. Biel, A.E. Drukker, ''et al''.

== Adverse effects ==

Common side effects of phenelzine may include [[dizziness]], [[blurry vision]], [[dry mouth]], [[headache]], [[lethargy]], [[sedation]], [[somnolence]], [[insomnia]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[weight gain]] or [[weight loss|loss]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], [[constipation]], [[urinary retention]], [[mydriasis]], [[muscle tremor]]s, [[hyperthermia]], [[sweating]], [[hypertension]] or [[hypotension]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], [[paresthesia]], [[hepatitis]], and [[sexual dysfunction]] (consisting of loss of [[libido]] and [[anorgasmia]]). Rare side effects usually only seen in susceptible individuals may include [[hypomania]] or [[mania]], [[psychosis]], and [[acute liver failure]], the latter of which is usually only seen in people with pre-existing [[liver damage]], [[old age]], [[Long-term effects of alcohol|alcohol consumption]], or [[viral infection]].<ref>{{Cite pmid|8607601}}</ref>

== Interactions ==

{{See also|Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#Dangers}}
{{See also|Foods containing tyramine}}

The MAOIs are infamous for their problematic food restrictions and drug interactions. [[Hypertensive crisis]] may result from the overconsumption of [[tyramine]]-containing foods. As a result, patients on phenelzine and other MAOIs must avoid excess quantities of certain foods that contain tyramine such as [[aged cheese]]s and [[cured meat]]s, among others. [[Serotonin syndrome]] may result from an interaction with certain drugs which increase serotonin activity such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]], [[serotonin releasing agent]]s, and [[serotonin]] [[agonist]]s. Several deaths have been reported due to drug interaction-related [[serotonin syndrome]] such as the case of [[Libby Zion]].

As is the case with other MAOIs, there is a concern regarding phenelzine and the use of both [[Local anesthetic|local]] and [[general anesthetic]]s. Anyone taking phenelzine should inform their psychiatrist before proceeding with dental surgery, and surgery in any other contexts.

Phenelzine has also been linked to [[vitamin B6|vitamin B<sub>6</sub>]] [[Vitamin B6#Deficiencies|deficiency]].<ref>{{cite pmid|7803366}}</ref>  It (or possibly its metabolites such as [[phenylethylidenehydrazine]]) reacts with vitamin B<sub>6</sub> via an unknown enzyme to form a biologically inert metabolite. Transaminases such as GABA transaminase have been shown to be dependent upon vitamin B6<ref>http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1ohw</ref> and may be involved in this process, since the phenelzine metabolite phenylethylidenehydrazine (PEH) is a GABA transaminase inhibitor.<ref>{{cite pmid|15207360}}</ref>  Both phenelzine and vitamin B<sub>6</sub> are rendered inactive upon these reactions occurring. For this reason, it may be recommended to supplement with vitamin B<sub>6</sub> while taking phenelzine.  The pyridoxine form of B6 is recommended for supplementation, since this form has been shown to reduce hydrazine toxicity from phenelzine and, in contrast, the pyridoxal form has been shown to increase the toxicity of hydrazines.<ref>{{cite pmid|13818307}}</ref>

== Name ==
The name is formed from ''yuè'' ({{linktext|?}}) "moon" and ''shì'' ({{linktext|?}}) "clan".
According to the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'', it referred to a country beyond China's borders.<ref>''Kangxi Dictionary'': Yue: ''...definition list...'' also a country outside China. (Source: ''[[Book of Han]]'', [[Huo Qubing]] Biography. Finally reached the small Yuezhi) (?: ????????·???????????)</ref>
Since the character ? can stand for the character ''ròu'' ({{linktext|?}}) in pictograms, it may not mean "moon" here. The character seems to have derived originally from ''ròu'', "meat", as a character component.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

There are numerous theories about the derivation of the name ''Yuezhi'', and none has yet found general acceptance.<ref>''Les Saces: Les « Scythes » d'Asie. VIIIe siècle av. J.-C.?IVe siècle apr.

See also: pp. 333-334.</ref> According to Zhang Guang-da, the name ''Yuezhi'' is a transliteration of their own name for themselves, the [[Visha]] ("the tribes") or [[Vèsh]] in modern Pashto meaning "divisions", being called the Vijaya in [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]].<ref>''History of civilizations of Central Asia, volume III: Zhang Guang-da, "The city-states of the Tarim Basin, p. 284</ref>

The Yuezhi are usually identified with the ''Tókharoi'' (????????), named by Greek historians among the conquerors of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] in the 2nd century BCE.<ref>{{cite book |author = Millward, James A. |year=2007 |title= Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang |publisher= Columbia University Press, New York |page=15|isbn= 978-0-231-13924-3 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA15 }}</ref>
At the beginning of the 20th century, manuscripts were discovered in the northern Tarim Basin written in two hitherto-unknown [[Indo-European languages]] dating from the 6th to 8th centuries CE.
Believing the authors to be the ''Tókharoi'', [[Friedrich W. K. Müller]] called these languages the [[Tocharian languages]].
Although few scholars now accept Müller's identification, "Tocharian" remains the standard term for the languages of the Tarim Basin manuscripts and for the people who produced them.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia |author=A.

Although the peoples who overran the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom are known to have spoken [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]], an [[Eastern Iranian language]], other scholars have argued that the Yuezhi were originally Tocharian-speakers.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/eieol/tokol-0-X.html Tocharian Online: Series Introduction], Todd B.

According to the linguist J. Derakhshani the Yuezhi are linked to the [[Kuchis]] of Afghanistan, formerly ''Guci''.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== Origins ==
[[File:QinEmpireWithOrdos.jpg|thumb|The Yuezhi were settled at the doorstep of [[Qin empire|Qin China]] in the 3rd century BCE.]]
The first known references to the Yuezhi are contained in the ''[[Yizhoushu]]'', ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' (73, 78, 80 and 81) and ''[[Tale of King Mu, Son of Heaven]]''. The dates of the most common version of this book are disputed, however, and it may date to as late as the 1st century BCE.<ref>Liu Jianguo (2004). ''Distinguishing and Correcting the pre-Qin Forged Classics''. Xi'an: Shaanxi People's Press. ISBN 7-224-05725-8. pp. 115–127.</ref> Unlike the neighbouring [[Xiongnu]] dynasty, who were also nomadic, the Yuezhi did not engage in conflict with the nearby Chinese states. Rather, the book described the Yuzhi ??, or Niuzhi ??, as a people from the northwest who supplied [[jade]] to the Chinese.<ref>"Les Saces", Iaroslav Lebedynsky, ISBN 2-87772-337-2, p. 59.</ref> The supply of jade from the Tarim Basin from ancient times is indeed well documented archaeologically: "It is well known that ancient Chinese rulers had a strong attachment to jade. All the jade items excavated from the [[tomb of Fuhao]] of the [[Shang dynasty]], more than 750 pieces, were from [[Khotan]] in modern [[Xinjiang]]. As early as the mid-first millennium BCE the Yuezhi engaged in the jade trade, of which the major consumers were the rulers of agricultural China."<ref>Liu (2001), pp.&nbsp;267–268.</ref> During the Qin Dynasty period, the Yuezhi earned the support of Chinese rulers by providing them with large supplies of war horses.<ref>Xinru Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 4.</ref> As well as maintaining this friendly trading relationship with China, the Yuezhi also acted as 'middlemen' between China and Central Asia. During the [[Warring States period]], the Chinese also turned to the Yuezhi for the supply of good horses. Moreover, the Yuezhi supplied the Qin Empire with crucial military mounts.<ref name=Liu>{{cite book|last=Liu|first=Xinru|title=The Silk Road in World History|year=2010|publisher=Oxford|pages=3–4}}</ref> The suffix ''Di'' or ''Zhi'' (Chinese:?) was generally used to describe the [[Di (Wu Hu)|Di people]] in [[Han Dynasty]]-era Chinese annals.

According to former [[USSR]] scholar Zuev, there was a queen among the large Yuezhi confederation who added to her possessions the lands of the Tochar (Pinyin: [[Daxia]]) on the headwaters of the [[Huanghe]] c. 3rd century BCE. According to Zuev, the Chinese chronicles{{which|date=February 2013}}<!--what is the name of the books and chapters?--> began referring to the queen's tribe as the Great Yuezhi (Da Yuezhi) and to the Tochars as the Lesser Yuezhi (Pinyin: Xiao Yuezhi). Together, they were simply called Yuezhi. In the 5th century CE, scholar, translator and monk Kumarajiva, while translating texts into Chinese<!--what's the name of the book?-->, used the name ''Yuezhi'' to translate ''Tochar''. In the middle of the 2nd century BCE, the Yuezhi conquered [[Bactria]], and the Ancient Greek authors inform us that the conquerors of Bactria were the [[Asii]] and Tochari tribes. In the Chinese chronicles Bactria then began to be called the country of Daxia, i.e., [[Tocharistan]].<ref>Zuev, Ü.A. (2002) Early Türks: Outline of history and ideology, p. 6 (translated from the Russian) {{Listed Invalid ISBN|9985-4-4152-9}}</ref>

The Yuezhi are also documented in detail in Chinese historical accounts, in particular the 2nd-1st century BCE ''Records of the Great Historian'', or ''[[Shiji]]'', by [[Sima Qian]]. According to these accounts:

:"The Yuezhi originally lived in the area between the [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian]] or Heavenly Mountains ([[Tian Shan]]) and [[Dunhuang]], but after they were defeated by the Xiongnu they moved far away to the west, beyond [[Dayuan]], where they attacked and conquered the people of Daxia and set up the court of their king on the northern bank of the Gui [= [[Oxus]]] River. A small number of their people who were unable to make the journey west sought refuge among the [[Qiang (historical people)|Qiang]] barbarians in the Southern Mountains, where they are known as the Lesser Yuezhi."<ref name="Watson, Burton 1993. p. 234">Watson, Burton. Trans. 1993. ''Records of the Grand Historian of China: Han Dynasty II.'' Translated from the ''[[Shiji]]'' of [[Sima Qian]]. Chapter 123: "The Account of [[Dayuan]]", Columbia University Press. Revised Edition. ISBN 0-231-08166-9; ISBN 0-231-08167-7 (pbk.), p. 234.</ref>

The [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian]] and [[Dunhuang]] original homeland of the Yuezhi has recently been argued not to refer to the current locations in [[Gansu]], but to the [[Tian Shan]] range and the [[Turpan]] region, 1,000&nbsp;km to the west, Dunhuang being identified with a mountain named [[Dunhong]] listed in the ''[[Shanhaijing]]''.<ref>Liu Xinru, "Migration and Settlement of the Yuezhi-Kushan: Interaction and Interdependence of Nomadic and Sedentary Societies," Journal of World History 12, no. 2, p. 268 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_world_history/v012/12.2liu.html#REF13]</ref>

The Yuezhi may have been an [[Europoid]] people, as indicated by the portraits of their kings on the coins they struck following their exodus to [[Transoxiana]] (2nd–1st century BCE), some old place names in [[Gansu]] explainable in [[Tocharian languages]],<ref>[http://bbs.tiexue.net/post_1411525_1.html ??--???????????????????]</ref> and especially the coins they struck in India as [[Kushans]] (1st–3rd century CE).<ref>[http://cn.qikan.com/Article/hfcn/hfcn200902/hfcn20090219.html ??????????????]</ref><ref>[http://www.xyfj.com.cn/woxingwoxiu/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=1054 ????——???????????]</ref><ref>[http://www.tianshannet.com/culture/content/2006-08/20/content_1118295.htm ???????? - ?????]</ref><ref>[http://mzx.muc.edu.cn/upimg/200804.pdf ????]</ref>

Ancient Chinese sources do describe the existence of "white people with long hair" (the ''Bai'' people of the ''[[Shan Hai Jing]]'') beyond their northwestern border. Very well preserved [[Tarim mummies]] with Europoid features (light hair and eyes) and dominated by [[Haplogroup R1a1a (Y-DNA)]], today displayed at the [[Ürümqi]] Museum and dated to the 3rd century BCE, were found at the ancient oasis on the [[Silk Road]], [[Niya (Tarim Basin)|Niya]].<ref>"The strange creatures of the ''Shanhai jing'': (...) we find recorded north of the territory of the "fish dragons" the land of the Whites (Bai), whose bodies are white and whose long hair falls on their shoulders." Such a description could correspond well to a Europoid population beyond the frontiers of ancient China and some scholars have identified these Whites as Yuezhi." ''The Tarim Mummies: Ancient China and the Mystery of the Earliest Peoples from the West''. J. P. Mallory and Victor H. Mair. Thames & Hudson. London. (2000), p. 55.</ref>

Evidence of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Tocharian languages]] also has been found in the same geographical area, Although the first known epigraphic evidence dates to the 6th century CE, the degree of differentiation between Tocharian A and Tocharian B and the absence of Tocharian language remains beyond that area suggest that a common Tocharian language existed in the same area of Yuezhi settlement during the second half of the 1st millennium BCE.

According to one theory, the Yuezhi were probably part of the large migration of Indo-European-speaking peoples who were settled in eastern Central Asia at that time. The nomadic people of the [[Ordos culture]], who lived in northern China, east of the Yuezhi, are another example. Also, the Europoid mummies of [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk]], which were probably [[Scythian]] in origin, were found around 1,500 kilometers northwest of the Yuezhi and date to around the 3rd century BCE.<ref name="nova">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2517siberian.html

According to Han Dynasty accounts, the Yuezhi "were flourishing" during the time of the first great Chinese [[Qin Shi Huang|Qin emperor]], but were regularly in conflict with the neighboring tribe of the [[Xiongnu]] to the Northeast."

Esther Jacobson emphasizes that "the Yuezhi/[[Kushans]] may properly be considered to have belonged to the larger [[Scytho-Siberian culture]]."<ref>{{cite book |title=The Deer Goddess of Ancient Siberia: A Study in the Ecology of Belief |volume=Volume 55 of Studies in the History of Religions |first=Esther |last=Jacobson |edition=illustrated |publisher=BRILL |year= 1993 |page=6 |ISBN=9004096280 |quote=The most western of the Early Nomads' relatives and those most familiar to the modern observer were [[Scythians]]. They are believed to have arrived in the lands of the [[Caucasus]], the [[Crimea]], and the rich steppe north of the [[Black Sea]] by the sixth century B.C.&nbsp;... In the late years of the first millennium B.C., the successors to the Early Nomads and [[Sakas]] served as the vehicles for the transformation of [[Eurasia]]n nomadism into statehood. The Xiongnu of Mongolia gathered an array of nomadic peoples together into a confederation which became the major geopolitical opponent of the Chinese [[Han Dynasty]]. In the same period, the second and first centuries B.C., the Yuezhi established hegemony over the vital steppe region west of the borders of Han China and extending through [[Bactria]] to the borders of India. Indeed, after their conversion to Buddhism, the Yuezhi- by then known as the Kushans- proceeded to conquer India and to establish the great Kushan Dynasty. Despite these political transformations and despite significant distinctions in language and physical anthropology between the Xiongnu and their Early Nomadic relatives, they as well as the Yuezhi/Kushans may properly be considered to have belonged to the larger Scytho-Siberian culture.}}</ref>

== The Yuezhi exodus ==
[[File:PazyrikHorseman.JPG|thumb|170px|A Scythian horseman from the area invaded by the Yuezhi, [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]], c.300 BCE.]]
The Yuezhi sometimes practiced the exchange of hostages with the [[Xiongnu]], and, at one time, were hosts to [[Modu Shanyu]] (??), son of the Xiongnu leader. Modu stole a horse and escaped when the Yuezhi tried to kill him in retaliation for an attack by his father. Modu subsequently became ruler of the Xiongnu after killing his father.

Shortly before 176 BCE, led by one of Modu's tribal chiefs, the Xiongnu invaded Yuezhi territory in the [[Gansu]] region and achieved a crushing victory.<ref name="Benjamin">{{cite web|last=Benjamin|first=Craig|title=The Yuezhi Migration and Sodia|url=http://www.transoxiana.org/Eran/Articles/benjamin.html#_NDEF_1|work=Transxoiana.org|accessdate=February 3, 2013}}</ref>  Modu boasted in a letter (174 BCE) to the Han emperor{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} that due to "the excellence of his fighting men, and the strength of his horses, he has succeeded in wiping out the Yuezhi, slaughtering or forcing to submission every number of the tribe." The son of Modu, [[Laoshang Chanyu]], subsequently killed the king of the Yuezhi and, in accordance with nomadic traditions, "made a [[skull cup|drinking cup]] out of his skull." (Shiji 123. Watson 1961:231).

Following Chinese sources, a large part of the Yuezhi people therefore fell under the domination of the Xiongnu, and these may have been the ancestors of the [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] speakers attested in the 6th century CE. A very small group of Yuezhi fled south to the territory of the Proto-[[Tibet]]an [[Qiang (historical people)|Qiang]] and came to be known to the Chinese as the "Small Yuezhi". According to the ''Hanshu'', they only numbered around 150 families.

Finally, a large group of the Yuezhi fled from the [[Tarim Basin]] towards the Northwest circa 165 BCE,<ref>Chavannes (1907) "Les pays d'occident d'après le ''Heou Han chou''". ''T'oung pao'', ser.2:8, p. 189, n. 1.</ref> first settling in the [[Ili valley]], immediately north of the [[Tian Shan]] mountains, where they confronted and defeated the Sai ([[Sakas]] or [[Scythians]]): "The Yuezhi attacked the king of the Sai who moved a considerable distance to the south and the Yuezhi then occupied his lands" (Han Shu 61 4B). The Sai then undertook their own migration, which was to lead them as far as [[Kashmir]], after travelling through a "Suspended Crossing" (probably the [[Khunjerab Pass]] between present-day [[Xinjiang]] and northern [[Pakistan]]). The Sakas ultimately established an [[Indo-Scythian]] kingdom in northern India.<ref name=Sagar>{{cite book|last=Chandra Sagar|first=Khrisna|title=Foiegn Influence on Ancient India|year=1992|publisher=Northern Book Centre|location=New Dehli|isbn=81-7211-028-6|pages=119}}</ref>

In the year 132 BCE, the [[Wusun]], in alliance with the Xiongnu and out of revenge from an earlier conflict, managed to dislodge the Yuezhi, forcing them to move south.<ref name="Benjamin"/> The Yuezhi crossed the neighbouring urban civilization of the [[Dayuan]] in [[Ferghana]] and settled on the northern bank of the [[Oxus]], in the region of [[Transoxiana]], in modern-day [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]], just north of the Hellenistic [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]].  The Greek city of [[Alexandria on the Oxus]] was apparently burnt to the ground by the Yuezhi around 145 BCE.<ref>Bernard, P. (1994a): "Alexander and his successors in Central Asia."

== Settlement in Transoxiana ==
[[File:ZhangQianTravels.jpg|thumb|300px|The Chinese mission of [[Zhang Qian]] to the Yuezhi in 126 BCE, [[Mogao Caves]], 618-712 CE mural painting]]

The Yuezhi were visited by a Chinese mission, led by [[Zhang Qian]] in 126 BCE,<ref>[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006 ''Silk Road, North China'', C. Michael Hogan, The Megalithic Portal, editor A. Burnham]</ref> that was seeking an offensive alliance with the Yuezhi to counter the Xiongnu threat to the north. Although the request for an alliance was denied by the son of the slain Yuezhi king, who preferred to maintain peace in Transoxiana rather than to seek revenge, Zhang Qian made a detailed account, reported in the ''Shiji'', that gives considerable insight into the situation in [[Central Asia]] at that time.<ref>Watson, Burton. Trans. 1993. ''Records of the Grand Historian of China: Han Dynasty II.'' Translated from the ''[[Shiji]]'' of [[Sima Qian]]. Chapter 123: "The Account of [[Dayuan]]", Columbia University Press. Revised Edition. ISBN 0-231-08166-9; ISBN 0-231-08167-7 (pbk.), pp. 2231-252.</ref>

Zhang Qian, who spent a year with the Yuezhi and in [[Bactria]], relates that "the Great Yuezhi live 2,000 or 3,000 ''li'' (832-1,247 kilometers) west of [[Dayuan]] ([[Ferghana]]), north of the Gui ([[Oxus]]) river. They are bordered on the south by [[Daxia]] ([[Bactria]]), on the west by Anxi ([[Parthia]]), and on the north by [[Kangju]] (beyond the middle [[Jaxartes]]). They are a nation of [[nomad]]s, moving from place to place with their herds, and their customs are like those of the Xiongnu. They have some 100,000 or 200,000 archer warriors."<ref name="Watson, Burton 1993. p. 234" />

Although they remained north of the Oxus for a while, they apparently obtained the submission of the [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]] to the south of the Oxus. The Yuezhi were organized into five major tribes, each led by a ''yabgu'', or tribal chief, and known to the Chinese as ''Xi?mì'' (??) in Western Wakh?n and Zibak, ''Guishuang'' (??) in [[Badakhshan]] and the adjoining territories north of the [[Oxus]], ''Shuangmi'' (??) in the region of Shughnan, ''Xidun'' (??) in the region of [[Balkh]], and ''D?mì'' (??) in the region of [[Termez]].<ref>Hill (2004), pp. 29, 318-350</ref>

A description of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was made by [[Zhang Qian]] after the conquest by Yuezhi:
:"[[Daxia]] ([[Greco-Bactria]]) is located over 2,000 [[Li (Chinese unit)|li]] southwest of [[Dayuan]], south of the Gui ([[Oxus]]) river. Its people cultivate the land and have cities and houses. Their customs are like those of [[Ta-Yuan]]. It has no great ruler but only a number of petty chiefs ruling the various cities. The people are poor in the use of arms and afraid of battle, but they are clever at commerce. After the Great Yuezhi moved west and attacked the lands, the entire country came under their sway. The population of the country is large, numbering some 1,000,000 or more persons. The capital is called the city of Lanshi ([[Bactra]]) (modern [[Balkh]]) and has a market where all sorts of goods are bought and sold."<ref>Watson, Burton. Trans. 1993. ''Records of the Grand Historian of China: Han Dynasty II.'' Translated from the ''[[Shiji]]'' of [[Sima Qian]]. Chapter 123: "The Account of [[Dayuan]]", Columbia University Press. Revised Edition. ISBN 0-231-08166-9; ISBN 0-231-08167-7 (pbk.), p. 235.</ref>

In a sweeping analysis of the physical types and cultures of Central Asia that he visited in 126 BCE, Zhang Qian reports that "although the states from [[Dayuan]] west to Anxi (Parthia), speak rather different languages, their customs are generally similar and their languages mutually intelligible. The men have deep-set eyes and profuse beards and whiskers. They are skilful at commerce and will haggle over a fraction of a cent. Women are held in great respect, and the men make decisions on the advice of their women."<ref>Watson, Burton. Trans. 1993. ''Records of the Grand Historian of China: Han Dynasty II.''

== Invasion of Bactria ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:YuezhiHeliocles.jpg|thumb|300px|right|One of the first Yuezhi coins, imitative, in crude style, of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Heliocles]], circa 120 BCE.<br />'''Obv:''' Presumed bust of a Yuezhi chief with Greek royal headband.<br />'''Rev:''' [[Zeus]] with thunderbolt and sceptre. Misspelled Greek legend BASILEO HELIOLEEU "(of) King Heliocles".]] -->
[[File:Asia 001ad.jpg|thumb|300px|Asia in 1 CE, showing location of Yuezhi tribes.]]
In 124 BCE, the Yuezhi were apparently involved in a war against the Parthians, in which the Parthian king [[Artabanus I of Parthia]] was wounded and died:

:"During the war against the Tochari, he (Artabanus) was wounded in the arm and died immediately" (Justin, Epitomes, XLII,2,2: ''"Bello Tochariis inlato, in bracchio vulneratus statim decedit"'').

Some time after 124 BCE, possibly disturbed by further incursions of rivals from the north and apparently vanquished by the Parthian king [[Mithridates II of Parthia|Mithridates II]], successor to Artabanus, the Yuezhi moved south to [[Bactria]]. Bactria had been conquered by the Greeks under [[Alexander the Great]] in 330 BCE and since settled by the [[Hellenistic civilization]] of the [[Seleucids]] and the [[Greco-Bactrians]] for two centuries.

This event is recorded in Classical Greek sources, when [[Strabo]] presented them as a [[Scythian]] tribe and explained that the Tokhari—together with the Assianis, Passianis and Sakaraulis—took part in the destruction of the [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]] in the second half of the 2nd century BCE:

:"Most of the [[Scythians]], beginning from the [[Caspian Sea]], are called [[Dahae]] Scythae, and those situated more towards the east [[Massagetae]] and [[Saka|Sacae]]; the rest have the common appellation of Scythians, but each separate tribe has its peculiar name. All, or the greatest part of them, are nomads. The best known tribes are those who deprived the Greeks of [[Bactria]]na, the Asii, Pasiani, Tochari, and Sacarauli, who came from the country on the other side of the [[Jaxartes]], opposite the Sacae and [[Sogdians|Sogdiani]]." ([[Strabo]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+11.8.1 11-8-1])

The last Greco-Bactrian king, [[Heliocles I]], retreated and moved his capital to the Kabul Valley. The eastern part of Bactria was occupied by [[Pashtun people]].

[[File:SakaYueZhi.jpg|thumb|upright|Head of a Yuezhi warrior, from [[Khalchayan]], southern [[Uzbekistan]], Painted clay.<ref>[http://www.iranica.com/articles/greece-viii ''Encyclopaedia Iranica'', PLATE VIII]</ref>]]
As they settled in Bactria from around 125 BCE, the Yuezhi became Hellenized to some degree, as suggested by their adoption of the Greek alphabet and by some remaining coins, minted in the style of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] kings, with the text in Greek. The area of Bactria they settled came to be known as [[Tokharistan]], since the Yuezhi were called ''Tókharoi'' by the Greeks.

Commercial relations with China also flourished, as many Chinese missions were sent throughout the 1st century BCE: "The largest of these embassies to foreign states numbered several hundred persons, while even the smaller parties included over 100 members&nbsp;... In the course of one year anywhere from five to six to over ten parties would be sent out." (''Shiji'', trans. Burton Watson).

The ''[[Hou Hanshu]]'' also records the visit of Yuezhi envoys to the Chinese capital in 2 BCE, who gave oral teachings on [[Buddhist]] sutras to a student, suggesting that some Yuezhi already followed the [[Buddhist]] faith during the 1st century BCE (Baldev Kumar (1973)).

A later Chinese annotation in ''[[Shiji]]'' made by Zhang Shoujie during the early 8th century, quoting Wan Zhen's s (??) ''Strange Things from the Southern Region'' (Nanzhouzhi (???), a now-lost third-century text of from the [[kingdom of Wu|Wu kingdom]]), describes the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] as living in the same general area north of India, in cities of Greco-Roman style, and with sophisticated handicraft. The quotes are dubious, as Wan Zhen probably never visited the Yuezhi kingdom through the [[Silk Road]], though he might have gathered his information from the trading ports in the coastal south.<ref name=taishan>Yu Taishan (2nd Edition 2003). ''A Comprehensive History of Western Regions''. Zhengzhou: Zhongzhou Guji Press. ISBN 7-5348-1266-6.</ref> The Chinese never adopted the term ''Guishuang'' and continued to call them Yuezhi:

:"The Great Yuezhi [Kushans] is located about seven thousand ''li'' (about 3000 km) north of India. Their land is at a high altitude; the climate is dry; the region is remote. The king of the state calls himself "son of heaven". There are so many riding horses in that country that the number often reaches several hundred thousand. City layouts and palaces are quite similar to those of [[Daqin]] (the Roman empire). The skin of the people there is reddish white. People are skilful at horse archery. Local products, rarities, treasures, clothing, and upholstery are very good, and even India cannot compare with it."<ref>[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/hhshu/notes13.html References and quote (Note 36)]</ref>

== Expansion into the Hindu-Kush ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:HermaeusPosthumous.jpg|thumb|300px|A posthumus, slightly barbarized, coin of [[King Hermaeus|Hermaeus]], minted in the [[Paropamisade]] between 50 BCE and 25 BCE.<br />'''Obv:''' Bust of Hermaeus.

[[Kharoshti]] legend: MAHARAJASA TRATARASA HERAYAMASA "Saviour King Hermaeus".]] -->

The area of the [[Hindu-Kush]] ([[Paropamisade]]) was ruled by the western [[Indo-Greek]] king until the reign of [[King Hermaeus|Hermaeus]] (reigned c. 90 BCE–70 BCE). After that date, no Indo-Greek kings are known in the area, which was probably{{Or|date=August 2008}} overtaken by the neighbouring Yuezhi, who had been in relation with the Greeks for a long time. According to [[Bopearachchi]], no trace of [[Indo-Scythian]] occupation (nor coins of major Indo-Scythian rulers such as [[Maues]] or [[Azes I]]) have been found in the [[Paropamisade]] and western [[Gandhara]].

As they had done in Bactria with their copying of [[Greco-Bactrian]] coinage, the Yuezhi copied the coinage of [[King Hermaeus|Hermeaus]] on a vast scale, up to around 40 CE, when the design blends into the coinage of the [[Kushan]] king [[Kujula Kadphises]].
Such coins provide the earliest names of presumed Yuezhi princes, [[Sapadbizes]] (probably a yabgu's prince of Yuezhi confederation{{Or|date=August 2008}}) and [[Agesiles]], both around 20 BCE.

[[File:YuezhiKingAndAttendants.jpg|thumb|Possible Yuezhi king and attendants, [[Gandhara]] [[stone palette]], 1st century CE]]
By the end of the 1st century BCE, one of the five tribes of the Yuezhi, the Guishuang (??, origin of name ''Kushan'' adopted in the West), managed to take control of the Yuezhi confederation. From that point, the Yuezhi extended their control over the northwestern area of the Indian subcontinent, founding the [[Kushan Empire]], which was to rule the region for several centuries. The Yuezhi came to be known as Kushan among Western civilizations; however, the Chinese kept calling them Yuezhi throughout their historical records over a period of several centuries.

The Yuezhi/Kushans expanded to the east during the 1st century CE to found the Kushan Empire. The first Kushan emperor, [[Kujula Kadphises]], ostensibly associated himself with [[King Hermaeus|Hermaeus]] on his coins, suggesting that he may{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} have been one of his descendants by alliance, or at least wanted to claim his legacy.

The unification of the Yuezhi tribes and the rise of the Kushan are documented in the Chinese Historical chronicle, the ''[[Hou Hanshu]]'':

:"More than a hundred years later, the ''xihou'' (Ch:??, "Allied Prince") of Guishuang ([[Badakhshan]] and the adjoining territories north of the Oxus), named Qiujiu Que (Ch: ???, [[Kujula Kadphises]]) attacked and exterminated the four other xihou ("Allied Princes"). He set himself up as king of a kingdom called Guishuang ([[Kushan]]). He invaded Anxi ([[Parthia]]) and took the Gaofu (Ch:??, [[Kabul]]) region. He also defeated the whole of the kingdoms of Puda (Ch: ??) and Jibin (Ch: ??, [[Kapi?a]]-[[Gandh?ra]]). Qiujiu Que (Kujula Kadphises) was more than eighty years old when he died.

:"His son, ''Yan Gaozhen'' (Ch:???) ([[Vima Takto]]), became king in his place. He returned and defeated [[Names of India#Tianzhu|Tianzhu]] (Northwestern India) and installed a General to supervise and lead it. The Yuezhi then became extremely rich. All the kingdoms call [their king] the Guishuang (Kushan) king, but the [[Han dynasty|Han]] call them by their original name, Da Yuezhi." (''[[Hou Hanshu]]'', trans. John Hill,<ref>Hill (2009), pp. 28-29.</ref><ref>???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Hanshu, 96 [http://www.guoxue.com/discord/xwm/jnsj.htm]</ref>).

The Yuezhi/Kushan integrated [[Buddhism]] into a pantheon of many deities and became great promoters of [[Mahayana Buddhism]], and their interactions with Greek civilization helped the [[Gandhara]]n culture and [[Greco-Buddhism]] flourish.

During the 1st and 2nd century, the Kushan Empire expanded militarily to the north and occupied parts of the [[Tarim Basin]], their original grounds, putting them at the center of the lucrative Central Asian commerce with the [[Roman Empire]]. When the Han Dynasty desired to advance north, Emperor Wu sent the explorer [[Zhang Qian]] to see the kingdoms to the west and to ally with the Yuezhi people, in order to fight the [[Xiongnu]] [[Mongol]] tribe.  The Yuezhi continued to collaborate militarily with the Chinese against nomadic incursion, particularly with the Chinese general [[Ban Chao]] against the Sogdians in 84 CE when the latter were trying to support a revolt by the king of [[Kashgar]]. Around 85 CE,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} they also assisted the Chinese general in an attack on [[Turpan]], east of the Tarim Basin.

In recognition of their support to the Chinese, the Kushans requested, but were denied, a [[Han Dynasty|Han]] princess, even after they had sent presents to the Chinese court.  In retaliation, they marched on Ban Chao in 86 CE with a force of 70,000 but, exhausted by the expedition, were finally defeated by the smaller Chinese force.  The Kushans retreated and paid tribute to the Chinese Empire during the reign of the Chinese emperor [[Emperor He of Han China|Han He]] (89-106).

About 120 CE, Kushan troops installed Chenpan—a prince who had been sent as a hostage to them and had become a favorite of the Kushan Emperor—on the throne of [[Kashgar]], thus expanding their power and influence in the [[Tarim Basin]],<ref>Hill (2009), pp. 14, 43.</ref> and introduced the [[Br?hm? script|Brahmi]] script, the Indian [[Prakrit]] language for administration, and [[Greco-Buddhist art]], which developed into [[Serindian art]].

Benefiting from this territorial expansion, the Yuezhi/Kushans were among the first to introduce [[Buddhism]] to northern and northeastern Asia, by direct missionary efforts and the translation of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] scriptures into Chinese. Major Yuezhi missionaries and translators included [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]] and [[Dharmaraksa]], who went to China and established translation bureaus, thereby being at the center of the [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

The Chinese kept referring to the Kushans as Da Yuezhi throughout the centuries. In the [[Sanguozhi]] (???, chap. 3), it is recorded that in 229 CE, "The king of the Da Yuezhi, Bodiao ?? ([[Vasudeva I]]), sent his envoy to present tribute, and His Majesty (Emperor [[Cao Rui]]) granted him the title of King of the Da Yuezhi Intimate with the [[Kingdom of Wei|Wei]] (?) (Ch: ??????, Q?n Wèi Dà Yuèzh? Wáng)."

The [[Sassanid]]s extended their dominion into Bactria during the reign of [[Ardashir I]] around 230 CE.

The '''Morris Marina''' is an automobile that the [[Morris (car)|Morris]] division of [[British Leyland Motor Corporation|British Leyland]] manufactured in the UK throughout the 1970s—a period of great turbulence and difficulty for the British car industry. It was sold in some markets as the '''Austin Marina''',<ref>[http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/cars/morris/marina-ital/morris-marinaital-the-austins/ Morris Marina/Ital : The Austins, www.aronline.co.uk] Retrieved on 22 June 2013</ref> the '''Leyland Marina''' and the '''Morris 1700'''.<ref name=aka/>

The 1980 replacement for the Marina, the closely related [[Morris Ital|Ital]], was essentially a body facelift and a change to the front suspension that replaced lever dampers with telescopic dampers but still retained torsion bars, to address criticism from the motoring press. Still, it sold reasonably well.

The Marina has been described as one of the worst cars of all time, although it was one of the most popular cars in Britain throughout its production life, narrowly beating the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] to 2nd place in the UK car sales table in 1973<ref>{{cite web|title=Sest Sellers|url=http://bestsellingcarsblog.com/1976/01/29/uk-1974-1975-ford-cortina-escort-popular-austin-allegro-shines/#more-10895|accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> and regularly taking 3rd or 4th place.<ref>{{cite web|title=Best Selling Cars 74/75|url=http://bestsellingcarsblog.com/1977/01/28/uk-1976-ford-escort-claims-pole-position-mini-stays-on-podium/|accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> The car was also exported throughout the world, including North America, and assembled with varying degrees of popularity in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.<ref>Fourth, according to {{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3742504.stm | title = VW Beetle is named 'crappest car' | work = BBC News | date = 2004-09-14 | accessdate = 2007-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = The politics of building cars | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/uk_politics/4294709.stm | last = Wheeler | first = Brian | date = 2005-04-07 | accessdate = 2007-07-14 | quote = [T]he cars produced in that era, such as the Austin Allegro and the Morris Marina, are now widely regarded as some of the worst ever built. | work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = First among the worst | work = Sydney Morning Herald | date = 2000-06-30 | last = Dowling | first = Joshua | quote = The failed Morris Marina was a close runner-up [to being the worst car ever sold in Australia].}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | work = The Sun Online |  title = Porsche's Cayenne caned | url = http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2005560578,00.html | accessdate = 2007-07-14 | location=London | first=Ken | last=Gibson | date=2007-05-24}}</ref>

==Development==
The Marina was developed under the ADO 28 codename. The impetus for its development came when [[Leyland Motors]] merged with [[British Motor Holdings]] in 1968, thus forming [[British Leyland]]. BMH was the corporate parent of the two biggest car manufacturers in the UK, [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] and [[Morris Motors|Morris]]. The new BL management, made largely from ex-Leyland Motors staff, were shocked to learn that apart from the [[Austin Maxi]] (then entering the final stages of development) and a tentative design for a replacement for the [[Mini]] (the [[Mini concept cars#9X .281967 to 1979.29|9X]]) BMH had no new cars under development. The company's products aimed at the mass-market consisted of the [[Morris Minor]], dating from 1948, and the [[British Motor Corporation#BMC Farina|'Farina']] range of mid-sized Austin and Morris saloons that were a decade old. BL rapidly implemented a plan to develop a replacement for both the Minor and the smaller Farina models that could be produced as quickly as possible and would be on sale for no more than five years until a genuinely 'all new' product could be launched in its place.

To try and introduce some clear distinctions between its multiple brands BL decided to release conservative, traditionally engineered cars under the Morris name, and sell more adventurous cars as Austins, or even as new marques—such as the [[Austin Allegro]] and [[Princess (car)|Princess]]. Specifically this meant that Austins use the groundbreaking transverse-engine [[front-wheel-drive]] layout developed by [[Alec Issigonis]]. It was thus decided that the ADO 28 would be badged as a  Morris. It would use a conventional [[rear-wheel drive]], [[live axle|live rear axle]] drivetrain as found on other popular mass-market cars such as the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] and [[Vauxhall Viva (1963–1979)|Vauxhall Viva]]. This strategy was also intended to improve sales in BL's export markets. [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] markets such as South Africa, Australia and New Zealand were large buyers of BL products, but the innovative BMC cars were considered too fragile and complex for use in such countries, as well as being fitted exclusively with small, low-powered engines. As a result, the Marina was unadventurous but simple by making use of tried and trusted [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] components derived from the [[Morris Minor]] and [[MG MGB|MGB]], as well as using mainly [[Triumph Dolomite]] transmission and running gear from the former Leyland side of the organisation. The car was designed by [[Roy Haynes (designer)|Roy Haynes]], the same man who designed the [[Ford Cortina]] Mark II, with which it shares some stylistic similarities. Lacking the budget to develop two cars to directly compete with the Escort and the Cortina the ADO 28 was sized in between the two benchmark Ford models. Haynes' original idea was to produce the car in [[coupe]] and [[saloon (automobile)|saloon]] versions with the coupe pitched as a premium, sporting version in a similar mold to the [[Ford Capri]]- a coupe based on Cortina running gear- to appeal to younger buyers while the saloon was for the crucial [[Take-home vehicle|company car]] market and families.

Roy Haynes also attempted to put forward a system that many manufacturers now use - a common floor pan shared between models. The Marina was the first car design that used this idea. Although this idea carried great potential benefits for a company selling cars under numerous different brands across multiple market sectors it was looked on as too radical by the management of [[British Leyland]] and Triumph designer [[Harry Webster]] was drafted in to push the project forward. Roy Haynes soon left the company. This protracted development period and the numerous changes made to the design by the various people working on it had a major effect on the Marina.  It meant that the Marina (a car intended to be basic and conventional) cost more to develop than the [[Austin Allegro]], its technically and aesthetically advanced stablemate. This is often held up as a prime example of British Leyland's poor project and cost management.

The Board decided to build the Marina at the ex-Morris Motors plant at Cowley in [[Oxford]], which been largely unchanged since the 1920s.  Furthermore, the plant had insufficient capacity (British manufacturers had trouble just meeting demand in the postwar years). This increased design and production costs significantly, since Leyland had to rebuild the plant from the ground up.

The Marina was originally designed to use the E-series OHC BMC engines.  These engines had a number of design problems. A modular series, the E series had standard bores, with capacity increased using more cylinders or larger strokes. However, small capacity sixes fell out of favour as postwar Britain became increasingly affluent.

To increase capacity, BL preferred increasing stroke, which added little to the cost of production.  This resulted in a tall engine.  It was not possible to slant the engine, because of the location of the fuel pump.  Furthermore, the engine had to be "siamesed"—that is, the water jacket was shared between pairs of cylinders.  These factors contributed to overheating and oil burning in the [[Austin Maxi]], so the board decided to adopt the more reliable A- and B- series engine for indigenous production. (Australia and South Africa continued with the E series.)  However, the body had already been designed, so the Marina was forever cursed with "full nappy" rear end styling (needed to even the lines between the necessarily bloated front and the rear).

The cost was further exacerbated by the fact that Leyland had to build an overpass for the engine assembly line, which was bifurcated by a municipal road. (The Birmingham council agreed to sell the road to Leyland ''after'' the overpass had been completed.)
This increased the cost even further.

Numerous redesigns also meant that the final design of the Marina was rushed as the project's final deadline grew near. The car went from design stage to production in just 18 months. As a result, the board decided to "cut costs" and abandon Macpherson struts in favour of an old design for the [[Morris Minor]].  They also abandoned a project to design a new 4-speed BMC gearbox. As a further cost-cutting measure the coupe version of the Marina would now use the same front doors as the saloon version. This produced significant costs in tooling and assembly but left the coupe as obvious styling derivative of the saloon rather than having a different, more sporting image as Roy Haynes had originally proposed. This made it impossible to pitch the coupe as a more premium product and so it was decided that the 2-door coupe version of the Marina would be the cheaper of the two bodystyles, competing with the 2-door saloon versions of the [[Ford Escort (Europe)#First generation (1968–74)|Ford Escort]] and the [[Hillman Avenger]]. This gave the coupe a rather conflicted image- the sporty bodystyle led many buyers and testers to have expectations of the Marina coupe that the final product was never intended to meet, being mechanically identical to the standard saloon version.

The indigenous engines were the venerable [[BMC A-Series engine|A-Series]] and [[BMC B-Series engine|B-Series]] units in 1.3- and 1.8-litre capacities, respectively, which drove rear wheels through a [[live axle]]. It featured [[torsion bar]] suspension at the front, leaf-spring suspension at the rear—and five body styles: [[sedan (car)|saloon]], [[station wagon|estate]], [[coupé]], [[Pickup truck|pickup]], and [[van]]. The estate (station wagon) came in 1972, almost a year and a half years later than the other models. for extra performance, TC versions were equipped with a twin carburettor engine similar to that in the MG MGB for extra performance. These could be fitted with a body kit from BL Special Tuning that added front and rear [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoilers]], [[alloy]] wheels, extra lighting and other details.  A 1.5-litre diesel version, using an engine developed from the B-Series, was offered in a few European countries where the tax rates favoured diesels. With no more than 37 or 40&nbsp;hp on offer (depending on your source), performance must have been lethargic. 3,870 diesels were built between 1977 and 1980.

The new car was launched on the domestic market on 27 April 1971,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Bu1AAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UKcMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6301,8093696&dq=morris-marina&hl=en |title=Morris Marina |publisher=Evening Times |date= |accessdate=2012-03-26}}</ref> with a night shift added at the Cowley plant in May 1971.<ref name=Autocar1971>{{cite journal| authorlink = Geoffrey Howard| title = British Cars| journal = [[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume = 134 (nbr 3920)| pages = pages 42–45 |date = 13 May 1971}}</ref>  At that time the manufacturers reported they were producing 2,000 cars per week, projecting, as things turned out, optimistically, to increase this to 5,000 cars per week by the end of 1971.<ref name=Autocar1971/>  Nevertheless, eleven months after launch, on 29 March 1972, the 100,000th Marina, a 1.8TC version, emerged from the Cowley plant<ref name=Motor197204>{{cite journal| authorlink = Charles Bulmer (Ed)| title = Motorweek: Marina Landmark| journal = Motor| volume = | page = page 56 |date = 15 April 1972}}</ref> and by February 1973 the company was able to announce that 250,000 Marinas had already been built in less than two years.<ref name=Autocar197302>{{cite journal| authorlink = | title = Worldwide News and commentary| journal = [[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume = 138 (nbr 4003)| page = page 2 |date = 15 February 1973}}</ref>  The Marina continued in production from 1971 to 1980, when it was replaced by the [[Morris Ital]] (a reworking of the Marina) that continued in production until 1984, when the Morris marque was axed and the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] badge featured on the [[Austin Montego|Montego]] that replaced it. In Australia and in [[South Africa]], it was known as the Leyland Marina, in New Zealand as the Morris 1.7 (for 1979–81, in face-lifted [[BL O-Series engine|O-Series]] form), and [[North America]] as the Austin Marina.

With the discontinuation of the [[Morris 18-22]] - also sold as an Austin and [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] - the Marina car and the [[Morris Ital|Ital]] were the only non commercial vehicles sold with the Morris badge after 1975.

The car was popular with families and undemanding car buyers, and was available in the typical BL colours of the day{{spaced ndash}}Russet Brown, Harvest Gold, Limeflower Green, Midnight Blue, Teal Blue, Blaze Orange, Damask Red and a characteristically 1970s purple called Black Tulip. It was intended to compete with the generally similar [[Ford Cortina]] (and to some extent the smaller Escort); the [[Vauxhall Viva (1963–1979)|Vauxhall Viva]] and later [[Vauxhall Cavalier]]; and the [[Hillman Avenger]] and [[Hillman Hunter|Hunter]]. It shared its basic styling with all these cars, adopting a "transatlantic" look that took elements of car styling from contemporary American cars (especially the front-end treatment in the Marina's case) and offered them at a scale acceptable to the European market. As with its mechanics, the Marina was not intended to be visually innovative or particularly interesting{{spaced ndash}}its [[Austin Allegro]] stablemate was the entry in that area of the market. A point of criticism with the Marina was that the windscreen wiper setup was "opposite" to the driver. This was decided pre-production after drivers of the prototypes reported that airflow at certain speeds made the wiper closest to the A-post lift off the windscreen, potentially disrupting the driver's line of sight. The problem was judged sufficiently serious that the car went on sale with a wiper position as if for driving on the other side of the road, though subsequent road testers questioned the effectiveness of this decision and the basis for it.{{fact|date=June 2014}}

BL was beset with problems including industrial action throughout the period, and the Marina was one of a number of models that suffered. While the BL workers gradually eroded their own employment, manufacturers in Europe and Japan introduced innovative designs (such as the [[VW Golf]]) that the Marina and its like were never likely to compete with.  Problems were compounded as the cars to replace the Marina and BL's other mid-size offerings were repeatedly delayed (eventually appearing as the [[Austin Maestro]] and [[Austin Montego]] in 1983/4).  By this point, Leyland had abandoned the idea of separate Austin and Morris ranges. There was not enough money to develop a full range of rear-wheel-drive Morris cars and an equivalent front-wheel-drive (FWD) Austin range, and FWD was increasingly accepted across the market.

There were changes however, albeit small ones. A facelift in 1975 gave the Marina new radiator grilles, dashboard, seats, suspension modifications and increased soundproofing. In May 1977 Marinas started to appear at dealers equipped with [[Austin Allegro|Allegro]] style seats: apart from rationalising the procuring and production processes, this was said to give the Marinas more comfortable and supportive seating.<ref name=Autocar1977>{{cite journal| authorlink = Unsigned| journal = [[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume =  146 (nbr 4203)| page = page 17 |date = 28 May 1977}}</ref>  The overhead camshaft [[BL O-Series engine|O-Series]] engine (that was also used for [[Leyland Princess]]) appeared in 1.7-litre form in 1978 to replace the larger [[BMC B-Series engine|B-Series]] 1.8 models. A changed grille, including driving lights, a front spoiler and redesigned bumpers and rear lights were added to all models.

Under severe financial strain, BL was bailed out by the government under the [[Ryder Report (British Leyland)|Ryder Report]] of 1975, and [[Sir Michael Edwardes]] was brought in to oversee the company. Under his leadership, BL made an attempt to update the Marina, by enlisting the help of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]'s [[ItalDesign]]. ItalDesign, however, did not design the car, which was an in-house product — it merely productionised it. The result of this exercise, the 1980 [[Morris Ital]] features large rear lamp clusters and a new front end, but the 1971 vintage of the design was obvious. The Ital lasted four years and was replaced by the [[Austin Montego]] in early 1984, thus bringing to an end use of the Morris name on passenger cars.

==Popularity==

The Marina's public life did not get off to a good start. The rushed final stages of design and production, especially in regard to the suspension, meant that many of the press fleet cars had an incorrect front suspension set-up whereby there was no camber change when the car rolled, which in turn produced "almost heroic" levels of [[understeer]]:<ref name=Autocar197406>{{cite journal| journal = [[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] |volume =  141 (nbr 4053)| authorlink = Martin Lewis |title =Long Term Report: Morris Marina 1.3 Coupe| pages = Pages 75–77| date = 22 June 1974}}</ref> ''[[Autocar]]'' reported that the car they were driving ended up on the wrong side of the road when taking a sharp corner.<ref>{{cite book |last=Daniels |first=Jeff |title=British Leyland: The truth about the cars |publisher=Osprey | year=1980 |isbn=0-85045-392-5 |page=113 }}</ref>  This was a particular problem with the more powerful 1.8 and 1.8TC cars, which were unfortunately the models the press were most likely to test, though the 1.3-litre models with their lighter engine did not suffer from the problem to the same extent. Early production Marinas were fitted with the original front suspension although a different lower link-arm (trunnion) was fitted quite quickly. The best estimate is that about 30,000 cars with the original suspension were sold to the public: many, though not all, had their front suspension set-up retrospectively corrected by dealers and before September 1971, less than six months after launch, front suspension "uprights" were being modified on the production line.<ref name=Autocar197406/> The Marina was never intended, or designed, to have particularly exciting or sharp handling, but the early problems led to less-than flattering road test reports and it was undeniable that the Marina's handling always tended towards understeer, which for a rear-wheel-drive car was unusual, and body-roll. ''[[What Car?]]'', in a very typical review, described the understeer as "noticeable", but called the car as a whole "unobtrusively well designed".

More comprehensive suspension changes were made with the Mark 2's introduction in 1975, which added [[sway bar|anti-roll bars]] that calmed the earlier car's wayward tendencies. In 1982 the Ital changed its Marina-derived front lever arm shock absorbers for telescopic shock absorbers.

Despite heavy criticism from the media and motoring press, the car's lack of technical sophistication let it be keenly priced. The Morris Marina was a very popular car in Britain, and was among the country's best selling cars throughout its production life, peaking at second place in 1973—only surpassed by the Ford Cortina. In many ways, the car fulfilled its design goal of being an unpretentious, high volume, mass-market car for average-income families and business people.

The deliberately simple and 'old-fashioned' design of the Marina was intended mainly to appeal to company car and corporate fleet buyers. This market was dominated by Ford with the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Escort]] and [[Ford Cortina|Cortina]]. BL's Austin products, with their advanced front-wheel drive and suspension systems were more expensive to buy and more costly to maintain, and so suffered poorer sales in these crucial markets. The Marina's front-engined, rear-wheel-drive, live-rear-axle layout was identical to the Ford products and most other mass-production saloons of the day. Although Ford remained dominant by a large margin, the Marina did succeed in capturing a larger share of the fleet/hire market and this contributed to its high sales but also its image as a rather dull, 'workaday' vehicle.

Marina production lasted almost 10 years, and in that time no fewer than 807,000 were sold across Britain, though it was less popular on export markets. Whilst intended as a 'stop gap' design until a more up-to-date replacement could be developed, the problems faced by British Leyland in the mid-to-late 1970s meant that the Marina remained in production essentially unchanged other than some light facelifting and interior changes, as the competition moved ahead. Coupled to the continuing quality problems suffered by the car and the increasingly poor perception of BL cars as a whole, this sealed the Marina's poor reputation despite its high sales.

Over the years, it has frequently been described by journalists, authors and motoring critics as one of the worst cars of all time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/classiccars/6670541/10-cars-that-should-never-have-been-built.html?image=2|title=Morris Marina - 10 cars that should never have been built|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=30 May 2012|date=1 December 2009}}</ref>

The relaunching of the then decade-old design as the [[Morris Ital]] only added to the image of an outdated, outclassed, and poor-performing vehicle.

A survey conducted by ''Auto Express'' magazine in August 2006 revealed that just 745 of the 807,000 Marinas sold in Britain are still on the road — that number is fewer than one in a thousand, making it officially the most-scrapped car sold in Britain over the previous 30 years. A few of these were later destroyed for comic effect by the BBC television series ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''. The low survival rate is due to a combination of factors, chief amongst which is the Marina's poor rust-proofing. Like other 'ordinary' family saloon cars of the period the Marina did not gain the status of a [[classic car]] whilst large numbers were still in good enough condition to encourage preservation. The Marina also made a good 'donor car' for several other British Leyland models. The brakes and suspension from a Marina were/are often used to upgrade the [[Morris Minor]], whilst the A- and B-Series engines were used in a wide variety of other cars. The 1275 cc A-Series, for example, made an easy performance improvement for a [[MG Midget|Midget]] or [[Austin-Healey Sprite|Sprite]], whilst the twin-carb B-Series engine used in the TC versions of the Marina fitted the [[MG MGB|MGB]] without any modifications needed (and the TC engine carries a slightly higher power output). Factors such as these meant that elderly Marinas were more likely to be stripped for parts to upgrade more popular models than be repaired or restored.

==Running gear==

The Marina was a conventional design, a fully unitary spot welded body (no sub-frames were used except on the six-cylinder) with a longitudinally mounted engine driving through the transmission and naked propeller shaft to a solid live axle suspended on semi-elliptic leaf springs with telescopic dampers. For ease of production and to reduce costs the body featured a strong central 'spine' around the transmission tunnel where most of the unit's strength was. The rear dampers were inclined inboard from the axle to their top mounts on this 'spine', rather than being mounted vertically on dedicated top mounts built into the body at the rear wheel arches. This limited the effectiveness of the dampers somewhat (they were dissipating vertical motion when mounted at an angle) and, when combined with the live rear axle, made the rear end prone to 'bump steer' on rough roads. A similar setup was used on the early [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] for the same reasons of cost-effective construction but Ford revised the arrangement on later models. BL lacked the funds to significantly retool the Marina's design and so all models were fitted with this less-than-ideal setup.

The front suspension was closely derived from that on the [[Morris Minor]], using longitudinal [[torsion bar]]s for springing. The rest of the front suspension consisted of lower arms pivoting on [[trunnion]]s with upper ball joints supporting the wheel and acting on hydraulic [[Lever arm shock absorber|lever arm dampers]]. These provided superior ride comfort over rough roads when compared to early [[Telescopic shock absorber#Telescopic|telescopic dampers]] at the expense of 'sloppy' handling and body control at high speeds. Improvements in road surfaces, the development of the [[List of motorways in the United Kingdom|motorway network]], the huge increase in the performance of even standard family cars and advances in the design of telescopic dampers since Minor was launched in 1948 made this type of damper wholly obsolete by 1971. Nonetheless this setup was adopted to keep development and tooling costs to a minimum.

British Leyland's Special Tuning department (which primarily handled development of BL's 'works' motorsport cars and technical support to private entries using BL products) produced a variety of upgrades for the Marina, which were (technically) available on road cars through special order. Amongst the S/T products were a kit to adapt the front suspension to use telescopic dampers (eventually fitted to the 'Marina' in its last days as the [[Morris Ital]] and adaptor kits to convert the rear dampers to a more effective vertical orientation using separate turrets. The S/T suspension upgrades produced significant improvements in handling and ride over the standard Marina but were not widely publicised on the general market, remaining the preserve of specialist motorsport interests.

The troublesome manual gearbox was a four-speed unit with synchromesh on all gears except reverse and was derived from the [[Triumph Toledo]] unit, controlled by a floor-mounted lever. Automatic transmission was a conventional Borg Warner Type 35 3 Speed transmission and was offered at extra cost.<ref name=DailyMailMotorShowReviewOct1972re1973>{{cite journal|journal =Daily Mail Motor Show Review 1972 on 1973 Cars |volume = | authorlink =  |title = | publisher=Associated Newspapers Group Ltd |location= London |pages = Page 37 (Morris Marina saloons)|date=October 1972}}</ref>

==North America==
The Marina was available in the United States as the Austin Marina from 1973 to 1975 in 2- and 4-door form. It was marketed as an Austin because Morris was a virtually unknown brand in the US and to capitalise on the success of the [[Austin-Healey]] marque.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} The 1973 model still had the normal small bumpers, but the 1974/5 models had large bumpers to comply with new US regulations. It was only produced with the 1800&nbsp;cc engine, and was soon strangled by the emissions equipment that U.S. law required—an air pump and exhaust air injection. The US government soon accused BL of "dumping" cars in the US, which—combined with tales of poor quality—made it a poor seller, and they were not exported to the US after 1975.

The Marina was also marketed in Canada as the Austin Marina, in 2-door coupé and 4-door saloon, from 1972 and 1973 to 1978, using only the 1800 engine, fitted with US-style heavier bumpers and emissions equipment.  Sales stopped when the 1.8&nbsp;L engine was replaced by the 1.7&nbsp;L engine, which was not emissions-certified in Canada.  While its simple rear-wheel-drive layout and mechanicals appealed to many Canadian drivers, the Marina's body was prone to extremely fast rust-out on the salted winter roads of eastern Canada, which limited sales in later years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

In Denmark, the [[Morris 1100]] & [[Morris 1300]] models were marketed under the Morris Marina name from 1962 to 1972.<ref>[http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/cars/bmc-cars/11001300/11001300-international-variations/bmc-11001300-danish-variations/ BMC 1100/1300 : Danish variations, www.aronline.co.uk] Retrieved on 13 January 2013</ref>

The Marina was introduced to the Australian market in April 1972 as the Morris Marina <ref>Glass's Dealer Guide, SA & NT Edition, June 1973, page 90</ref> and then, following a change in marketing policy, sold there from 1973 under the '''Leyland Marina''' name.<ref name=elevenhundred>[http://www.elevenhundred.com/marina/MarinaHistory.php Morris Marina - History in Australia] Retrieved on 1 April 2012</ref> From that time a restyled grille was used on all models.<ref name=elevenhundred/> The Australian Marina, which was sold in sedan and coupé forms only, used the OHC E-Series four-cylinder motor in 1500 cc, 1750 cc and 1750 cc twin carburettor form.<ref>Leyland Australia's Morris Marina sales brochure (undated, but almost certainly from 1972)</ref> Additionally, in an attempt to compete with the Holden Torana and Ford Cortina 6-cylinder models, the Marina was also offered from November 1973 <ref>Green Book Guide, March–April 1984, page 56</ref> with a 121&nbsp;hp (90&nbsp;kW) 2600 cc E-series six-cylinder engine.  This indigenous Marina variant was capable of 0–60&nbsp;mph in under nine seconds.

The Australian Marinas were built from CKD kits sent from Cowley in England, but used high levels of local content, including different running gear, axle, interiors, seals, seats, uprated dampers and mounts, uprated wheels and a higher grade of fit and finish. The Marina Six used a separate front sub-frame to support the weight of the Big Red engine and different front struts in an attempt to improve handling.  Base model featured a 3-speed manual gearbox  - sourced from [[General Motors Holden]] - to meet local content requirements.  The locally manufactured Borg-Warner automatic was, however, the variation most popular in the local market.

Leyland Australia were known for their own development and a version of the Rover V8 was converted into a V6 and test fitted to a Marina saloon, allegedly running in a race at Mount Panorama. Production of the Marina in Australia ended in 1975,<ref>[http://autocade.net/index.php/Leyland_Marina Leyland Marina] Retrieved from autocade.net on 23 July 2010</ref> when [[Leyland Australia]]'s Victoria Park, [[Zetland, New South Wales|Zetland]] factory (home of the [[Leyland P76]]) closed. A replacement model, the P82, was under development in 1974 but did not reach production.<ref>[http://www.aronline.co.uk/p7682p82f.htm Leyland P82] Retrieved from  www.aronline.co.uk on 23 July 2010</ref> Over 30,000 Marinas were produced in Australia.<ref name=elevenhundred/>

==New Zealand==
The Morris Marina was a popular car on the New Zealand market, imported by the [[New Zealand Motor Corporation]]. Imports began with built-up British sourced saloons and coupes (in 1.3 and 1.8L forms) in 1971, but local assembly of Australian sourced (E-Series engines) models began in 1972 after the release of the Marinas there. Six cylinder models were added in 1973. In 1974, before the demise of Leyland Australia's manufacturing operations, local assembly switched to British sourced models again in saloon, estate, van and pick-up forms. Batches of fully built UK-sourced cars also came in 1973 and 1974 when the government allowed additional import licences due to the inability of local assembly plants to keep pace with demand for new cars.

In 1979 the Marina received a facelift and the BL O-Series [[OHC]] 1.7L engine, however at the time the Marina name was perceived as negative by the New Zealand public{{spaced ndash}}hence the Marina name was dropped completely, the car being renamed '''Morris 1700'''.<ref name=aka/> The Morris 1700 had high equipment levels and included front spoilers and driving lights on all models. The related van and pickup models were renamed '''Morris 575'''.

Production of this car ceased in 1981, and the car was replaced locally by an expanded range of NZMC Honda products.

==Rallying==
In 1970, [[Donald Stokes]] ordered the [[BMC Competitions Department]] closed and disbanded. By the time the Marina appeared, it was becoming obvious that Stage Rallying was gaining popularity and in early 1971 it was decided to use the new model in the 1971 RAC rally, the following November. Luckily for BL, [[Special Tuning]] had a rally driver on its books by the name of [[Brian Culcheth]] and so with no team, no mechanics, no funding and initially no sponsorship a team of talented engineers developed a 1.3 Coupe into a rally car, funded purely by sales of performance parts from Special Tuning.

Knowing that the 1.8 engine was too heavy for decent handling, they concentrated on the 1.3 engine and using [[Mini]] components got good horsepower figures from it; then they played a flanker to pen the field in the 1.3 classes. All rally teams used one particular course to test, so the car was fitted with a full-race 1.8 and blasted around the track in front of the [[Ford]] rally team — consequently they withdrew from the 1.3 class allowing the car to claim 1st in Class for the 1971 Rally.

Subsequently, the car was entered in seventeen more national and international rallies until 1975, either being placed or winning class honours in twelve of them, the others being crashes/failures.

For 1976, BL management decided to move to the [[Triumph Dolomite]] Sprint for its main rallying weapon.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

In 1974 [[Edwin Foden, Sons & Co.|Foden]] commissioned a [[Rover V8 engine|Rover V8]]-engined Marina to compete in the London-Sahara-Munich rally.  This stormed through several stages before suffering rear-axle failure in the desert. The rear axle had been the only part sourced from outside the BL parts bin.

==Post-demise==
During the early 1970s, [[George Turnbull (autoindustry executive)|George Turnbull]] was retired from BL and took two Marinas, one saloon and one coupé to a small car producing company in [[Korea]] who were interested in developing their own car, instead of making other people's cast-offs. [[Hyundai]] took the Marinas and developed the [[Hyundai Pony]] from them, in 3-, 4- and 5-door variants, a [[station wagon]], and a pick-up, kick-starting the company's ascendancy in car manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://pages.eidosnet.co.uk/~morrismarina/Korean%20Connection.htm | title = The Korean Connection | accessdate = 2007-07-14}}</ref>

The Marina lived on in many smaller ways: many parts from the Marina were used in other [[British Leyland]] vehicles. The door handles from the Marina were utilized in the Austin Allegro, [[Range Rover Classic|Range Rover]], [[Triumph TR7]], and the first series of [[Land Rover Discovery]], until 1998.<ref name="independent-carincluded">{{cite news | title = Only &pound;634,500, car included | work = The Independent | date = 1995-06-24 | last = Bremner | first = Richard | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19950624/ai_n13990574 | accessdate = 2007-07-14}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name="randomdoorhandletrivia">{{cite web | url = http://www.rangerovers.net/rrpartsv.htm | title = Range Rover Parts Sources | last = Brabyn | first = John | quote = The Range Rover door handles are the same as the ones on the Morris Marina and the early 1980s Lotus Esprit Turbo. | accessdate = 2007-07-14}} Very early Range Rovers did not use these door handles, though.</ref> They were also used by some models of the [[Reliant Scimitar]], and by various [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] cars, including some versions of the [[Lotus Esprit]].<ref name="randomdoorhandletrivia" /> The indicator switchgear, also used on the [[Triumph Stag]], eventually became part of the [[Lamborghini Diablo]].<ref name="independent-carincluded" /> Marina-sourced gearboxes were used in the [[MG Midget]] 1500 version.<ref>{{cite book | title = Original Sprite & Midget: The Restorer's Guide | last = Horler | first = Terry | isbn = 0-7603-1449-7 | year = 2003 | publisher = MotorBooks}}</ref>

==''Top Gear''==
The [[BBC2]] motoring show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' has featured several Morris Marinas, all of which have been destroyed. A running gag throughout the series involves dropping a piano on a Marina every time the car is featured. The first Marina was set on fire after [[Jeremy Clarkson]] raced it against a [[Lada]] driven by [[James May]] in the Communist Cars episode. Next, following complaints from an online Morris Marina web forum, the presenters claimed that they had bought their own Marina to restore. They ended up dropping a piano on it, which they claimed new delivery firm "Careless Airways" was responsible for. In the Rear Wheel Drive Challenge, May was forced to drive a Marina after his own [[Ford Capri]] broke down, during this episode Hammond, who was following May described the Marina as an "Entirely Beige, Wilfully Awful Pile of Misery". It was entered in an ice race against Clarkson in a [[Porsche 944]] and [[Richard Hammond]] in a [[Nissan 300ZX]], not to mention several professionals such as Frenchman [[Olivier Panis]] - during the race, Panis was recorded to have called May's Marina a "shitbox". Although the Marina ultimately came first among the three presenters' cars in the ice race, another piano was dropped on top of it. In the [[Lancia]] Challenge, a Marina (driven by Hammond) raced against a [[Lancia Beta#HPE|Lancia Beta HPE]] (driven by Clarkson). The Lancia caught fire and the Marina broke down. Hammond had strapped a piano to the roof of the Marina to prevent another one landing on it, but another one was dropped anyway. In his DVD ''Duel'', Clarkson was about to race an [[Aston Martin V12 Vantage]] against a Marina (driven by [[The Stig]]) in a 24-hour endurance race, but the race was canceled when a piano was dropped on the Marina. In the Top Gear book ''Crap Cars'' by [[Sniff Petrol|Richard Porter]], the Marina was named 4th worst car of all time.<ref>{{cite book|title = Crap Cars|first = Richard|last = Porter|publisher = Random House|year = 2004|isbn = 9780563522102}}</ref>

===1983–2000: Early life & ''Broken Bracelet''===

In August 2001, she appeared on ''[[Total Request Live]]'' after "Everywhere" reached No. 4 on their charts. Due to the mainstream success of those released singles, ''The Spirit Room'' was certified Double Platinum by the [[RIAA]] for selling over two million copies in the United States. Michelle also sang in Hanson's 2004 album, ''Underneath'' in the song, "Deeper". [[VH1]] released Branch's [[Pop-Up Video]] for her song "[[All You Wanted]]".

===2003–05: ''Hotel Paper''===
Her second album ''[[Hotel Paper]]'' was released in 2003, and debuted at No. 2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts and matched the commercial success of her debut album earning a Platinum certification by the [[RIAA]] for selling over a million copies.<ref name="Billboard HP">{{cite web |title=Billboard Chart History: Hotel Paper |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=michelle branch|chart=all}} |work=Billboard |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref> However, the album was met with mixed reviews.

The following singles, however, "[[Breathe (Michelle Branch song)|Breathe]]" and "'Til I Get over You," did not match the first single's success. Branching out into television, she appeared in several shows, including ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[American Dreams]]'', and ''[[Charmed]]''. In June 2004, she hosted MTV's "Faking the Video" alongside [[Nick Lachey]] and [[JC Chasez]]. She also appeared in the Rob Schneider film ''[[The Hot Chick]]''.

The horse draws its body together so that it becomes like a giant [[Spring (device)|spring]] whose stored [[energy]] can be reclaimed for fighting or running from a predator. The largest organic spring in the horse's body, and therefore the easiest one to observe in action, is the [[back (horse)|back]], including the [[Spine (anatomy)|spine]] and the associated [[Muscle|musculature]] that draws it together in much the same way that a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] is drawn by an [[Archery|archer]].  

==Collection and the wild horse==
Collection of the horse's body is an important mechanism for survival. If danger suddenly appears the horse has a large store of energy ready for instantaneous release and so it is much easier for it to spring away from the danger than if it had been caught flat-footed, or "[[forehand (horse)|on the forehand]]." 

When a strange horse comes upon the scene, when a horse catches the scent of a [[predator]], or when a horse scents a potential mate, the attention of the horse is naturally aroused and its body prepares for action. It raises its head, arches its back, and in so doing brings its legs more under its body where they can maintain the bending of the spine by their contact with the earth. With each step forward this spring is released slightly and then immediately re-compressed.

==Collection in riding==
[[Image:WC07b.JPG|right|thumb|Collection in the trot, with more weight carried on the hindquarters.]]
[[Image:Dance in the mood 20061029R1.jpg|right|thumb|Trotting with a shortened stride "on the forehand," rather than collected.]]
Collection is also an important ingredient in [[Equestrianism|riding]], if the rider wishes to perform more advanced movements or [[Jumping (horse)|jumping]]. It not only allows the horse to move more easily and athletically, but also helps prevent wear-and-tear on the front legs. Through training, the horse learns to collect itself when requested to do so by the rider. The observer receives the impression of great strength held under perfect control.

The most readily apparent form of collection can be observed when comparing different degrees of collection within a single [[Horse gait|gait]]. A more collected gait will have two main symptoms: the horse will lower his hindquarters and raise his forehand, and the horse will have more bend in the joints of his legs. Additionally, the stride length will be shortened. Collection may be performed at any gait.

However, this does ''not'' mean that any shortened gait is collected. Riders who try to pull their horses into a shortened gait (riding "front-to-back"), rather than contain the energy coming from the hindquarters (riding "back-to-front"), will produce a shortened stride, but the horse will continue to carry his weight on his front end, and will simply have stiff, unathletic movement. The shoulders will not be raised, and the horse will find it more difficult to perform a task than he would otherwise. The hind legs will usually be "strung out behind," rather than coming up under the body with each stride to support it, and the back will be dropped rather than properly raised upward.

===Specific uses in sport===
Collected gaits are asked for in dressage tests from the mid-levels upward, at the walk, trot, and canter. Additionally, a high degree of collection is required of the rider in more advanced dressage moves, such as the [[pirouette (dressage)|pirouette]], [[piaffe]], and [[Passage (dressage)|passage]]. The ultimate level of collection is the [[levade]], in which the horse carries 100% of his weight on his hindquarters. Unlike a [[rear (horse)|rearing]] horse, the horse's rear legs are well under it, and it can safely support itself in an upright position for a time and then lower itself to the ground under control.  

Collection is also essential in jumping. Most horses will physically be unable to jump extremely high fences (such as those seen in Grand Prix [[show jumping]] or [[puissance]] classes) without collection, as they will not have enough power to make it over the obstacle. Speed is not a substitute, and a horse that is simply galloped at a fence will find it extremely difficult to raise his forehand upward on takeoff and gain enough height over the fence. Instead, he will jump flat, without [[bascule (horse)|bascule]], and will be much more likely to pull a rail. Secondly, horses must be adjustable within jumping courses, having the ability to shorten or lengthen their stride between obstacles, especially if placed in a [[combination (jump)|combination]]. A horse that is not collected will find it very hard to seamlessly shorten his stride in a related distance, and may be forced to take off too close or too far away from the jump, which greatly increases the chance he will hit it.

Collection also makes it easier for a horse to make sudden changes of direction, such as those required by western performance horses. [[Cutting (sport)|Cutting]] horses are excellent examples, as they crouch low and back on their hindquarters so they may quickly move side to side to mirror the movements of the calf.

A '''bone [[tumor]]''', (also spelled '''bone tumour'''), is a [[neoplastic]] growth of tissue in [[bone]].  Abnormal growths found in the bone can be either [[benign]] (noncancerous) or [[malignant]] (cancerous).

A '''bone lytic lesion''' (often just '''lytic lesion''') is an area where part of a bone appears to have been dissolved or "eaten away".

Average five year survival in the United States after being diagnosed with bone and joint cancer is 67%.<ref>{{cite web|title=SEER Stat Fact Sheets: Bone and Joint Cancer|url=http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/bones.html|website=NCI|accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref>

==Classification==
[[Image:Giant cell tumor of bone08.JPG|thumb|X-ray of a [[giant cell bone tumor]] in the head of the 4th metacarpal of the left hand. ]]
[[Image:Bonetumor.jpg|thumb|right|An arm bone tumor]]
Bone tumors may be classified as "[[primary tumors]]", which originate in bone or from bone-derived cells and tissues, and "[[secondary tumor]]s" which originate in other sites and spread ([[metastasis|metastasize]]) to the skeleton. Carcinomas of the [[Prostate cancer|prostate]], [[Breast cancer|breasts]], [[Lung cancer|lungs]], [[Thyroid cancer|thyroid]], and [[Kidney cancer|kidneys]] are the carcinomas that most commonly metastasize to bone. Secondary malignant bone tumors are estimated to be 50 to 100 times as common as primary bone cancers.

===Primary bone tumors===
Primary tumors of bone can be divided into [[benign|benign tumors]] and [[cancer]]s. Common benign bone tumors may be [[neoplasia|neoplastic]], developmental, [[Physical trauma|traumatic]], [[infection|infectious]], or [[inflammation|inflammatory]] in etiology. Some benign tumors are not true neoplasms, but rather, represent [[hamartoma]]s, namely the [[osteochondroma]]. The most common locations for many primary tumors, both benign and malignant include the distal femur and proximal tibia.

Examples of benign bone tumors include [[osteoma]], [[osteoid osteoma]], [[osteochondroma]], [[osteoblastoma]], [[enchondroma]], [[giant cell tumor of bone]], [[aneurysmal bone cyst]], and [[fibrous dysplasia of bone]].

Malignant primary bone tumors include [[osteosarcoma]], [[chondrosarcoma]], [[Ewing's sarcoma]], [[fibrosarcoma]], and other types.

While malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) - now generally called "[[pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma]]" - primary in bone is known to occur occasionally,<ref name='JeonSong'>Jeon DG, Song WS, Kong CB, Kim JR, Lee SY. MFH of Bone and Osteosarcoma Show Similar Survival and Chemosensitivity. ''Clin Orthop Rel Res'' 469;584-90.</ref> current paradigms tend to consider MFH a "wastebasket" diagnosis, and the current trend is toward using specialized studies (i.e. [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemical]] tests) to classify these undifferentiated tumors into other tumor classes. [[Multiple myeloma]] is a [[hematology|hematologic]] cancer, originating in the bone marrow, which also frequently presents as one or more bone lesions.

[[Germ cell tumors]], including [[teratoma]], often present and originate in the midline of the sacrum, coccyx, or both. These sacrococcygeal teratomas are often relatively amenable to treatment.

===Secondary bone tumors===
Since, by definition, benign bone tumors do not metastasize, all secondary bone tumors are [[metastasis|metastatic]] [[lesion]]s which have spread from other organs, most commonly carcinomas of the breast, lung, and prostate.

Reliable and valid statistics on the incidence, prevalence, and mortality of malignant bone tumors are difficult to come by, particularly in the oldest (those over 75 years of age), because [[carcinomas]] that are widely metastatic to bone are rarely ever curable, biopsies to determine the origin of the tumor in cases like this are rarely done.

==Symptoms==
{{see also|Cancer pain}}
The most common symptom of bone tumors is [[pain]], which will gradually increase over time. A person may go weeks, months, and sometimes years before seeking help; the pain increases with the growth of the tumor. Additional symptoms may include [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[fever]], [[weight loss]], [[anemia]], and/or unexplained bone fractures. Many patients will not experience any symptoms, except for a painless mass. Some bone tumors may weaken the structure of the bone, causing [[pathologic]] [[bone fracture|fractures]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/phase2/mbone.pdf |title=Questions and Answers about Bone Cancer |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment of bone tumors is highly dependent on the type of tumor.

===Chemotherapy and radiotherapy===
[[Chemotherapy]] and [[Radiation therapy|radiotherapy]] are effective in some tumors (such as [[Ewing's sarcoma]]) but less so in others (such as [[chondrosarcoma]]).<ref>[http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/bone-cancer Bone tumor] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York]]</ref>
There are a variety of chemotherapy treatment protocols for bone tumors. The protocol with the best reported survival in children and adults is an intra-arterial protocol where tumor response is tracked by serial arteriogram.  When tumor response has reached >90% necrosis surgical intervention is planned.<ref>[http://www.thedenverclinic.com/images/stories/Published_articles/Ped_OGS.pdf 10 year survival in Pediatric Osteosarcoma]</ref><ref>[http://www.thedenverclinic.com/images/stories/Published_articles/Clin_Orthop_adult_OGS.pdf Survival in Adult Osteosarcoma and MFH of Bone]</ref>

===Medication===
One of the major concerns is bone density and bone loss. Non-hormonal [[bisphosphonate]]s increase bone strength and are available as once-a-week prescription pills. Metastron also known as [[strontium-89]] chloride is an intravenous medication given to help with the pain and can be given in three month intervals. Generic Strontium Chloride Sr-89 Injection UPS, manufactured by Bio-Nucleonics Inc., its the generic version of Metastron.<ref>{{cite web|title=FDA ANDA Generic Drug Approvals|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/DrugandBiologicApprovalReports/ANDAGenericDrugApprovals/UCM064272|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]}}</ref> Astra zantec is currently under review as to the benefits in bone cancer.

===Surgical treatment===
{{Main|Amputation}}

Treatment for some bone cancers may involve [[surgery]], such as limb [[amputation]], or limb sparing surgery (often in combination with [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiation therapy]]).  Limb sparing surgery, or limb salvage surgery, means the [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] is spared from [[amputation]].   Instead of amputation the affected bone is removed and is done in two ways (a) [[bone graft]], in which a bone from elsewhere from the body is taken or (b) [[artificial bone]] is put in. In upper leg surgeries, limb salvage prostheses are available.

The other surgery is called van-ness rotation or [[rotationplasty]] which is a form of amputation,  in which the patient's foot is turned upwards in a 180 degree turn and the upturned foot is used as a knee.

Types of amputation:

;Leg
* Below knee
* Above knee
* Symes
* Hip disarticulation
* [[Hemipelvectomy]] or hindquarter, in which the whole leg is removed with one half of the pelvis

;Arm

* Below elbow
* Above elbow
* Shoulder disarticulation
* Forequarter (amputation of the whole arm, along with the shoulder blade and the clavicle)

The most radical of amputations is [[hemicorporectomy]] (translumbar or waist amputation) which removes the legs, the pelvis, urinary system, excretory system and the genital area (penis/testes in males and vagina/vulva in females).  This operation is done in two stages.   First stage is doing the colostomy and the urinary conduit, the second stage is the amputation.   This is a mutilating operation and is only done as a last resort (e.g. when even [[pelvic exenteration]] doesn't work or in cases of advanced pelvic/reproductive cancers)

==Prognosis==
The outlook depends on the type of tumor. The outcome is expected to be good for people with noncancerous (benign) tumors, although some types of benign tumors may eventually become cancerous (malignant). With malignant bone tumors that have not spread, most patients achieve a cure, but the cure rate depends on the type of cancer, location, size, and other factors.

==Signs and symptoms==
Many patients first complain of pain that may be worse at night, and may have been occurring for some time. Also, teenagers who are active in sports tend to complain about pain in their lower femur, or right below the knee. If the tumor is large, it can appear as a swelling. The affected bone is not as strong as normal bones and may fracture with minor trauma (a pathological fracture).  According to [[the Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT)|Bone Cancer Research Trust]], the pain may come and go and vary in intensity. The swelling will not be visible if it is not near the surface of the body such as on the pelvis.

==Causes==

Several research groups are investigating cancer stem cells and their potential to cause tumors.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Osuna D, de Alava E |title= Molecular pathology of sarcomas |journal= Rev Recent Clin Trials |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=12–26 |year=2009 |pmid=19149759 |doi= 10.2174/157488709787047585}}</ref>  Radiotherapy for unrelated conditions may be a rare cause.<ref>Dhaliwal J, Sumathi VP and Grimer RJ. Radiation-induced periosteal osteosarcoma. ''Grand Rounds'' '''10''': 13-18 [http://www.grandrounds-e-med.com/articles/gr100003.htm]</ref>

* Familial cases where the deletion of chromosome '13q14' inactivates the [[retinoblastoma gene]] is associated with a high risk of osteosarcoma development.
* Bone dysplasias, including Paget's disease, [[Fibrous dysplasia of bone|fibrous dysplasia]], [[enchondromatosis]], and [[hereditary multiple exostoses]], increase the risk of osteosarcoma.
* [[Li–Fraumeni syndrome]] (germline TP53 mutation) is a predisposing factor for osteosarcoma development.
* [[Rothmund–Thomson syndrome]] (i.e. autosomal recessive association of congenital bone defects, hair and skin dysplasias, [[hypogonadism]], and cataracts) is associated with increased risk of this disease.

Despite persistent rumors suggesting otherwise, there is no clear association between [[water fluoridation]] and [[cancer]] or deaths due to cancer, both for cancer in general and also specifically for [[bone cancer]] and osteosarcoma.<ref>{{vcite book |url=http://nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/publications/synopses/Eh41_Flouridation_PART_A.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-13 |year=2007 |title=A systematic review of the efficacy and safety of fluoridation |author=National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia) |isbn=1-86496-415-4 }}</ref>

== Mechanism ==
[[File:Prediclationofosteosarcoma2.PNG|thumb| 120px|left|Predilections of osteosarcoma]]
The tumor may be localized at the end of the long bone. Most often it affects the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] end of [[tibia]] or [[humerus]], or [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] end of [[femur]]. Osteosarcoma tends to affect regions around the [[knee]] in 60% of cases, 15% around the [[hip]], 10% at the [[shoulder]], and 8% in the [[jaw]]. The tumor is solid, hard, irregular ("fir-tree," "moth-eaten", or "sun-burst" appearance on X-ray examination) due to the tumor spicules of calcified bone radiating in right angles. These right angles form what is known as [[Codman's triangle]]. Surrounding tissues are infiltrated.

[[File:Osteosarcoma - very high mag.jpg|thumb|right|High-magnification micrograph showing osteoid formation in an osteosarcoma, [[H&E stain]]]]
Microscopically: The characteristic feature of osteosarcoma is presence of osteoid (bone formation) within the tumor. Tumor cells are very [[pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphic]] ([[anaplastic]]), some are giant, numerous atypical [[mitoses]]. These cells produce osteoid describing irregular [[trabeculae]] (amorphous, [[eosinophilic]]/pink) with or without central calcification ([[hematoxylin]]ophilic/blue, granular) - tumor bone. Tumor cells are included in the [[osteoid]] matrix. Depending on the features of the tumor cells present (whether they resemble bone cells, cartilage cells, or fibroblast cells), the tumor can be subclassified.  Osteosarcomas may exhibit multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Papalas JA, Balmer NN, Wallace C, Sangüeza OP |title=Ossifying dermatofibroma with osteoclast-like giant cells: report of a case and literature review |journal=Am J Dermatopathol |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=379–83 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19461244 |doi=10.1097/DAD.0b013e3181966747 |url=}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Family [[physicians]] and [[orthopedist]]s rarely see a [[malignant]] bone tumor (most bone tumors are [[benign]]). The route to osteosarcoma diagnosis usually begins with an [[X-ray]], continues with a combination of scans ([[CT scan]], [[PET scan]], [[bone scan]], [[MRI]]) and ends with a surgical [[biopsy]]. A characteristic often seen in an X-ray is  Codman's triangle, which is basically a subperiosteal lesion formed when the periosteum is raised due to the tumor.
Films are suggestive, but bone [[biopsy]] is the only definitive method to determine whether a tumor is [[malignant]] or [[benign]].

The biopsy of suspected osteosarcoma should be performed by a qualified [[orthopedic oncologist]]. The [[American Cancer Society]] states: "Probably in no other cancer is it as important to perform this procedure properly. An improperly performed biopsy may make it difficult to save the affected limb from amputation."
It may also metastasise to the lungs, mainly appearing on the chest X-ray as solitary or multiple round nodules most common at the lower regions.

==Treatment==
A complete radical, surgical, ''en bloc'' resection of the cancer, is the treatment of choice in osteosarcoma.<ref name="OttavianiJaffe"/>
Although about 90% of patients are able to have limb-salvage surgery, complications - particularly infection, prosthetic loosening and non-union - or local tumor recurrence may cause the need for further surgery or amputation.
[[Mifamurtide]] is used after a patient has had surgery to remove the tumor and together with chemotherapy to kill remaining cancer cells to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Also, the option to have rotationplasty after the tumor is taken out exists.<ref>http://www.childrenscancer.org/main/kids_stories/lukes_story_surviving_osteosarcoma/</ref>

Patients with osteosarcoma are best managed by a medical [[oncologist]] and an [[orthopedic oncologist]] experienced in managing sarcomas. Current standard treatment is to use [[neoadjuvant]] [[chemotherapy]] (chemotherapy given before surgery) followed by surgical resection. The percentage of tumor cell [[necrosis]] (cell death) seen in the tumor after surgery gives an idea of the prognosis and also lets the oncologist know if the chemotherapy regimen should be altered after surgery.

Standard therapy is a combination of limb-salvage orthopedic surgery when possible (or amputation in some cases) and a combination of high-dose [[methotrexate]] with [[leucovorin]] rescue, intra-arterial [[cisplatin]], [[adriamycin]], [[ifosfamide]] with [[mesna]], BCD ([[bleomycin]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[dactinomycin]]), [[etoposide]], and muramyl tripeptide. [[Rotationplasty]] may be used. Ifosfamide can be used as an adjuvant treatment if the necrosis rate is low.

Despite the success of chemotherapy for osteosarcoma, it has one of the lowest survival rates for pediatric cancer. The best reported 10-year survival rate is 92%; the protocol used is an aggressive intra-arterial regimen that individualizes therapy based on arteriographic response.<ref>[http://www.thedenverclinic.com/images/stories/Published_articles/Ped_OGS.pdf Wilkins RM, Cullen JW, Odom L, Jamroz BA, Cullen PM, Fink K, Peck SD, Stevens SL, Kelly CM, Camozzi AB: Superior survival in treatment of primary non-metastatic pediatric osteosarcoma of the extremity. Ann Surg Oncol 10:498-507, 2003.]</ref> Three-year event-free survival ranges from 50% to 75%, and five-year survival ranges from 60% to 85+% in some studies. Overall, 65-70% patients treated five years ago will be alive today.<ref name=Buecker>{{cite web|author=Buecker, PJ, Gebhardt, M and Weber, K|year=2005|title=Osteosarcoma|work=ESUN|url=http://sarcomahelp.org/osteosarcoma.html| accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref> These survival rates are overall averages and vary greatly depending on the individual necrosis rate.

Fluids are given for [[Rehydration|hydration]], while antiemetic drugs (such as the [[5-HT3 antagonist|5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist]]s e.g. [[granisetron]] and [[ondansetron]]) help with [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]]. [[Filgrastim]] or [[pegfilgrastim]] help with [[white blood cell]] counts and [[neutrophil]] counts. Blood transfusions and [[epoetin alfa]] help with [[anemia]].

==Epidemiology==
Osteosarcoma is the eighth-most common form of childhood cancer, comprising 2.4% of all malignancies in [[pediatric]] patients, and about 20% of all primary bone cancers.<ref name="OttavianiJaffe"/>

Incidence rates for osteosarcoma in U.S. patients under 20 years of age are estimated at 5.0 per million per year in the general population, with a slight variation between individuals of black, Hispanic, and white ethnicities (6.8, 6.5, and 4.6 per million per year, respectively). It is slightly more common in males (5.4 per million per year) than in females (4.0 per million per year).<ref name="OttavianiJaffe"/>

It originates more frequently in the [[metaphysis|metaphyseal]] region of tubular long bones, with 42% occurring in the femur, 19% in the tibia, and 10% in the humerus. About 8% of all cases occur in the skull and jaw, and another 8% in the pelvis.<ref name="OttavianiJaffe"/>

Around 300 of the 900 people diagnosed in the United States will die each year.  A second peak in incidence occurs in the elderly, usually associated with an underlying bone pathology such as [[Paget's disease of bone]].

==Prognosis==
Prognosis is separated into three groups.

* '''Stage I''' osteosarcoma is rare and includes parosteal osteosarcoma or low-grade central osteosarcoma. It has an excellent prognosis (>90%) with wide resection.
* '''Stage II''' prognosis depends on the site of the tumor (proximal tibia, femur, pelvis, etc.), size of the tumor mass, and the degree of necrosis from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Other pathological factors such as the degree of p-glycoprotein, whether the tumor is cxcr4-positive,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osteosarcomasupport.org/cxcr4_metastases.pdf |title=osteosarcomasupport.org |publisher=osteosarcomasupport.org |accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref> or Her2-positive are also important, as these are associated with distant metastases to the lung.  The prognosis for patients with metastatic osteosarcoma improves with longer times to metastases, (more than 12 months-24 months), a smaller number of metastases, and their resectability.  It is better to have fewer metastases than longer time to metastases.  Those with a longer length of time (>24months) and few nodules (two or fewer) have the best prognosis, with a two-year survival after the metastases of 50%, five-year of 40%, and 10-year of 20%.  If metastases are both local and regional, the prognosis is worse.
* Initial presentation of '''stage III''' osteosarcoma with lung metastases depends on the resectability of the primary tumor and lung [[Nodule (medicine)|nodule]]s, degree of necrosis of the primary tumor, and maybe the number of metastases.  Overall survival prognosis is about 30%.<ref name=Koshkina>{{cite web|author=Koshkina, NV and Corey, S|year=2008|title=Novel Targets to Treat Osteosarcoma Lung Metastases|work=ESUN|url=http://sarcomahelp.org/research_center/osteosarcoma_lung_metastases.html| accessdate=2009-04-14}}</ref>

Deaths due to malignant neoplasms of the bones and joints account for an unknown number of childhood cancer deaths. Mortality rates due to osteosarcoma have been declining at about 1.3% per year. Long-term survival probabilities for osteosarcoma have improved dramatically during the late 20th century and approximated 68% in 2009.<ref name="OttavianiJaffe"/>

==Research, information, and support==
In the UK and Ireland, the Bone Cancer Research Trust funds research and provides information on osteosarcoma and other bone cancers, including information for teenagers who have this condition. In the US, the nonprofit organization Triumph Over Kid Cancer Foundation helps not only to raise awareness about osteosarcoma, but also helps raise funds to try to improve treatment and survivability of pediatric bone cancer. About 90% of their proceeds go to research and M.D. Anderson Cancer Hospital matches those funds dollar for dollar, and use all funds for research in pediatric sarcoma. The work will be done under the auspices of the Children's Sarcoma Initiative, and will feature a committee to solicit new research ideas in this area and fund those most likely to lead to progress. Also, because early diagnosis greatly improves prognosis, they work on educational efforts to increase awareness of bone cancer's signs and symptoms in parents and their pediatricians. Finally, since the life of pediatric bone cancer patients is so difficult, TOKC sets aside 10% of its proceeds to help fund the Sunshine Kids Organization, which works to bring some brief periods of happiness to the lives of these children.

===Risk factors===
Osteosarcoma is the most common bone tumor in dogs and typically afflicts middle-aged large and giant breed dogs such as [[Irish Wolfhound]]s, [[Greyhound]]s, [[German Shepherd Dog|German Shepherd]]s, [[Rottweiler]]s, mountain breeds (Great Pyrenees, St. Bernard, Leonberger, Newfoundland), [[Doberman Pinscher]]s and [[Great Dane]]s.

===Clinical presentation===
The most commonly affected bones are the proximal [[humerus]], the distal [[radius (bone)|radius]], the distal [[femur]], and the [[tibia]],<ref name=Morrison_1998>{{cite book|author=Morrison, Wallace B.|title=Cancer in Dogs and Cats|edition=1st|publisher=Williams and Wilkins|year=1998|isbn=0-683-06105-4}}</ref> following the basic premise "far from the elbow, close to the knee". Other sites include the ribs, the [[Human mandible|mandible]], the spine, and the pelvis.  Rarely, osteosarcoma may arise from soft tissues (extraskeletal osteosarcoma). [[Metastasis]] of tumors involving the limb bones is very common, usually to the lungs. The tumor causes a great deal of pain, and can even lead to fracture of the affected bone. As with human osteosarcoma, bone [[biopsy]] is the definitive method to reach a final diagnosis. Osteosarcoma should be differentiated from other [[bone tumours]] and a range of other lesions, such as [[osteomyelitis]]. Differential diagnosis of the osteosarcoma of the skull in particular includes, among others, [[chondrosarcoma]] and the [[multilobular tumour of bone]].<ref>Loukopoulos P, Thornton JR , Robinson WF. Clinical and pathologic relevance of p53 index in canine osseous tumors. Veterinary Pathology 2003; 40:237-248</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Psychas|first=V|author2=Loukopoulos, P |author3=Polizopoulou, ZS |author4= Sofianidis, G |title=Multilobular tumour of the caudal cranium causing severe cerebral and cerebellar compression in a dog.|journal=Journal of veterinary science|date=Mar 2009|volume=10|issue=1|pages=81–3|pmid=19255529|accessdate=13 November 2012|pmc=2801101|doi=10.4142/jvs.2009.10.1.81}}</ref>

===Treatment and prognosis===
Amputation is the initial treatment, although this alone will not prevent metastasis.  [[Chemotherapy]] combined with amputation improves the survival time, but most dogs still die within a year.<ref name=Morrison_1998/> Surgical techniques designed to save the leg (limb-sparing procedures) do not improve the prognosis.  

Some current studies indicate [[osteoclast]] inhibitors such as alendronate and pamidronate may have beneficial effects on the quality of life by reducing osteolysis, thus reducing the degree of pain, as well as the risk of [[pathological fracture]]s.<ref name=Tomlin>{{cite journal|author=Tomlin|year=2000|title=Use of the bisphosphonate drug alendronate for palliative management of osteosarcoma in two dogs|journal=Vet Rec |author-separator=,|author2=J. L.|author3=Sturgeon|author4=C.|display-authors=4|author5=<Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.>}}</ref>

===Cats===
Osteosarcoma is also the most common bone tumor in cats, although not as frequently encountered, and most typically affects the rear legs.  The cancer is less aggressive in cats than in dogs, so amputation alone can lead to a significant survival time.<ref name=Morrison_1998/>

The U.S. [[Office of Management and Budget]] utilizes two definitions of the area: the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the Combined Statistical Area (CSA). The MSA definition is titled the ''New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area'', and includes a population of 19.9 million people by 2013 Census estimates<ref name=2013metroest/> (roughly 1 in 16 Americans). The MSA is further subdivided into four metropolitan divisions. The 25-county metropolitan area includes twelve counties in [[New York State]] (coinciding with the [[Borough (New York City)|five boroughs]] of New York City, the two counties of [[Long Island]], and five counties in the lower [[Hudson Valley]]); 12 counties in [[North Jersey|Northern]] and [[Central Jersey|Central]] [[New Jersey]]; and seven counties in northeastern [[Pennsylvania]]. The largest [[United States urban area|urbanized area]] in the United States is at the heart of the metropolitan area, the ''New York–Newark, NY–NJ–CT Urbanized Area'' (estimated to have an area of 6,720 square miles).

The counties and county groupings constituting the New York metropolitan area are listed below, with 2012 population estimates:

The area is frequently divided into the following regions:<ref>Geography Explained (see Change in Labor Market Areas) http://www.labor.ny.gov/stats/lsgeog.shtm</ref><ref>http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/puma/puma2k/ct_puma5.pdf</ref>
* [[New York City]] (Center of the region)
* [[Long Island]] (Nassau & Suffolk Counties, NY – separated by water from the rest of the region except New York City; not including [[Queens]] County or Kings County  ([[Brooklyn]]), which coincide with two of New York City's Five Boroughs)
* [[North Jersey]] (Northern portion of New Jersey)
* [[Central Jersey]] (Middle portion of New Jersey)
* [[Hudson Valley]] (Lower Hudson Valley suburbs of Westchester, Putnam and Rockland Counties; and Mid-Hudson [[exurb]]s of Dutchess, Orange and Ulster Counties)
* Western Connecticut (Only Fairfield, New Haven and Litchfield Counties are part of the region and separated by the state line)
* [[Lehigh Valley]] (Carbon, Lehigh, and Northampton counties in Pennsylvania and Warren County in New Jersey)
* Southern and Eastern [[Poconos]] (Monroe and Pike Counties in Pennsylvania)

All eight areas can be (and often are) further divided. For instance, Long Island can be divided into its South and North Shores (usually when speaking about Nassau County), Western Suffolk, and the East End. The Hudson Valley and Connecticut are sometimes grouped together and referred to as the Northern Suburbs, largely because of the shared usage of Metro-North Railroad.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/generalinformation.html | title=Metro-North Railroad | publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority of the State of New York | accessdate=September 27, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:WesthamptonInnerWaterway.jpg|thumb|right|[[Westhampton, New York|Westhampton]], [[Suffolk County, New York]], on the [[East End (Long Island)|East End]] of Long Island.]]
{{main|Long Island}}
Long Island, identified mostly by its more suburban [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] counties, is also home to two of New York City's boroughs: [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]].

Known especially for recreation, boating and miles of world-class public beaches, including numerous town, county and state parks and [[Fire Island National Seashore]]. Along the north shore, the [[Gold Coast, Long Island|Gold Coast of Long Island]] is an upscale section of Nassau and western Suffolk counties that once featured many lavish mansions built and inhabited by wealthy business tycoons in the earlier years of the 20th century, of which only a few remain, some preserved as historic sites. The [[East End (Long Island)|East End]] of Long Island (known as the "Twin Forks" because of its physical shape) boasts open spaces for farmland and [[winery|wineries]]. The South Fork, in particular, comprises numerous towns and villages known collectively as "[[The Hamptons]]" and has an international reputation as a "playground for the rich and famous". During the summer season, many celebrities and the wealthy visit or reside in multi-million dollar mansions and waterfront homes, while others spend weekends enjoying the beaches, attractions, bars, restaurants and nightclubs.

With a population of 7,568,304 as of the 2010 Census, Long Island is the most populated island in the United States and the [[List of islands by population|17th most populous island in the world]]. Queens is the most [[ethnic diversity|ethnically diverse]] urban area in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/queens-new-york-sightseeing-107156.html|title=Queens, New York, Sightseeing|author=Christine Kim, Demand Media|newspaper=USA TODAY|accessdate=June 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyork.com/articles/neighborhoods/queens-72876/|title=Queens|author=Andrew Weber|publisher=NewYork.com|date=April 30, 2013|accessdate=June 23, 2014}}</ref>

For transportation, it is served by a network of parkways and expressways, with the [[Long Island Expressway]] being the major east-west route to New York City. Passenger rail access is provided by the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) [[Long Island Railroad]], one of the largest commuter railroads in the United States. Air travel needs are served by several airports - most notably Farmingdale-Republic Airport (private and commuter) and Islip-MacArthur Airport (commercial airlines), both in Suffolk County. Within Queens, it is home to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] and [[LaGuardia Airport]], two of the three major airline hubs serving the New York City area (with Newark Liberty International Airport being the third; all three major airports are operated by The Port Authority of New York & New Jersey).

Northern New Jersey is typically defined as the following counties:
* [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]]
* [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]]
* [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]]
* [[Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Hunterdon County]] (anything north of [[Readington Township, New Jersey|Readington Township]])

* [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]]
* [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]] (anything north of [[Westfield, New Jersey|Westfield]])
* [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]]

The New Jersey State Department of Tourism splits North Jersey into the urban [[Gateway Region]] and the more rural [[Skylands Region]].

Northern New Jersey is home to four of the largest cities of New Jersey: [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], and [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]].

The region is geographically diverse with wetlands, mountains, and valleys throughout the area. It has a large network of [[limited-access road|expressways]] and public transportation rail services, mostly operated by [[New Jersey Transit]]. It is also home to the second busiest airport in the metropolitan area, [[Newark Liberty International Airport]].

====Lower Hudson Valley====
{{main|Hudson Valley}}
Known for its hilly terrain, picturesque settings, and quaint small towns and [[village (New York)|villages]], the Lower Hudson Valley is centered around the [[Hudson River]] north of New York City and lies within New York State. Its two most populous counties, Westchester and Rockland, are located on opposite sides of the river, connected by the heavily trafficked Tappan Zee Bridge (a major commuter route from Rockland towards New York City) as well as the Bear Mountain Bridge near their northern ends. Several branches of the MTA Metro-North Railroad serve the region's rail commuters. Southern Westchester County contains more densely populated areas and includes the cities of Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle and White Plains. Although many of the suburban communities of Westchester are known for their affluence and expense (some examples: Scarsdale, Chappaqua, Armonk, Katonah and Briarcliff Manor), the Lower Hudson Valley as a whole is one of the fastest growing areas in the metropolitan area because of high housing costs in New York City and the inner suburbs.

Historically, the valley was home to many factories, including paper mills, but a significant number have closed. After years of lingering pollution, cleanup efforts to improve the Hudson River water quality are currently planned and will be supervised by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).<ref name="EPA">{{cite web| publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency| location= New York, NY | url= http://www.epa.gov/hudson/faqs.htm | work=Hudson River PCBs| title=Frequently Asked Questions | accessdate=September 29, 2011}}</ref>

====Western Connecticut====

{{main|Fairfield County, Connecticut|New Haven County, Connecticut|Litchfield County, Connecticut}}
Fairfield, New Haven, and Litchfield Counties are located in the western portion of Connecticut with large business and [[industrial park]]s scattered throughout the area although mostly contained within Fairfield County. The three counties (and Connecticut in general) have had a long-standing reputation for affluence. Geographically, the areas are flat along the coast with low hills eventually giving way to large mountain ranges such as [[The Berkshires]] further inland. Most of the largest cities in the state are located within New Haven County (home to [[Yale University]]) and Fairfield County.

====Monroe and Pike Counties, Pennsylvania====
[[File:Dingmansfalls.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dingmans Falls]] in the [[Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area]], [[Pike County, Pennsylvania|Pike County]], northeastern Pennsylvania.]]
{{main|Monroe County, Pennsylvania}}
{{main|Pike County, Pennsylvania}}
Pike County is located in [[northeastern Pennsylvania]]. As of the 2010 Census, the population was 57,369.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/42/42103.html|title=Pike County, Pennsylvania QuickFacts|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=2012-09-11}}</ref> Its [[county seat]] is [[Milford, Pennsylvania|Milford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pikepa.org/courtadmin.html|title=Pike County, PA Court Administration|publisher=Pike County Commissioners |accessdate=2012-09-11}}</ref> Part of the [[Pocono Mountains]] region lies within Pike County, which has ranked among the fastest growing counties of Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poconorecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100625/NEWS/6250358/-1/NEWS01|title=Population pops in Pike, Monroe counties |author=David Pierce |publisher=The Pocono Record |date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2012-09-11}}</ref>

Monroe County was added to the CMSA in March 2013, as was the Lehigh Valley. Monroe's county seat is [[Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania|Stroudsburg]], and its largest borough is [[East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania|East Stroudsburg]]. Monroe and Pike are the fastest-growing counties in Pennsylvania and are home to many residents who commute to jobs in Northern New Jersey and New York City. They are located largely in the [[Pocono Mountains]] and have multiple state parks as well as most of the Pennsylvania portion of the [[Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area]]. Efforts continue to resume passenger rail service on the [[Lackawanna Cutoff]] route between [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] and Northern New Jersey via Monroe County.

====Lehigh Valley====
{{main|Carbon County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Warren County, New Jersey}}
The Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton MSA (better known as the [[Lehigh Valley]]) consists of Carbon, Lehigh, and Northampton Counties, PA and Warren County, NJ. The Pennsylvania portion alone constitutes the third-largest metropolitan area of Pennsylvania and [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] is Pennsylvania's third-largest city. The region is important for east-west transportation between Greater NYC, the [[Harrisburg metropolitan area]], and points west, both by rail and [[Interstate 78]]. It also important for north-south road traffic via [[Interstate 476]] and the [[Pennsylvania Route 33|Route 33 Expressway]]. The Lehigh Valley is in the process of major urban economic redevelopment including the Two Rivers Landing in downtown Easton, the Steel Stacks/Sands complex on the south side of Bethlehem, and a [[PPL Center|multi-purpose arena]] (which hosted its first event on 12 September 2014) in downtown Allentown. In 2010 the population was 712,481 for the PA portion and 821,173 in the MSA as a whole. While a large portion of Carbon County is in the [[Pocono Mountains]], it is also in the [[Lehigh River]] valley and the employment interchange is mainly with Lehigh and Northampton Counties.

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], using the {{convert|0|°C}} January [[isotherm]], New York City, western (and parts of eastern) Long Island, and a sliver of the Jersey Shore experience a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''),<ref name="Peel, M. C.; Finlayson, B. L.; McMahon, T. A">{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Koppen_World_Map.png|title=World Map of Köppen-Geiger climate classification|author=Peel, M.

Much of the remainder of the metropolitan area lies in the transition zone from a humid subtropical (''Cfa'') to a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa''),<ref name="Peel, M. C.; Finlayson, B. L.; McMahon, T. A"/><ref name="newyorkpolonia.com"/> and it is only the inland, more exurban areas far to the north and west such as Sussex County, New Jersey, that have a January daily average of {{convert|?3|°C|1}} or below and are fully humid continental; the ''Dfb'' (warm summer subtype) regime is only found inland at a higher elevation,<ref name="Peel, M. C.; Finlayson, B. L.; McMahon, T. A"/> and receives greater snowfall<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-snowfall-map.htm|title=united states annual snowfall map|publisher=©1998–2012 HowStuffWorks, Inc|accessdate=2012-09-03}}</ref> than the ''Dfa'' region. Carbon, Monroe, and Pike Counties in Pennsylvania also have a fully humid continental climate, as do colder areas of Lehigh and Northampton Counties.

The [[oceanic climate]] zone (''Cfb'') only exists on the [[North Fork, Suffolk County, New York|North Fork]], islands in [[Peconic Bay]], and [[Fishers Island, New York|Fishers Island]]. It is rare in eastern North America.

Winters are cold and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean; yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding by the [[Appalachians]] from colder air keep the New York area warmer in the winter than inland North American metropolitan areas located at similar or lesser latitudes including [[Pittsburgh]], [[Cincinnati]], and [[Indianapolis]]. Warm periods with {{convert|50|°F}}+ temperatures may occasionally occur during winter.<ref>{{cite web

  |accessdate=2012-09-03}}</ref> Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from chilly to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity. Summers in the area are typically hot and humid. Nighttime conditions in and around the Five Boroughs are often exacerbated by the [[urban heat island]] phenomenon, and temperatures exceed {{convert|90|°F|0}} on average of 7–8 days (on the immediate [[Long Island Sound]] and Atlantic coasts), up to in excess of 27 days (inland suburbs in New Jersey) each summer and may exceed {{convert|100|°F|0}}.<ref name=NOAA/>

Almost all of the metro area receives at least {{convert|42|in|sigfig=3}} of precipitation annually, which is fairly spread throughout the year, and many areas receive upwards of {{convert|50|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. Average winter snowfall for 1981 to 2010 ranges from just under {{convert|25|in|cm|0}} along the coast of Long Island to more than {{convert|50|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} in some inland areas, but this usually varies considerably from year to year.<ref name="Weatherbase New York, New York">{{cite web

During the [[Wisconsinan glaciation]], the region was situated at the edge of a large [[ice sheet]] over 1000 feet in depth. The ice sheet scraped away large amounts of soil, leaving bedrock. Later on, the ice sheet would help split apart what are now Long Island and Staten Island.

At the time of European contact the region was inhabited by [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native Americans]], predominantly the [[Lenape]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lenapelifeways.org/lenape1.htm |title=About the Lenapes |publisher=[Lenape Lifeways] |accessdate=2012-09-08}}</ref> and others. The Native Americans used the abundant waterways in the area for many purposes such as fishing and trade routes. Sailing for France in 1524, [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] was the first European to enter the local waters and encounter the residents, but he did not make landfall.  [[Henry Hudson]], sailing for the Dutch in 1609, visited the area and built a settlement on Lower Manhattan Island that was eventually renamed [[New Amsterdam]] by [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]] colonists in 1626.<ref name="u-s-history.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2122.html|title=United States History – History of New York City, New York|accessdate=2012-09-09}}</ref> The area came under [[Kingdom of England|English]] control in 1664<ref name="u-s-history.com"/><ref>

As the fur trade expanded north, New York became a trading hub, which brought in a diverse set of ethnic groups including [[African]]s, [[Jews]], and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]].  The island of Manhattan had an extraordinary natural harbor formed by [[New York Bay]] (actually the drowned lower river valley of the Hudson River, enclosed by [[moraine|glacial moraines]]), the [[East River]] (actually a [[strait|tidal strait]]), and the [[Hudson River]], all of which are confluent at the southern tip, from which all later development spread. During the [[American Revolution]], the strategic waterways made New York vitally important as a wartime base for the British navy. Many battles such as the [[Battle of Long Island]] and the [[Battle of New York]] were fought in the region to secure it. New York City was captured by the British early in the war, becoming a haven for [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] refugees from other parts of the country, and remained in the hands of the British until the war ended in 1783. New York served as the [[List of capitals in the United States#Former national capitals|capital of the United States]] from 1785 until 1790,<ref name=senate>

</ref> In 1792, the [[Buttonwood Agreement]], made by a group of merchants, created what is now the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in Lower Manhattan. Today, many people in the metropolitan area work in this important stock exchange.

The [[Statue of Liberty]] in [[New York Harbor]] greeted millions of [[immigration|immigrants]] as they came to America by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/statue-of-liberty|title=Statue of Liberty|publisher=1996–2011, A&E Television Networks, LLC.

A [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] attitude in the city created tolerance for various cultures and ethnic groups. German, Irish, and Italian immigrants were among the largest ethnic groups. Today, many of their descendents continue to live in the region. Cultural buildings such as the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Metropolitan Opera]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]] were built. New York newspapers were read around the country as media moguls [[James Gordon Bennett, Sr.]], [[Joseph Pulitzer]] and [[William Randolph Hearst]] battled for readership. In 1884, over 70% of exports passed through ports in New York or in one of the surrounding towns. The five [[borough (New York City)|boroughs]] of New York City — [[The Bronx]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Manhattan]], [[Queens]], and [[Staten Island]] — were consolidated into a single city in 1898.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.correctionhistory.org/html/chronicl/nycdoc/html/kbd_brnx.html|title=A 5-Borough Centennial Preface for Katharine Bement Davis Mini-History|publisher=The New York City Department of Correction |year=1997|accessdate=2012-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/neighbor/neigh.shtml|title=New York: A City of Neighborhoods|publisher=New York City Department of City Planning|accessdate=2012-09-02}}</ref>

The now-unified New York City encouraged both more physical connections between the boroughs and the growth of [[bedroom community|bedroom communities]]. The [[New York City Subway]] began operating in 1904 as the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]], one of three systems (the other two being the [[Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation]] and the [[Independent Subway System]]) that were later taken over by the city. Railroad stations such as [[Grand Central Terminal]] and [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] helped fuel suburban growth. During the era of the [[Prohibition]], when alcohol was banned nationwide, organized crime grew to supply the high demand for bootleg alcohol. The Broadway [[Theater District]] developed with the showing of the musical, [[Show Boat]].

The [[Great Depression]] suspended the region's fortunes as a period of widespread unemployment and poverty began. City planner [[Robert Moses]] began his automobile-centered career of building bridges, [[parkways]], and later [[controlled-access highway|expressways]]. During World War II, the city economy was hurt by blockades of German [[U-Boats]], which limited of shipping with Europe.

After its population peaked in 1950, much of the city's population began leaving for the suburbs. The effects were a result of [[white flight]]. Industry and commerce also declined in this era, with businesses leaving for the suburbs and other cities. Crime affected the city severely. Urban renewal projects alleviated the decay in Midtown Manhattan to a certain extent, but later failed. Blackouts such as the [[Northeast Blackout of 1965]] and the [[New York City Blackout of 1977]] caused massive rioting. A rare highlight was the completion of the former [[World Trade Center]], which once stood as the tallest buildings in the world.

In the 1980s, the city economy was booming. [[Wall Street]] was fueling an economic surge in the real estate market. Despite this, crime was still an issue. Beginning in the 1990s, however, crime dropped substantially. [[Crime in New York City]] has continued to decline through the 21st century.

[[File:Hurricane Sandy Flooding Avenue C 2012.JPG|thumb|left|A flooded [[Avenue C (Manhattan)|Avenue C]] in Manhattan just moments before the explosion at an [[electrical substation]] caused by [[Hurricane Sandy]] on October 29, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121029/east-village/video-dramatic-explosion-at-east-village-con-ed-plant |title=VIDEO: Dramatic Explosion at East Village Con Ed Plant |author=Mary Johnson |publisher=DNAinfo.com |date=2012-10-29 |accessdate=2012-11-27}}</ref>]]
A major event in the region's history was the [[September 11th attacks]] in 2001, that killed nearly 3,000 people as two planes crashed into the former World Trade Center and caused the towers to collapse. Businesses led an exodus from Lower Manhattan because of this. In 2003, another blackout occurred, the [[2003 North America blackout]], but the city suffered no looting and a building boom in New York City continues to this day.

On October 29 and 30, 2012, [[Hurricane Sandy]] caused extensive destruction in the metropolitan area, ravaging portions of the Atlantic coastline with record-high [[storm surge]], severe flooding, and high winds, causing [[power outage]]s for millions of residents via downed trees and power lines and malfunctions at [[electrical substation]]s, leading to [[gasoline]] shortages and snarling [[mass transit]] systems. Damage to New York and New Jersey in terms of [[physical infrastructure]] and [[private property]] as well as including interrupted commerce was estimated at several tens of billions of dollars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-26/bloomberg-seeks-9-8-billion-in-aid-for-nyc-s-sandy-storm-losses.html|title=Bloomberg Seeks $9.8 Billion Aid for NYC Sandy Storm Losses|author=Martin Z.

The U.S. Census Bureau first designated metropolitan areas in 1950 as [[Metropolitan Statistical Area|standard metropolitan areas]] (SMAs). The "New York–Northeastern NJ SMA" was defined to include 17 counties: 9 in New York (the five boroughs of New York City, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, and Rockland) and 8 in New Jersey (Bergen, Hudson, Passaic, Essex, Union, Morris, Somerset, and Middlesex). In 1960, the metropolitan area standards were modified and renamed standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSAs). The new standards resulted in the splitting of the former SMA into several pieces: the nine New York counties became the "New York SMSA"; three of the New Jersey counties (Essex, Union, and Morris) became the "Newark SMSA"; two other New Jersey counties (Bergen and Passaic) became the "Paterson–Passaic–Clifton SMSA"; Hudson County was designated the "Jersey City SMSA"; and Middlesex and Somerset counties lost their metropolitan status. In 1973, a new set of metropolitan area standards resulted in further changes: Nassau and Suffolk counties were split off as their own SMSA ("Nassau–Suffolk SMSA"); Bergen County (originally part of the Paterson–Clifton–Passaic SMSA) was transferred to the New York SMSA; the New York SMSA also received Putnam County (previously non-metropolitan); Somerset County was added to the Newark SMSA; and two new SMSAs, the "New Brunswick–Perth Amboy–Sayreville SMSA" (Middlesex County) and "Long Branch–Asbury Park SMSA" (Monmouth County), were established. In 1983, the concept of a consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA) was first implemented. A CMSA consisted of several primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs), which were individual employment centers within a wider [[labor market area]]. The "New York–Northern New Jersey–Long Island CMSA" consisted of 12 PMSAs. Seven PMSAs were based on the original 1950 New York SMA that were split up: New York, Bergen–Passaic, Jersey City, Middlesex–Somerset–Hunterdon (Hunterdon added for the first time), Monmouth–Ocean (Ocean added for the first time), Nassau–Suffolk, and Newark (Sussex added for the first time). One additional PMSA was the Orange County PMSA (previously the Newburgh–Middletown SMSA). The other four PMSAs were former SMSAs in Connecticut: Bridgeport, Stamford, Norwalk, and Danbury. In 1993, four PMSAs were added to the New York–Northern New Jersey–Long Island CMSA: Trenton PMSA (Mercer County), Dutchess County PMSA, Waterbury PMSA, and New Haven PMSA. Several new counties were also added to the CMSA: Sussex, Warren, and Pike. The CMSA model was originally utilized for tabulating data from the 2000 census. In 2003, a new set of standards was established using the [[core based statistical area|Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA)]] model was adopted and remains in use as of 2010. The CBSA model resulted in the splitting up of the old CMSA into several metropolitan statistical areas: New York–Northern New Jersey–Long Island, Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown, Trenton–Ewing, Bridgeport–Stamford–Norwalk (includes Danbury), and New Haven–Milford (includes Waterbury). In 2013, the Census Bureau added Carbon, Lehigh, Northampton, and Monroe counties in Pennsylvania, and Warren County, New Jersey (encompassing collectively the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ MSA and the East Stroudsburg, PA MSA), to the Combined Statistical Area,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policom.com/2013MAPS/Combined%202013.pdf|accessdate=October 28, 2013}}</ref> and assimilated Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown into the larger New York–Northern New Jersey–Long Island–NY–NJ–PA MSA.

The depth and intricacy of the transportation network in the New York City region parallel the size and complexity of the metropolis itself.

===Rail===
About one in every three users of [[mass transit]] in the United States and two-thirds of the nation's rail riders live in the New York City metropolitan area.<ref>{{cite web|title=The MTA Network: Public Transportation for the New York Region |publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority |url=http://www.mta.info/mta/network.htm |accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Commuting in America III: Commuting Facts |author=Pisarski, Alan |publisher=Transportation Research Board |date=October 16, 2006 |url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/CIAIIIfacts.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref>

The [[New York City Subway]] is the largest [[rapid transit system]] in the world when measured by stations in operation, with {{NYCS const|number|total}}, and by length of routes. In 2006 it was the third largest when measured by annual ridership (1.5&nbsp;billion passenger trips in 2006),<ref>{{cite web|title=The MTA Network: Public Transportation for the New York Region |publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority |url=http://web.mta.info/mta/network.htm |accessdate=2012-09-04}}</ref> However, in 2013, the subway delivered over 1.71 billion rides,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/transit/159176/mta--subway-ridership-at-highest-level-since-1950| title=MTA: Subway Ridership At Highest Level Since 1950| work=[[NY1]]| date=April 10, 2012| accessdate=April 11, 2012}}</ref> but slipped to being the [[Metro systems by annual passenger rides|seventh busiest rapid transit rail system]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ffsubway.htm| title=(New York City) Subways (Facts and Figures under title of Annual Subway Ridership)| work=MTA.info| date=April 2, 2013| accessdate=April 2, 2013}}</ref>  New York's subway is also notable because nearly the entire system remains open 24 hours a day, in contrast to the overnight shutdown common to systems in most cities, including [[MTR|Hong Kong]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/getting_around/service_hours.html |title=Service Hours|publisher=[[MTR]] |accessdate=2012-09-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/hongkong/transportation/metro-tsuenwan-line.htm |title=Tsuen Wan Line |publisher=TravelChinaGuide.com |accessdate=2012-09-06}}</ref> [[London Underground|London]], [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smrt.co.kr/program/Eng/Subway/Train/Station_select.jsp?main=Y|title=Train Time Table – Search station|publisher=[[Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation]]|accessdate=2012-09-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smrt.co.kr/program/cyberStation/main2.jsp?lang=e#|title=Subway map|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation|accessdate=2012-09-06}}</ref> [[Tokyo Subway|Tokyo]], and [[Toronto Subway and RT|Toronto]].

====Commuter rail====
The metropolitan area is also fundamentally defined by the areas from which people commute into New York City. The city is served by three primary [[commuter rail]] systems plus [[Amtrak]].

[[Metro-North Railroad]] (MNRR), the busiest commuter railroad in the United States (as of 2012),<ref name="ntdref" /> is operated by the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York)|Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) (an agency of [[New York]] state that focuses on New York City-area transit), in conjunction with the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]] and [[New Jersey Transit Rail Operations|New Jersey Transit]]. Its major terminal is [[Grand Central Terminal]]. Trains on the [[Port Jervis Line]] and [[Pascack Valley Line]] terminate at [[Hoboken Terminal]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]; commuters may transfer at either [[Secaucus Junction]] for New Jersey Transit trains to [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York Pennsylvania Station]] or at Hoboken Terminal for [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] trains into Manhattan.

The [[Long Island Rail Road]] (LIRR), the second busiest commuter railroad in the United States,<ref name="ntdref">[http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/article/20120126/NEWS01/301260012/Metro-North-ridership-tops-LIRR-1st-time Metro-North ridership tops LIRR for 1st time – Poughkeepsie Journal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> is also operated by the MTA.  It has two major terminals at Pennsylvania Station in [[Midtown Manhattan]] and [[Atlantic Terminal]] in [[Downtown Brooklyn]], with a minor terminal at the [[Long Island City (LIRR station)|Long Island City]] station and a major transfer point at the [[Jamaica (LIRR station)|Jamaica]] station in [[Queens]].

[[New Jersey Transit Rail Operations|New Jersey Transit]] (NJT), the third busiest commuter railroad in the United States by passenger miles and also third in trips (when direct operated and purchased transportation services are both included – fourth if only direct operated are included),<ref name="ntdref" /> is operated by the New Jersey Transit Corporation, an agency of the state of New Jersey, in conjunction with Metro-North Railroad and Amtrak. A map of the system can be found here [http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/rail/Rail_System_Map.pdf]. It has major terminals at Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, Hoboken Terminal, and [[Pennsylvania Station (Newark)|Newark Pennsylvania Station]], with a major transfer point at [[Secaucus Junction]] in [[Hudson County, New Jersey]]. New Jersey Transit also operates the [[Hudson–Bergen Light Rail]] through Hudson County, the [[Newark City Subway]], and the [[River Line (New Jersey Transit)|River Line]] that runs along tracks shared with [[Conrail Shared Assets Operations]] from Trenton to [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] in [[southern New Jersey]]. NJ Transit also has commuter buses operating in and out of Manhattan.

Amtrak's [[Northeast Corridor]] offers service to [[Philadelphia]], New Haven, and other points between and including [[Boston]] and [[Washington, D.C]]. Additionally, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], an agency controlled by the states of New York and New Jersey, operates the PATH system; this heavy rail transportation service links Manhattan in New York and the counties of Hudson and Essex in New Jersey. A map can be found here [http://www.panynj.gov/path/maps.html].

===Media===
{{Main|Media in New York City}}
The New York City metropolitan area is home to the headquarters of several well-known media companies, subsidiaries, and publications, including [[Thomson Reuters]], [[The New York Times Company]], the [[Associated Press]], [[Time Warner]], [[NBCUniversal]], the [[Hearst Corporation]], [[Viacom]], [[News Corporation]], [[The Wall Street Journal]], [[Fox News]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], and [[NBC]]. Local television channels include [[WCBS-TV]] 2 (CBS), [[WNBC]] 4 (NBC), [[WNYW]] 5 (FOX), [[WABC-TV]] 7 (ABC), [[WWOR-TV]] 9 (MyNetworkTV), [[WPIX]] 11 (CW), [[WNET]] 13 (PBS), [[WNYE-TV]] 25 (NYC Media) and [[WPXN-TV]] 31 ([[Ion Television|Ion]]). [[NY1]] is a 24/7 local news provider available only to [[cable television]] subscribers. Radio stations serving the area include: [[WNYC]], [[WFMU]], [[WABC-AM]], and [[WFAN]]. Many television and radio stations use the top of the [[Empire State Building]] to broadcast their [[terrestrial television]] signals, while some media entities broadcast from studios in [[Times Square]].

The New York metropolitan area is extensive enough so that its own channels must compete with channels from neighboring television markets (including Philadelphia, [[Wyoming Valley|Scranton/Wilkes-Barre]], and Hartford) within its outlying counties. Cable companies offer such competition in the Pennsylvania portion, Connecticut, and a few counties in central New Jersey.

The '''patella''' ({{IPAc-en|p|?|'|t|?|l|?|}}), also known as the '''kneecap''' or '''kneepan''', is a thick, circular-triangular [[bone]] which articulates with the [[femur]] (thigh bone) and covers and protects the anterior articular surface of the [[knee joint]]. The patella appears in the majority of [[vertebrate]]s with a femur, for example [[mouse|mice]], [[cat]]s, and [[bird]]s, but not [[whale]]s or most reptiles and amphibians such as [[snake]]s or [[frog]]s.

In humans, the patella is the largest [[sesamoid bone]] in the body. Babies are born with a patella of soft cartilage which begins to ossify into bone at about three years of age.

== Structure ==
[[File:Patella ant.jpg|thumb|Human left patella - anterior aspect]]
The patella is roughly triangular in shape with its base facing proximally (towards the torso) and its tip (''apex patellae'') facing distally (towards the feet).  Its anterior and posterior surfaces are joined laterally (left/right) by a thinner margin and medially (towards centre) by a thicker margin.<ref name="Platzer-194">{{cite book

}}</ref><!-- ref for section -->

=== Anterior surface ===
The anterior surface can be divided into three parts:<ref name="Platzer-194" /><!-- ref for section -->
# The upper third is coarse, flattened, and rough; it serves for the attachment of the tendon of the quadriceps and often has [[Exostosis|exostoses]].
# The middle third has numerous [[vascular]] [[Canaliculus (bone)|canaliculi]].
# The lower third includes the distal apex which serves as the origin of the [[patellar ligament]].

=== Posterior surface ===
[[File:Patella post.jpg|thumb|Human left patella - posterior aspect]]
The posterior surface is divided into two parts.<ref name="Platzer-194" /><!-- ref for section -->

The upper three-quarters articulates with the femur and is subdivided into a medial and a lateral facet by a vertical ledge which varies in shape.  Four main types of articular surface can be distinguished:
# Most commonly the medial articular surface is smaller than the lateral.
# Sometimes both articular surfaces are virtually equal in size.
# Occasionally, the medial surface is [[Hypoplasia|hypoplastic]] or
# the central ledge is only indicated.
In the adult the articular surface is about {{convert|12|cm2|sqin|abbr=on}} and covered by [[cartilage]], which can reach a maximal thickness of {{convert|6|mm|in|abbr=on}} in the centre at about 30 years of age.

The lower part of the posterior surface has vascular canaliculi filled and is filled by fatty tissue, the [[infrapatellar fat pad]].

=== Muscles ===
It is attached to the [[tendon]] of the [[quadriceps]] femoris muscle, which contracts to extend/straighten the [[knee]]. The [[vastus intermedius]] muscle is attached to the base of patella. The [[vastus lateralis]] and [[vastus medialis]] are attached to lateral and medial borders of patella respectively.

The patella is stabilized by the insertion of the horizontal fibres of vastus medialis and by the prominence of the lateral femoral condyle, which discourages lateral dislocation during flexion. The retinacular fibres of the patella also stabilize it during exercise.

===Variation===
Emarginations (i.e. ''patella emarginata'', a "missing piece") are common laterally on the proximal edge.<ref name="Platzer-194" /><!-- ref for section --> [[Bipartite patella]]s are the result of an ossification of a second [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] layer at the location of an emargination.  Previously, bipartite patellas were explained as the failure of several ossification centres to fuse, but this idea has been rejected.  Partite patellas occur almost exclusively in men.  Tripartite and even multipartite patellas occur.

=== Development===
In the patella an [[ossification]] centre develops between the ages 3–6 years.<ref name="Platzer-194" />

== Function ==
The primary functional role of the patella is knee extension. The patella increases the [[lever]]age that the tendon can exert on the femur by increasing the angle at which it acts.

==Clinical significance==
===Dislocation===
{{Main|Patellar dislocation}}
[[Patellar dislocation]]s occur with significant regularity, particular in young female athletes.<ref name=palmu2008>{{cite journal | last1 = Palmu | first1 = S. | last2 = Kallio | first2 = P.E. | last3 = Donell | first3 = S.T. | last4 = Helenius | first4 = I. | last5 = Nietosvaara | first5 = Y. | year = 2008 | title = Acute patellar dislocation in children and adolescents: A randomized clinical trial | url = | journal = Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery | volume = 90 | issue = 3| pages = 463–470 | doi = 10.2106/JBJS.G.00072 | pmid = 18310694 }}</ref> It involves the patella sliding out of its position on the knee, most often laterally, and may be associated with extremely intense pain and swelling.<ref name=dath2006>{{cite journal | last1 = Dath | first1 = R. | last2 = Chakravarthy | first2 = J. | last3 = Porter | first3 = K.M. | year = 2006 | title = Patella Dislocations | url = | journal = Trauma | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 5–11 | doi = 10.1191/1460408606ta353ra }}</ref> The patella can be tracked back into the groove with an extension of the leg, and therefore sometimes returns into the proper position on its own.<ref name=dath2006/>

==History==
The etymology of patella presents an interesting case of convergent [[etymology]].  In the Western world, 'patella' originated in the late 17th century from the [[diminutive]] form of [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|patina}}'', meaning shallow dish.<ref>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=patella</ref>  The use of this term in Eastern medicine, however, predates the Western etymology.  As early as the 13th century, traditional [[Ayurveda]] practitioners in the Indian subcontinent referred to the kneecap as ''pa??la ha???'' ({{lang-hi|???? ?????}}), literally 'farmer's bone' because the grueling life of a [[patidar]].  The term was subsequently shortened to just 'patela'. During the [[British Raj]] period, Western medicine was introduced to India, and the two etymologies converged into the modern medical use, with two 'L's.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

'''Slope Point''' is the southernmost point of the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]]. 

Slope Point lies just south of the small settlements of [[Waikawa, Southland|Waikawa]] and Haldane, near the southwestern edge of [[the Catlins]] and [[Toetoes Bay]] and 70&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi) east of [[Invercargill]].

The land around Slope Point is used for [[sheep farming]] with no houses anywhere nearby. [[Erosion|Eroded]] cliffs drop down to the sea below. An [[New Zealand Automobile Association|AA]] signpost there shows the distance to the [[Equator]] and the [[South Pole]], and a small [[solar power|solar-power]]ed [[lighthouse]] stands on farmland.

There is no road to Slope Point; it must be reached by a 20-minute walk following dilapidated yellow markers. There is no public access during the lambing season (September &ndash; November).

'''Antonio Cervantes''' aka '''Kid Pambelé''' (born December 23, 1945 in [[San Basilio de Palenque]], [[Bolívar Department|Bolívar]]) is a [[Colombia]]n [[boxing]] trainer and former two time world Jr. Welterweight champion. He successfully defended the title 16 times. Cervantes fought 21 world title fights, keeping the 140 pounds title for almost 8 years.<ref>http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=009005&cat=boxer</ref> Cervantes, who is [[Afro-Colombian]], was born in Palenque, also known as the first site of a [[slave rebellion]] in the [[Americas]]. Cervantes used to sell contraband cigarettes and shine shoes as a child to survive.

He met boxing trainer [[Carmelo Prada]], who helped shape his style. Cervantes only had three amateur bouts, winning two and losing one. On January 31, 1964, Cervantes entered the boxing ring as a professional for the first time, beating [[Juan Martínez (boxer)|Juan Martínez]] by decision in six rounds. His first 32 bouts as a professional were in Colombia, and he won 27, lost 4 and drew (tied) one of them. Realizing his pupil needed publicity outside Colombia, Prada then moved with Cervantes to [[Venezuela]], where, on November 25, 1968, he [[knockout|knocked out]] [[Orlando Ruiz]] in the first round for his first fight abroad. He followed that win with a ten rounds decision over [[Nestor Rojas]] in the very short time of only three days later.

On December 23 of that year, he suffered his first knockout defeat when [[Cruz Marcano]], a fringe contender of the time, beat him in four rounds in [[Caracas]].

He won five and lost two in 1969, splitting his fights between Colombia and Venezuela, and losing a ten round decision to [[Antonio Gomez]], former world champion.

He won two more in 1970, then he and Prada moved once again, this time to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. In [[California]], he began by beating [[Jose Rodriguez]]{{disambiguation needed|date=June 2012}} by a knockout in the first round in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], and on December 17, he beat [[Rodolfo Gato González]], a very famous [[Mexican people|Mexican]] boxer of the time, by knockout in round eight. After this and a 1971 win over [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Enrique Jana]], Cervantes was ranked as a Jr. Welterweight by the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]]. On December 11 of that year, he had his first world title try, against [[Nicolino Locche]], in [[Buenos Aires]]. Cervantes lost a 15 round decision that time, however.

After winning three fights in 1972, Cervantes, who had by then returned to Colombia, had another world title try: [[Alfonso 'Peppermint' Frazer]], who had dethroned Locche of the world title, gave Cervantes a chance on October 28 at [[Panama City, Panama|Panama City]]. Cervantes knocked Frazer out in round ten and became world champion for the first time. 

Cervantes immediately became a national hero in Colombia, and many enterprises made him their spokesman in the coffee producing country, most notably [[Sanyo]], whose name the popular champion advertised on his clothing and fight trunks (boxer's shorts).

Cervantes made nine defenses, including a knockout in nine of Locche in a rematch, a knockout in five of Frazer, also in a rematch, a 13th. round knockout win over [[Josue Marquez]] in [[Puerto Rico]] (in the first world title bout ever held at [[Roberto Clemente Coliseum]]) and a 15 round decision against future world Lightweight champion [[Esteban De Jesús]]. But on March 6, 1976 at [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], he lost a 15 round decision and the world title to 17 year old [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[Wilfred Benítez]], who with that became boxing's youngest champion ever.

Cervantes won five more fights in a row, including a win over [[Saoul Mamby]], before fighting for the world title again. After Benitez had left the Jr. welterweight belt vacant, Cervantes regained it on June 25, 1977, with a five round knockout over [[Carlos Maria Gimenez]], once again in Venezuela. His second reign as world champion took him to such places as [[Thailand]], [[Botswana]] and [[South Korea]], among others. He retained the title six times, beating the likes of [[Adrian Marrero]] and [[Miguel Montilla]] (twice). By this time, there was much talk about a ''superfight'' with world Lightweight champion [[Roberto Durán]], who was coming up in weight. Duran decided to challenge [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] instead, however, and Cervantes vs. Duran never materialized.

On August 2, 1980, Cervantes dropped his next title challenger, [[Aaron Pryor]], to the canvas in the first round. Pryor recovered, however, and beat Cervantes by a knockout in round four. This turned out to be Cervantes' last world title fight. He fought two times more for the FECARBOX WBC title, winning both fights shortly before retiring in 1980.

However, Cervantes came out of retirement due to financial problems and went on boxing until 1983, winning four fights and dropping his last one, a ten round decision loss to [[Danny Sanchez]] on December 9, 1983 at [[Miami, Florida|Miami]].

In retirement, his life was almost as public as it was during his boxing career: In 1985, for example, he and a female passenger in one of the boats Cervantes owned, suffered a water accident, and the passenger almost drowned, but Cervantes was able to save her life. A movie has been made about a fictional boxer called Milton Ollivera (who comes from Colombia) who goes through a majority of the things Cervantes went through throughout his life.

Cervantes was inducted into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] in 1998, and in 2000, he was declared by the ''Colombian Boxing Federation and National Association of Professional Boxing'' as Colombia's ''Fighter of the Century''. For that award, the WBA issued him a special, commemorative belt.

Cervantes' nickname, ''Kid Pambelé'', became almost as famous as Cervantes himself: as a matter of a fact, many fans called him only ''Pambelé'' or ''Pambe'' (the name of a song by [[Carlos Vives]] about him).

'''''Trachodon''''' (meaning "rough tooth") is a [[nomen dubium|dubious]] [[genus]] of [[hadrosaurid]] [[dinosaur]] based on [[teeth]] from the [[Campanian]]-age [[Upper Cretaceous]] [[Judith River Formation]] of [[Montana]], [[U.S.A.]]<ref name =JL56>Leidy, J. (1856). "Notice of remains of extinct reptiles and fishes, discovered by Dr. F. V. Hayden in the Bad Lands of the Judith River, Nebraska Territories." ''Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Science Philadelphia'', '''8'''(March 25): 72-73.</ref> It is a historically important genus with a convoluted [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] that has been all but abandoned by modern dinosaur [[paleontologist]]s.<ref name=BC07>Creisler, B.S. (2007). Deciphering duckbills. in: K. Carpenter (ed.), ''Horns and Beaks: Ceratopsian and Ornithopod Dinosaurs''. Indiana University Press: Bloomington and Indianapolis, 185-210. ISBN 0-253-34817-X</ref>

Despite being used for decades as the iconic [[Hadrosaurid|duckbill]] dinosaur per [[antonomasia]] the material it is based on is composed of teeth from both duckbills and [[ceratopsid]]s (their teeth have a distinctive double root<ref name=HML07>Hatcher, J.B., Marsh, O.C. and Lull, R.S. (1907). ''The Ceratopsia''. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 300 pp. ISBN 0-405-12713-8</ref>), and its describer, [[Joseph Leidy]], came to recognize the difference and suggested limiting the genus to what would now be seen as ceratopsid teeth.<ref name=BC07/> Restricted to the duckbill teeth, it may have been a [[Lambeosaurinae|lambeosaurine]].<ref name=CMS36>Sternberg, C.M. (1936). The systematic position of ''Trachodon''. ''Journal of Paleontology'' 10(7):652-655.</ref>

==History and classification==
In 1856, Joseph Leidy received fragmentary remains from the Judith River Formation, collected by [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden]].  From these bones, he provided the first names for [[North America]]n dinosaurs: ''[[Deinodon]]'', ''[[Palaeoscincus]]'', ''Trachodon'', and ''[[Troodon]]'' (then spelled ''Troödon''), the latter being the only name still in use.<ref name=JL56/><ref name="dodson2009">{{cite journal|first=Peter |last=Dodson |title=Dinosaurs in America – Joseph Leidy & the Academy of Natural Sciences | journal=American Paleontologist |volume=17 |number=2 |year=2009| page=32}}</ref> The [[type species]] of ''Trachodon'' is ''T. mirabilis''. The generic name is derived from Greek ??????, ''trakhys'', "rough", and ????, ''odon'', "tooth", referring to the granulate inner surface of one of the teeth. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] means "marvelous" in [[Latin]].

''Trachodon'' was based on ANSP 9260, seven unassociated teeth, one of which had double roots.  With better remains from ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'', he began to reconsider his taxonomy, and suggested, at least informally, that ''Trachodon'' should refer to the double-rooted tooth, and the other teeth should be referred to ''Hadrosaurus''.<ref name=JL68>Leidy, J. (1868). Remarks on a jaw fragment of ''Megalosaurus''. ''Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Science Philadelphia'' 20:197-200.</ref> In the [[Bone Wars]] that followed, and their wake, the taxonomy of ''Trachodon'' and its relatives became increasingly confusing,<ref name=BC07/> with one author going so far as to sink all known hadrosaur species into ''Trachodon'' except for ''[[Claosaurus agilis]]'',<ref name=JBH02>Hatcher, J.B. (1902). The genus and species of the Trachodontidae (Hadrosauridae, Claosauridae) Marsh. ''Annals of the Carnegie Museum'' 14(1):377-386.</ref> but as new material was described from the [[Rocky Mountain]] region, [[Alberta]], and [[Saskatchewan]], later authors began progressively restricting the reach of this genus.<ref name=CMS36/><ref name=CWG15>Gilmore, C.W. (1915). On the genus ''Trachodon''. ''Science'' 41:658-660.</ref>

By 1942, and the publication of the influential Lull-Wright [[monograph]] on duckbills, its [[holotype]] was regarded as "typical of all the genera of hadrosaurian dinosaur", except for the roughened margin that gave it its name, and that they regarded as due to the tooth having not been used (p.&nbsp;149).<ref name=LW42>Lull, R.S., and Wright, N.E.

In 1936, paleontologist Charles Sternberg compared the holotype teeth of ''Trachodon mirabilis'' to those of more completely known hadrosaurids and noted that they were most similar to those of lambeosaurines.<ref name=CMS36/> It has been reported that paleontologist [[John R. Horner]] also found that ''Trachodon'' teeth compare well with the teeth of lambeosaurines, specifically ''[[Corythosaurus]]'', though they also share similarities with the genus ''[[Prosaurolophus]]''.<ref name=olshevsky1997>Olshevsky, G.

The '''Georgia Northeastern Railroad''' {{reporting mark|GNRR}} is a [[short-line railroad|short line]] [[freight]] [[railroad]] which runs from the town of [[Elizabeth, Georgia]] (now within [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]], northwest of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]) to the city of [[Blue Ridge, Georgia]].  Goods hauled are mostly [[timber]], [[cereal|grain]], [[poultry]], and [[marble]] products.  The GNRR's [[subsidiary]], the [[Blue Ridge Scenic Railway]], also operates on this line north of Blue Ridge.  Despite the name, it actually operates between north-central and [[northwest Georgia]], from north-northwest [[metro Atlanta]], and is a few [[counties in Georgia|counties]] away from [[northeast Georgia]].

Purchased from [[CSX]], the line [[interconnect]]s with the [[Western & Atlantic]] subdivision of CSX at '''Elizabeth Yard''' in Marietta at [[milepost]] 22.0 ({{coord|33|58|29|N|84|33|25|W|display=inline,title|name=Elizabeth Yard, Georgia Northeastern Railroad}}), located {{convert|22|mi|km|0}} from [[downtown Atlanta]].  GNRR tracks include a long [[rail siding]] along the east side of the triple CSX tracks, from just north of [[Kennesaw]] Avenue, over Tower Road, to just north of Loudermilk Drive, where it rejoins what becomes the main northbound CSX track.  The main GNRR track splits from the GNRR siding at a [[rail switch]] just north of Tower Road, and parallels the other tracks to just before Marr Avenue, before a sharp turn to the east.  Between Marr, Loudermilk, the GNRR siding, and GNRR mainline, there are two dead-end sidings extending north on the east side of the GNRR office, and one of those has another dead-end siding extending north on the west side of the office.

==Communities==
Counties and communities served by the line are as follows, from north to south (major towns in bold):
*[[Fannin County, Georgia|Fannin]]:
**'''[[Blue Ridge, Georgia|Blue Ridge]]'''  ''(new)''
*[[Gilmer County, Georgia|Gilmer]]:
**[[Cherry Log, Georgia|Cherry Log]] ''(new)''
**'''[[Ellijay, Georgia|Ellijay]]'''
*[[Pickens County, Georgia|Pickens]]:
**[[Whitestone, Georgia|Whitestone]]
**'''[[Jasper, Georgia|Jasper]]'''
**[[Tate, Georgia|Tate]]
*[[Cherokee County, Georgia|Cherokee]]:
**[[Ball Ground, Georgia|Ball Ground]]
**[[Keithsburg, Georgia|Keithsburg]]
**'''[[Canton, Georgia|Canton]]'''
**[[Holly Springs, Georgia|Holly Springs]]
**[[Lebanon, Georgia|Lebanon]]
**'''[[Woodstock, Georgia|Woodstock]]'''
*[[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb]]:
**[[Noonday, Georgia|Noonday]]
**[[Blackwells, Georgia|Blackwells]]
**[[Westoak, Georgia|Westoak]]
**[[Elizabeth, Georgia|Elizabeth]], within '''[[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]]'''

==History==
The route has had several names since it was [[charter]]ed in 1854:
*[[Ellijay Railroad]], changing name to
*[[Marietta, Canton and Ellijay Railroad]], changing name to
*[[Marietta and North Georgia Railroad]], changing name to
*[[Atlanta, Knoxville and Northern Railroad]], later purchased by
*[[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]], later sold to
*[[CSX Transportation]], then sold to GNRR.

==Commuter rail==
At least one [[proposal (business)|proposal]] is also considering using the line for [[commuter rail]] on the lower part of the route, from Canton to Marietta, and possibly along the [[CSX]] main route down to Atlanta.  Canton, Marietta, and Cobb County put together $40,000 for a study, a [[draft document|draft]] of which says that it would cost $97 million to upgrade the old [[rail track]]s and add [[passenger]] [[train station]]s, [[train]] cars and [[locomotive]]s.  Another $1.8 million would be needed annually above the intake of [[fare]]s.  

The line would be 22 miles or 35 kilometers long from Canton to Elizabeth, where riders could [[transfer (public transit)|transfer]] to [[Cobb Community Transit]] buses.  The draft study [[Guesstimate|estimates]] about 300 people per day would initially ride if it were already in place (600 if it went to Atlanta), and about 1700 would ride in 20 years.

The study urges local governments (Cobb and Cherokee counties, and the cities of Marietta, Woodstock, Holly Springs, and Canton) to preserve any areas where a [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] may be necessary, allow no new [[grade crossing]]s of [[road]]s, and prevent [[land development]] too close to the line (so that new residents cannot complain about it, though it has been there since the 1890s).

The [[Transport corridor|corridor]] may be in addition to [[GRTA]] [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority|Xpress]] or even CCT [[bus]]es on the [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] [[Interstate 575]], which is scheduled to get new [[HOV lane]]s soon.

'''Aristotelianism''' ({{IPAc-en|?|ær|?|s|t|?|?|t|i?|l|i|?|n|?|z|?m}} {{respell|ARR|i-st?|TEE|li-?-niz-?m}}) is a [[Tradition#Philosophical tradition|tradition]] of [[philosophy]] that takes its defining inspiration from the work of [[Aristotle]]. The works of Aristotle were initially defended by the members of the [[Peripatetic school]], and, later on, by the [[Neoplatonists]], who produced many [[Commentaries on Aristotle|commentaries on Aristotle's writings]]. In the Islamic world, the works of Aristotle were translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and under philosophers such as [[Al-Kindi]], [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]], Aristotelianism became a major part of [[early Islamic philosophy]]. 

Moses Maimonides adopted Aristotelianism from the Islamic scholars and based his famous [[Guide for the Perplexed]] on it; and that became the basis of Jewish Scholastic Philosophy. Although some knowledge of Aristotle's logical works was known to western Europe, it wasn't until the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]] that the works of Aristotle and his Arabic commentators became widely available. Scholars such as [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] interpreted and systematized Aristotle's works in accordance with [[Christian theology]].

After retreating under criticism from modern natural philosophers, the distinctively Aristotelian idea of [[teleology]] was transmitted through [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to [[Hegel]], who applied it to history as a totality. Although this project was criticized by [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg|Trendelenburg]] and [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] as non-Aristotelian, Hegel's influence is now often said to be responsible for an important Aristotelian influence upon [[Marx]]. Postmodernists, in contrast, reject Aristotelianism's claim to reveal important theoretical truths. In this, they follow [[Heidegger]]'s critique of Aristotle as the greatest source of the entire tradition of Western philosophy.

Recent Aristotelian ethical and 'practical' philosophy, such as that of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] and [[John McDowell|McDowell]], is often premissed upon a rejection of Aristotelianism's traditional metaphysical or theoretical philosophy. From this viewpoint, the early modern tradition of political [[republicanism]], which views the ''res publica'', public sphere or state as constituted by its citizens' virtuous activity, can appear thoroughly Aristotelian.

The most famous contemporary Aristotelian philosopher is [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]. Especially famous for helping to revive [[virtue ethics]] in his book ''[[After Virtue]]'', MacIntyre revises Aristotelianism with the argument that the highest temporal goods, which are internal to human beings, are actualized through participation in social practices. He opposes Aristotelianism to the managerial institutions of capitalism and its state, and to rival traditions - including the philosophies of [[David Hume|Hume]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] - that reject its idea of essentially human goods and virtues and instead legitimate capitalism. Therefore, on MacIntyre's account, Aristotelianism is not identical with Western philosophy as a whole; rather, it is "the best theory so far, [including] the best theory so far about what makes a particular theory the best one." Politically and socially, it has been characterized as a newly 'revolutionary Aristotelianism'. This may be contrasted with the more conventional, apolitical and effectively conservative uses of Aristotle by, for example, Gadamer and McDowell. Other important contemporary Aristotelian theorists include Fred D. Miller, Jr. in politics and Rosalind Hursthouse in ethics.

==History==

===Ancient Greece===
{{Main|Peripatetic school}}
The original followers of Aristotle were the members of the [[Peripatetic school]]. The most prominent members of the school after Aristotle were [[Theophrastus]] and [[Strato of Lampsacus]], who both continued Aristotle's researches. During the [[Roman era]] the school concentrated on preserving and defending his work.<ref>Furley, David (2003), ''From Aristotle to Augustine: Routledge History of Philosophy'', 2, Routledge</ref> The most important figure in this regard was [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] who commentated on Aristotle's writings. With the rise of [[Neoplatonism]] in the 3rd century, Peripateticism as an independent philosophy came to an end, but the Neoplatonists sought to incorporate Aristotle's philosophy within their own system, and produced many [[commentaries on Aristotle]].

===Islamic world===
In the [[Abbasid Empire]], many foreign works were translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], large libraries were constructed, and scholars were welcomed.<ref name="Wiet-Baghdad">[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/wiet.html Gaston Wiet, ''Baghdad: Metropolis of the Abbasid Caliphate''] Retrieved 2010-04-16</ref> Under the [[caliphs]] [[Harun al-Rashid]] and his son [[Al-Ma'mun]], the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]] flourished. Christian scholar [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] (809–873) was placed in charge of the translation work by the caliph. In his lifetime, Ishaq translated 116 writings, including works by Plato and Aristotle, into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and Arabic.<ref name="Opth">Opth: Azmi, Khurshid. "Hunain bin Ishaq on Ophthalmic Surgery." Bulletin of the Indian Institute of History of Medicine 26 (1996): 69–74. Web. 29 Oct. 2009</ref><ref name="Lindberg">Lindberg, David C. The Beginnings of Western Science: Islamic Science. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago]], 2007. Print.</ref> [[Al-Kindi]] (801–873) was the first of the Muslim [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosophers, and is known for his efforts to introduce [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]] to the [[Arab world]].<ref>Klein-Frank, F. ''Al-Kindi''. In Leaman, O & Nasr, H (2001). ''History of Islamic Philosophy''. London: Routledge. p 165</ref> He incorporated Aristotelian and Neoplatonist thought into an Islamic philosophical framework. This was an important factor in the introduction and popularization of Greek philosophy in the Muslim intellectual world.<ref>Felix Klein-Frank (2001) ''Al-Kindi'', pages 166–167. In Oliver Leaman & Hossein Nasr. ''History of Islamic Philosophy''. London: Routledge.</ref>

The philosopher [[Al-Farabi]] (872–950) had great influence on science and philosophy for several centuries, and in his time was widely thought second only to Aristotle in knowledge (alluded to by his title of "the Second Teacher"). His work, aimed at synthesis of philosophy and [[Sufism]], paved the way for the work of [[Avicenna]] (980–1037).<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.iep.utm.edu/avicenna/| title =Avicenna (Ibn Sina) (c.980–1037)| accessdate =2007-07-13 | publisher =The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> Avicenna was one of the main interpreters of Aristotle.<ref name="Avicenna Abu Ali Sina">{{cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/Museum/avicen.html |title=Avicenna (Abu Ali Sina) |publisher=Sjsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100111184611/http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/Museum/avicen.html| archivedate= 11 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The school of thought he founded became known as [[Avicennism]], which was built on ingredients and conceptual building blocks that are largely Aristotelian and Neoplatonist.<ref name="Iranica">{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= | authorlink= |title=Avicenna |year=| encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica |accessdate=2010-04-14|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-iv}}</ref>

At the western end of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], during the reign of [[Al-Hakam II]] (961 to 976) in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], a massive translation effort was undertaken, and many books were translated into Arabic. [[Averroes]] (1126–1198), who spent much of his life in Cordoba and [[Seville]], was especially distinguished as a commentator of Aristotle. He often wrote two or three different commentaries on the same work, and some 38 commentaries by Averroes on the works of Aristotle have been identified.<ref name="grant30">Edward Grant, (1996), ''The foundations of modern science in the Middle Ages'', page 30. Cambridge University Press</ref> Although his writings had only marginal impact in Islamic countries, his works would eventually have a huge impact in the [[Latin West]],<ref name="grant30"/> and would lead to the school of thought known as [[Averroism]].

===Europe===
Although some knowledge of Aristotle seems to have lingered on in the ecclesiastical centres of western Europe after the fall of the Roman empire, by the ninth century nearly all that was known of Aristotle consisted of [[Boethius]]'s commentaries on the ''[[Organon]]'', and a few abridgments made by Latin authors of the declining empire, [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Martianus Capella]].<ref name="schmolders">Auguste Schmolders, ''History of Arabian Philosophy'' in ''The eclectic magazine of foreign literature, science, and art'', Volume 46. February 1859</ref> From that time until the end of the eleventh century, little progress is apparent in Aristotelian knowledge.<ref name="schmolders"/>

The [[renaissance of the 12th century]] saw a major search by European scholars for new learning. [[James of Venice]], who probably spent some years in [[Constantinople]], translated Aristotle's ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' from Greek into [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] in the mid-twelfth century,<ref>L.D. Reynolds and Nigel G. Wilson, ''Scribes and Scholars,'' Oxford, 1974, p. 106.</ref> thus making the complete Aristotelian logical corpus, the ''Organon'', available in Latin for the first time. Scholars travelled to areas of Europe that once had been under Muslim rule and still had substantial Arabic-speaking populations. From central [[Spain]], which had come under Christian rule in the eleventh century, scholars produced many of the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]]. The most productive of these translators was [[Gerard of Cremona]],<ref>C. H. Haskins, ''Renaissance of the Twelfth Century,'' p. 287. "more of Arabic science passed into Western Europe at the hands of Gerard of Cremona than in any other way."</ref> (c. 1114–1187), who translated 87 books,<ref>For a list of Gerard of Cremona's translations see: Edward Grant (1974) ''A Source Book in Medieval Science'', (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Pr.), pp. 35–8 or Charles Burnett, "The Coherence of the Arabic-Latin Translation Program in Toledo in the Twelfth Century," ''Science in Context'', 14 (2001): at 249-288, at pp. 275–281.</ref> which included many of the works of [[Aristotle]] such as his ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[On the Heavens]]'', ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'', and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''. [[Michael Scot]] (c. 1175–1232) translated  [[Averroes]]' commentaries on the scientific works of [[Aristotle]].<ref>{{BBKL|m/michael_sco|band=5|autor=Christoph Kann|artikel=Michael Scotus|spalten=1459–1461}}</ref>

Aristotle's physical writings began to be discussed openly, and at a time when Aristotle's method was permeating all theology, these treatises were sufficient to cause his prohibition for [[heterodoxy]] in the [[Condemnations of 1210–1277]].<ref name="schmolders"/> In the first of these, in [[Paris]] in 1210, it was stated that "neither the books of Aristotle on natural philosophy or their commentaries are to be read at Paris in public or secret, and this we forbid under penalty of [[excommunication]]."<ref name="Grant42">Edward Grant, ''A Source Book in Medieval Science'', page 42 (1974). Harvard University Press</ref> However, despite further attempts to restrict the teaching of Aristotle, by 1270 the ban on Aristotle's natural philosophy was ineffective.<ref>Rubenstein, Richard E. ''Aristotle's Children: How Christians, Muslims, and Jews Rediscovered Ancient Wisdom and Illuminated the Middle Ages'', page 215 (2004). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</ref>

[[William of Moerbeke]] (c. 1215–1286) undertook a complete translation of the works of Aristotle or, for some portions, a revision of existing translations. He was the first translator of the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (c. 1260) from Greek into Latin. Many copies of Aristotle in Latin then in circulation were assumed to have been influenced by Averroes, who was suspected of being a source of philosophical and theological errors found in the earlier translations of Aristotle. Such claims were without merit, however, as the ''Alexandrian'' Aristotelianism of Averroes followed "the strict study of the text of Aristotle, which was introduced by Avicenna, [because] a large amount of traditional [[Neoplatonism]] was incorporated with the body of traditional Aristotelianism".<ref name="Schmolders1842">{{cite book |last=Schmölders |first=Auguste |editor1-last=Telford |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Barber |editor2-first=Benjamin Aquila |editor3-last=Watkinson |editor3-first=William Lonsdale |editor4-last=Davison |editor-first4=William Theophilus |title=The London Quarterly Review |volume=11 |year=1859 |publisher=J.A.

In no material point did they differ from their master, and, therefore, an exposition of their doctrines would be useless to those who know anything of the history of philosophy; but, before the strict study of the text of Aristotle, which was introduced by Avicenna, a large amount of traditional Neo-Platonism was incorporated with the body of traditional Aristotelianism, so as to take them sometimes far astray from their master's track.}}</ref>  [[Albertus Magnus]] (c. 1200–1280) was among the first among medieval scholars to apply Aristotle's philosophy to Christian thought. He produced paraphrases of most of the works of Aristotle available to him.<ref name="sep-albert">{{sep entry|albert-great|Albert the Great|Markus Fhrer}}</ref> He digested, interpreted and systematized the whole of Aristotle's works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine. His efforts resulted in the formation of a Christian reception of Aristotle in the Western Europe.<ref name="sep-albert"/> [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274), the pupil of Albertus Magnus, wrote a dozen commentaries on the works of Aristotle.<ref name="sep-thomas">{{sep entry|aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas|Ralph McInerny}}</ref> Thomas was emphatically Aristotelian, he adopted Aristotle's analysis of physical objects, his view of place, time and motion, his proof of the prime mover, his cosmology, his account of sense perception and intellectual knowledge, and even parts of his [[Aristotelian ethics|moral philosophy]].<ref name="sep-thomas"/> The philosophical school that arose as a legacy of the work of Thomas Aquinas was known as [[Thomism]], and was especially influential among the [[Dominicans]], and later, the [[Jesuits]].<ref name="sep-thomas"/>

===Modern era===
After retreating under criticism from modern natural philosophers, the distinctively Aristotelian idea of [[teleology]] was transmitted through [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], who applied it to history as a totality.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Although this project was criticized by [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg|Trendelenburg]] and [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] as un-Aristotelian,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Hegel's influence is now often said to be responsible for an important Aristotelian influence upon [[Karl Marx|Marx]].<ref>For example, George E. McCarthy (ed.), ''Marx and Aristotle: Nineteenth-Century German Social Theory and Classical Antiquity'', Although many disagree Rowman & Littlefield, 1992.</ref> Postmodernists, in contrast, reject Aristotelianism's claim to reveal important theoretical truths.<ref>For example, Ted Sadler, ''Heidegger and Aristotle: The Question of Being'', Athlone, 1996.</ref> In this, they follow [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s critique of Aristotle as the greatest source of the entire tradition of Western philosophy.

===Contemporary Aristotelianism===
Aristotelianism is understood by its proponents as critically developing Plato's theories.<ref>For contrasting examples of this, see Hans-Georg Gadamer, ''The Idea of the Good in Platonic-Aristotelian Philosophy'' (trans. P. Christopher Smith), Yale University Press, 1986, and Lloyd P. Gerson, ''Aristotle and Other Platonists'', Cornell University Press, 2005.</ref> Recent [[Aristotelian ethics|Aristotelian ethical]] and 'practical' philosophy, such as that of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] and [[John McDowell|McDowell]], is often premised upon a rejection of Aristotelianism's traditional metaphysical or theoretical philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} From this viewpoint, the early modern tradition of political [[republicanism]], which views the ''res publica'', public sphere or state as constituted by its citizens' virtuous activity, can appear thoroughly Aristotelian.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The contemporary Aristotelian philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] is specially famous for helping to revive [[virtue ethics]] in his book ''[[After Virtue]]''. MacIntyre revises Aristotelianism with the argument that the highest temporal goods, which are internal to human beings, are actualized through participation in social practices. He opposes Aristotelianism to the managerial institutions of capitalism and its state, and to rival traditions—including the philosophies of [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Nietzsche]]—that reject its idea of essentially human goods and virtues and instead legitimize [[capitalism]]. Therefore, on MacIntyre's account, Aristotelianism is not identical with Western philosophy as a whole; rather, it is "the best theory so far, [including] the best theory so far about what makes a particular theory the best one."<ref>Alasdair MacIntyre, 'An Interview with Giovanna Borradori', in Kelvin Knight (ed.), ''The MacIntyre Reader'', Polity Press / University of Notre Dame Press, 1998, p. 264.</ref> Politically and socially, it has been characterized as a newly 'revolutionary Aristotelianism'. This may be contrasted with the more conventional, apolitical and effectively conservative uses of Aristotle by, for example, Gadamer and McDowell.<ref>Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy: Ethics and Politics from Aristotle to MacIntyre'', Polity Press, 2007.</ref> Other important contemporary Aristotelian theorists include Fred D. Miller, Jr.<ref>Fred D. Miller, Jr., ''Nature, Justice, and Rights in Aristotle's Politics'', Oxford University Press, 1997.</ref> in politics and Rosalind Hursthouse in ethics.<ref>Rosalind Hursthouse, ''On Virtue Ethics'', Oxford University Press, 1999.</ref>

In metaphysics, an Aristotelian realism about [[universals]] is defended by such philosophers as [[David Malet Armstrong]] and [[Stephen Mumford]], and is applied to the philosophy of mathematics by [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]].

==Criticism==

[[Bertrand Russell]] criticizes Aristotle's logic on the following points:<ref>{{harvtxt|Russell|1967}}, Chapter XXII Aristotle's Logic</ref>

# The Aristotelian system allows formal defects leading to "bad metaphysics". For example, the following [[syllogism]] is permitted: "All golden mountains are mountains, all golden mountains are golden, therefore some mountains are golden", which insinuates the existence of at least one golden mountain.<ref>{{harvtxt|Russell|1967|p=197}}</ref> Furthermore, according to Russell, a predicate of a predicate can be a predicate of the original subject, which blurs the distinction between names and predicates with disastrous consequences; for example, a class with only one member is erroneously identified with that one member, making impossible to have a correct theory of the number one.<ref name="Russell 1967 198">{{harvtxt|Russell|1967|p=198}}</ref>
# The [[syllogism]] is overvalued in comparison to other forms of deduction. For example, syllogisms are not employed in mathematics since they are less convenient.<ref name="Russell 1967 198"/>

In addition, Russell ends his review of the Aristotelian logic with these words:
<blockquote>
I conclude that the Aristotelian doctrines with which we have been concerned in this chapter are wholly false, with the exception of the formal theory of the syllogism, which is unimportant. Any person in the present day who wishes to learn logic will be wasting his time if he reads Aristotle or any of his disciples. None the less, Aristotle's logical writings show great ability, and would have been useful to mankind if they had appeared at a time when intellectual originality was still active. Unfortunately, they appeared at the very end of the creative period of Greek thought, and therefore came to be accepted as authoritative. By the time that logical originality revived, a reign of two thousand years had made Aristotle very difficult to dethrone. Throughout modern times, practically every advance in science, in logic, or in philosophy has had to be made in the teeth of the opposition from Aristotle's disciples.<ref>{{harvtxt|Russell|1967|p=202}}</ref>

Waiting on tables is (along with [[Nurse|nursing]] and [[Teacher|teaching]]) part of the [[service sector]], and among the most common occupations in the [[United States]]. The [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] estimates that, as of May 2008, there were over 2.2 million persons employed as servers in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes353031.htm |title=Occupational Employment and Wages - Waiters and Waitresses |accessdate=2006-12-31 |author=U.S. Department of Labor - Bureau of Labor Statistics |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=24 May 2006 |work= |publisher=US Department of Labor |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

Many businesses choose for the people waiting to all wear a [[uniform]], a [[tradition]] that has been around in the waiting industry for centuries.

Waitstaff may receive [[Tip (gratuity)|tips]] as a minor or major part of their earnings, with customs varying widely from country to country.<ref name="ButlerFrench2011">{{cite book|author1=Reg Butler|author2=Carole French|title=Tips on Tipping: A Global Guide to Gratuity Etiquette|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LLmPKCtJarkC|year=2011|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|pages=viii–ix|isbn=978-1-84162-210-1}}</ref>

==Duties of waiting staff==
The duties of waiting staff include preparing tables for a meal, taking customers' orders, serving drinks and food, and cleaning up before, after and during servings in a restaurant.
[[Silver service]] staff are specially trained to serve at banquets or high-end restaurants. They follow specific rules of service and it is a skilled job. They generally wear black and white with a long, white apron (extending from the waist to ankle).

The head server is in charge of the waiting staff, and is also frequently responsible for assigning seating. The functions of a head server can overlap to some degree with that of the [[Maître d'hôtel]]. Some restaurants employ [[busboy]]s or busgirls, increasingly referred to as bussers, to clear dirty dishes, set tables, and otherwise assist the waiting staff.<ref>(2004.)

'''Raes Junction''' is a small settlement in [[New Zealand]], located at the intersection of [[New Zealand State Highway 8|State Highways 8]] and [[New Zealand State Highway 90|90]], in the lower [[South Island]]. The highways which meet at the junction are the main routes to the [[Clutha River|Clutha]] valley for travellers from [[Dunedin]] and [[Invercargill]] respectively.

[[Image:RaesJunctionNZ.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Raes Junction Hotel.]]
Raes Junction is 62 kilometres by road from [[Milton, New Zealand|Milton]], 67 from [[Gore, New Zealand|Gore]], and 72&nbsp;km from [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]]. The junction lies three kilometres to the south of the Clutha River. The nearest town of any significant size is [[Lawrence, New Zealand|Lawrence]], which is 25 kilometres to the southeast.

Although the settlement itself is little more than a farming and horticultural community, its location at this mid-way junction is thus of considerable regional importance, as is the larger settlement of [[Beaumont, New Zealand|Beaumont]], some six kilometres to the southeast. The settlement consists of a mere five families, who occupy four local farms and the settlement's most well-known feature, the Raes Junction Hotel.

The '''Holga''' is a [[Medium format (film)|medium format]] [[120 film]] camera, made in [[Hong Kong]], known for its [[Lo-fi photography|low-fidelity]] [[aesthetic]].

The Holga's low-cost construction and simple [[meniscus lens]] often yields pictures that display [[vignetting]], [[Focus (optics)|blur]], [[light leak]]s, and other [[distortion (optics)|distortions]]. The camera's limitations have brought it a [[cult following]] among some photographers, and Holga photos have won awards and competitions in [[fine art photography|art]] and [[photojournalism|news photography]].<ref name=NYTimes20050608>{{Cite news| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/08/technology/circuits/08schiesel.html | title = Which Camera Does This Pro Use?

==History==
The Holga camera was designed by T. M. Lee in 1981. It first appeared outside China in 1982 in Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Bates, Michelle|title=Plastic Cameras: Toying With Creativity|location=New York|publisher=Focal Press|year=2006|ISBN=978-0-240-80840-6}}</ref> At the time, [[120 film|120 roll film]] in black-and-white was the most widely available film in mainland China.  The Holga was intended to provide an inexpensive mass-market camera for working-class Chinese in order to record family portraits and events.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://shop.lomography.com/holga/history/ | publisher = Lomography.com | title = Holga: History}}</ref> However, the rapid adoption of the [[35 mm film|35mm film]] format, due to new foreign camera and film imports, virtually eliminated the consumer market for 120 roll film in China.<ref name="The Holga Manual 2002 p. 3">The Holga Manual: The Holga History, Freestyle Photographic Supplies (2002), p. 3</ref>  Seeking new markets, the manufacturer sought to distribute the Holga outside mainland China.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Within a few years after the Holga's introduction to foreign markets, some photographers began using the Holga for its surrealistic, impressionistic scenes for landscape, still life, portrait, and especially [[street photography]].  These owners prized the Holga for its lack of precision, light leaks, and inexpensive qualities, which forced the photographer to concentrate on innovation and creative vision in place of increasingly expensive camera technology.<ref>''[http://microsites.lomography.com/holga/history Holga History]'' Lomography.com, retrieved 15 April 2010</ref>  In this respect, the Holga became the successor to the [[Diana camera|Diana]] and other [[toy camera]]s previously used in such work. A Holga photograph by photojournalist [[David Burnett (photojournalist)|David Burnett]] of former vice-president Al Gore during a 2000 campaign appearance earned a top prize in a 2001 White House News Photographers' Association ''Eyes of History'' award ceremony.<ref name=NYTimes20050608/>

Recently the Holga has experienced renewed consumer interest outside China due to the increasing popularity of [[toy camera]]s, and a continuing [[counterculture]] response to the increasing complexity of modern cameras.<ref>''Holga History'' Lomography.com</ref>

==Lens and aperture settings==
[[Image:Holga sample.jpg|right|thumb|205px|A sample Holga image showing its characteristic [[vignetting]].]]
Most Holga cameras use a single-piece plastic meniscus [[photographic lens|lens]] with a [[focal length]] of 60 millimeters and utilize a zone-focus system that can adjust from about 1 meter (3&nbsp;feet) to infinity.  Like any simple meniscus lens, the Holga lens exhibits [[soft focus]] and [[chromatic aberration]]. Other Holga variants, denoted either by the letter 'G' in their model name, or the name WOCA, feature a simple glass lens, but are otherwise identical in construction. The manufacturer has since outsourced supply of the varying plastic and glass lenses to contractors in Japan and China

There is an [[aperture]] setting switch on the camera with two positions indicated by pictorial [[ideograms]]: ''sunny'' and ''cloudy'', with a nominal value of {{f/|11}} and {{f/|8}}, respectively.  Due to a manufacturing oversight, this switch has no effect on pre-2009 production cameras, and the actual aperture is around {{f/|13}}, giving the Holga just one aperture.<ref>Hahn, Mark ''[http://webspace.webring.com/people/ps/submini/holga_mods.html The Authoritative Guide to Holga Tune-Up And Modifications]''</ref><ref>Even 2009 production 120N Holgas have been recorded as having no effective aperture switch.</ref> The problem is reported as having been fixed in cameras post-2009, providing two working aperture settings of {{f/|13}} and {{f/|20}},<ref>Williamson, Paul [http://www.squarefrog.co.uk/basics/apertures.html "The Holga's Aperture"]</ref> and earlier cameras are modifiable to provide two usable settings.<ref name="ReferenceA">Hahn, Mark, ''The Authoritative Guide To Holga Tune-Up and Modifications''</ref>  Apertures of {{f/|10}} and {{f/|13}} work well for ISO200 speed films, while settings of {{f/|13}} and {{f/|19}} tend to suit faster films of around ISO400.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Film format==
The Holga was originally designed to accept either a 6&times;4.5 format or a 6&times;6 (square) format.  However, once the camera went into production, vignetting (darkening of the corners of the finished photograph) occurred when the camera was modified to a 6&times;6 format.  Hence, early Holgas had their film size switches tightly fixed to shoot only 6&times;4.5 format.  Many owners removed both this restriction and the 6&times;4.5 film mask as well, finding the resultant vignetting a desirable effect.<ref name="The Holga Manual 2002 p. 3"/>  Later Holgas such as the 120N come with two masks for both the 6&times;4.5 and 6&times;6 format.  Holgas can even be modified to use 35mm film.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite web| url = http://scissorxarm.blogspot.com/2008/04/history-of-holga.html | publisher = Scissor × Arm | title = History of Holga}}</ref>

The Holga has one shutter speed - approximately 1/100th of a second.  The camera can shoot 16 exposures per 120 roll in 6x4.5&nbsp;cm format or 12 exposures in 6x6 format. Film is advanced by a knob on the top of the camera, and frame numbers printed on the backing paper of the film can be viewed through a red window on the back of the Holga. The number of frames chosen is indicated by the black arrow.

==Modifications and variants==
[[File:Holga 120S Camera With Tape To Prevent Light Leaks.jpg|thumb|120S prepared with tape in order to prevent too many light leaks]]
Holga cameras are often modified:
* A Holga's interior can be "flocked"&mdash;coated with matte black paint&mdash;in order to limit the effect of light bouncing off the plastic interior from light leaks.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.holgamods.com/mods/mods.html | publisher = Holga Mods | title = Mods}}</ref>
* The red window on the camera back can be blocked by an improvised cover to eliminate light leaks when using panchromatic films
* The Holga's aperture switch can be modified as needed to provide a larger ('cloudy') or smaller ('sunny') aperture.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://squarefrog.co.uk/holga/index.php?id=aperturemod | title = Holga Hacks: Aperture Mod}}</ref>
* The lens, and sometimes the entire shutter assembly, can be replaced with a [[Pinhole Photography|pinhole]] (the "Pinholga").<ref name = "Holga Mods">{{Cite web| title = Holga Mods | url = http://www.holgamods.com}}</ref>
* The plastic lens can be replaced with a glass version (the "Woca") or can be completely removed.
* Newer models of the camera come with multiple optional frame inserts (4.5 × 6&nbsp;cm and 6 × 6&nbsp;cm). Shooting without an insert can lead to problems keeping the [[120 film|120 size film]] flat against the [[film plane]].
* Inserting cardboard or foam or felt padding under or behind the film spool to provide proper film tensioning
[[Image:Holga sprocket.jpg|right|thumb|300px|An example of a "sprocket hole" exposure when using 35mm film in a modified Holga 120.]]
* The Holga TIM camera has two fixed focus plastic lenses which work simultaneously, allowing for the capture of 3D images.<ref>Pawel Piejko, Gizmag. "[http://www.gizmag.com/holga-twin-image-maker/19120/ Holga's TIM camera lets film fans experiment in 3D]." July 5, 2011. Retrieved July 22, 2011.</ref>
Some modifications permit the use of other film formats:
* Holga cameras may be fitted with a [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] back, allowing use of Polaroid 80 series instant film, or with newer models, 100 series film (but the image is not centered).  This modification, sometimes termed a "Holgaroid" or "Polga", renders the viewfinder unusable, but allows for instant Holga prints.
* By sandwiching a normal 35mm roll of film into the Holga's 120 spool, "sprocket hole" exposures may be taken that expose the entire surface of [[135 film]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://photondetector.com/tools_ref/135-advance/ | publisher = Photon Detector | work = Tools & Reference | title = 35mm Film in Holga, Diana, Agfa Isoly, and Zero Image Film Advance Guide for Sprocket Hole Photography}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.holgamods.com/faq/faq.html | publisher = Holga Mods | title = FAQ}}</ref>
* Cameras such as the [[Hasselblad]] have been modified to make use of a Holga lens.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.holgamods.com/new/new.html | publisher = Holga Mods | title = New}}</ref>
* Holga plastic lenses have also been adapted to the Canon EOS, the Nikon f-mount, Pentax, Sony, Olympus and Minolta.  An f-mount, 'melted' plastic Holga lens has been used on a digital f-mount camera while the EOS Holga has been mounted to the latest Canon DSLRs. Adapted lenses are also commercially available.<ref name = "Holga Mods" /><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://photo.net/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00NG77 | publisher = Photo.net | title = Fall with a 'melted' Holga on a Nikon D2X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.howcast.com/guides/1504-How-To-Make-Your-Holga-Lens-Mountable-To-Your-SLR-Camera-EOSNikonSony-ETC | publisher = Howcast | title = How To Make Your Holga Lens Mountable To Your SLR Camera (EOS, Nikon, Sony, &c.)}}</ref>

===Concept ''Holga D''===
In 2010, designer Saikat Biswas proposed a concept for a digital version of the Holga camera, called ''Holga D''. It has a modernized case, but retains the simplicity of the original camera. However, there is no evidence of current plans to produce this device, or produce any other digital version.<ref>{{cite web|last=Biswas|first=Saikat|title=Holga . D|url=http://www.saikatbiswas.com/web/Projects/Holga_D.htm|accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref>

==Accessories==
Accessories exist that will do the same thing as a modified Holga without the need for physical modifications as well as accessories for special effects. Such accessories include:
* [[Cable release]], which slips onto the lens so that a cable release can depress the shutter. Also includes tripod mount since the Holga 120N's mount is covered by the accessory.
* [[35mm]] Film Adapter, available in two models: full negative and "panoramic." Both adapters come with a light-proof back and a mask made to hold the 135 canister in place. The only difference between the two models is the size of the mask. The "panoramic" adapter will mask out the sprocket holes. A rarer model available in Japan is an all-in-one back and cartridge unit.
* [[Fisheye lens]], produces circular Fisheye images.
* Filter holder and filters. Filter holders can hold one or two filters, depending on the model of the holder. Filters come in special effect filters, color filters, and center spot filters (which leaves a normal center, but a colored surrounding).
* Holgon Flash, a small normal flash for Holgas with a [[hot shoe]].
* Holgon Strobe Flash, a bulky flash which features multi flash strobe (which keeps flashing as long as the shutter stays open in bulb mode) or single flash (a more powerful flash, which will flash once on pressing the shutter and a second time on release). Features vertical adjustable angles.
* Holgon Slave Flash, a small, round slave flash meant for placing on a surface or handheld. Good for any kind of secondary light. Some units will come with multi colored filters to place over the flash.
* Camera bags, available in a small and a large size.
* Holga Enlargers, an inexpensive darkroom enlarger with two available lenses and several masks/negative carriers for both [[120 film|120]] and [[35mm]] formats.
* Holga iPhone Filter and Case was released at the end of 2011 and has opened up a new market for Holga accessories (smartphone)<ref>''[http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57329619-1/holga-iphone-filter-case-takes-retro-photos/]'' CNET, Holga iPhone filter case takes retro photos</ref>

[[File:The Benjamin Silliman Family.jpg|thumb|Yale professor and famed chemist Benjamin Silliman with his extended family.]]

'''Benjamin Silliman''' (8 August 1779 &ndash; 24 November 1864) was an early [[United States|American]] [[chemist]] and [[science education|science educator]]. He was one of first American professors of science, at [[Yale University|Yale College]], the first person to distill [[petroleum]], and a founder of the ''[[American Journal of Science]]'', the oldest scientific journal in the United States.

==Early life==
Silliman was born in a tavern in North Stratford, now [[Trumbull, Connecticut|Trumbull]], [[Connecticut]], a few months after his mother, [[Mary Silliman|Mary (Fish) Silliman]] (widow of John Noyes), fled for her life from their [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]], Connecticut, home to escape two thousand invading British troops that burned Fairfield center to the ground. The British forces had taken his father, General [[Gold Selleck Silliman]], prisoner in May 1779.

==Education==
Silliman was educated at Yale, receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in 1796 and a [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1799. He studied law with [[Simeon Baldwin]] from 1798 to 1799 and became a tutor at Yale from 1799 to 1802. He was admitted to the bar in 1802. President [[Timothy Dwight IV]] of Yale proposed that he equip himself to teach in chemistry and natural history and accept a new professorship at the university. Silliman studied chemistry with Professor James Woodhouse at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]] and delivered his first lectures in chemistry at Yale in 1804. These lectures were the first science lectures ever given at Yale.<ref>{{cite web|title=Silliman History|url=http://silliman.yalecollege.yale.edu/history|accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref> In 1805, he traveled to [[Edinburgh]] for further study.

==Career==
[[File:The American Journal of Science cover page first issue 1818.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Title page]], inaugural edition of the ''[[American Journal of Science]]'', founded by Benjamin Silliman, 1818]]
Returning to [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], he studied its [[geology]], and made a chemical analysis of the [[Weston meteorite|meteorite]] that fell near [[Weston, Connecticut|Weston]], Connecticut, publishing the first scientific account of any American meteorite. He lectured publicly at New Haven in 1808 and came to discover many of the constituent elements of many [[mineral]]s. Some time around 1818, Ephraim Lane took some samples of rocks he found at an area called Saganawamps, now a part of the [[Old Mine Park Archeological Site]] in Trumbull, Connecticut, to Silliman for identification. Silliman reported in his new ''[[American Journal of Science]]'', a publication covering all the natural sciences but with an emphasis on geology, that he had identified [[tungsten]], [[tellurium]], [[topaz]] and [[fluorite]] in the rocks.<ref>History and Minerals of Old Mine Park (Saganawamps), Earle Sullivan, Trumbull Historical Society, 1985, p. 8</ref> In 1837, the first (and at the time only) prismatic barite ore of [[tungsten]] in the United States was discovered at the mine. The mineral [[sillimanite]] was named after Silliman in 1850. Upon the founding of the [[Yale School of Medicine|Medical School]], he also taught there as one of the founding faculty members. As professor emeritus, he delivered lectures at Yale on geology until 1855; in 1854, he became the first person to fractionate [[petroleum]] by distillation.<ref name=NAS>{{cite web|title=Benjamin Silliman Jr.|url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/deceased-members/20001707.html|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=12 April 2014}}</ref>

Like his son-in-law [[James Dwight Dana|James Dana]], Silliman was a [[Christian]].<ref>Buckingham Mouheb, Roberta (2012). ''Yale Under God'', p. 110. Xulon Press, ISBN 9781619968844</ref> In an address delivered before the ''Association of American Geologists'' he spoke in favor of [[old-earth creationism]], stating:
{{Quote|It is already admitted by multitudes, that the chronology of the Scriptures is, in strictness, applied only to the history of our race, the sole moral beings whom God has placed in this World; while all that precedes man in the creation, is limited, in duration backwards, only by that beginning, whose is known to no being but the infinite Creator, and which certainly precedes, by many ages, the creation of man.|Silliman, (1842)<ref>Silliman, Benjamin. ''[http://books.google.com.mx/books?id=DLQoAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Address Delivered Before the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists: At Their Meeting Held in Boston, April 25-30]'', 1842. B.L. Hamlen., p. XXXII</ref>}}
In the same line of thought, he posed arguments against atheism and materialism.<ref>Silliman, Benjamin (1839). [http://books.google.com.mx/books?id=--8RAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Suggestions Relative to the Philosophy of Geology, as Deduced from the Facts and to the Consistency of Both the Facts and Theory of this Science with Sacred History.] pp. 79-80</ref>

==1807 meteor==
{{Main|Weston meteorite}}
At 6:30 in the morning of December 14, 1807, a blazing fireball about two-thirds the size of the moon, was seen traveling southwards by early risers in Vermont and Massachusetts. Three loud explosions were heard over the town of [[Weston, Connecticut|Weston]] in Fairfield County, Connecticut. Stone fragments fell in at least 6 places. The largest and only unbroken stone of the Weston fall, which weighed 36.5 pounds (16.5 kilograms), was found some days after Silliman and Kingsley had spent several fruitless hours hunting for it. The owner, a [[Trumbull, Connecticut|Trumbull]] farmer named Elijah Seeley, was urged to present it to Yale by local people who had met the professors during their investigation, but he insisted on putting it up for sale. It was purchased by Colonel [[George Gibbs (mineralogist)|George Gibbs]] for his large and famous collection of minerals; when the collection became the property of Yale in 1825, Silliman finally acquired this stone; the only specimen of the Weston meteorite that remains in the Yale [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|Peabody Museum]] collection today.<ref>[http://www.peabody.yale.edu/collections/met/met_weston.html Yale Peabody Museum website retrieved 2011 March 10]</ref><ref>Seeley, Tales of Trumbull's Past, Trumbull Historical Society, 1984</ref>

==Family==
His first marriage was on  September 17, 1809, to Harriet Trumbull, daughter of Connecticut governor [[Jonathan Trumbull, Jr.]], who was the son of Governor [[Jonathan Trumbull, Sr.]] of Connecticut, a hero of the [[American Revolution]]. Silliman and his wife had four children: one daughter married Professor Oliver P. Hubbard, another married Professor [[James Dwight Dana]]; and youngest daughter Julia married Edward Whiting Gilman, brother of Yale graduate and educator [[Daniel Coit Gilman]].  His son [[Benjamin Silliman Jr.]], also a professor of chemistry at Yale, wrote a report that convinced investors to back [[George Bissell (industrialist)|George Bissell's]] seminal search for oil. His second marriage was in 1851 to Mrs. Sarah Isabella (McClellan) Webb, daughter of John McClellan. Silliman died at New Haven and is buried in [[Grove Street Cemetery]].

==Legacy==
Silliman deemed [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] an "enormous evil".

As of February 1991 it is the successor of the CCMC manufacturers committee ({{lang-fr|'''Comité des Constructeurs du Marché Commun'''}}) which was founded in October 1972.

Its members include: [[Toyota Motor Europe|Toyota]], [[BMW]], [[Volkswagen AG|Volkswagen Group]], [[Volvo]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[DAF Trucks|DAF]], [[Renault]], [[Fiat Group]], [[Scania AB]], [[Porsche]], [[DaimlerChrysler|Mercedes]], [[PSA Peugeot Citroën]], [[Hyundai]] and [[MAN SE|MAN AG]].

One major area of ACEA work including its predecessor associations has been in performance quality classifications for [[4-stroke]] [[engine oil]]s. That history goes back to 1919 (Bureau Permanent International des Constructeurs d'Automobile - BPICA) that was renamed in 1985 (Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles - OICA).  The ACEA has its predessor in the CMMC (Comité des Constructeurs du Marché Commun) founded in October 1972 by French (Citroën, Peugeot, Renault), German (Mercedes, Volkswagen), Italian (Fiat) and British (BLMC) manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.congresafsp2009.fr/sectionsthematiques/st33/st33moguen.doc|title=Congrès ASFP 2009|author=Marine Moguen-Toursel|publisher=Centre de recherches historiques EHESS|year=2009|accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref>

The ACEA is studying electric vehicle [[charging station]]s and expects that [[Charging station#Standards|Type 2 Mode 3]] connectors also to be used for home charging in the second phase after 2017 while still allowing Mode 2 charging with established plug types that are already available in home environments

There is no unified association of manufacturers which sell in the European Union (independently of the European, Asian or American origin).

== Presidents ==
The presidency had been rotated among French, Italian and German automobile manufacturers.

A lifting body is a [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foil]] or a complete foil-bearing body such as a [[fixed-wing aircraft]]. ''C''<sub>L</sub> is a function of the angle of the body to the flow, its [[Reynold number]] and its [[Mach number]]. The lift coefficient ''c''<sub>l</sub> is refers to the dynamic lift characteristics of a [[two-dimensional]] foil section, with the reference area replaced by the foil [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]].<ref name=Clancy>{{cite book|last=Clancy|first=L. J.|title=Aerodynamics|year=1975|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|at=Sections 4.15 & 5.4}}</ref><ref name=TWS1.2>[[Ira H. Abbott|Abbott, Ira H.]], and Von Doenhoff, Albert E.: ''Theory of Wing Sections''. Section 1.2</ref>  

==Definition of the lift coefficient ''C''<sub>L</sub>==

The lift coefficient ''C''<sub>L</sub> is defined by<ref name=TWS1.2/><ref>Clancy, L. J.: ''Aerodynamics''. Section 4.15</ref>

:<math>C_\mathrm L = {\frac{L}{\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2S}} = {\frac{2 L}{\rho v^2S}} = \frac{L}{q S}</math> ,
where 
<math>L\,</math> is the [[Lift (force)|lift force]], <math>\rho\,</math> is [[fluid]] [[density]], <math>v\,</math> is [[true airspeed]], <math>S\,</math> is [[planform]] area and <math>q\,</math> is the fluid [[dynamic pressure]].

The lift coefficient can be approximated using the [[lifting-line theory]],<ref>Clancy, L. J.: ''Aerodynamics''. Section 8.11</ref> numerically calculated  or measured in a [[wind tunnel]] test of a complete aircraft configuration.

== Section lift coefficient ==
[[Image:Lift curve.svg|thumb|300px|right|A typical curve showing section lift coefficient versus angle of attack for a cambered airfoil]]
Lift coefficient may also be used as a characteristic of a particular shape (or cross-section) of an [[airfoil]].  In this application it is called the '''section lift coefficient''' <math>c_\text{l}</math>. It is common to show, for a particular airfoil section, the relationship between section lift coefficient and [[angle of attack]].<ref>Abbott, Ira H., and Von Doenhoff, Albert E.: ''Theory of Wing Sections''. Appendix IV</ref> It is also useful to show the relationship between section lift coefficient and [[drag coefficient]].

The section lift coefficient is based on two-dimensional flow over a wing of infinite span and non-varying cross-section so the lift is independent of spanwise effects and is defined in terms of <math>l</math>, the lift force per unit span of the wing.  The definition becomes

:<math>c_\text{l} = \frac{l}{\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2c},</math>

where <math>c\,</math> is the [[chord (aircraft)|chord]] of the airfoil. Note this is directly analogous to the drag coefficient since the chord can be interpreted as the "area per unit span".

For a given angle of attack, ''c''<sub>l</sub> can be calculated approximately using the [[thin airfoil theory]],<ref>Clancy, L. J.: ''Aerodynamics''. Section 8.2</ref> calculated numerically or determined from wind tunnel tests on a finite-length test piece, with end-plates designed to ameliorate the three-dimensional effects. Plots of ''c''<sub>l</sub> versus angle of attack  show the same general shape for all [[airfoil]]s, but the particular numbers will vary. They show an almost linear increase in lift coefficient with increasing [[angle of attack]] with a gradient known as the lift slope.  For a thin airfoil of any shape the lift slope is ?<sup>2</sup>/90 ? 0.11 per degree. At higher angles a maximum point is reached, after which the lift coefficient reduces. The angle at which maximum lift coefficient occurs is the [[Stall (flight)|stall]] angle of the airfoil, which is approximately 10 to 15 degrees on a typical airfoil.

Symmetric airfoils necessarily have plots of c<sub>l</sub> versus angle of attack symmetric about the ''c''<sub>l</sub> axis, but for any airfoil with positive [[camber (aerodynamics)|camber]], i.e. asymmetrical, convex from above, there is still a small but positive lift coefficient with angles of attack less than zero. That is, the angle at which ''c''<sub>l</sub> = 0 is negative. On such airfoils at zero angle of attack the pressures on the upper surface are lower than on the lower surface.

'''Arthur William "Art" Bell, III''' (born June 17, 1945) is an American [[Presenter|broadcaster]] and author known as one of the founders and the original host of the [[paranormal]]-themed radio program ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]''.<ref name=ARTBELL>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/phenomena/artbell.html|title=Legal Web Heats Up Around Art Bell|last=Martin|first=Robert Scott|date=August 26, 1999|publisher=Space.com|accessdate=February 5, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100324165224/http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/phenomena/artbell.html|archivedate=March 24, 2010}}</ref> He also created and formerly hosted its companion show ''Dreamland''. Semi-retired from ''Coast to Coast AM'' since 2003, he hosted the show many weekends for the following four years. He announced his retirement from weekend hosting on July 1, 2007, but occasionally served as a [[guest host]] through 2010. He attributed the reason for his retirement to a desire to spend time with his new wife and his daughter, born May 30, 2007. He added that unlike his previous "retirements," this one would stand, while leaving open the option to return. Classic Bell-hosted episodes of ''Coast to Coast AM'' can be heard in some markets on Saturday nights under the name ''Somewhere in Time''. He started a new nightly show, ''[[Art Bell's Dark Matter]]'', on [[Sirius XM Radio]] that began on September 16, 2013 <ref>David Bauder, [http://www.mercurynews.com/entertainment/ci_23757348/art-bell-returning-radio-sirius-show-about-paranormal Art Bell returning to radio with Sirius show about the paranormal], San Jose Mercury News ENTERTAINMENT July 29, 2013</ref> and ended 6 weeks later on November 4, 2013.<ref name="artbell.com">{{cite web|url=http://artbell.com/art-bell-leaves-siriusxm/ |title=Leaves SiriusXM |publisher=Art Bell |date=2013-11-05 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref><ref name="Speigel">{{cite news|last=Speigel|first=Lee|title=Paranormal Radio Host Art Bell Mysteriously Disappears From SiriusXM|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/04/art-bell-resigns-from-sirius-xm-radio_n_4215776.html|accessdate=5 November 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=4 November 2013}}</ref>

Bell founded and was the original owner of [[Pahrump, Nevada]]-based radio station [[KNYE]] 95.1 FM. His [[Radio studio#Radio studios|broadcast studio]] and [[transmitter]] were located near his home in Pahrump while he hosted ''Coast to Coast AM'' except from June to December 2006, when he lived in the [[Philippines]]. He and his family returned to the Philippines in March 2009, after having significant difficulties obtaining a U.S. visa for his wife, Airyn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/art-bell-s-wife-denied-u-s-visa|title=Art Bell's Wife Denied U.S. Visa|last=Bell|first=Art|date=June 6, 2009|work=Articles|publisher=[[Coast to Coast AM]]}}</ref>

==Early life==
Art Bell was born in [[Jacksonville, North Carolina]] to Arthur Bell, Jr., a [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]], and Jane Gumaer Bell, a Marine [[Military parade|drill]] [[Drill instructor|instructor]]. Arthur Bell, Jr. died in 2000 and Jane Bell died December 23, 2008.

Art Bell III was always interested in radio and at the age of 13 became a licensed [[amateur radio operator]]. Bell now holds an Amateur [[Amateur radio licensing in the United States#Current license classes|Extra Class]] [[Amateur radio#Licensing|license]], which is in the top U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] license class. His [[ITU prefix (amateur stations)|call sign]] is W6OBB.

Bell served in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] as a [[medic]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and in his free time operated a [[pirate radio]] station at [[Amarillo Air Force Base]]. He would go out of his way to play [[anti-war]] music (like "[[Eve of Destruction (song)|Eve of Destruction]]" and "[[Fortunate Son (song)|Fortunate Son]]") that was not aired on the [[American Forces Network]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bargainprofessor.wordpress.com/2006/09/24/arthur-art-bell-iii/|title=Arthur "Art" Bell, III|last=Voice|first=Just A|date=September 24, 2006|work=The Compass Blog|publisher=[[WordPress.com]]}}</ref>

After leaving military service he stayed in Asia, living on the Japanese island of [[Okinawa]] where he worked as a [[disc jockey]] for [[KSBK]], the only non-military English-language station in Japan. While there, he set a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] by staying on the air for 116 hours and 15 minutes. The money raised there allowed Bell to [[Charter airline|charter]] a [[DC-8]], fly to [[Vietnam]], and rescue 130 Vietnamese [[orphans]] stranded in [[Saigon]] at the war's end. They were eventually brought to the United States and [[adoption|adopted]] by American families.<ref name="c2c1">{{cite web|url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/pages/art-bell |title=Art Bell |publisher=Coast to Coast AM |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref>

Bell returned to the United States and studied engineering at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. He dropped out and returned to radio as a board operator and chief engineer, and had opportunity to be on the air a few times. For several years he worked behind and in front of the microphone. After a period of working in cable television, in 1986 the 50,000-watt [[KDWN]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] offered Bell a five-hour time slot in the middle of the night. [[Radio syndication|Syndication]] of his program to other radio stations began in 1993.

==Broadcasting career==
Art Bell was living in [[Watsonville, California]] and worked for [[KIDD]] 630 AM in [[Monterey, California]] during the early 70s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  He also worked for [[KION-TV|KMST]] channel 46.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

First a rock music jockey before moving into [[talk radio]], Bell's original 1978 late-night Las Vegas program on [[KDWN]] was a political call-in show under the name ''West Coast AM''.<ref name = knight/> In 1988, Bell and Alan Corberth renamed the show ''Coast to Coast AM'' and moved its broadcast from the [[Plaza Hotel & Casino|Plaza Hotel]] in Las Vegas to Bell's home in Pahrump.<ref name = knight/>

[[File:KNYE Radio.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Broadcast facilities of KNYE in Pahrump, Nevada.]]
Bell abandoned conventional political talk in favor of topics such as [[gun control]] and [[conspiracy theories]], leading to a significant bump in his overnight ratings. The show's focus again shifted significantly after the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in 1995. Many in the media did not want to be blamed for inciting anti-government or militia actions like the bombing. Subsequently, Bell discussed off-beat topics like the [[paranormal]], the [[occult]], [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]], [[protoscience]] and [[pseudoscience]]. During his tenure at KDWN Bell met and married his third wife, Ramona, who later handled production and management duties for the program.

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in its February 23, 1997 edition, Art Bell was at the time America's highest-rated late-night radio talk show host, broadcast on 328 stations. According to ''[[The Oregonian]]'' in its June 22, 1997 edition, ''Coast to Coast AM'' with Art Bell was on 460 stations. At its initial peak in popularity, ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' was syndicated on more than 500 radio stations and claimed 15 million listeners nightly. Bell's studios were located in his home in the town of Pahrump, located in [[Nye County]], [[Nevada]]; hence the voice-over catchphrase, "from the Kingdom of Nye."

===Critical reputation===
Fans regard Bell as a master showman, noting that he calls his show "absolute entertainment"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Genoni Jr.|first=Thomas C.|date=March 1998|title=Peddling the Paranormal: Late-Night Radio's Art Bell|journal=[[Skeptical Briefs]]|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/peddling_the_paranormal_late-night_radios_art_bell/}}</ref> and expressly says he does not necessarily accept every guest or caller's claims but only offers a forum where they will not be openly ridiculed. Bell was one of only a few talk show hosts who did not [[Call screening|screen incoming calls]], but this changed in 2006. On the October 31, 2006 edition of ''Coast to Coast AM,'' (renamed for the night to ''Ghost to Ghost AM''), Bell was asked why he was now using call screeners. The explanation given was that for him to use unscreened open phone lines while in the Philippines would require listeners to call there directly at enormous cost to them. Art admitted that he should have chosen New Zealand instead of the Philippines as an alternative to the USA. He said, "It was a bad choice, and I'll regret it, one day, in the near future."  He subsequently stopped screening calls upon his return to the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

His calm attitude, patient questions, and ability to tease substance from nebulous statements of callers and guests gave his show a relaxed yet serious atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} This earned him praise from those who declare that the paranormal deserves a mature outlet of discussion in the media as well as the approval of those simply amused by the nightly parade of bizarre, typically fringe topics. [[Ed Dames]], [[Richard C. Hoagland]], [[Terence McKenna]], [[Dannion Brinkley]], [[David John Oates]], and [[Robert Bigelow]] have all been regular guests. Some of Bell’s regular guests, particularly Hoagland, continue to be regular guests on ''Coast to Coast AM'' now hosted by [[George Noory]].

Bell's own interests, however, extend beyond the [[paranormal]]. He has interviewed singers [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Eric Burdon]] and [[Gordon Lightfoot]], comedian [[George Carlin]], writer [[Dean Koontz]], [[hard science fiction]] writer [[Greg Bear]], ''[[X-Files]]'' writer/creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], TV talk host [[Regis Philbin]], ''[[Star Trek]]'' actor [[Leonard Nimoy]], actor [[Dan Aykroyd]], former [[Luftwaffe]] pilot [[Bruno Stolle]], actress [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]], actress [[Ellen Muth]], actor and TV host [[Robert Stack]], human rights lawyer [[John Loftus (author)|John Loftus]], legendary disc jockey [[Casey Kasem]], and frequent guests [[Physics|physicist]] [[Michio Kaku]] and [[SETI]] [[astronomer]]s [[Seth Shostak]] and [[H. Paul Shuch]].

Beginning in late 1996, Bell was criticized for reporting rumors that [[Comet Hale-Bopp]] was being trailed by a UFO. It was speculated that members of the [[Heaven's Gate (cult)|Heaven's Gate]] group committed mass suicide based on rumors Bell aired, but others dismissed the idea, noting that the Heaven's Gate website stated: "Whether Hale-Bopp has a 'companion' or not is irrelevant from our perspective."<ref>{{cite web

===Political and religious views===
Bell chooses not to discuss his political views on ''Coast to Coast AM'' though occasionally he has brought them up. He has expressed support for [[the right to bear arms]] and [[same-sex marriage]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} He also used to be, in his own words, a "staunch" supporter of the [[death penalty]], though he has changed his mind at least to some extent due to innocent people being sentenced to death.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Bell has completely dismissed the [[9/11 conspiracy theories]], having uploaded an image stating "God Bless [[George W. Bush]] and the U.S.A." to his website following the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wingtv.net/bell.html |title=Art Bell 9-11 Outrage |publisher=Wingtv.net |accessdate= June 7, 2012}}</ref>

Bell is a member of the [[U.S. Libertarian Party]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}  Originally, ''Coast to Coast AM'' was a conservative political talk show, but in recent years Bell has expressed both conservative and liberal views on the air. On air, Bell has shown support for immigration reform and [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|decriminalizing marijuana]]. He has also criticized humankind's role in facilitating the onset of [[global warming]]. Bell has also stated that he [[Pro-life|opposes abortion]], believes the U.S. should finish the job in the [[war in Iraq]] and supports a [[free market]] economy.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Bell supported [[Barack Obama]] for President of the United States in both the 2008<ref>{{cite web|url=http://downtowneastsideenquirer.blogspot.ca/2008/03/art-bell-endorses-obama-barack.html |title=Art Bell Endorses Barack Obama|publisher=DOWNTOWN EASTSIDE ENQUIRER |accessdate= May 21, 2014}}</ref> and 2012 elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coalspeaker.com/post/35157936542/art-bell-makes-his-call-he-supports-obama-in |title=Art Bell makes his call!!|publisher=Coalspeaker|accessdate= May 21, 2014}}</ref>

==Callers and guests==
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2014}}
* John Lear, [[ufologist]], was a frequent guest on [[Coast to Coast AM]], and whom Art credits with getting him on the paranormal track for his show. Lear and Lazar have unveiled their infiltration and revelations of [[Area 51]].
* On March 23, 1994, Bell interviewed [[Neal Chase]], who had predicted the nuking of New York City for that exact day. Bell became hysterical and lost his radio composure when he read the headline that came over the newswire just at the start of his interview with Chase that "Newark Had Been Nuked!" This headline referred to the exact report of the eye-witness account of a pilot flying into Newark seeing the giant Hiroshima and Nagasaki sized fireball and mushroom cloud from the [[Edison, New Jersey natural gas explosion|Edison gas explosion]]. The pillar of fire—after the initial flash of the blast—reached over {{convert|1000|ft}} into the night sky.
* In April 1996, Bell received a package of what would be known as "Art's Parts". These parts were allegedly pieces of debris from the 1947 Roswell UFO crash. Extensive analysis of the metals indicated they were made of an odd [[bismuth]] material.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* On May 24, 1996, Bell interviewed [[William Luther Pierce]], author of the highly controversial book, ''[[The Turner Diaries]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/tribalism/pierce.html|title=PIERCE INTERVIEW - NATIONALISM OR IMPERIALISM?|publisher=|accessdate=September 16, 2014|date=May 24, 1996}}</ref> in which Pierce—writing under the pseudonym "Andrew Macdonald"—depicted a [[race war]] leading to the extermination of Jews, non-whites and gay people. In a remark that Bell later said nearly caused him to lose his temper on the air, Pierce denounced [[interracial marriage]], calling white people who married non-whites "traitors to the white race"—apparently unaware that Bell himself was in an interracial marriage, as his then-wife, [[Ramona Bell|Ramona]], was an [[Asian-American]] of [[Filipino peoples|Filipino]] descent.
* One of Art Bell's ''Coast to Coast'' interviews occurred in 1997 with Mel Waters who discussed what is known as "[[Mel's Hole]]" in rural Washington State. The mysterious opening is said to be a fantastically deep vertical shaft which possesses extremely bizarre properties. No such hole has ever been physically located by anyone attempting to verify this story.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
* On May 23, 1997, Bell interviewed a man who called himself "Victor" who claimed to have been at [[S-4 (Sector Four)|S-4]] (near [[Area 51]]) and was responsible for the release to the public of a nearly three-minute video commonly called the "alien interview."  For almost two hours Victor described the ebe (extraterrestrial biological entities) program at S-4, verifying most of [[Bob Lazar]]'s claims.
* On September 11, 1997, Bell took a call from a frantic man claiming to be an ex-Area 51 employee who grew progressively more upset as the call wore on, culminating in the show's going temporarily off the air because of a satellite failure. The gentleman called back on April 28, 1998, admitting that the original call was fraudulent.
** This incident formed the basis of the song [[Disposition (song)|"Faaip de Oiad"]] by the rock band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] which features said interview (with Art Bell's part cut out) dubbed in over frantic drumming and buzzing static.
** The interview was also sampled in [[Konkhra]]'s track "Religion is a Whore", [[The Faceless]]'s "Planetary Duality", experimental Texas quartet [[The Paper Chase (band)|The Paper Chase]]'s "It's Out There and It's Gonna Get You", [[MC Lars]]' "[[Lars Attacks!]]" and [[Sweet Valley]]'s "So Serene" (around the 22:40 mark).
* J.C. Webster III, or "J.C." – Webster began calling in 1996, and has since been on the air over 50 times. He purports to be a [[Baptists|Baptist]] [[Christian revival|Revival]] preacher, and believes Art to be "the Devil's Mouthpiece". He has continued to call [[George Noory]] and guest hosts. Although some listeners have expressed a disbelief that someone like J.C. could exist, Art Bell and George Noory have repeated their beliefs that Webster is real, and is neither a "put-on" nor a "plant".
* On the night of October 23, 1997, Art interviewed Harlot the Witch (Patsy).
* In 1997, [[Cusco (band)|Cusco]]'s Michael Holm, the group's leader, revealed that a song on [[Apurimac III]] – Nature Spirit Pride – "Pahrump-Big Water" was titled in recognition of Art Bell and ''Coast to coast.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cuscomusic.com/bio.html|title=Bio|publisher=OFFICIAL WEBSITE OF CUSCO|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101030101022/http://www.cuscomusic.com/bio.html|archivedate=October 30, 2010}}{{Failed verification|date=July 2010}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2010}}
* In 1998, Bell received two faxes from [[John Titor]], a self-proclaimed time traveler from 2036, who made many fantastic predictions and discussed time travel.
* In a 1997 show, Art bell interviewed a gentleman claiming to be a time traveler from the year 2063. He was known as Single Seven, a rank in the time travel unit he was in.
* In the mid to late 1990s, a regular caller named "Fritz" would call in and give his view on various matters.
* In the mid to late 1990s, another regular caller known only as "Charlie Liberal" used to call with his perspectives on current events.
* "Bugs" – An aging farmer who has repeatedly told of his account of shooting and burying two [[Bigfoot]] creatures back in the 1970s in the [[Texas Panhandle]], initially thinking they were bears. Bugs has mailed a map of the location of this "burial" to Art Bell, to be released to the public upon Bugs' death. During his first appearance in 1996, Bugs said he had taken a dozen [[Instant film|Polaroid]] photos of the creatures he would be willing to send to Bell. None of the alleged photos have yet been made available.
* A caller in 2000 named "Daniel Murray" claimed he was a [[Majestic 12|Majestic]] agent from Downey, California.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
** This call served as the inspiration for the [[alternate reality game]] ''[[Majestic (video game)|Majestic]].''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/technology/feature/2001/08/10/majestic/index.html|title=Paranoia for fun and profit – CIA|last=Brown|first=Janelle|date=August 10, 2001|publisher=Salon.com}}</ref>
* In 2003, Chris Clements, a freelance writer with the ''Washington Post,'' called Bell to tell him he had evidence of a financial connection between the [[Bush family]] and the [[Bin Laden family|Bin Ladens]]. Clements went on further to tell of how his research showed that 9/11 may have been orchestrated by the Bush family and hinted at proof of a coming [[police state]] with secret prisons and the chipping of citizens. Clements promised to forward all of his information to Bell but it was reported{{By whom|date=February 2011}} that Clements died in a suspicious car crash in the weeks after his call.
* In October 2003, Bell interviewed Temple of the Vampire representative Nemo. Nemo spoke about the Temple of the Vampire's beliefs and practices.
* In February 2005, Bell received a call from a person calling himself "Oscar", proclaiming to be "the Son of [[Satan]]".  Oscar had since also called George Noory, but disappeared after a June 2007 on-air confrontation with J.C.
* In March 2005 a man also called about disturbing events on [[Kwajalein]] and [[Johnston Atoll]] about a weapon that only targeted certain people and could leave others unhurt. He indicated he had been on both islands (that are US military only) and that these weapons had been tested in 1993. Bell lost the call after another voice came on the line with a click saying: "Shelton, terminate the call from A-6." Art tried to call the man back but was unsuccessful.
* In 2009, David Van Dyke, a photojournalist with [[Metro News Canada]], called into ''Coast-to-Coast'' (guest-hosted by Art Bell that night) and warned listeners that Toronto would become a testing ground for police tactics and subverting citizens at a soon to be announced global summit. Weeks after the call Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] announced that Toronto would play host to the [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit|G20 summit]]. Van Dyke, also a Toronto citizen, returned to the show after the announcement and declared that Toronto's downtown would be "stripped of everything not bolted down. Even trees and sticks will be removed, so that the oligarchy could not be touched." Van Dyke went missing shortly after the second call. Van Dyke resurfaced in mid-2010 following the G20 Summit in Toronto and was interviewed on local news channel [[CP24]] while protesting outside a court hearing for G20 detainees. Van Dyke claimed he was held against his will in a stone-block room for "what felt like years" while being subjected to various psychological stress tactics. "German [[industrial metal music]] blasted frequently. A bright [[strobe light]] came on intermittently, and when it wasn't on a TV constantly played a loop of [[interracial porn]]," Van Dyke told CP24. He also claimed he was only fed raw steak and agents "dressed in pink bunny costumes" shouted anti-Marxist slogans at him. At this point the interview was abruptly ended by the reporter.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Retirements and comebacks==
Bell has retired and returned to ''Coast to Coast AM'' several times.

His first retirement was highly unexpected by his listeners, and was announced on October 13, 1998. Bell spoke of "an event, a threatening terrible event occurred to my family, which I could not tell you about. Because of that event, and a succession of other events, what you're listening to right now is my final broadcast on the air."<ref>[[The Seattle Times]]" 10-13-98</ref> [[Hilly Rose]] filled in after Bell's departure. Bell returned on October 28, 1998, asserting that the brief departure was brought on by threats made against his family. On May 29, 1999, Art Bell explained that this retirement was due to an allegation made by hosts of [[WWCR]] [[shortwave]] radio that Bell had paid to cover up a criminal indictment.<ref>"[[The Washington Post]]" 5-29-99</ref> The facts of the matter became public knowledge in 2000, when it was revealed that an actual criminal indictment was filed against a person who had assaulted a member of Bell's family. Because of the nature of the crime, Bell had wanted to keep the matter private. The hosts at WWCR shortwave radio had accused Bell of the crime, and Bell took legal action against the hosts and stations, which was settled in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/F0005.html|title=Statement Regarding Art Bell Lawsuit|first=October 20, 2000|publisher=coasttocoastam.com|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20001202164100/http://www.coasttocoastam.com/F0005.html|archivedate=2 December 2000}}</ref>

On April 1, 2000, Bell again announced to his retirement, which would occur on April 26, 2000,<ref>''[[The Washington Post]]'' 4-1-00</ref> but offered no details other than expressing intentions to "resolve a family crisis." On April 11, 2000, [[Mike Siegel]] was introduced as the new host of ''Coast to Coast AM'', taking over on April 27, to an estimated audience of 22 million listeners.<ref>"The Seattle Times" 4-12-00</ref> It was later explained that Bell had left to deal with the aftermath of a sexual assault against his son. Brian Lepley, a substitute teacher, was convicted of sexual assault and attempted transmission of HIV and was sentenced to 10 to 25 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/May%2007-Tue-2002/news/18691181.html|title=Ex-teacher sentenced in sex case|last=Thevenot|first=Carri Geer|date=May 7, 2002|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]}}{{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref> Bell returned to ''Coast to Coast AM'' in February 2001. Bell noted that since his departure the show had lost a number of affiliates, commercial content had risen to an unbearable level, and Siegel had taken the program in a "different direction" of which Bell disapproved. Bell retained some authority over the program as its creator and felt his return was necessary.

On October 23, 2002, Bell announced he would be retiring due to recurring back pain, the result of a fall from a telephone pole during his youth. Bell was replaced by [[George Noory]] as weekday host of ''Coast to Coast AM'' on January 1, 2003. It was also said that [[Barbara Simpson]] would host weekends and that Bell planned to be an occasional guest host for Noory.<ref>Most information from "The Seattle Times" 10-26-02</ref> Bell returned in September 2003 as a weekend host, replacing [[Barbara Simpson]] and [[Ian Punnett]] as host of the Saturday and Sunday evening broadcasts. In June 2005, he scaled this schedule back, calling it a "semiretirement", and hosted only the last two Sundays of every month. Bell went back to hosting every weekend show as his schedule permitted after his wife Ramona’s death a few months later.

On July 1, 2007, Bell announced his retirement stating that he wished to spend more time with his new wife and daughter. He made it explicitly clear that, unlike the circumstances surrounding previous retirements, this decision was an entirely positive and joyful one and that he would not disappear completely, announcing an intention to occasionally substitute for other hosts and host "special" shows. According to George Noory, Bell is on board to do 15 shows per year.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Art Bell confirmed this fact in a post on the Fantastic Forum fan site.

==Events of 2006==
Bell's life took some dramatic twists in the beginning of 2006:

===Death of Ramona Bell===
Ramona Bell, his wife of 15 years, died unexpectedly,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/nevada/2006/jan/07/010710429.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060110205954/http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/nevada/2006/jan/07/010710429.html|archivedate=10 January 2006|title=Stories published January 7, 2006|date=January 7, 2006|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]}}</ref> at the age of 47, of what appeared to be an acute [[asthma]] attack on January 5, 2006 in [[Laughlin, Nevada]], where the couple were taking a short vacation.

The events surrounding Ramona's death were described in great detail by Art Bell during the January 22 broadcast of ''Coast to Coast AM''. For weeks thereafter, callers would express their sadness and sympathy for Art Bell to [[George Noory]], who had taken Art Bell's place weekdays in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2006/01/22 |title=Coast to Coast AM. Sunday January 22nd, 2006 |publisher=Coasttocoastam.com |accessdate= June 7, 2012}}</ref>

===Change in schedule===
On January 21, 2006, 16 days after the unexpected death of his wife Ramona, Bell announced he would host ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' every Saturday and Sunday evening, and that former weekend host [[Ian Punnett]] would work a new live prefeed program for the four hours preceding Bell's slot on Saturday nights (9:00&nbsp;pm – 1:00&nbsp;am [[North American Eastern Time Zone|ET]]). Punnett's show was titled ''[[Coast to Coast AM#Coast to Coast Live|Coast to Coast Live]] with [[Ian Punnett]]''. When returning to the show the following day, Bell spent the first hour recounting the death of his wife.

===New Marriage===
By the end of January, Bell began hinting that he was making a significant life decision, but that he would keep it a secret for at least one year, asking listeners to remind him in 2007 to let them in on it. By March, he was saying that he would soon take a "huge risk" and "do something rash".  On April 15, 2006, he ended the mystery and, to the mild surprise of listeners, revealed that, after several weeks of mourning, he had recently gone to the [[Philippines]] and married Airyn Ruiz,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.unknowncountry.com/news/?id=5222|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060423044345/http://www.unknowncountry.com/news/?id=5222|archivedate=23 April 2006|title=Art Bell Remarries|date=April 16, 2006|work=Whitley Strieber's Unknown Country}}</ref> whose name is pronounced like the name "Irene," but Art likes to pronounce her name as "Arin." This is because during their [[Online dating service|Internet dating]] Art imprinted the spelling of her name with that pronunciation. Airyn Ruiz Bell is a recent college graduate. Ruiz – given Bell's private e-mail address by an amateur radio friend – had contacted Bell to offer condolences shortly after Ramona's death. After "dating" via Internet [[videoconferencing]] for "hundreds of hours," the two married one week after Bell arrived in the Philippines to actually meet her in person. Bell also paid for his friend – who was courting Airyn's sister – to accompany him to the Philippines and marry her. The two couples wed in a double marriage ceremony on April 11, 2006.

On October 7, 2006, Bell announced on ''Coast to Coast'' that Ruiz was pregnant with the couple's first child. Art told listeners that the couple's child was indeed a girl as many listeners suspected. He noted that they had been hoping for a girl and had announced only a girl's name for their unborn child in hopes of receiving a girl.

Art and Airyn's baby girl, Asia Rayne Bell, was born by [[caesarean section]] on May 30, 2007.

===Relocation to the Philippines===
At the same time, Bell announced he would be leaving his longtime homestead in [[Nevada]] and relocating to the [[Philippines]], near [[Makati]], [[Metro Manila]], intending to continue hosting ''Coast to Coast AM'' weekend editions via an [[ISDN]] connection. He departed the United States on April 29, 2006, stating an intention to remain abroad for at least a year, while maintaining ownership of his property in [[Nevada]] and of the radio station [[KNYE]]. Bell resumed hosting on June 18, 2006 but then encountered technical problems that kept him off air until July 23, 2006, when the ISDN line was finally installed.

In July 2001, the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' printed an email letter purportedly from Bell that made derogatory statements about Filipinos. This letter was subsequently demonstrated to be a hoax perpetrated upon Bell, who in fact had a publicly loving relationship with his Filipina wife and his previous wife Ramona, who was also Filipina, and who often spoke openly about his admiration for the Filipino people on his radio show. Subsequently, the ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'' printed a retraction and apologized for printing the statement upon their verification of the hoax.

In October 2006, Bell threatened [[Rogers Cadenhead]] with a lawsuit for some allegedly libelous comments posted on Cadenhead's blog, which Cadenhead has said he will defend himself against under [[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act|Section 230]] of the [[Communications Decency Act]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://workbench.cadenhead.org/news/3042/art-bell-threatens-lawsuit-over-weblog|title=Art Bell Threatens Lawsuit Over Weblog Comments|last=Cadenhead|first=Rogers|date=23 October 2006}}</ref>

===Return to "the High Desert and the Great American Southwest"===
Bell opened his December 28, 2006 program by disclosing to his stunned listeners that he had just relocated back to [[Pahrump, Nevada]], with Ruiz, who had obtained the necessary paperwork for immigrating to the United States. Bell had not disclosed on any previous show his plans to return to the High Desert. Despite feeling jet-lagged after a 15-hour flight from the Philippines via [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, he did the full show. Bell was aloft returning to the States when an [[2006 Hengchun earthquake|earthquake]] cut off [[Submarine communications cable|undersea cables]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://submarinenetworks.com/news/cables-cut-after-taiwan-earthquake-2006 |title=Submarine Cables Cut after Taiwan Earthquake in December 2006 |publisher=Submarine Cable Networks |date=19 March 2011 |author=Winston Qiu |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref> that would have prevented his broadcasts from the Philippines. Bell indicated on his December 30, 2006 show that among the reasons for his return were a recent recirculation of the infamous fake anti-Filipino email,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bargainprofessor.wordpress.com/2006/10/19/art-bells-alleged-hate-letter-to-the-filipino-people/|title=Art Bell’s Alleged Hate Letter to the Filipino People|last=Voice|first=Just A|date=October 19, 2006|work=The Compass Blog|publisher=[[WordPress.com]]}}</ref> and his homesickness for his elaborate stateside Amateur Radio station.

==Events of 2007==
On May 30, 2007, at 12:51&nbsp;pm PDT, daughter Asia Rayne Bell was born by planned [[caesarean section]].

On July 1, 2007 at 10:10&nbsp;pm PDT, Art Bell announced his retirement from regular hosting effective that day, expressing a desire to spend more time with his family. Bell stated that he will only host occasionally on ''Coast to Coast''.

==Events of 2008==
On May 23, 2008, Bell, while hosting ''Coast to Coast AM'', stated that there would be a change in the artbell.com website in July 2008. Within a few weeks the website was no longer responding to requests and had even dropped from [[DNS]].

On May 29, 2008 Bell sold [[KNYE]] to Station Manager Karen Jackson.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.knye.com/pahrumpradioinc_009.htm|work=Kingdom of KNYE|accessdate=July 28, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110717142833/http://www.knye.com/pahrumpradioinc_009.htm| archivedate= July 17, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

On September 8, 2008, Noory stated that he would be hosting the annual ''Ghost to Ghost AM'' Halloween call-in show rather than Bell, who normally returns to the ''Coast to Coast'' to host it (along with the New Year's prediction shows). On September 19, Noory explained that Bell would be unavailable because he was on a cruise during that time this year.

On November 30, 2008, Bell hosted ''Coast to Coast AM''. [[Michio Kaku]] was the guest. This was the first time Bell had hosted the show since May 23, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2008/11/30.html |title=Future Technology & Parallel Worlds - Shows |publisher=Coast to Coast AM |date=2008-11-30 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref> On December 23, Bell's mother, Jane, died. George Noory informed ''Coast to Coast'' listeners of her death during that night's show, with a number of callers offering Bell their condolences regarding the death of Bell's mother.

On December 30 and 31, 2008, Bell once again hosted his annual New Year's predictions special of ''Coast to Coast''. Bell remarked on his mother's death and stated that he was very happy that she got to spend time with his daughter, Asia, before she died.

==Events of 2009==
Art Bell returned to ''Coast to Coast AM'' on February 20, 2009, for a discussion on the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010|global financial crisis]] with Wall St. insider Michael J. Panzner. Bell and Panzer agreed the United States was headed for an economic depression.

Art Bell was scheduled to return to ''Coast to Coast AM'' on April 24, 2009, to host an evening of open lines, but because of engineering problems in Manila, Art was rescheduled to a later date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2009/04/24 |title=Open Lines with Richard Syrett – Shows |publisher=Coast to Coast AM |date=April 24, 2009 |accessdate= June 7, 2012}}</ref>

On May 17, 2009, Bell returned to host ''Coast to Coast AM'' live from Manila. His guest was professor [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]]. Topics of discussion were mass extinctions, earth's "self-destructive" phenomena, and life beyond planet earth. While on the air, Art answered an email question from a listener who asked why he was in the Philippines again and how long he'd be there. Art replied that he'd address it on "Friday" and hinted that his move might be permanent.

As of May 20, 2009, the ''Coast to Coast'' website listed that Art Bell would be filling in for George Noory on Friday, May 22, 2009 to interview Dr. [[Bob Koontz]]. However, Art Bell did not do that show. The ''Coast to Coast'' website, again, cited technical difficulties in Manila and that his interview would be postponed. Bell interviewed Koontz on Saturday, June 6, 2009.

Friday June 26, 2009 Bell hosted ''Coast to Coast AM'' from Manila with guest Dr. [[Dean Radin]]. He also commented on the [[death of Michael Jackson]] and how he had lived in Pahrump, Nevada not too far away from where Art lived.

Friday November 20, 2009 Bell hosted ''Coast to Coast AM'' from Manila with guest Starfire Tor, psi researcher and experiencer who discussed time shifts and time slips, and other strange occurrences of time. During the first 90 minutes, they were joined by [[Whitley Strieber]], who shared his take on Tor's research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2009/11/20 |title=Time Anomalies – Shows |publisher=Coast to Coast AM |date=November 20, 2009 |accessdate= June 7, 2012}}</ref>

On Wednesday, December 30 and Thursday, December 31, 2009, Bell once again hosted his annual New Year's predictions special of ''Coast to Coast'', noting that a number of the predictions this year were of an unusual and interesting nature and not mere repeats of many that had come before, though he also took several callers to task for seemingly veiling their obvious political agendas or wishes in the form of predictions, rather than offering up something from their "psychic center," which is what he repeatedly asks for during the prediction show. He also suggested that maybe Coast to Coast AM should institute some sort of prize or acknowledgment for listeners whose predictions are particularly accurate or astute.

===Immigration controversy===
In late 2008, Bell filed an I-751 with the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] in order to get his wife a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]]. In early 2009 the USCIS responded that they would need additional evidence to prove that Bell's marriage to a Filipina national and subsequent green card application therefore was in good faith. Bell responded with evidence including their marriage license, their daughter's birth certificate, Bell's last will and testament, bank records, family photos, and Social Security forms. Bell sent the package to the USCIS by return receipt mail, and he subsequently received the return receipt stamped "USCIS RECEIVED JAN-15-09."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/cimages/var/ezwebin_site/storage/images/coast-to-coast/repository/photos/art-s-postal-receipts/409589-1-eng-US/Art-s-Postal-Receipts.jpg |title=USCIS Received Jan-15-09 |publisher=Coasttocoast.com |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref>

On March 10, 2009, Bell and his wife and daughter left Nevada for Manila to deal with some family business including the disposition of a condo they owned. Shortly thereafter, the USCIS denied the application on the grounds that the documentary evidence was never received, and further stipulated that Airyn Bell is not permitted to re-enter the United States, which is why Bell remains in the Philippines. Moreover, since the Bells were out of the country when the application was denied, they must start the process all over again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/art-bell-s-wife-denied-u-s-visa |title=Art Bell's Wife Denied U.S. Visa - Articles |publisher=Coast to Coast AM |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref>

On his June 6 broadcast, Bell explained the situation and asked his listeners to send emails on his behalf to the White House.

Recently, George Noory announced that he has heard from Art, that the immigration controversy is over, and that Airyn has been granted permanent residency.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Events of 2010–13==
Art Bell hosted 10 episodes in 2010, 5 short of his publicly announced, contractually specified quota of 15 shows per year. His last hosting gig was his annual ''Ghost to Ghost'' show on Halloween night (this was the first show ever wherein Art used call screeners). At the end of that broadcast, Bell said "When they next call my name we'll come back and we'll do this one more time."

As of December 2010 Art Bell was no longer listed as a host on the ''Coast to Coast'' website; his shows were no longer searchable under his name; and the only references to Bell on the site were of an historical/archival nature. However, the weekly ''Somewhere in Time with Art Bell'' broadcasts of classic Bell-hosted episodes (which have aired before the live show on Saturday nights since 2006) were not discontinued.

On December 21, 2010 the "HamCam" on Art's ham radio website<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usadigitalmedia.com/Coast/bellcam.htm |title=Art Bell's Web Camera |publisher=Usadigitalmedia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref> featured an image with the following cryptic wording: "The Wind No Longer Blows, in the End it was Without Direction. Long Live the Hot Air. 30" "[[-30-]]" is journalistic shorthand for "end of story."

It was announced in late December 2010 that Ian Punnett would host Art's annual two-part New Year's Eve prediction shows. Initially, Noory had said that Art was unable to host them because he would be traveling, but on December 24, 2010 Noory said: "We had asked Art to do his predictions show; he's going to spend time with his family. He's winding down, folks, he's winding down....I don't anticipate he'll do any more shows." On the first of the two nights (December 30, 2010), Punnett made a brief, oblique reference to his having the honor of "picking up (Art's) fallen mantle." On the January 1, 2011 show, Punnett stated he was "looking forward to doing the follow-up a year from now."

In email interactions with fans who have written in to inquire about Bell's absence, Coast personnel have confirmed that Art Bell has retired. According to Coast webmaster Lex Lonehood: "Art Bell decided he no longer wished to do live C2C shows, and asked that his name be removed from the host listings accordingly. Classics and Somewhere in Time shows will continue as is."<ref>[http://www.coastgab.com/index.php/topic,2136.390.html] {{login}}{{dead link|date=June 2014}}</ref> Coast producer Lisa Lyon told another fan that Bell "has chosen to retire," but that "Art Bell will always be associated with our show, and he is welcome back to the mic whenever he feels the need."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://s3.zetaboards.com/Tranquility/topic/7445290/3/ |title=Art Bell has quit Coast |publisher=S3.zetaboards.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref>

Despite the above remarks from Punnett, Noory, Lyon, Lonehood and Bell, as of 01/06/11, an official public statement formally confirming Bell's departure from ''Coast to Coast AM'' has yet to be made via press release, website announcement or on-air, by any party with the authority to do so—the show's producers, Premier Radio Networks, Clear Channel Communications, or Art Bell himself. This lack of information has led to rampant speculation among Bell's fanbase as to the motivations and circumstances behind Bell's sudden absence; whether he has given his last live broadcast; and what—if anything—he may decide to do next.

During a chat on February 8, 2011, events became even more confusing for Bell's fans as George Noory, during a public chat responding to a question on Art Bell, stated that Art Bell isn't responding to his emails. The questioner, "Coalspeaker," asked "Have you spoken to Art Bell lately? And if so is he and his family doing well?" Noory responded by saying, "No I haven't. Art has decided to retire for good this time. I assume all is well for him and his family. He has gone through many ups and downs. I sent him a very lengthy email a few months ago, and he never responded. Though he normally would."<ref>[http://www.coastgab.com/index.php/topic,2136.msg33538.html#msg33538] {{login}}{{dead link|date=June 2014}}</ref> There was no further explanation beyond that point on why Art Bell did not respond to Mr. Noory's email, although it only led Bell's fanbase to speculate further.

In March 2011 a Facebook profile appeared claiming to be the legitimate page of "Arthur W. Bell III," who posted hints that there would be a "big announcement" at the end of April 2011. After much speculation and debate among fans and friends on that page and various Bell forums, and finally after direct intervention from a verified Art Bell account, the "Arthur W. Bell III" page was proven to be a hoax, with no "big announcement" imminent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasticforum.com/1res/showthread.php?s=086cc9bda056c5e686b3de48622c0459&postid=653454 |title=Fantastic Forum 4-15-11 |publisher=Fantasticforum.com |accessdate= June 7, 2012}}</ref>

On July 20, 2011, Art Bell announced via his Facebook page that he had relocated with his family to Pahrump, Nevada. Subsequent posts indicate Art and his family initially focusing on resettling his house and making it "fit for human habitation" again, giving no indication about his radio plans, if any (beyond maintaining his HAM activity). However, on July 30, Bell posted the following: "There is so much to do and only so many hours in the day. There are things going on in the background that I will talk about at the proper time. The move was a big one and we need time to adjust."

On August 19, 2011 Art Bell announced via Facebook "Phrase for the day......Stay tuned!", followed on August 31 by the message "Sorry for so few posts but we are working on this house every day like dogs, much more soon." Some Bell fans voiced speculation that the phrase "stay tuned" may have been meant to indicate Art's return to broadcasting in some form, but 2011 ended with no such announcement forthcoming, though shortly before Christmas he did report that a malfunctioning fire extinguisher in his radio room caused tens of thousands of dollars worth of damage to his equipment and house.

On August 20, 2012, Art spoke of his grievances on [[Facebook]] with Premiere Radio stations, claiming that he would soon tell the full story of the truth of his retirement. "I am just about ready to tell the real story of my so called 'Retirements' I have asked Premiere to stop the Saturday broadcasts and thus far they have not done so as is there (sic) legal right. Free speech remains my right, I will soon exercise it."

On November 1, 2012, Bell updated his Facebook status with the following:  "I wish my name was no longer associated with what Coast has become!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horrorreport.com/2012/11/art-bell-speaks.html |title=Because it's a scary world: Art Bell speaks! |publisher=Horror Report |date=2012-11-01 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref>

===Art Bell's Return to Radio, September 2013 on SiriusXM Satellite Radio===
In January 2013, Bell announced via Facebook, "I am now in negotiation for a new Radio show, stay tuned. No promises but the wind may be about to change direction!"<ref>{{cite web

"I guess it is time to end any further speculation that I will return to the air any time soon. I have given (2) very solid offers a lot of thought and have turned them down. My reasons are many, though I am profoundly sad at the current state of the show, both offers would have been direct competition with Coast and anger is the wrong reason to proceed. Also I really do not want to destroy what I built despite its current state. Asia will be in first grade in the Fall and getting up very early, I would be up late and sleeping late, I would not see much of her or Airyn. Life is short and I want to spend what I have left with my Family. I hope my friends understand..."{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In June 2013, Art Bell announced on his Facebook page that his official website, artbell.com, would be relaunching. On July 10, 2013 a red, white, and blue textual representation of a smiley face was displayed on the website. The site's [[favicon]] is a picture of a grey alien.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artbell.com/ |title=Art Bell official website |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref>
On July 11, 2013, the smiley face was replaced with a red, white, and blue Morse code script that translated to "WANNA TAKE A RIDE?".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artbell.com/ |title=Art Bell official website |deadurl=no |accessdate=July 11, 2013}}</ref>

On July 29, 2013, Art Bell officially announced a return to the airwaves with a launch date of September 16, 2013. His new show ''[[Art Bell's Dark Matter]]'' broadcasts on SiriusXM satellite radio's Indie Talk channel (channel #104), Monday through Thursday from 7 PM to 11 PM [[Pacific Time Zone|PT]] <!-- broadcast time will not be Standard Time during Daylight Saving Time, so "S" was removed from "PST" rather than changing this biennially from "PST" to "PDT" or vice-versa --> with repeats during the remainder of the night and "best of" shows airing on Fridays.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bauder |first=David |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/radios-art-bell-returning-sirius-xm-show |title=Radio's Art Bell returning with Sirius XM show |publisher=Bigstory.ap.org |date=2013-07-30 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref> His official website was updated on that date to include the announcement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artbell.com/ |title=Dark Matter |publisher=Art Bell |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref>

On November 4, 2013, Art left Dark Matter after only 6 weeks.<ref name="artbell.com"/><ref name="Speigel"/>

On November 7, 2013, Art Bell announced and began testing for potential Internet streaming sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artbell.com/testing-a-potential-live-streaming-solution/ |title=LIVE Streaming Now on Dark Matter Radio Network |publisher=Art Bell |date=2012-11-19 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref>

===Art Bell's 24/7 Radio Network===
In November 2013, Art Bell launched his 24/7 online radio network run by Keith Rowland which streams live from his website Darkmatterradio.net. The current lineup has shows such as Dark Weekend, Fade to Black, Podcast UFO, Skywatchers Radio, The Malliard Report, among others.

Art Bell plans to use this network to host his own radio show once his non compete clause can be worked out with Sirius XM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artbell.com/dark-matter-radio-schedule/ |title=Dark Matter Radio Network Launched |publisher=Art Bell |date=November 18, 2013 |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref>

==Feud with George Noory==
Art Bell started a short lived show, 'Dark Matter,' on Sirius, which was ended due to Sirius' decision not to provide an internet streaming service. Art Bell stated that the decision to come out of retirement was his, and was a response to Noory having "ruined" the franchise by taking it in a political [[talk radio]] direction, with conspiracy theorist [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]] as a regular guest. Bell wanted to see a return to the open-minded exploration of the supernatural that had defined his own earlier tenure.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dickey |first=Jack |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2151794,00.html#ixzz2ehU9iB4g |title=Insomniac Radio King Art Bell Reclaims His Crown |publisher=Time |date=September 23, 2013 |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref>
Noory has previously stated that Art Bell was "winding down."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37gWjbnAveA |title=George Noory Comments On What Happened To Art Bell |publisher=YouTube |date=September 22, 2013 |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref> Bell was critical of the recent firing of popular Saturday host [[John B. Wells]] by Coast to Coast, even though Wells often tackled controversial political subjects that Bell usually avoided.

On a show in September 2013, Noory was a guest on [[David John Oates]]'s show,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/oates-david-john/64282 |title=David John Oates - Guests |publisher=Coast to Coast AM |date=September 5, 2013 |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref> Oates being a guest who was banned by Art Bell. Bell sued Oates and Robert Stephens, of Montana, for "seeking to malign, harass, cyberstalk, defame, injure and annoy" Bell by making false and defamatory statements, including calling him "crazy" and suggesting that Bell had been arrested on pornography-related charges. Bell's suit stated that several witnesses had reported hearing Oates accuse Bell of pedophilia. This was proven to be 100% false. As a result Oates was banned from Coast to Coast and had to publically apologize to Art Bell.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/38240/art-bell-s-strange-days |title=Art Bell's Strange Days |publisher=E! Online UK |date=May 30, 1999 |accessdate=December 3, 2013 |author=Joal Ryan }}</ref>

After Bell and Sirius mutually agreed to end the Dark Matter Show on Sirius due to them failing to provide a stable stream, George Noory took that time slot.

==Books==
Bell has written, or co-written, several books. They include ''[[The Quickening: Today's Trends, Tomorrow's World]]''; ''[[The Art of Talk]]'' (an autobiography); ''The Source: Journey Through the Unexplained''; ''[[The Edge: Man's Mysterious Past & Incredible Future]]''; and ''[[The Coming Global Superstorm]]'' (co-authored with [[Whitley Streiber]]), which became the basis for the popular movie, ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''.

==Other work==
In 1996 Bell appeared in an episode of the NBC science fiction series ''[[Dark Skies]]'' as [[William S. Paley]], head of CBS.

On September 30, 1998 NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' aired a taped segment of reporter Fred Francis interviewing Bell. Francis questioned Bell about Hale-Bopp, Area-51, eccentric callers claiming to be "six-fingered alien hybrids" as well as the UFO sighting experienced by Bell and his wife Ramona. The segment also featured members of Bell's audience reacting to topics being discussed.

In 1999 Bell appeared as himself on the series ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]''. The episode called "Collateral Damage" aired in the third season and dealt with a former U.S. soldier who claimed the government he fought for was indeed responsible for horrendous tests on soldiers and Iraqi civilians. (This episode was broadcast on January 22, 1999. The Washington Post, 1-22-99.)

In 1999 Bell was interviewed on ''[[Larry King Live]]''. (This was broadcast on March 5, 1999. The Washington Post, 3-5-99.)

Progressive rock band [[Tool (band)|Tool]]'s 2001 album, [[Lateralus]], featured a track entitled "Faaip de Oiad" ([[Enochian]] for "The Voice of God"), which includes a clip of the "distraught and terrified" Area 51 employee call from September 11, 1997.

In 2005 Bell and then-wife Ramona were featured on the ABC news special: ''[[Peter Jennings]] Reporting: UFOs&nbsp;— Seeing Is Believing,'' which reported on the entire scope of the [[UFO]] experience, from the first famous sighting by [[Kenneth Arnold]] in 1947 to the present day. (This was broadcast on February 24, 2005. The Washington Post, 2-20-05.)

In 2005 snippets of Bell and callers to his show were featured on the song "Conspiracy Radio" on [[Sean Hogan]]'s album "Catalina Sunrise": Bell is credited for "voice overs" on this track.

In 2006 Bell was featured in the video game ''[[Prey (video game)|Prey]]'' and played himself. He hosts, as in real life, ''Coast to Coast AM'', and the player is able to listen to the broadcast at several terminals throughout the game. The broadcasts describe what is happening on Earth as the game unfolds. The game plot centers around a massive space ship and alien abductions. Bell receives a number of calls about people who have seen smaller craft as they abduct people. The protagonist is one of these people and listens to the radio while on the space ship.

In 2007, Bell appeared as himself in the movie ''[[I Know Who Killed Me]]''.

In [[Euclidean geometry]], '''Carnot's theorem''' states that the sum of the [[signed distance]]s from the [[circumcenter]] ''D'' to the sides of an arbitrary triangle ''ABC'' is 

:<math>DF + DG + DH = R + r,\ </math>

where ''r'' is the [[inradius]] and ''R'' is the [[circumradius]] of the triangle. Here the sign of the [[distances]] is taken negative if and only if the [[line segment]] ''DX'' (''X'' = ''F'', ''G'', ''H'') lies completely outside the triangle. In the picture ''DF'' is negative and both ''DG'' and ''DH'' are positive.

The theorem is named after [[Lazare Carnot]] (1753&ndash;1823). It is used in a proof of the [[Japanese theorem for concyclic polygons]].

The '''Algemeen Dagblad''' or '''AD''' (founded 1946) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] daily newspaper. After a merger with 7 regional newspapers on 1 september 2005 and ongoing reduction in readership, it has an average circulation merger of 365,912 copies in 2014.<ref name=daalt>http://www.telegraaf.nl/dft/bedrijven/telegraaf/22190489/__Betaalde_oplage_grootste_kranten_daalt_verder__.html</ref> This makes it the second largest paid newspaper of the [[Netherlands]], after [[De Telegraaf]] (488,902 copies).<ref name=daalt/> AD is published in tabloid format. Production of the newspaper is in [[Rotterdam]]. The publication employs 550 journalists in the Netherlands and abroad. The AD is owned by [[De Persgroep Nederland]].

== History ==
In September 2005, the company merged with several regional newspapers. The regional newspapers disappeared and instead the AD includes a regional supplement in the districts previously served by these regional papers. Two of them, the AD Haagsche Courant (for The Hague region) and the AD Rotterdams Dagblad (for the Rotterdam region) appear in both a morning and an evening edition.

An '''Application Service Provider''' ('''ASP''') is a business providing computer-based services to customers over a network; such as access to a particular software application (such as [[customer relationship management]]) using a standard protocol (such as [[HTTP]]).

The need for ASPs has evolved from the increasing costs of specialized software that have far exceeded the price range of small to medium sized businesses. As well, the growing complexities of software have led to huge costs in distributing the software to end-users. Through ASPs, the complexities and costs of such software can be cut down. In addition, the issues of upgrading have been eliminated from the end-firm by placing the onus on the ASP to maintain up-to-date services, 24 x 7 technical support, physical and electronic security and in-built support for [[business continuity]] and flexible working.

The importance of this marketplace is reflected by its size. {{As of|2003|alt=As of early 2003}}, estimates of the [[United States]] market range from 1.5 to 4 billion dollars. Clients for ASP services include businesses, government organizations, non-profits, and membership organizations.

==Provider types==
There are several forms of ASP business. These are:
*A '''specialist''' or '''functional''' ASP delivers a single application, such as credit card payment processing or [[timesheet]] services;
*A '''vertical market''' ASP delivers a solution package for a specific customer type, such as a dental practice;
*An '''enterprise''' ASP delivers broad spectrum solutions;
*A '''local''' ASP delivers [[small business]] services within a limited area.

Some analysts identify a '''volume''' ASP as a fifth type. This is basically a specialist ASP that offers a low cost packaged solution via their own website. [[PayPal]] was an instance of this type, and their volume was one way to lower the unit cost of each transaction.

In addition to these types, some large multi-line companies (such as [[HP]] and [[IBM]]), use ASP concepts as a particular business model that supports some specific customers.

==The ASP model==
The application software resides on the vendor's system and is accessed by users through a web browser using [[HTML]] or by special purpose client software provided by the vendor. Custom client software can also interface to these systems through [[XML]] [[API]]s. These [[API]]s can also be used where [[Saas integration|integration]] with in-house systems is required. ASPs may or may not use [[multitenancy]] in the deployment of software to clients; some ASPs offer an instance or license to each customer (for example using Virtualization), some deploy in a single instance multi-tenant access mode, now more frequently referred to as "SaaS".

Common features associated with ASPs include:
* ASP fully owns and operates the software application(s) - ALJO-IN
* ASP owns, operates and maintains the servers that support the software
* ASP makes information available to customers via the [[Internet]] or a "[[thin client]]"
* ASP bills on a "per-use" basis or on a monthly/annual fee

The advantages to this approach include:
* Software integration issues are eliminated from the client site
* Software costs for the application are spread over a number of clients
* Vendors can build more application experience than the in-house staff
* Key software systems are kept up to date, available, and managed for performance by experts
* Improved reliability, availability, scalability and security of internal IT systems
* A provider's [[service level agreement]] guarantees a certain level of service
* Access to product and technology experts dedicated to available products
* Reduction of internal IT costs to a predictable monthly fee
* Redeploying IT staff and tools to focus on strategic technology projects that impact the enterprise's bottom line

Some inherent disadvantages include:
* The client must generally accept the application as provided since ASPs can only afford a customized solution for the largest clients
* The client may rely on the provider to provide a critical business function, thus limiting their control of that function and instead relying on the provider
* Changes in the ASP market may result in changes in the type or level of service available to clients
* Integration with the client's non-ASP systems may be problematic

Evaluating an Application Service Provider security when moving to an ASP infrastructure can come at a high cost, as such a firm must assess the level of risk associated with the ASP itself. Failure to properly account for such risk can lead to:
* Loss of control of corporate data
* Loss of control of corporate image
* Insufficient ASP security to counter risks
* Exposure of corporate data to other ASP customers
* Compromise of corporate data
Some other risks include failure to account for the financial future of the ASP in general, i.e. how stable a company is and if it has the resources to continue business into the foreseeable future. For these reasons [[Cisco Systems]] has developed a comprehensive evaluation guideline. This guideline includes evaluating the scope of the ASP's service, the security of the program and the ASP's maturity with regard to security awareness. Finally the guidelines indicate the importance of performing audits on the ASP with respect to:
* Port/Network service
* Application vulnerability
* ASP Personnel
Physical visits to the ASP to assess the formality of the organization will provide invaluable insight into the awareness of the firm.

==History==
In terms of their common goal of enabling customers to [[Outsourcing|outsource]] specific computer applications so they can focus on their [[Core competency|core competencies]], ASPs may be regarded as the indirect descendant of the [[service bureau]]s of the 1960s and 1970s. In turn, those bureaus were trying to fulfill the vision of computing as a utility, which was first proposed by [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] in a speech at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1961. Jostein Eikeland, the founder of Telecomputing, is credited with coining the acronym ASP in 1996, according to ''Inc. Magazine''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/20000401/18093.html |title=Upstarts: ASPs, ASPs Article |publisher=Inc.com |date=2000-04-01 |accessdate=2013-01-19}}</ref>

==Comparisons==
The ASP model is often compared with [[Software as a Service]] (SaaS), but while the latter typically delivers a generic service at scale to many users, the former typically involved delivering a service to a small number of users (often using separate single-tenant instances). This meant that the many benefits of multi-tenancy (cost sharing, economies of scale, etc.) were not accessible to ASP providers, and their services were more comparable to in-house hosting than to true multi-tenant SaaS solutions like [[Salesforce]].

'''Agalega day gecko''' ('''''Phelsuma borbonica agalegae''''' <small>[[Anthony S. Cheke|Cheke]], 1975</small>) is a [[subspecies]] of [[gecko]]s.

==General introduction==

This diurnal gecko only lives on [[Agaléga]] Islands. It typically inhabits [[coconut tree]]s or [[cheval tree]]s. The Agalega day gecko feeds on [[insect]]s and [[nectar]].

==Description==
This lizard belongs to the medium-sized day geckos. Males are slightly larger than females and can reach a total length of about 16 cm whereas females measure only 13.5 cm. The basic body colour is grayish green. Both the head and the neck are yellow-brown. The tail and back can be bright turquoise. The flanks are grey or beige. The dorso-lateral bands are turquoise. On the back and tail there are brownish or red-brick coloured dots or bars.

==Distribution==
This species is endemic to the two Agalega islets.

==Habitat==
The two islands where ''P. borbonica agalega'' occurs, are small low coral sand island. On these islands are mainly coconut tree plantations. The Agalega day gecko is often found on these trees as well as on ''Terminalia spec.'' and mango trees.

==Diet==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar. 

==Behaviour==
This ''Phelsuma'' species is rather shy.
==Reproduction==

The pairing season is between April and the first weeks of September. During this period, the females lay up to 4 pairs of eggs, often under loose bark of coconut trees. Females often share the same location for their eggs. The young will hatch after approximately 70–100 days, depending on the temperature. The juveniles measure 45–50 mm.

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be between 24 and 30°C. During the night the temperature can drop to 18–22°C. The relative humidity should be maintained between 40 and 60% during the day and 75% at night. These animals can be fed with [[cricket]]s,  [[wax moth]]s, [[Tephritidae|fruit flies]], [[mealworm]]s and [[housefly|houseflies]].

'''Citrix Systems, Inc.''' is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[software]] company founded in 1989 that provides server, application and [[desktop virtualization]], networking, [[software-as-a-service]] (SaaS), and [[cloud computing]] technologies, including [[Xen]] open-source products.

Citrix currently services around 330,000 organizations worldwide<ref>[http://in.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=CTXS.OQ] "Citrix company profile" ''[[Reuters]]''</ref> and is based in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]], in the [[Miami metropolitan area]], with [[subsidiary]] operations in [[California]] and [[Massachusetts]], and additional development centers in  [[Canada]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[India]] and [[Australia]].

Following the acquisition of XenSource, Inc. in October 2007, Citrix started [[Leadership|spearheading]] the Xen open-source [[hypervisor]] project.<ref>[http://www.citrix.com/lang/English/lp/lp_680809.asp] "Citrix Unveils End-to-End Virtualization Strategy" ''citrix.co.uk''</ref>

== {{anchor|WinView}}History ==
Citrix was founded in [[Richardson, Texas]], in 1989 by former [[IBM]] developer [[Ed Iacobucci]] with $3 million in funding.<ref name=NetIndustries>{{cite web | author=NetIndustries | title=Citrix Systems, Inc. – Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Citrix Systems, Inc.  | publisher=NetIndustries | year=2002 | url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/98/Citrix-Systems-Inc.html }}</ref> Following its initial setup and development, Iacobucci moved the company to his former home of [[Coral Springs, Florida]].<ref name=NetIndustries/>

Citrix was originally named Citrus but changed its name after an existing company claimed trademark rights. The Citrix name is a [[portmanteau]] of [[Citrus Project|Citrus]] and [[UNIX]].

Many of the original founding members had participated in the IBM [[OS/2]] project. Iacobucci's vision was to build OS/2 with multiuser support. IBM was not interested in this idea, so Iacobucci left.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Iacobucci was offered a job at Microsoft as chief technical officer of its networking group but turned it down to start his own company.<ref name=NetIndustries/>

The company's first product was Citrix MULTIUSER, which was based on OS/2. Citrix licensed the OS/2 [[source code]] from [[Microsoft]], bypassing IBM. Citrix hoped to capture part of the UNIX market by making it easy to deploy text-based OS/2 applications. The product failed to find a market. This was due in part to Microsoft's declaring in 1991 that it was no longer going to support OS/2.<ref name=NetIndustries/>

Roger Roberts was appointed the CEO of Citrix in 1990. Roberts, a Texan, came from [[Texas Instruments]].

From 1989 to 1995, the company did not turn a profit. In 1989 and 1990 there was no income at all. Between 1991 and 1993, Citrix received funding from both Intel and Microsoft as well as venture capitalists. Without the help of this funding, Citrix would not have survived.<ref name=NetIndustries/>

In 1993, Citrix purchased the product "[[NetWare Access Server]]" from Novell. It was a remote-access application built on DOS and [[Quarterdeck Expanded Memory Manager]]. It provided desktop and applications from the server to multiple users in a similar way Terminal Servers still do. Citrix developed the product further and released it as WinView. It became Citrix's first successful product.

The company went public in December 1995.<ref name=NetIndustries/>

== Microsoft relationship ==
The Citrix and Microsoft relationship is based upon a 20-year alliance that began in 1989 when Citrix licensed the OS/2 source code.

Citrix obtained a source code license to Microsoft's [[Windows NT]] 3.51. In 1995, Citrix shipped a multiuser version of Windows NT with remote access known as [[Citrix WinFrame|WinFrame]]. This product was a unique offering targeting the needs of large enterprises.

During the development of WinFrame for Windows NT 4, Microsoft decided that it did not want to license Windows NT 4 source code to Citrix. Microsoft considered to build its own version of WinFrame. Citrix and Microsoft entered negotiations about how best to resolve this dilemma.<ref name=NetIndustries /><ref name=USAToday>{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Maney |title=Tiny tech firm does the unthinkable |work=USA Today |publisher=USA Today |date= June 11, 1997 |accessdate=November 4, 2008}}</ref> After negotiations, Microsoft agreed to license Citrix technology for Windows NT Server 4.0, resulting in [[Terminal Services|Windows Terminal Server Edition]].<ref name="MSJDA">{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1997/may97/hydrapr.mspx|title=Microsoft and Citrix Sign Technology Cross-Licensing and Development Agreement|accessdate=2008-10-24|publisher=Microsoft|year=1997|author=Microsoft|work=Microsoft PressPass – Information for Journalists}}</ref><ref name="SFBJ">{{Cite news|url=http://southflorida.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/1997/06/23/focus6.html|title=Citrix rebounds – after a close call with Bill Gates|accessdate=2008-10-24|publisher=American City Business Journals|author=Jim Freer|work=South Florida Business Journal|date=1997-06-23}}</ref> Citrix agreed not to ship a competing product but retained the right to sell an extension to Microsoft's products, initially under the name MetaFrame. This relationship continued into the [[Windows 2000 Server]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] eras, with Citrix offering Metaframe XP and Presentation Server. On February 11, 2008, Citrix changed the name of its Presentation Server product line to [[Citrix XenApp|XenApp]].

The core technology that Microsoft did not buy was the [[Independent Computing Architecture|ICA]] protocol. Microsoft derived the work for [[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP]] (T.share) protocol from [[Microsoft NetMeeting|NetMeeting]], which originally derived it from a deal with PictureTel (now known as [[Polycom]]).<ref name="VideoConfHistory">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nefsis.com/Best-Video-Conferencing-Software/video-conferencing-history.html|title=Video Conferencing History|accessdate=2008-10-23|publisher=Nefsis.com|year=2005|author=Nefsis.com|work=Video Conferencing History}}</ref>

In January 2008, Citrix announced an expanded alliance with Microsoft to deliver a set of virtualization solutions to address the desktop and server virtualization markets to ensure broad interoperability between their technologies.<ref name=Microsoft>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/jan08/01-21VirtualizationAdoptionPR.mspx |title=Microsoft Announces Vision and Strategy to Accelerate Virtualization Adoption |author=Microsoft |date=21 January 2008 |accessdate=4 May 2010 }}</ref>

In February 2009, Citrix extended its collaboration with Microsoft in the server virtualization market with “Project Encore”. This was heralded by a new product, Citrix Essentials, that offers advanced management for [[Windows Server 2008|Microsoft Windows Server 2008]] [[Hyper-V]]. Joint marketing, training and channel activities were conducted with Microsoft.<ref name=ZDNet>{{cite news | first=Dan | last= Kusnetzky | title=Citrix launches a free version of XenServer and Citrix Essentials | url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/virtualization/?p=723 | newspaper=ZDNet | date=23 February 2009 }}</ref>

These plans included:
*Technology integration so enterprise IT organisations can manage both distributed and centrally hosted applications using [[Citrix XenApp]] and [[System Center Configuration Manager|Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager]]
* Extension of XenApp support for [[Microsoft Application Virtualization]] (App-V) to enable self-service delivery of applications on any device using Citrix Receiver and Citrix Dazzle

'''''De Telegraaf''''' ({{IPA-nl|d? te?l??ra?f}}; {{lang-en|The Telegraph}}) is the largest [[Netherlands|Dutch]] daily morning [[newspaper]], with a daily circulation of approximately {{formatnum:488902}} (2013).<ref name="daalt">{{nl icon}} "[http://www.telegraaf.nl/dft/bedrijven/telegraaf/22190489/__Betaalde_oplage_grootste_kranten_daalt_verder__.html Betaalde oplage grootste kranten daalt verder]", ''De Telegraaf'', 2014.</ref> ''De Telegraaf'' is based in [[Amsterdam]]. [[Sjuul Paradijs]] is the editor-in-chief of the paper.

''De Telegraaf'' is owned by the [[Telegraaf Media Groep]], which also publishes the free daily ''[[Metro (Dutch newspaper)|Metro]]''.

==Editorial content==
This national newspaper contains many "sensational" and sports-related articles, and one or more pages the content of which is supplied by the [[gossip]]-magazine ''Privé'' ("Private"). The financial news coverage, however, is more serious in tone. The paper targets a broad audience, mostly in a conservative and populist style,<ref>{{cite book|last=Hermes|first=Joke|title=Re-reading Popular Culture|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2005|pages=39|isbn=978-1-4051-2245-0|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JoEGuRxG42cC&pg=PA39|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref> attracting specific target groups for the paper's advertisers.

The newspaper not only reports news, but also actively campaigns in political issues.<ref>{{nl icon}} Sara Berkeljon, "[http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2694/Tech-Media/article/detail/3314972/2012/09/12/De-Telegraaf-helpt-rechts-een-handje.dhtml De Telegraaf helpt rechts een handje]", ''[[de Volkskrant]]'', 2012.</ref>

==History==
[[File:De Telegraaf.jpg|thumb|right|Advertisement poster, 1898]]

''De Telegraaf'' was founded by [[Henry Tindal]], who simultaneously started another paper ''De Courant'' ("The Gazette"). The first issue appeared on 1 January 1893. Following Tindal's death on 31 January 1902 the printer [[HMC Holdert]], with backing from financiers, took over ''De Telegraaf'' and ''De Courant'' on 12 September 1902. This proved to be a good investment, particularly with regard to ''De Courant'', enabling Holdert between 1903 and 1923 to take over one newspaper after another, suspending publication as he went. He added the name ''Amsterdamsche Courant'' ("Amsterdam Gazette") as a subtitle to ''De Telegraaf'', and ''Het Nieuws van den Dag'' ("The News of the Day") to ''De Courant''. In 1926, he began construction of a new printing facility at the ''Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal'' in Amsterdam, designed by [[J.F. Staal]] and [[G.J. Langhout]]. Construction was completed and the building occupied in 1930. At one point, in June 1966, the building was besieged by angry construction workers and [[Provo (movement)|Provo]] followers, after a false report that a victim of a labour dispute had been killed not by the police but by a co-worker. In 1974, ''De Telegraaf'' moved to its current location in the ''Basisweg''.

During [[World War I]], when the Netherlands was officially [[Neutral country|neutral]], Holdert's [[France|French]] sympathies and his pro-[[United Kingdom|British]] standpoint caused ''De Telegraaf'' to be the focus of some controversy. During [[World War II]], the Telegraaf companies published pro-[[Germany|German]] papers, which led to a thirty-year ban on publishing after the war. The prohibition was, however, lifted in 1949 and ''De Telegraaf'' flourished anew to become the biggest newspaper in the Netherlands.

''De Courant/Nieuws van de Dag'' ceased publication in 1998.

''De Telegraaf'' was also published on Sundays between 21 March 2004 and 27 December 2009.

'''Johann Bernhard Bach''' (23 May 1676{{spaced ndash}}11 June 1749) was a German composer, and second cousin of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]].<ref name="Sojurn">Smith, Timothy A. [http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~tas3/jbbach.html "Johann Bernhard Bach 1676-1749"]. Northern Arizona University. Retrieved 3 August 2012.</ref> He was born in [[Erfurt]], and his early musical education was by his father, [[Johann Aegidius Bach]]. He took up his position as [[organ (music)|organ]]ist in Erfurt in 1695, and then took a similar position in [[Magdeburg]]. He replaced [[Johann Christoph Bach]] as organist in [[Eisenach]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Boyd|first=Malcolm|title=Oxford Composer Companions: J.S. Bach|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=0-19-866208-4|pages=32}}</ref>  and also as [[harpsichord]]ist in the court orchestra in 1703. Most of his musical output has been lost, but amongst his surviving music there are four orchestral suites. It is known that J.S. Bach had individual parts prepared for performance by his orchestra.

His musical style has been described as being similar to that of [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]].<ref name="Sojurn" />

The surviving orchestral suites ([[overture]]s) are as follows:
*Suite No. 1 in G minor
*Suite No. 2 in G major
*Suite No. 3 in E minor
*Suite No. 4 in D major

They are thought to have been written before 1730.

Surviving keyboard music:

In addition to several organ chorales and 2 [[chaconne]]s, there are also 2 fugues by J.B. Bach.

'''Nancy "Nan" Goldin''' (born September 12, 1953) is an [[People of the United States|American]] [[photographer]]. She lives and works in [[New York City]], [[Berlin]], and [[Paris]].<ref name="gagosian.com">[http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/nan-goldin--march-21-2014 Nan Goldin: Scopophilia, March 21 - May 24, 2014] [[Gagosian Gallery]], Rome.</ref>

==Life and work==
[[File:Ballad of Sexual Dependency.jpg|thumb|''The Ballad of Sexual Dependency'' (1986). The image on the cover is "Nan and Brian in Bed" (1981).]]
[[File:The Hug.jpg|thumb|upright|Nan Goldin, ''The Hug, NYC'', 1980, cibachrome, 40 x 30 inches]]
[[File:Misty and Jimmy.jpg|thumb|Nan Goldin, ''Misty and Jimmy Paulette in a Taxi, NYC'', 1991, 30 x 40 inches]]
Goldin was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], and grew up in the [[Boston]] suburb of [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], to middle-class [[Jewish]] parents. Goldin’s father worked in broadcasting, and served as the chief economist for the [[Federal Communications Commission]].<ref>Deborah Solomon (October 9, 1996), [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB844810967532358500.html# Nan Goldin: Scenes From the Edge] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> After attending the nearby Lexington High School, she enrolled at the Satya Community School in [[Lincoln, Massachusetts|Lincoln]], where a teacher introduced her to the camera in 1968. Goldin was then fifteen years old. Her first solo show, held in [[Boston]] in 1973, was based on her photographic journeys among the city's [[gay men|gay]] and [[transsexual]] communities, to which she had been introduced by her friend [[David Armstrong (photographer)|David Armstrong]]. Goldin graduated from the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]/[[Tufts University]] in 1977/1978, where she had worked mostly with [[Cibachrome]] prints.

Following graduation, Goldin moved to [[New York City]]. She began documenting the [[post-punk]] new-wave music scene, along with the city's vibrant, post-[[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] [[gay]] subculture of the late 1970s and early 1980s. She was drawn especially to the hard-drug subculture of the [[Bowery]] neighborhood; these photographs, taken between 1979 and 1986, form her famous work ''[[The Ballad of Sexual Dependency]]'' — a title taken from a song in [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[Threepenny Opera]]''.<ref>Brecht, Bertolt. "Three Penny Opera." Act II, song 12.</ref> Published with help from [[Marvin Heiferman]], Mark Holborn, and Suzanne Fletcher, these [[snapshot aesthetic]] images depict drug use, violent, aggressive couples and autobiographical moments. In her forward to the book she describes it as a “diary [she] lets people read” of people she referred to as her “tribe”. The photographs show a transition through Goldin’s travels and her life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heiferman|first=Nan Goldin ; edited with Marvin|title=The ballad of sexual dependency|publisher=Aperture Foundation|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-1-59711-208-6|edition=2012 reissue.|coauthors=Holborn,, Mark; Fletcher, Suzanne}}</ref> Most of her ''Ballad'' subjects were dead by the 1990s, lost either to [[drug overdose]] or [[AIDS]]; this tally included  close friends and often-photographed subjects [[Greer Lankton]] and [[Cookie Mueller]].<ref>Curley, Mallory. ''A Cookie Mueller Encyclopedia'', Randy Press, 2010.</ref> In 2003, [[The New York Times]] nodded to the work's impact, explaining  Goldin had "forged a genre, with photography as influential as any in the last twenty years."<ref>Tillman, Lynne. The New York Times. "A New Chapter of Nan Goldin's Diary." 16 November 2003.</ref> In addition to ''Ballad,'' she combined her Bowery pictures in two other series: ''I'll Be Your Mirror'' (from a song on [[The Velvet Underground]]'s ''[[The Velvet Underground & Nico]]'' album) and ''All By Myself.''

Goldin's work is most often presented in the form of a [[slideshow]], and has been shown at film festivals; her most famous being a 45 minute show in which 800 pictures are displayed. The main themes of her early pictures are love, gender, domesticity, and sexuality; these frames are usually shot with [[available light]]. She has affectionately documented women looking in mirrors, girls in bathrooms and barrooms, drag queens, sexual acts, and the culture of obsession and dependency. The images are viewed like a private journal made public.<ref>{{citation | title= Nan Goldin at Pa. Academy of Fine Arts | publisher=BLOUINARTINFO  | date= September 11, 2007 | url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/9149/nan-goldin-at-pa-academy-of-fine-arts | accessdate=2008-04-23 }}</ref> In the book ''Auto-Focus'', her photographs are described as a way to “learn the stories and intimate details of those closest to her”. It speaks of her uncompromising manner and style when photographing acts such as drug use, sex, violence, arguments, and traveling. It references one of Goldin’s famous photographs 'Nan One Month After Being Battered, 1984' as an iconic image which she uses to reclaim her identity and her life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bright|first=Susan|title=Auto focus : the self-portrait in contemporary photography|year=2010|publisher=Monacelli Press|location=[New York]|isbn=978-1-58093-300-1|edition=1st American ed.}}</ref>

''The Devil’s Playground'' is one of Goldin’s most famous published works, including her most modern images from her series ''Elements'', ''57 Days'', ''Still on Earth'', and ''From Here to Maternity''.

Goldin's work since 1995 has included a wide array of subject matter: collaborative book projects with Japanese photographer [[Nobuyoshi Araki]]; New York City skylines; uncanny landscapes (notably of people in water); her lover, Siobhan; and babies, parenthood and family life.

In 2002, her hand was injured in a fall, and she currently retains less ability to turn it than in the past.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
[[File:Christmas at the other side.jpg|thumb|left|Nan Goldin, ''Christmas at the Other Side, Boston'', 1972, gelatin-silver print, 16 x 20 inches]]

In 2006, her exhibition, ''Chasing a Ghost,'' opened in New York. It was the first installation by her to include moving pictures, a fully narrative score, and voiceover, and included the three-screen slide and video presentation ''Sisters, Saints, & Sybils'' which has been described as disturbing.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The work involved her sister Barbara's suicide and how she coped through production of numerous images and narratives. Her works are developing more and more into cinemaesque features, exemplifying her gravitation towards working with films.<ref name="NGI">{{citation | title=Nan Goldin | author=Robert Ayers | publisher=BLOUINARTINFO  | date= March 27, 2006 | url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/72685-nan-goldin| accessdate=2008-04-23 }}</ref>

Australian label Scanlan & Theodore commissioned Goldin with its spring/summer 2010 campaign, shot with model [[Erin Wasson]] in upstate New York. Commissioned by Italian luxury label [[Bottega Veneta]], she photographed models [[Sean O'Pry]] and Anya Kazakova for the brand’s spring/summer 2010 campaign, evoking memories of her ''Ballad of Sexual Dependency''.<ref>Ann Binlot (January 3, 2012), [http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/754977/bottega-veneta-taps-jack-pierson-for-latest-arty-ad-campaign Bottega Veneta Taps Jack Pierson for Latest Arty Ad Campaign] ''BLOUINARTINFO''.</ref> In 2011, Goldin made an advertising campaign with model [[Linda Vojtova]] for luxury shoemaker [[Jimmy Choo]].<ref>Ann Binlot (October 18, 2011), [http://www.blouinartinfo.com/visual-arts/article/38892-the-ballad-of-shoe-dependency-nan-goldin-shoots-a-new-ad-campaign-for-jimmy-choo The Ballad of Shoe Dependency: Nan Goldin Shoots a New Ad Campaign for Jimmy Choo] ''BLOUINARTINFO''.</ref> In 2013, she photographed an advertising campaign for [[Dior]] titled ''1000 LIVES'', featuring [[Robert Pattinson]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Pattinson Confirmed As New Face of Dior BY CHARLOTTE COWLES|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/06/robert-pattinson-confirmed-as-new-face-of-dior.html|accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Some critics have accused her of making [[heroin]]-use appear glamorous, and of pioneering a [[grunge]] style that later became popularized by youth fashion magazines such as ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' and ''[[I-D]]''. However, in a 2002 interview with ''[[The Observer]]'', Goldin herself called the use of "[[heroin chic]]" to sell clothes and perfumes "reprehensible and evil."<ref>{{citation | title=The dark room | publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|author= Sheryl Garratt|date=January 6, 2002|accessdate=2010-03-08|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2002/jan/06/features.magazine27|quote= "I never took pictures of people doing heroin to sell clothes. And I have a bit of a problem with it. Like this Dior campaign right now, where the girl is really dope-sick then she sprays Addiction perfume and suddenly she's high. I find that really reprehensible and evil."}}</ref>

===Censorship===
An exhibition of Goldin's work was censored in Brazil, two months before opening, due to its sexually explicit nature.<ref name="estadao.com.br">http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/arteelazer,cancelamento-de-exposicao-no-rio-deixa-artista-norte-americana-chocada,805090,0.htm#</ref> The main reason was the photographs containing sexual acts next to children.<ref name="estadao.com.br"/>  In Brazil, there is a law that prohibits the image of minors associated with pornography.<ref>http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/2003/L10.764.htm#art3</ref>
The sponsor of the exhibition, a cellphone company, claimed to be unaware of the content of Goldin's work and that there was a conflict between the work and its educational project. The curator of the Rio de Janeiro Museum of Modern Art changed the schedule in order to accommodate, in February 2012, the Goldin exhibition in Brazil.<ref>http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/1013229-oi-futuro-cancela-mostra-da-artista-nan-goldin-no-rio.shtml</ref>

However, due to the [[commoditization]] of standard desktop components, and due to the increasing availability and popularity of various software options for using full desktops as [[diskless node]]s, [[thin client]]s, and [[hybrid client]]s, the Network Computer brand never achieved the popularity hoped for by Oracle and was eventually [[:wikt:mothball#Verb|mothballed]].

The term "network computer" is now used for any [[diskless node|diskless]] [[desktop computer]] or a [[thin client]].

==History ==
{{Original research|section|date=June 2011}}
The failure of the NC to impact on the scale predicted by [[Larry Ellison]] may have been caused by a number of factors. Firstly, prices of PCs quickly fell below $1000, making the competition very hard. Secondly, the software available for NCs was neither mature nor open.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Walters, E. Garrison | authorlink= | title=The essential guide to computing | year=2001 | publisher=Prentice Hall PTR | location=Upper Saddle River, NJ  | isbn=0-13-019469-7 | page=13 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=AwrQsOW5SsQC&pg=PA398&dq=information+network+desktop+computer+IT+appliance+date:1970-2005#PPA398,M1  | accessdate=2008-05-06 }}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2008}}

Thirdly, the idea could simply have been ahead of its time, as at the NC's launch in 1996, the typical home [[Internet]] connection was only a 28.8 kbit/s modem [[dialup]]. This was simply insufficient for the delivery of [[executable]] content. The [[world wide web]] itself was not considered mainstream until its breakout year, 1998. Prior to this, very few [[Internet service provider]]s advertised in mainstream press (at least outside of the USA), and knowledge of the Internet was limited. This could have held back uptake of what would be seen as a very niche device with no (then) obvious appeal.

Ironically, NCs ended up being used as the very 'dumb terminals' they were intended{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} to replace, as the [[proprietary software|proprietary]] backend infrastructure is not readily available.{{Clarify|date=May 2008}} 1990s era NCs are often network-booted into a minimal Unix with X, to serve as X terminal. While NC purists may consider this to be a suboptimal use of NC hardware, the NCs work well as terminals, and are considerably cheaper than purpose-built terminal hardware.

==NC standards and drafts==

===Reference Profile===
The initial Network Computing standard, the [[Network Computer Reference Profile]] (NCRef), required that all 'NC' appliances supported [[HTML]], [[Java virtual machine|Java]], [[HTTP]], [[JPEG]], and other key standards.

{{details|Network Computer Reference Profile}}

===Other standards===

Because many NCs did not use [[Intel]] [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] or [[Microsoft]] [[Computer software|software]], Microsoft and Intel developed a competing standard called [[NetPC]].<ref name="bytecoverstory">[http://www.byte.com/art/9704/sec6/art1.htm Cheaper Computing, Part I], ''Byte'' magazine, April 1997</ref> Other alternatives to the NCRef were [[WeBRef]] ([[Motorola]] and [[HDS (company)|HDS]] Network Systems) and [[Odin (software)|Odin]] ([[National Semiconductor]]).<ref>

===Acorn Network Computer===

===Macintosh NC===
In 1997 Apple announced the [[Mac NC]], its attempt to develop the [[Apple Pippin|Pippin]] into a network computer platform. By the end of 1997, Steve Jobs discontinued all [[Macintosh clone]] efforts, effectively killing the Pippin, although key components of the Mac NC technology were inherited by the original [[iMac]].

===NetProducts NetStation===
The first generation [[NetStation]] design and the NetStation [[trademark]] was licensed to [[NChannel]], which provided the consumer equipment and Internet service (with associated infrastructure) for the [[United Kingdom|UK]] market. After a few months, NChannel split into two entities: [[NetChannel]] (which provided the Internet service) and [[NetProducts]] which provided the consumer hardware.

NetProducts started working with Acorn to develop a next-generation product, NetStation II and started developing an [[email]]-only set-top-box (the TVemail). NetProducts went into voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1998 before either project was completed.

===Sun Microsystems JavaStation===
[[Sun Microsystems]] developed the [[JavaStation]], a [[JavaOS]]-based NC based on [[SPARC]] hardware, initially similar to Sun's range of Unix [[workstation]]s.

===IBM Network Station===
[[IBM]] launched its [[Network Station]] in September 1996.<ref>
{{cite news
| title = First Network Computer Announced By IBM

| accessdate = 2011-06-08
| quote = IBM announced its first network computer [...]}}
</ref> As with the later reference design, the Network Station used a NetBSD-based NCOS booted over a LAN from an [[AS/400]] or [[IBM PC]] server. The Network Station supported local execution of basic applications, such as a [[web browser]] and [[Virtual console|console]]. In addition, [[X windows|X]] capability was also implemented to allow both locally and remotely run applications to be used on the same machine. In practice, the lack of real applications meant that this was little more than a hardware [[X terminal]].

The IBM Network Station was originally based on the [[PowerPC]] architecture, but the final few models used [[Intel]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] processors.

==Contemporary analogy==
Some see the idea behind the NC as existing in contemporary times in the system of [[cloud computing]] and in particular [[Google Chrome OS]]. In [[Wired magazine]], Daniel Roth claims that the failure of the network computer eventually led to the development of cloud computing. A large contribution to this transition was attributed to [[Eric Schmidt]], once the [[chief technical officer|CTO]] of [[Sun Microsystems]], a proponent of the network computer, who eventually became the CEO of [[Google]]. Google is a large purveyor of cloud technology, "most notably Google Docs and Spreadsheets."<ref>Roth, Daniel. [http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/12/fail_oracle/all/1 "Time Your Attack: Oracle's Lost Revolution"], ''Wired'', 2009-12-21. Retrieved on 2010-02-22.</ref>

'''''Phelsuma breviceps''''' is a [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] [[species]] of [[gecko]] that is native to south-east [[Madagascar]] and typically dwells on [[trees]] and [[Shrub|bushes]]. Its diet in the wild consists mainly of [[insect]]s.

==Description==
This lizard belongs to the smallest day geckos. It can reach a maximum total length of about 10&nbsp;cm. This species is easily recognised by its short snout, after which it has been named. The basic body colour is light grey to brownish. On the back there are light blue and dark dots and stripes. The legs have light blue spots.

==Distribution==
This species inhabits southeast Madagascar. It is found in the area around [[Toliara]] and near the [[Tsimanampetsotsa]]-lake.

==Habitat==
[[Image:E stenoclada ies.jpg|thumb|150px|''[[Euphorbia stenoclada]]'']]
''P. breviceps'' is adapted to a dry climate. It is often found on the [[succulent]] spurge ''[[Euphorbia stenoclada]]'' which has 7&nbsp;cm long thorns.

==Diet==
These day geckos feed on various insects, other invertebrates and nectar, both in the wild and in captivity.

==Behaviour==
Like most geckos of the genus ''Phelsuma'', this species is quite silent.

==Reproduction==
The females lay their [[egg (biology)|eggs]] between the wood spurge thorns.

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a dry terrarium. These animals can be fed with crickets,  wax moth, fruits flies, mealworms, houseflies and fruit baby food.

'''Cryptosporidiosis''', also known as '''crypto''',<ref name=cdc>{{cite web |title=Cryptosporidiosis |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=5 February 2009 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/crypto/ }}</ref> is a [[parasitic disease]] caused by ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'', a [[protozoa]]n [[parasite]] in the phylum Apicomplexa. It affects the [[intestine]]s and is typically an acute short-term infection. It is spread through the [[fecal-oral route]], often through contaminated water;<ref name=cdc/> the main symptom is self-limiting [[diarrhea]] in people with intact immune systems. In immunocompromised individuals, such as [[AIDS]] patients, the symptoms are particularly severe and often fatal.

''Cryptosporidium'' is the organism most commonly isolated in [[HIV-positive]] patients presenting with diarrhea. Treatment is symptomatic, with fluid rehydration, electrolyte correction and management of any pain.  Despite not being identified until 1976, it is one of the most common waterborne diseases and is found worldwide.  The parasite is transmitted by environmentally hardy [[microbial cyst]]s (oocysts) that, once ingested, exist in the [[small intestine]] and result in an infection of intestinal [[epithelial tissue]].

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Symptom]]s appear from two to ten days after infection, with an average of 7 days,<ref name=cdc/> and last for up to two weeks, or in some cases, up to one month.<ref name=cdc/> There are 3 possible forms of the illness in immunocompetent people.  The disease can be tragic or cause acute diarrhea or persistent diarrhea that can last for a few weeks. Diarrhea is usually watery with mucus. It is very rare to find blood or leukocytes in the diarrhea.<ref name=Chen>{{cite journal |author=Chen XM, Keithly JS, Paya CV, LaRusso NF |title=Cryptosporidiosis |journal=N. Engl. J.

When ''Cryptosporidium'' spreads beyond the intestine, as it can predominantly in patients with AIDS, it can reach the lungs, middle ear, pancreas, and stomach.  Thus, one symptom is pain in the right upper quadrant.<ref name=chen/>  The parasite can infect the biliary tract, causing biliary cryptosporidiosis. This can result in cholecystitis and cholangitis.<ref name=ryan/>

==Cause==
[[Image:Cryptosporidiosis 01.png|thumb|300px|Life cycle of ''Cryptosporidium'' spp.]]
''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' is a [[protozoan]] [[pathogen]] of the Phylum Apicomplexa and causes a diarrheal illness called cryptosporidiosis.  Other apicomplexan pathogens include the [[malaria]] parasite ''[[Plasmodium]]'', and ''[[Toxoplasma]]'', the causative agent of [[toxoplasmosis]].  Unlike ''Plasmodium'', which transmits via a [[mosquito]] vector, ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' does not require an insect vector and is capable of completing its life cycle within a single host, resulting in microbial cyst stages that are excreted in [[feces]] and are capable of transmission to a new host.  However, studies show that synanthropic filth flies may be involved in the transmission of human and animal cryptosporidiosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Graczyk TK, Fayer R, Knight R, et al. |title=Mechanical transport and transmission of ''Cryptosporidium parvum'' oocysts by wild filth flies |journal=Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. |volume=63 |issue=3–4 |pages=178–83 |year=2000 |pmid=11388511 |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/reprint/63/3/178}}</ref>

The pattern of ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' life cycle fits well that of other intestinal homogeneous coccidian genera of the suborder ''[[Eimeriina]]'': macro- and microgamonts develop independently; a microgamont gives rise to numerous male gametes; and oocysts serving for parasites' spreading in the environment.

Electron microscopic studies made from the 1970s have shown the intracellular, although extracytoplasmic localization of ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' species.

These species possess a number of unusual features:

* an endogenous phase of development in microvilli of epithelial surfaces
* two morphofunctional types of oocysts
* the smallest number of sporozoites per oocyst
* a multi-membraneous "feeder" organelle

DNA studies suggest a relationship with the gregarines rather than the coccidia.<ref name="Carreno1999">{{cite journal |author=Carreno RA, Martin DS, Barta JR |title=Cryptosporidium is more closely related to the gregarines than to coccidia as shown by phylogenetic analysis of apicomplexan parasites inferred using small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequences |journal=Parasitol.

The [[genome]] of ''Cryptosporidium parvum'' was sequenced in 2004 and was found to be unusual amongst [[Eukaryote]]s in that the [[mitochondria]] seem not to [[mitochondrial DNA|contain DNA]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1094786 |title=Complete Genome Sequence of the Apicomplexan, ''Cryptosporidium parvum'' |year=2004 |author=Abrahamsen, M.

A number of ''Cryptosporidium'' infect mammals. In humans, the main causes of disease are ''C. parvum'' and ''C. hominis'' (previously ''C. parvum'' genotype 1). ''C. canis'', ''C. felis'', ''C. meleagridis'', and ''C. muris'' can also cause disease in humans.

Cryptosporidiosis is typically an acute short-term infection but can become severe and non-resolving in children and immunocompromised individuals. In humans, it remains in the lower intestine and may remain for up to five weeks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The parasite is transmitted by environmentally hardy microbial cysts (oocysts) that, once ingested, exist in the small intestine and result in an infection of intestinal epithelial tissue.

===Transmission===
[[Infection]] is through contaminated material such as earth, [[water]], uncooked or cross-contaminated [[food]] that has been in contact with the feces of an infected individual or [[animal]]. Contact must then be transferred to the mouth and swallowed. It is especially prevalent amongst those in regular contact with bodies of fresh water including recreational water such as swimming pools. Other potential sources include insufficiently treated water supplies, contaminated food, or exposure to feces.<ref name=cdc/>  The high resistance of ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' [[oocysts]] to [[disinfectant]]s such as [[chlorine]] [[bleach]] enables them to survive for long periods and still remain infective.<ref name=Carpenter_1999>{{cite journal | author = Carpenter C, Fayer R, Trout J, Beach M | title = Chlorine disinfection of recreational water for Cryptosporidium parvum | journal = Emerg Infect Dis | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 579–84 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10458969 | doi = 10.3201/eid0504.990425 | pmc = 2627758}}</ref> Some outbreaks have happened in day care related to diaper changes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Teresa Ortega M, Vergara A, Guimbao J, Clavel A, Gavín P, Ruiz A |title=[Cryptosporidium hominis diarrhea outbreak and transmission linked to diaper infant use] |language=Spanish; Castilian |journal=Med Clin (Barc) |volume=127 |issue=17 |pages=653–6 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17169283 |doi= |url=http://www.elsevier.es/en/linksolver/ft/ivp/0025-7753/127/653}}</ref>

The following groups have an elevated risk of being exposed to ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'':{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}
* People who swim regularly in pools with insufficient sanitation (certain strains of ''Cryptosporidium'' are chlorine-resistant)
* Child care workers
* Parents of infected children
* People who take care of other people with cryptosporidiosis
* International travelers
* Backpackers, hikers, and campers who drink unfiltered, untreated water
* People, including swimmers, who swallow water from contaminated sources
* People who handle infected cattle
* People exposed to human feces through sexual contact

Cases of cryptosporidiosis can occur in a city that does not have a contaminated water supply. In a city with clean water, it may be that cases of cryptosporidiosis have different origins. Testing of water, as well as [[epidemiological]] study, are necessary to determine the sources of specific infections. Note that ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' typically does not cause serious illness in healthy people. It may chronically sicken some children, as well as adults who are exposed and [[immunocompromised]]. A subset of the immunocompromised population is people with AIDS. Some sexual behaviours can transmit the parasite directly.

===Life cycle===
''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' has a [[spore]] phase ([[oocyst]]) and in this state it can survive for lengthy periods outside a host. It can also resist many common disinfectants, notably chlorine-based disinfectants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol5no4/carpenter.htm |title=Chlorine Disinfection of Recreational Water for ''Cryptosporidium parvum'' |publisher=CDC |accessdate=6 May 2007}}</ref>

The life cycle of ''Cryptosporidium parvum'' consists of an asexual stage and a sexual stage.<ref name=cdc/>  After being ingested, the oocysts excyst in the small intestine.  They release sporozoites that attach to the microvilli of the epithelial cells of the small intestine.  From there they become trophozoites that reproduce asexually by multiple fission, a process known as schizogony.  The trophozoites develop into Type 1 [[meront]]s [1] that contain 8 daughter cells.<ref name=ryan/>

These daughter cells are Type 1 merozoites, which get released by the meronts.  Some of these merozoites can cause autoinfection by attaching to epithelial cells.  Others of these merozoites become Type II meronts,<ref name=chen/> which contain 4 Type II merozoites.<ref name=ryan/>  These merozoites get released and they attach to the epithelial cells.  From there they become either macrogamonts or microgamonts.<ref name=chen/>  These are the female and male sexual forms, respectively.<ref name=ryan/>  This stage, when sexual forms arise, is called gametogony.<ref name=murray>Murray, Patrick R., Ken S. Rosenthal, and Michael A. Pfaller. Medical Microbiology. 5th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier Inc., 2005: 855-856.</ref>

Zygotes are formed by microgametes from the microgamont penetrating the macrogamonts.  The zygotes develop into oocysts of two types.<ref name=chen/>  20% of oocysts have thin walls and so can reinfect the host by rupturing and releasing sporozoites that start the process over again.<ref name=ryan/>  The thick-walled oocysts are excreted into the environment.<ref name=chen/>  The oocysts are mature and infective upon being excreted.<ref name=ryan/>  They can survive in the environment for months.<ref name=gideon>{{cite web |title=Cryptosporidiosis |publisher=Gideon |date=23 February 2009 |url=http://web.gideononline.com/web/tox_diseases/index.php?disease=355&view=General |quote=Trial subscription required to access}}</ref>

==Pathogenesis==
The oocysts are ovoid or spherical and measure 5 to 6 micrometers across.  When in flotation preparations they appear highly refractile.  The oocysts contains up to 4 sporozoites that are bow-shaped.<ref name=winn/>

As few as 2 to 10 oocysts can initiate an infection.<ref name=chen/>  The parasite is located in the brush border of the epithelial cells of the small intestine.<ref name=brooks/>  They are mainly located in the jejunum.  When the sporozoites attach the epithelial cells’ membrane envelops them.  Thus, they are “intracellular but extracytoplasmic”.<ref name=ryan/>  The parasite can cause damage to the microvilli where it attaches.<ref name=winn/>  The infected human excretes the most oocysts during the first week.<ref name=ryan/>  Oocysts can be excreted for weeks after the diarrhea subsides.<ref name=cdc/>

The immune system reduces the formation of Type 1 merozoites as well as the number of thin-walled oocysts.<ref name=ryan/>  This helps prevent autoinfection. B cells do not help with the initial response or the fight to eliminate the parasite.<ref name=chen>{{cite journal |author=Chen W, Harp JA, Harmsen AG |title=Cryptosporidium parvum infection in gene-targeted B cell-deficient mice |journal=J. Parasitol. |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=391–3 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12760662 |doi=10.1645/0022-3395(2003)089[0391:CPIIGB]2.0.CO;2 |year=2003 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
There are many diagnostic tests for ''Cryptosporidium''.  They include microscopy, staining, and detection of antibodies.  Microscopy<ref name=cdc/> can help identify oocysts in fecal matter.<ref name=brooks/>  To increase the chance of finding the oocysts, the diagnostician should inspect at least 3 stool samples.<ref name=murray/>  There are several techniques to concentrate either the stool sample or the oocysts.  The modified formalin-ethyl acetate (FEA) concentration method concentrates the stool.<ref name=winn/>  Both the modified zinc sulfate centrifugal flotation technique and the Sheather’s sugar flotation procedure can concentrate the oocysts by causing them to float.<ref name=murray/>  Another form of microscopy is fluorescent microscopy done by staining with auramine.<ref name=brooks/>

Other staining techniques include acid-fast staining,<ref name=chen/> which will stain the oocysts red.<ref name=winn/>  One type of acid-fast stain is the Kinyoun technique.<ref name=gideon/>  Giemsa staining can also be performed.<ref name=ryan/>  Part of the small intestine can be stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E), which will show oocysts attached to the epithelial cells.<ref name=winn/>
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:crypto acidfast.jpg|thumb|Acid-fast stain showing ''Cryptosporidium'' oocysts.]] -->

Detecting antigens is yet another way to diagnose the disease.  This can be done with direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) techniques.<ref name=cdc/>  It can also be achieved through indirect immunofluorescence assay.<ref name=murray/>  Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) also detects antigens.<ref name=brooks/>

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is another way to diagnose cryptosporidiosis.  It can even identify the specific species of ''Cryptosporidium''.<ref name=cdc/>  If the patient is thought to have biliary cryptosporidiosis, then an appropriate diagnostic technique is ultrasonography.  If that returns normal results, the next step would be to perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.<ref name=chen/>

== Prevention ==
Many [[Water purification|treatment plants]] that take raw water from [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, and [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]] for public [[drinking water]] production use conventional filtration technologies. This involves a series of processes, including coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration. Direct filtration, which is typically used to treat water with low particulate levels, includes coagulation and filtration, but not sedimentation. Other common filtration processes, including [[slow sand filter]]s,  [[diatomaceous earth|diatomaceous earth filter]]s and membranes will remove 99% of ''Cryptosporidium''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/safewater/mdbp/ieswtrwhatdoesitmeantoyou.pdf |title=The Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule – What Does it Mean to You? |publisher=USEPA |format=pdf |accessdate=6 May 2007}}</ref> Membranes and bag and cartridge filters remove ''Cryptosporidium''  product-specifically.

While ''Cryptosporidium'' is highly resistant to chlorine disinfection,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Korich DG, Mead JR, Madore MS, Sinclair NA, Sterling CR |title=Effects of ozone, chlorine dioxide, chlorine, and monochloramine on Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst viability |journal=Appl.

The required levels of chlorine generally preclude the use of chlorine disinfection as a reliable method to control ''Cryptosporidium'' in drinking water. Ultraviolet light treatment at relatively low doses will inactivate ''Cryptosporidium''. Water Research Foundation-funded research originally discovered UV's efficacy in inactivating ''Cryptosporidium''.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Irreversible UV inactivation of ''Cryptosporidium'' spp. despite the presence of UV repair genes | pmid = 15537090 | journal = J Eukaryot Microbiol | date = September–October 2004 | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 553–62 | doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.2004.tb00291.x | author=Rochelle, PAUL A. | last2=Fallar |first2=D | last3=Marshall | first3=MM | last4=Montelone | first4=BA | last5=Upton | first5=SJ | last6=Woods | first6=K }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterresearchfoundation.org/research/TopicsAndProjects/topicSnapshot.aspx?topic=uv|title=Ultraviolet Disinfection and Treatment |publisher=WaterResearchFoundation (formerly AwwaRF) |accessdate=6 May 2007}}</ref>

One of the largest challenges in identifying outbreaks is the ability to identify ''Cryptosporidium'' in the [[laboratory]].  Real-time monitoring technology is now able to detect ''Cryptosporidium'' with online systems, unlike the spot and batch testing methods used in the past.

The most reliable way to decontaminate drinking water that may be contaminated by ''Cryptosporidium'' is to boil it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7589839.stm |title=Boil water warning 'precaution' |publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 September 2009 | date=2 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4484946.stm |title=Boil water 'into January' warning  |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 September 2009 | date=30 November 2005}}</ref>

In the US the law requires doctors and labs to report cases of cryptosporidiosis to local or state health departments.  These departments then report to the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]].<ref name=cdc/>  The best way to prevent getting and spreading cryptosporidiosis is to have good hygiene and sanitation.<ref name=murray/>  An example would be hand-washing.<ref name=cdc/>  Prevention is through washing hands carefully after going to the bathroom or contacting [[feces|stool]], and before eating.  People should avoid contact with animal feces.<ref name="brooks"/>  They should also avoid possibly contaminated food and water.<ref name=cdc/>  In addition, people should refrain from engaging in sexual activities that can expose them to feces.<ref name=murray/>

Standard water filtration may not be enough to eliminate ''Cryptosporidium''; boiling for at least 1 minute (3 minutes above {{convert|6500|ft|m}} of altitude) will decontaminate it.  Heating milk at 71.7&nbsp;°C (161&nbsp;°F) for 15 seconds pasteurizes it and can destroy the oocysts' ability to infect.<ref name=text>John, David T. and William A. Petri, Jr. Markell and Voge’s Medical Parasitology. 9th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier Inc., 2006: 68-71.</ref>  Water can also be made safe by filtering with a filter with pore size not greater than 1 micrometre, or by filters that have been approved for “cyst removal” by NSF International [[National Sanitation Foundation]].<ref name=cdc/>  Bottled drinking water is less likely to contain ''Cryptosporidium'', especially if the water is from an underground source.<ref name=text/>

People with cryptosporidiosis should not swim in communal areas because the pathogen can reside in the anal and genital areas and be washed off.  They should wait until at least two weeks after diarrhea stops before entering public water sources, since oocysts can still be shed for a while.  Also, they should stay away from immunosuppressed people.<ref name=cdc/>  Immunocompromised people should take care to protect themselves from water in lakes and streams.<ref name=chen/>  They should also stay away from animal stools and wash their hands after touching animals.  To be safe, they should boil or filter their water.  They should also wash and cook their vegetables.<ref name=cdc/>

The US CDC notes the recommendation of many public health departments to soak contaminated surfaces for 20 minutes with a 3% hydrogen peroxide (99% kill rate) and then rinse them thoroughly, with the caveat that no disinfectant is guaranteed to be completely effective against Cryptosporidium. However, hydrogen peroxide is more effective than standard bleach solutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/crypto/daycare/outbreak.html|title=Control measures for Outbreaks — Intensified Cryptosporidiosis (Crypto) Control Measures for the Child Care Setting|publisher = US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref>

==Treatment==
There is no reliable treatment for cryptosporidium enteritis; certain agents such as [[paromomycin]], [[atovaquone]], [[nitazoxanide]],<ref name="pmid15640710">{{cite journal |author=Smith HV, Corcoran GD |title=New drugs and treatment for cryptosporidiosis |journal=Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=557–64 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15640710 |doi= 10.1097/00001432-200412000-00008|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0951-7375&volume=17&issue=6&spage=557}}</ref> and [[azithromycin]] are sometimes used, but they usually have only temporary effects.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Treatment is primarily supportive. Fluids need to be replaced orally. A lactose-free diet should be taken as tolerated {{cite web| url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/215490-treatment| title=Cryptosporidiosis Treatment - MedScape| accessdate=October 29, 2013 }}. In rare situations, intravenous fluids may be required. Antibiotics are not usually helpful, and are reserved primarily for persons with severe disease and a weak immune system. Sometimes relapses happen.

===Immunocompetent===
The majority of immunocompetent individuals suffer a short (less than 2 weeks) self-limiting course that requires supportive care with rehydration and occasionally antidiarrhoeal medication, and ends with spontaneous recovery. Nitazoxanide is one drug that the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]] has approved for use in immunocompetent people to combat diarrhea.<ref name=cdc/>  Spiramycin can help shorten the amount of time oocysts are passed, as well as the duration of diarrhoea in children.<ref name=chen/>

===Immunocompromised===
In immunocompromised individuals, such as AIDS patients, cryptosporidiosis resolves slowly or not at all, and frequently causes a particularly severe and permanent form of watery diarrhea coupled with a greatly decreased ability to absorb key nutrients through the intestinal tract. The result is progressively severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, malnutrition, wasting, and eventual death.  Spiramycin can help treat diarrhea in patients in the early stages of AIDS.<ref name=murray/>  In general, the mortality rate for infected AIDS patients is based on [[CD4+]] marker counts; in general, patients with CD4+ counts over 180 cells/mm³ recover with supportive hospital care and medication, but, in patients with CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm³, the effects are usually fatal within three to six months. During the Milwaukee cryptosporidiosis epidemic (the largest of its kind), 73% of AIDS patients with CD4+ counts lower than 50 cells/mm³ and 36% of those with counts between 50 and 200 cells/mm³ died within the first year of contracting the infection.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ian |last=Gilson M.D. |author2=Buggy, Brian P.

Currently, the best approach is to improve the immune status in immunodeficient individuals, which causes the diarrhea to resolve itself in most cases. Biliar drainage may be needed in case the biliary tract is affected.

Currently, research is being done in molecular-based immunotherapy.  For example, synthetic isoflavone derivates have been shown to fight off ''Cryptosporidium parvum'' in vitro and in a gerbil.  Derivates of nitazoxanide, which are synthetic nitro- or nonnitrothiazolide compounds, have also shown promising results in vitro.<ref name=gargala>{{cite journal |author=Gargala G |title=Drug treatment and novel drug target against Cryptosporidium |journal=Parasite |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=275–81 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18814694 |doi=10.1051/parasite/2008153275 }}</ref>

==History==
The organism was first described in 1907 by Tyzzer, who recognised it was a [[coccidia]]n.

==Research==
A recombinant Cryptosporidium parvum [[oocyst]] surface protein ([[rCP15/60]]) vaccine has produced an antibody response in a large group of cows and also antibody response in calves fed rCP15/60-immune [[colostrum]] produced by these vaccinated cows .  This is very promising.  Human Cryptosporidium parvum infections are particularly prevalent and often fatal in neonates in developing countries and to [[immunocompromised]] people, such as [[AIDs]] patients.  To date (2013), there is no commercially available effective vaccine against Cryptosporidium parvum, although passive immunization utilizing different zoite surface (glyco)proteins has showed promise.  Developmental stages within the life cycle of the parasite that might act as possible targets for vaccine development. The organism is detected in 65-97% of the [[surface-water]] supply in the United States and is resistant to most disinfectants used for treatment of drinking water. [[Antibodies]] in the serum of humans and animals infected with Cryptosporidium parvum react with several antigens, one of which is a 15 kDa protein ([[CP15]]) located on the surface of the organism. This protein is a good candidate for use as a molecular vaccine because previous studies have shown that a [[monoclonal antibody]] to CP15 confers [[passive immunity]]to mice.  Currently, there is no drug therapy or vaccine that is effective against Cryptosporidium parvum.  {{Or|date=July 2013}}

==Other animals==
The most important [[zoonotic]] reservoirs are [[cattle]], [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s. In addition, in recent years, cryptosporidiosis has plagued many commercial [[leopard gecko]] breeders.  Several species of the Cryptosporidium family (C. serpentes and others) are involved, and outside of geckos it has been found in monitor lizards, iguanas and tortoises, as well as several snake species.

==Notable cases==
* In 1987, 13,000 people in Carrollton, Georgia, United States, [[1987 Carroll County Cryptosporidiosis outbreak|became ill with cryptosporidiosis]]. This was the first report of its spread through a municipal water system that met all state and federal drinking water standards.
* In 1993, [[Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak|a waterborne cryptosporidiosis outbreak]] occurred in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. An estimated 403,000 people became ill, including 4,400 people hospitalized.

* The UK's biggest outbreak occurred in [[Torbay]] in [[Devon]] in 1995.
* In the summer of 1996, ''Cryptosporidium'' affected approximately 2,000 people in [[Cranbrook, British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. Weeks later, a separate incident occurred in [[Kelowna, British Columbia]], where 10,000 to 15,000 people got sick.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cryptosporidium |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/health/cryptosporidium.html |newspaper=CBC News |date=23 June 2004 |accessdate=19 April 2011 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>
* In April 2001, an outbreak occurred in the city of [[North Battleford, Saskatchewan]], Canada. Between 5800 and 7100 people suffered from diarrheal illness, and 1907 cases of cryptosporidiosis were confirmed. Equipment failures at the city's antiquated water filtration plant following maintenance were found to have caused the outbreak.<ref>{{cite web |last = |first = |authorlink = |title = Waterborne Cryptosporidiosis Outbreak, North Battleford, Ssaskatchewan, Spring 2001 |work = |publisher = Public Health Agency of Canada |date = 15 November 2001 |url = http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/01vol27/dr2722ea.html |doi = |accessdate = 25 January 2008}}</ref>
* In the summer of 2005, after numerous reports by patrons of gastrointestinal upset, a water park at [[Seneca Lake State Park]], in the [[Finger Lakes]] region of [[upstate New York]], USA was found to have two water storage tanks infected with ''Cryptosporidium''. By early September 2005, over 3,800 people reported symptoms of a ''Cryptosporidium'' infection.<ref>{{cite web | title=State Health Department Issues Update on Seneca Lake State Park Gastrointestinal Outbreak | work=New York State Health Dept | url=http://www.health.state.ny.us/press/releases/2005/2005-09-01_school_precautions_seneca_lake_release.htm | accessdate=29 September 2006}}</ref> The "Sprayground" was ordered closed for the season on 15 August.
* In October 2005, the [[Gwynedd]] and [[Anglesey]] areas of [[North Wales]], United Kingdom, suffered an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis. The outbreak may have been linked to the drinking water supply from [[Llyn Cwellyn]], but this is not yet confirmed. As a result, 231 people fell ill and the company Welsh Water (Dwr Cymru) advised 61,000 people to boil their water before use.
* In March 2007, a suspected outbreak occurred in [[Galway]], [[Ireland]], after the source of water for much of the county, [[Lough Corrib]], was suspected to be contaminated with the parasite. A large population (90,000 people), including areas of both Galway City and County, were advised to boil water for drinking, food preparation and for brushing teeth. On 21 March 2007, it was confirmed that the city and county's water supply was contaminated with the parasite. The area's water supply was finally given approval on 20 August 2007, five months after ''Cryptosporidium'' was first detected. Around 240 people are known to have contracted the disease; experts say the true figure could be up to 5,000.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0820/galway.html RTÉ News — ''Galway water now safer than ever — HSE'']</ref>
* Hundreds of public pools in 20 Utah, USA counties were closed to young children in 2007, as children under 5 are most likely to spread the disease, especially children wearing [[diaper]]s. As of 10 September 2007 the [[Utah Department of Health]] had reported [http://health.utah.gov/uthealthnews/2007/20070911-Restrictions.htm 1302 cases] of cryptosporidiosis in the year; a more usual number would be 30. On 25 September the pools were reopened to those not requiring diapers, but hyperchlorination requirements were not lifted.
* On 21 September 2007, a ''Cryptosporidium'' [[outbreak]] attacked the [[Western United States]]: 230 [[Idaho]] residents, with hundreds across the [[Rocky Mountain]] area; in the [[Boise]] and [[Meridian, Idaho|Meridian]] areas; [[Utah]], 1,600 [[illnesses]]; [[Colorado]] and other Western [[U.S. state|states]] — [[Montana]], decrease.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070921/ap_on_he_me/crypto_outbreak;_ylt=Ajt3IgBUbvpzpZeQjE_4Jpus0NUE Yahoo.com, Cryptosporidium outbreak hits the West]</ref>
* On 25 June 2008, ''Cryptosporidium'' was found in England in water supplies in [[Northampton]], [[Daventry]], and some surrounding areas supplied from the [[Pitsford]] Reservoir, as reported on the [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/7472619.stm BBC]. People in the affected areas were warned not to drink tap water unless it had been boiled. [[Anglian Water]] confirmed that 108,000 households were affected, about 250,000 people. They advised that water might not be fit for human consumption for many weeks.<ref>[http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/People-in-Northampton-and-Daventry.4218816.jp Northampton Chronicle and Echo<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The boil notice was lifted for all the affected customers on 4 July 2008.<ref>[http://www.anglianwater.co.uk/index.php?contentid=1135&sectionid=135&parentid=0 Anglian Water-lifting of boil notice]</ref>
* Throughout the [[summer]] of 2008; many public swimming areas, water parks, and public pools in the [[Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex]] of [[Texas]], USA suffered an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis. [[Burger's Lake]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] was the first to report such an outbreak. This prompted some, if not all, city-owned and private pools to close and hyperchlorinate. To date, there have been 400 reported cases of ''Cryptosporidium''.<ref>[http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/wfaa/latestnews/stories/wfaa080813_lj_stjames.42d762e2.html Crypto spreads to private pools] — [[WFAA-TV]].

* In July 2010, a local sport centre in Cumbernauld (Glasgow, UK) detected traces of cryptosporidium in its swimming pools, causing a temporarily closure of the swimming pools.
* In November 2010, over 4000 cases of cryptosporidiosis were reported in [[Östersund]], Sweden. The source of contamination was the tap water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smittskyddsinstitutet.se/nyhetsarkiv/2010/smittskyddsinstitutets-arbete-med-det-vattenburna-utbrottet-av-cryptosporidium-i-ostersund/ |title=Smittskyddsinstitutets arbete med det vattenburna utbrottet av Cryptosporidium i Östersund |publisher=Smittskyddsinstitutet |language=Swedish |accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref> In mid December 2010 the number of reported cases was 12,400 according to local media.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kommunens parasitenkät avslutas |first=Patrick |last=Sjöö |url=http://op.se/ostersund/1.2575643-kommunens-parasitenkat-avslutas |newspaper=Östersunds-Posten |date=13 December 2010 |language=Swedish |accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref>
* As of April 2011, there has been an ongoing outbreak in [[Skellefteå]], Sweden. Although many people have been diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis, the source of the parasite has not yet been found. Several tests have been taken around the water treatment unit "Abborren", but so far no results have turned up positive. Residents are being advised to boil the tap water as they continue to search for the contaminating source.
* Since May 2011, there has been an ongoing outbreak in South Roscommon in Ireland. Although many people have been diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis, the source of the parasite has not yet been found. Testing continues and Roscommon County Council are now considering introducing Ultra Violet Filtration to their water treatment process in the next 12 months. Residents are being advised to boil the tap water and there is no sign of this boil notice being lifted in the near future.
* On May 15, 2013, in Roscommon, Ireland, another outbreak of the cryptosporidiosis was reported and a boil water notice was issued. This was the second time the parasite was detected in a month in the Roscommon water supply. The source of one of the outbreaks had been linked to the agricultural community.<ref>{{cite news |title=Boil water notice after Cryptosporidiosis outbreak in Co Roscommon |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0515/450466-cryptosporidiosis-roscommon/ |date=15 May 2013 | work=RTÉ News}}</ref> To date, 13 people have been treated for Cryptosporidiosis and the boil water notice is still in effect.<ref>{{cite news |title=13 people treated following Roscommon water pollution |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0517/450919-water-roscommon/ |date=17 May 2013 | work=RTÉ News}}</ref>

'''Independent Computing Architecture''' (ICA) is a [[proprietary protocol]] for an [[application server]] system, designed by [[Citrix Systems]]. The protocol lays down a specification for passing data between server and clients, but is not bound to any one platform.

Practical products conforming to ICA are Citrix's [[Citrix WinFrame|WinFrame]], [[Citrix XenApp]] (formerly called MetaFrame/Presentation Server), and [[Citrix XenDesktop]] products. These permit ordinary [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] applications to be run on a suitable Windows server, and for any supported client to gain access to those applications. Besides Windows, ICA is also supported on a number of [[Unix]] server platforms and can be used to deliver access to applications running on these platforms. The client platforms need not run Windows; for example, there are clients for [[Macintosh|Mac]], Unix, [[Linux]], and various smartphones. ICA client software is also built into various [[thin client]] platforms.

ICA is broadly similar in purpose to window servers such as the [[X Window System]]. It also provides for the feedback of user input from the client to the server, and a variety of means for the server to send graphical output, as well as other media such as audio, from the running application to the client. 

Key challenges of such an architecture are [[network latency]] and performance—a graphically intensive application (as most are when presented using a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]) being served over a slow or bandwidth-restricted network connection requires considerable compression and optimization to render the application usable by the client.  The client machine may be a different platform, and may not have the same GUI routines available locally—in this case the server may need to send the actual bitmap data over the connection.  Depending on the client's capabilities, servers may also off-load part of the graphical processing to the client, e.g. to render multimedia content.  ICA runs natively over TCP port 1494 or may be encapsulated in [[Common Gateway Protocol]] (CGP) on TCP 2598.  ICA supports the concept of channels at a [[session layer]] to encapsulate rich media redirection or USB extension within ICA.

'''''Coast to Coast AM''''' is a [[North American]] (U.S. and Canada) late-night [[radio talk show]] that deals with a variety of topics, but most frequently ones that relate to either the [[paranormal]] or [[conspiracy theories]]. The program is distributed by [[Premiere Networks]], both as part of its talk network and separately as a [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] program. The program currently airs seven nights a week 1:05&nbsp;a.m. – 5:00&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/02/70218 |title=Coast to Coast AM Is No Wack Job |author=Randy Dotinga |date=February 15, 2006 |work=Wired}}</ref>

Originally created and hosted by [[Art Bell]], as of 2014 the program is hosted on most nights by [[George Noory]]. According to estimates by [[Talkers Magazine]], ''Coast to Coast AM'' draws approximately 3 million listeners, making it the [[List of most-listened-to radio programs|most listened-to program]] in its time slot.<ref name=talkers3.11>{{cite web|title=The Top Talk Radio Audiences (Updated 3/11)|url=http://www.talkers.com/top-talk-radio-audience/|publisher=Talkers Magazine|accessdate=January 6, 2012}}</ref> Today, the program is heard on nearly 570 stations in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Guam.

==Format and subject matter==
The ''Coast to Coast AM'' format consists of a combination of live callers and long format interviews.  The subject matter covers unusual topics and is full of personal stories related to callers, junk science, pseudo experts and non-peer reviewed scientists. While program content is often focused on paranormal and fringe subjects, sometimes, world-class scientists such as [[Michio Kaku]] and [[Brian Greene]] are featured in long format interviews.   Topics discussed include the [[near-death experience]], [[climate change]], [[cosmology]], [[quantum physics]], [[remote viewing]], [[ghosts|hauntings]], contact with [[extraterrestrials]], [[psychic reading]], [[metaphysics]], [[science and religion]], [[conspiracy theories]], [[Area 51]], [[crop circle]]s, [[cryptozoology]], [[Bigfoot]], the [[Hollow Earth]] hypothesis, and [[science fiction|science fiction literature]], among others. Since the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], the events of that day (as well as alternate theories surrounding them) and current U.S. [[counter-terrorism]] strategy have also become frequent themes. [[George Noory]], the main host since Art Bell retired, also took interest in the [[2012 phenomenon]] and believed that something could happen; but stated many times on air that he believed we would still be here on December 22, 2012.

After the theme song is played ([[Giorgio Moroder]]'s "[[Chase (composition)|Chase]]" from ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]''), the broadcast is typically kicked off with a reading of [[Portal:Current events|current events]] or news stories by the host, usually with at least one bizarre or peculiar story. This is usually followed by a guest interview for the rest of the first hour (with open phone lines if there is enough time), then a lengthier three-hour interview with a second guest.  For the last hour of the show, people may call in to ask questions of the second guest.  Ever so often, host George Noory will flip the show's format and have the longer interview guest on first to fill the first three hours of the show.  In this format, the primary interview begins after the reading of the news and then the first break.  In the last hour in this "flipped" format, the last hour will sometimes feature a guest with a shorter subject or, more often than not, be simply an hour of open lines.  Occasionally, round table discussions are held on one of the show's common topics. Conventional topics are sometimes discussed, with interviews with notable authors and political talk sometimes featured.

On rare occasions, hosts have cut interviews short when it became clear that guests were being dishonest, unethical, unintelligible, abusive, or patronizing.  When this happens, the rest of the show will be filled with a stand in guest of Noory's choosing.  Guests that have interviews cut short due to bad phone connections for example, or at the last minute becoming unavailable are generally rescheduled for a later date.

In 2008,  Noory volunteered an elaboration of the show's policy respecting the controversial opinions of regular guests. He explained that, provided there was no element of hostility toward third parties, it was program policy to allow expression of opinion unchallenged. He gave as an example [[Richard C. Hoagland]]'s contention that features on Mars are artificial, constructed by a civilization that once inhabited the planet. Noory  does not challenge these statements and agrees with whomever is making the statements.
During hours of "open lines", calls are taken and put on air.  Art Bell created multiple call-in numbers for:
# "East of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]"
# "West of the Rockies"
# "First-time callers"
# "International callers"
# A "wild card" line
# [[Skype]] (currently active only when Noory hosts)

These lines were all announced at the beginning of each broadcast by [[Ross Mitchell]] for nearly all of the show's history until the spring of 2012, when Mitchell's home station, [[KKOH]] in [[Reno, Nevada]], chose not to be a ''Coast to Coast'' affiliate any longer; two new announcers, Charles Tomas and Dick Ervasti, are the current voiceover announcers of the program.<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/?ref=logo#!/photo.php?fbid=10150776797062349&set=a.419111792348.213366.105212777348&type=1 "Coast has two new announcers taking the place of Ross Mitchell..."]</ref> Since 2007, ''Coast to Coast AM'' rolls out more numbers on special occasions, including lines that are reserved for special "themed" callers, for example those who claim to be from other [[dimensions]], time periods, and those [[spiritual possession|possessed]] by spirits.

The [[Halloween]] edition of ''Coast to Coast AM'' becomes '''''Ghost to Ghost AM''''', as listeners call in with their [[ghost stories]]. The [[New Year's Eve]] show usually entails listeners calling in their predictions for the coming year, and the host rating the predictions made a year earlier. In recent years, the host of the New Year's Eve prediction show has been cautioning the open line callers that they may not predict the assassination of any person or the death of the [[President of the United States|US president]].

The [[2006 in video gaming|2006]] [[first-person shooter]] ''[[Prey (video game)|Prey]]'' featured Art Bell as a guest star and featured him as himself in mock episodes of the show with guests calling in to discuss the various extraterrestrial or mythical phenomena making up the game's story line, sometimes to advance the plot and other times simply for humour. Additionally, an [[internet video]] featuring Bell was shown in the 2007 [[Lindsay Lohan]] film ''[[I Know Who Killed Me]]'', whose plot centered around the phenomenon of stigmatic twins.

==Criticism of declining quality, and declining ratings under  George Noory==
Art Bell stated that the decision to come out of retirement was entirely his, a response to the direction that George Noory has taken the show—closer to political talk radio rather than the open-minded exploration of the supernatural that defined Bell's tenure as host. Noory, Bell says, has "ruined" the franchise of Coast to Coast AM.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dickey |first=Jack |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2151794,00.html#ixzz2ehU9iB4g |title=Insomniac Radio King Art Bell Reclaims His Crown |publisher=Time |date=2013-09-23 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref>
Bell has publicly stated on his Facebook that he no longer wishes to be associated with Coast to Coast AM. 
There are also internet forums which have sprung up that are overwhelmingly critical of Noory hosting Coast to Coast AM.<ref>[http://bellgab.com/ THE Art Bell Fan Forum - Index]</ref>

The Commonsense show has described Noory-led Coast to Coast by the following:
{{quote|When Art Bell relinquished control of his program to corporate interests, Premiere and ultimately Clear Channel, Coast to Coast AM was never the same, as the show took a turn and became reflective of “the corporate message”. Noory’s listening numbers are nothing to write home about. Bell has an estimated  6-12 million listeners on any given night. In contrast, Noory’s numbers are a paltry 275,000 to 300,000 listeners per night. George Noory is the perfect front man, with little hands-on control of the show, and his numbers take on a secondary level of importance as he is very good at protecting the corporate turf while being very careful to only take risks on subjects that the corporate sponsors do not care about (e.g. crystal skulls, near death experiences, psychic mediums, etc.). Gone are the former days of Art Bell’s hard-hitting journalism.|<ref>{{cite news|last=Hodges |first=Dave |url=http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2014/02/06/john-b-wells-fired-for-being-too-popular-and-truthful-an-exclusive-interview/ |title=John B. Wells Fired for Being Too Popular and Truthful: An Exclusive Interview |publisher=The Common Sense Show |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}</ref>}}
The ratings of Coast to Coast AM under Noory have fallen to only 3.25 million listeners per week. Coast to Coast AM previously boasted a weekly listening audience in excess of 10 million listeners.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fisher |first=Marc |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/the-outer-limits-a-lone-voice-in-the-desert-lures-10-million-listeners/2013/10/28/95615598-3ff6-11e3-9c8b-e8deeb3c755b_story.html |title=The outer limits: A lone voice in the desert lures 10 million listeners |publisher=The Washington Post |date=1998-03-29 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkers.com/top-talk-radio-audiences/ |title=The Top Talk Radio Audiences |publisher=Talkers.Com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}</ref> Since 2013 the listener numbers have shrunk an additional half million to a  mere 2.75 million.<ref name="talkers.com">http://www.talkers.com/top-talk-radio-audiences/</ref> Listner numbers in 2014 has also continued to decline to 2.5 million.<ref name="talkers.com"/>

==Hosts==
George Noory hosts the show on weeknights and the first Sunday of every month. [[Las Vegas]]-based investigative journalist [[George Knapp (journalist)|George Knapp]] hosts the 3rd and 4th Sunday of each month, and when there is a 5th Sunday, George Noory or another fill in will host. Since the firing of host John B Wells,most Saturdays and non-Knapp Sundays are hosted by  Dave Schrader or Canadian political conspiracy talk show host Richard Syrett. Syrett and Schrader also work Fridays when Noory travels to Denver to record his video show ''Beyond Belief''.

===Former hosts===
[[Mike Siegel]] hosted the show from April 2000 until February 2001. He became a frequent substitute for the show's original host, Art Bell in late 1999, and when Bell announced his retirement in early 2000, he recommended Siegel to succeed him.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/11/entertainment/ca-18179 | title=Veteran Talk-Show Host Mike Siegel to Succeed Bell | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | author=Judith Michaelson | date=April 11, 2000 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jZJsLenw |archivedate=2009-09-05}}</ref> Siegel maintained the format of the show that Bell had created, but his personal style was very different, and the show became less popular. Siegel hosted the show from [[Seattle, Washington]], where he lived. Early in 2001, Bell decided to return, and Siegel left the show.

Other past hosts include weekend host [[Ian Punnett]] (who was forced by [[tinnitus]] to give up the show), [[Hilly Rose]], [[Barbara Simpson]], and [[Rollye James]], and John B Wells who was fired.

In January 2012, [[John B. Wells]] replaced Ian Punnett as the Saturday evening and the second Sunday evening host of Coast to Coast AM. He was fired in January 2014 because the show's producers wanted to go in a "different direction on Saturday nights," and is now the host of his own subscriber based program.<ref>[http://caravantomidnight.com Caravan to Midnight]</ref> On the February 4, 2014 episode of his "Caravan to Midnight" show, Wells stated that he thought he had been fired because he hated President Obama to the point where he can't bear the sight or sound of him such that he avoids "even speaking his [President Obama's] name," and that he thought President Obama is a communist.

==Broadcast area==
''Coast to Coast AM'' claims to be broadcast on over 500 United States affiliates (along with a limited number of [[FM broadcasting|FM stations]]), as well as numerous Canadian affiliates, several of which [[Streaming media|stream]] the show on their station's website.  The affiliate group is fronted by 12 [[clear-channel station]]s, among them [[WBT (radio station)|WBT]] in [[Charlotte]], [[WHO (AM)|WHO]] in [[Des Moines]], [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] in [[New York City]], [[KFBK (AM)|KFBK]] in [[Sacramento]], and [[KFI]] in [[Los Angeles]].  Among them, they bring the show to almost all of North America.

The show's ''Streamlink'' service offers live Internet feeds of the show by subscription. The program is also broadcast on [[Sirius XM Radio]] in the United States, on [[Sirius XM Stars Too|Indie Talk Radio]], channel 104 since November 12, 2013.

The show's complete schedule can be found on its website.  Because the show is so frequently repeated, audible cue signals are inserted at the beginning and end of commercial breaks, to facilitate substitution of commercials by local stations.

WOR AM Broadcast schedule replaced C to C with Met game rebroadcasts on most nights. C to C schedule has not been updated.

A complete list of guests is available on the Coast to Coast website, where they can be searched by show date, year, alphabet, etc.[http://www.coasttocoastam.com/guests]

==Banned guests==

'''[[Sylvia Browne]]''' (deceased) was banned by [[George Noory]] after the [[Sylvia Browne#Sago Mine disaster|Sago mine incident]] in January 2006.

'''Nancy Lieder''' is no longer booked, since several of her prophecies of doom have spectacularly failed.

'''[[Kreskin|The Amazing Kreskin]]''' was banned after misrepresenting a so-called mass "happening" as a UFO sighting.

The Ghost Buster Gals are no longer booked, since they appeared on ''[[Art Bell's Dark Matter]]''. Foster and Laure Lee have stated that Coast to Coast AM producer Tommy Danheiser informed them that since they were on ''Dark Matter'' their services were no longer needed.

==Associated shows==
Several shows associated with ''Coast to Coast AM'' have aired in the slot immediately preceding the late Saturday night edition of the program, from 6–10 p.m. Pacific time.

===Dreamland===
''[[Dreamland (webcast)|Dreamland]]'' was another Art Bell creation, nearly identical to ''Coast to Coast AM'' but less caller driven.  Bell recorded ''Dreamland'' on Friday afternoons where the show streamed live over the Internet and listeners could call in towards the end of the show.  The show then aired at various times on different stations during the weekend, but doing eight shows a week got to be too much and he handed over control of the show to [[Whitley Strieber]]. Many affiliates aired the show before ''Coast to Coast AM'' on Sunday nights, but [[Premiere Radio Networks|Premiere Radio]] pre-empted that time spot after it began to syndicate [[Matt Drudge]], and then dropped the program entirely. It is now heard over the [[Internet radio|Internet]], exclusively at [http://www.unknowncountry.com/ UnknownCountry.com].

''Dreamland'' continues to focus on many of the same topics as its sister program, although often with a more spiritual point of view, as well as an increased emphasis on [[extra-terrestrials]].

===Coast to Coast Live===
Upon Art Bell's January 2006 return, [[Ian Punnett]] hosted ''Coast To Coast Live'' on Saturdays from 9&nbsp;p.m. to 1&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time. A spin-off of the original ''Coast to Coast AM'', the show covered similar topics as its flagship program. With Bell's July 2007 retirement, ''Coast to Coast Live'' was discontinued, with Punnett returning to host the regular Saturday edition.

===Art Bell, Somewhere in Time===
Replacing ''Coast to Coast Live'' in the late Saturday time slot is a series of reruns of classic Art Bell episodes of ''Coast to Coast AM'', airing under the title ''Somewhere in Time''.

==Newsletters==
The radio show published a monthly newsletter for subscribers called ''After Dark''. Discussing matters covered on the show, it contained fourteen inner pages, approximately 46% of which were illustrations and photos, rather than text. The front cover contained artwork, and the back cover showed a list of recent shows.  The newsletter ceased publication in January 2011, but the show now offers a free daily e-newsletter called CoastZone.

'''David James "Dave" Pelzer''' (born December 29, 1960 in [[San Francisco]], California)<ref>"California Birth Index", www.ancestry.com : "David J Pelzer , December 29, 1960, San Francisco County, mother's maiden name Christa"</ref> is an [[United States|American]] author, of  several autobiographical and self-help books.<ref name="nyt"/> He is best known for his 1995 [[memoir]] of childhood abuse, ''A Child Called "It"''.

==Biography==
Pelzer was born in [[San Francisco, California]], and was the second of five boys. He grew up in the city of [[Daly City]], California.<ref name="Sydney">{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Memories-of-a-family-at-war/2005/03/28/1111862318203.html |title =Memories of a family at war |last=de Bertodano |first=Helena |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=29 March 2005 |accessdate= 5 January 2014}}</ref> He is the son of Stephen Joseph Pelzer (1923–1980), a [[San Francisco]] fireman, and Catherine Roerva Christen Pelzer (1929–1992). As a small child Pelzer faced abuse for several years which Pelzer wrote about in his books. He said that as a child, he was continually abused, mistreated, and beaten by his mother, who thought of it as a game. His teachers stepped in on March 5, 1973, wherein 12-year-old Pelzer was placed in foster care. At age 18 he joined the [[U.S. Air Force]] in 1979 and served in the [[Gulf War]].<ref>[http://www.davepelzer.com/about.html Dave Pelzer website bio]</ref><ref>[http://www.prweb.com/releases/2008/07/prweb1115404.htm PR Web news article]</ref> Pelzer married in the 1980s to his first wife, Patsy (a [[pseudonym]]), with whom he had a son.

==Abuse==
His book ''A Child called "It"'' describes from his viewpoint about the severe abuse he suffered as a child. He writes how his mother was physically and emotionally abusive towards him from ages 4 to 12. In his book he describes how his mom starved him, forced him to drink [[ammonia]], stabbed him in the stomach, burned his arm on a gas stove, and forced him to eat his own vomit. He mentioned that his father was not active in resolving or stopping the conflicts between Pelzer and his alcoholic mother. In 1973 at age 12 he was sent to a foster family. In the book he uses pseudonyms to reference his relatives.

Pelzer]], published his own autobiography detailing his experiences as well called ''A Brother's Journey''.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Journey-Surviving-Childhood-Abuse/dp/0446696331/ref=pd_sim_b_4]</ref> Paraphrased, Pelzer said in the afterword of his book that his objectives for his story was to show how a parent can turn to be abusive and how the human spirit can triumph and survive.<ref name="Pelzer1">{{cite book |title=A Child Called It: One Child's Courage to Survive |first=Dave |last=Pelzer |publisher=HCI |year=1995 |page=52 |isbn= 978-1558743663}}</ref>

===Reception of first book===
His first book "A Child Called It" was successful and garnered interest.<ref name=BBC /> It was listed on the [[New York Times Bestseller List]] for several years and in 5 years had sold at least 1.6 million copies.<ref name="Guardian" /><ref name=slate /> Pelzer was  invited to television shows such as [[Montel Williams]] and [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]] to give interviews after the book was published.

Readers responded in their own ways to the book; in a 2001 news article Orion UK Publishing's Trevor Dolby said, "We get 10 letters a day from people saying the first book mirrors their own childhood, which is very depressing." <ref name="BBC">{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Dave Pelzer: Dave who?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1138118.stm|accessdate=5 January 2014|newspaper=BBC|date=January 27, 2001}}</ref> One reader was quoted that the book, "Made me see that I wasn't the only one out there... that had this... in their life.

Writer [[David Plotz]] criticized Pelzer in an article he wrote for ''[[Slate]]''. In the article Plotz says that because Pelzer's parents are dead it is hard to question them.<ref name=slate>{{cite news|last=Plotz|first=David|title=Dave Pelzer The child-abuse entrepreneur|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2000/09/dave_pelzer.html|accessdate=29 March 2013|newspaper=Slate|date=September 29, 2000}}</ref>

==Books==
His second book, ''The Lost Boy: A Foster Child's Search for the Love of a Family'' was published shortly after in 1997. The book covered Pelzer's teen years. The third book in his series, ''A Man Named Dave: A Story of Triumph and Forgiveness'' was about Pelzer's experiences as an adult and how he forgave his father. In 2001 he wrote ''Help Yourself: Finding Hope, Courage, And Happiness'' which was a self-help book. When discussing his seventh book ''Moving Forward'' he said, "My message has always been about resilience".

==Controversy==
The assertions in his memoirs have led to some skeptical commentary.<ref name=mail>{{cite news|title=Is He Making "It" All Up?|publisher = The Mail on Sunday}}</ref> In a 2002 ''[[New York Times]]'' article by Pat Jordan the author questioned the reliability of Pelzer's recollections. He said that "Pelzer has an exquisite recall of his abuse, but almost no recall of anything that would authenticate that abuse," such as any details about his mother.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Jordan|date=July 28, 2002|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/28/magazine/dysfunction-for-dollars.html?pagewanted=all|title=Dysfunction For Dollars|publisher=New York Times}}</ref> Two members of his family, his maternal grandmother and brother, have disputed his book. One of his younger brothers, Stephen, denies that any abuse took place, and says that he thinks David was placed in foster care because "he started a fire and was caught shoplifting."<ref name="nyt"/> However, his other brother [[Richard Pelzer]] is author of the book ''A Brother's Journey,'' which confirms much of what David has said and describes his own abuse when David was finally removed from the home.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In regards to this Dave has said that Stephen had affection towards his mother and that, "He misses her terribly because she protected him".<ref name=2004TG /> Due to the criticism from the NYT article Dave does not give interviews often.<ref name=2004TG />

In an article with ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' Pelzer's grandmother said she believed Dave had been abused but not as severely as he described.  She also said she didn't believe his brother Richard was abused. It was revealed however that Pelzer's grandmother did not live in the same state as his brothers and family and was not in contact with them when the abuse happened.<ref name="Boston">{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/04/26/family_feud/?page=full |title =Family Feud |last=English |first=Bella |publisher=Boston Globe |date=26 April 2006 |accessdate= 5 January 2014}}</ref>

An article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' notes that gaps in the background narrative "makes the foreground harder to trust."<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|last=Bedell|first=Geraldine|title=Child abuse as entertainment|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/sep/02/biography.features|accessdate=29 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 September 2001}}</ref> The author writes, "My own hunch is that, substantially, he's telling the truth [...] But there is a definite feeling of exaggeration in the later two books..." The author then states the same feeling Plotz also covered in his article, that she feels Pelzer is profiting from his abuse and minimizing the seriousness of the crime by making the writing "entertaining".<ref name="Guardian" />

{{Banking}}
A '''merchant bank''' is a [[financial institution]] that provides [[capital (economics)|capital]] to companies in the form of [[share (finance)|share]] ownership instead of [[loan]]s. A merchant bank also provides advisory on corporate matters to the firms they lend to. In the [[United Kingdom]], the term "merchant bank" refers to an [[investment bank]]. 

Today, according to the U.S. [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (acronym FDIC), "the term merchant banking is generally understood to mean negotiated private equity investment by financial institutions in the unregistered securities of either privately or publicly held companies."<ref>[http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/banking/2001sep/article2.html Merchant Banking: Past and Present]</ref> Both [[commercial bank]]s and [[investment bank]]s may engage in merchant banking activities. Historically, merchant banks' original purpose was to facilitate and/or finance production and trade of commodities, hence the name "merchant". Few banks today restrict their activities to such a narrow scope.

==History==
{{Main|History of banking}}

Merchant banks are in fact the original modern banks. These were invented in the [[Middle Ages]] by [[Italy|Italian]] grain merchants. As the [[Lombardy]] merchants and bankers grew in stature based on the strength of the [[Lombardy|Lombard]] plains [[cereal]] crops, many displaced [[Judaism|Jews]] fleeing [[Spain|Spanish]] persecution were attracted to the trade. They brought with them ancient practices from the Middle and Far East [[Silk Road|silk routes]].  Originally intended for the finance of long trading journeys, these methods were applied to finance the production and trading of grain. 

In France during the 17th and 18th century, a merchant banker or ''marchand-banquier'' was not just considered a trader but also received the status of being an [[entrepreneur]] par excellence. Merchant banks in the United Kingdom came into existence in the early 19th century, the oldest being [[Barings Bank]].

The Jews could not hold land in Italy, so they entered the great trading [[piazza]]s and halls of Lombardy, alongside the local traders, and set up their benches to trade in crops. They had one great advantage over the locals. Christians were strictly forbidden the sin of [[usury]], defined as lending at interest ([[Islam]] makes similar condemnations of usury). The Jewish newcomers, on the other hand, could lend to farmers against crops in the field, a high-risk loan at what would have been considered usurious rates by the Church; but the Jews were not subject to the Church's dictates.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In this way they could secure the grain-sale rights against the eventual harvest. They then began to advance payment against the future delivery of grain shipped to distant ports. In both cases they made their profit from the present discount against the future price. This two-handed trade was time-consuming and soon there arose a class of merchants who were trading grain [[debt]] instead of grain.

The [[Court Jew]] performed both financing (credit) and underwriting (insurance) functions.  Financing took the form of a crop loan at the beginning of the growing season, which allowed a farmer to develop and manufacture (through seeding, growing, weeding, and harvesting) his annual crop. Underwriting in the form of a crop, or commodity, insurance guaranteed the delivery of the crop to its buyer, typically a merchant wholesaler. In addition, traders performed the merchant function by making arrangements to supply the buyer of the crop through alternative sources—grain stores or alternate markets, for instance—in the event of crop failure. He could also keep the farmer (or other commodity producer) in business during a [[drought]] or other [[crop failure]], through the issuance of a crop (or commodity) insurance against the hazard of failure of his crop. 

Merchant banking progressed from financing trade on one's own behalf to settling trades for others and then to holding deposits for settlement of "billette" or notes written by the people who were still brokering the actual grain. And so the merchant's "benches" (''bank'' is derived from the Italian for bench, ''banco'', as in a [[counter]]) in the great grain markets became centers for holding money against a [[bill (currency)|bill]] (''billette'', a note, a letter of formal exchange, later a [[bill of exchange]] and later still a [[cheque]]). 

These deposited funds were intended to be held for the settlement of grain trades, but often were used for the bench's own trades in the meantime. The term [[bankrupt]] is a corruption of the Italian ''banca rotta'', or broken bench, which is what happened when someone lost his traders' deposits. Being "broke" has the same connotation.

A sensible manner of [[discounting]] interest to the depositors against what could be earned by employing their money in the trade of the bench soon developed; in short, selling an "interest" to them in a specific trade, thus overcoming the [[usury]] objection. Once again this merely developed what was an ancient method of financing long-distance transport of goods. 

The medieval Italian markets were disrupted by wars and in any case were limited by the fractured nature of the Italian states. And so the next generation of bankers arose from migrant Jewish merchants in the great wheat-growing areas of Germany and Poland. Many of these merchants were from the same families who had been part of the development of the banking process in Italy. They also had links with family members who had, centuries before, fled Spain for both Italy and England. As non-agricultural wealth expanded, many families of [[goldsmith]]s (another business not prohibited to Jews) also gradually moved into banking. This course of events set the stage for the rise of Jewish family banking firms whose names still resonate today, such as [[Warburgs]] and [[Rothschilds]]. 

[[File:JohannHinrichGossler.jpg|thumb|[[Johann Hinrich Gossler]], a prominent Hamburg merchant banker of the 18th century]]
The rise of [[Protestantism]], however, freed many European Christians from Rome's dictates against usury. In the late 18th century, Protestant merchant families began to move into banking to an increasing degree, especially in trading countries such as the United Kingdom ([[Barings]]), Germany ([[Schroders]], [[Berenberg family|Berenbergs]]) and the Netherlands ([[Hope & Co.]], [[Gülcher & Mulder]]) At the same time, new types of financial activities broadened the scope of banking far beyond its origins. The merchant-banking families dealt in everything from [[underwriting]] [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] to originating foreign [[loans]]. For instance, [[bullion]] trading and [[Bond (finance)|bond]] issuance were two of the specialties of the Rothschilds. In 1803, [[Barings Bank|Barings]] teamed with [[Hope & Co.]] to facilitate the [[Louisiana Purchase]].

In the 19th century, the rise of trade and industry in the US led to powerful new private merchant banks, culminating in [[J.P. Morgan & Co.]] During the 20th century, however, the financial world began to outgrow the resources of family-owned and other forms of private-equity banking. [[Corporation]]s came to dominate the banking business. For the same reasons, merchant banking activities became just one area of interest for modern banks.

Here is a list of merchant banks of the past and present:

*[[Barings Bank]]
*[[Berenberg Bank]]
*[[BDT Capital Partners]]
*[[N. M. Rothschild & Sons]]
*[[George Peabody & Co.]]
*[[Kleinwort Benson]]
*[[Guinness Mahon]]
*[[Schroders]]
*[[J. S. Morgan & Co.]]
*[[Hope & Co.]]
*[[Defoe Fournier & Cie.]]

*[[Kuhn, Loeb & Co.]]
*[[Hambros Bank]]
*[[Hill Samuel]]
*[[Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.]]
*[[Samuel Montagu & Co.]]
*[[H. J. Merck & Co.]]

?==Modern practices==
Known as “accepting and issuing houses” in the [[UK]] and “investment banks” in the [[U.S.]], modern merchant banks offer a wide range of activities, including [[issue management]], [[Investment management|portfolio management]], credit [[Syndicated loan|syndication]], [[acceptance credit]], counsel on [[mergers and acquisitions]], insurance, etc. 

Of these two classes of merchant banks, the U.S. variant initiates loans and then sells them to investors.<ref>Fitch, Thomas P. (2000 [1990]), ''Dictionary of Banking Terms'': "Merchant Bank", 4th Edition, New York: Barron's Business Guides, ISBN 0-7641-1260-0</ref>  Even though some of these companies call themselves "merchant banks," they have few, if any, of the characteristics of former merchant banks.

'''Hanns Johst''' (8 July 1890 – 23 November 1978) was a [[Germany|German]] playwright and [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Poet Laureate]].

Hanns Johst was born in Seehausen as the son of an elementary school teacher. He grew up in [[Oschatz]] and [[Leipzig]]. As a juvenile he planned to become a missionary. When he was 17 years old he worked as an auxiliary in a [[Bethel Institution]]. In 1910 he earned his [[Abitur]] in Leipzig and then started studying medicine and philosophy and—later—history of art.

He volunteered for the army in 1914. In 1918 he settled down in Allmannshausen (part of [[Berg, Upper Bavaria|Berg]]) at the [[Starnberger See]].

==Early work==
His early work is influenced by [[Expressionism]]. Examples include ''Der Anfang'' [The Beginning] (1917) and ''Der König'' [The King] (1920). Later, he turned to a [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] philosophy in plays such as ''Wechsler und Händler'' [Money changers and Traders] (1923) and ''[[Thomas Paine]]'' (1927).

[[Bertolt Brecht]]'s first play [[Baal (play)|Baal]] was written in response to Johst's play ''Der Einsame'' [The Lonely], a dramatization of the life of playwright [[Christian Dietrich Grabbe]]. In 1928 Johst joined [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s "Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur" (Militant League for German Culture) designed to combat "Jewish" influence in German culture. In 1932 he joined the Nazi party, explaining his agreement with [[Hitler]]'s ideology in the essay "Standpunkt und Fortschritt" [Standpoint and Progress] in 1933.

==''Schlageter''==
When the Nazis achieved power in 1933, Johst wrote the play ''Schlageter'', an expression of Nazi ideology performed on Hitler's 44th birthday, 20 April 1933, to celebrate his victory. It was a heroic biography of the proto-Nazi martyr [[Albert Leo Schlageter]]. The famous line "when I hear the word culture, I reach for my gun", often associated with Nazi leaders, derives from this play. The actual original line from the play is slightly different: "Wenn ich Kultur höre ... entsichere ich meinen Browning!" "Whenever I hear of culture... I release the [[Safety (firearms)|safety catch]] of my [[Browning_Arms_Company|Browning]]!" (Act 1, Scene 1). It is spoken by another character in conversation with the young Schlageter. In the scene Schlageter and his wartime comrade Friedrich Thiemann are studying for a college examination, but then start disputing whether it is worthwhile doing so when the nation is not free. Thiemann argues he would prefer to fight than to study.

{{quote|SCHLAGETER: Good old Fritz! (Laughing.) No paradise will entice you out of your barbed wire entanglement!

THIEMANN: That's for damned sure! Barbed wire is barbed wire! I know what I'm up against.... No rose without a thorn!... And the last thing I'll stand for is ideas to get the better of me! I know that rubbish from '18 ..., fraternity, equality, ..., freedom ..., beauty and dignity! You gotta use the right bait to hook 'em. And then, you're right in the middle of a parley and they say: Hands up! You're disarmed..., you republican voting swine!—No, let 'em keep their good distance with their whole ideological kettle of fish ... I shoot with live ammunition! When I hear the word culture ..., I release the safety on my Browning!"

SCHLAGETER: What a thing to say!

THIEMANN: It hits the mark! You can be sure of that.

SCHLAGETER: You've got a hair trigger.|Hans Johst's Nazi Drama Schlageter. Translated with an introduction by Ford B. Parkes-Perret. Akademischer Verlag Hans-Dieter Heinz, Stuttgart, 1984.}}

The famous line is regularly misattributed, sometimes to [[Hermann Göring]] and sometimes to [[Heinrich Himmler]]. In December 2007, historian [[David Starkey]] misattributed it to [[Joseph Goebbels]] in comments criticizing [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] for being "poorly educated and philistine".<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,,2231413,00.html Queen is poorly educated and philistine, says Starkey | UK news | The Guardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It has also been adapted, for example by [[Stephen Hawking]] as "When I hear of [[Schrödinger's cat]], I reach for my pistol" and by filmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] in 1963's film ''[[Le Mépris]]'', when a producer says to [[Fritz Lang]]: "Whenever I hear the word culture, I bring out my checkbook." Lang evokes the original line as he answers "Some years ago—some horrible years ago—the Nazis used to take out a pistol instead of a checkbook." Songwriter [[Roger Miller (rock musician)|Roger Miller]] of ''[[Mission of Burma]]'' titled his 1981 song "[[That's When I Reach for My Revolver]]" after the line. {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Role in Nazi Germany==
[[File:Johst-hanns-1935b.jpg|thumb|Johst receives a literary prize from [[Alfred Rosenberg]]]]
In 1933, Johst signed the ''[[Gelöbnis treuester Gefolgschaft]]'', a declaration of loyalty to Hitler by pro-Nazi writers.<ref name=letters>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7iC7BGIcvTQC&pg=PA367 88 "writers", from ''Letters of Heinrich and Thomas Mann, 1900–1949, Volume 12 of Weimar and Now: German Cultural Criticism'', University of California Press 1998, ISBN 0-520-07278-2], p.&nbsp;367–8</ref> In 1935, Johst became the President of the ''Reichsschrifttumskammer'' (writer's union) and of the ''Deutsche Akademie für Dichtung'' (poetry academy), powerful organisations for German writers. In the same year the last prominent Jewish writers, e.g. [[Martin Buber]], were expelled from the Reichsschrifttumskammer. By this time these organisations restricted membership to writers whose work was either explicitly pro-Nazi or at least approved of by the Nazis as non-"degenerate". Johst achieved many other positions of importance within the Nazi state, and he was named in the [[Gottbegnadeten list]] of September 1944 as one of the Reich's most important artists.  During the war he held various positions within the SS.

After the war Johst was interned by the Allies. In 1949 he was tried for his activities, and was imprisoned for three and a half years. On his release he was unable to reestablish his career as a writer. He was only able to publish poems under the pseudonym "Odemar Oderich" for ''Die kluge Hausfrau'', the magazine of the German supermarket chain [[Edeka]] .<ref>Ernst Klee: ''Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich'', Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, p.286</ref>

'''''PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story''''' is a [[book]] by Dr. [[Alexander Shulgin]] and [[Ann Shulgin]] which was published in 1991. The subject of the work is [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] [[phenethylamine]] [[Derivative (chemistry)|chemical derivative]]s, notably those that act as [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]s and/or [[empathogen-entactogen]]s. The main title is an [[acronym]] that stands for "Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved".

The book is arranged into two parts:

# A fictionalized autobiography of the couple.
# Detailed synthesis instructions for 179 different psychedelic compounds (most of which Shulgin discovered himself), including bioassays, dosages, and other commentary.

The second part is made freely available by Shulgin on [https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal.shtml Erowid.org] while the first part is available only in the printed text.

Shulgin's choices of synthesis procedures in the second half of the book are themselves perhaps a small act of subversion: while the reactions are beyond the ability of people with a basic chemistry education, some tend to emphasize techniques that do not require difficult to obtain chemicals. Notable among these are the use of [[Aluminium amalgam|mercury-aluminum amalgam]] (an unusual but easy way to obtain [[reagent]]) as a [[reducing agent]] and detailed suggestions on legal plant sources of important drug precursors such as [[safrole]].

== Impact & popularity ==

Through ''PIHKAL'' (and later ''[[TIHKAL]]''), Shulgin sought to ensure that his discoveries would escape the limits of professional research labs and find their way to the public; a goal consistent with his stated beliefs that [[psychedelic drug]]s can be valuable tools for self-exploration. The [[MDMA]] ("ecstasy") synthesis published in ''PIHKAL'' remains one of the most common [[clandestine chemistry|clandestine]] methods of its manufacture to this day. Many countries have banned the major substances for which this book gives directions for synthesis, such as [[2C-B]], [[2C-T-2]], and [[2C-T-7]]. In the United Kingdom, all but [[Methylenedioxyhydroxyamphetamine|MDOH]] and [[phenethylamine]] are illegal.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In 1994, two years after ''PIHKAL'' was published, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) raided Shulgin's lab and requested that he turn over his DEA license. Richard Meyer, spokesman for DEA's San Francisco Field Division, has stated in reference to ''PIHKAL'' "It is our opinion that those books are pretty much cookbooks on how to make illegal drugs. Agents tell me that in clandestine labs that they have raided, they have found copies of those books," suggesting that the publication of ''PIHKAL'' and the termination of Shulgin's license may have been related.<ref name="Dr. Ecstasy">{{cite news | author = Drake Bennett | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/magazine/30ECSTASY.html | title = Dr. Ecstasy | work = New York Times Magazine | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = January 30, 2005}}</ref>

== Notable excerpts ==
=== Essential Amphetamines === <!-- Note: a redirect, [[Essential amphetamines]], links to this subsection -->

The "Essential Amphetamines" are what Shulgin describes as ten amphetamines that differ from natural products such as [[safrole]] or [[myristicin]] by an amine group ([http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal157.shtml ''PIHKAL'' Entry #157 TMA]). The list consists of:

* [[Paramethoxyamphetamine|PMA]] (''para''-'''m'''ethoxy-'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[2,4-DMA]] (2,4-'''d'''i'''m'''ethoxy-'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[3,4-DMA]] (3,4-'''d'''i'''m'''ethoxy-'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]] (3,4-'''m'''ethylene'''d'''ioxy-'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[3-Methoxy-4,5-methylendioxyamphetamine|MMDA]] (3-'''m'''ethoxy-4,5-'''m'''ethylen'''d'''ioxy-'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[MMDA-3a]] (2-'''m'''ethoxy-3,4-'''m'''ethylen'''d'''ioxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[MMDA-2]] (2-'''m'''ethoxy-4,5-'''m'''ethylen'''d'''ioxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[Trimethoxyamphetamine|TMA]] (3,4,5-'''t'''ri'''m'''ethoxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[Trimethoxyamphetamine|TMA-2]] (2,4,5-'''t'''ri'''m'''ethoxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[DMMDA]] (2,5-'''d'''i'''m'''ethoxy-3,4-'''m'''ethylene'''d'''ioxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[DMMDA-2]] (2,3-'''d'''i'''m'''ethoxy-4,5-'''m'''ethylene'''d'''ioxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[Tetramethoxyamphetamine|TeMA]] (2,3,4,5-'''te'''tra'''m'''ethoxy'''a'''mphetamine)

Not all of these chemicals are bioassayed in ''PIHKAL'', some are merely mentioned.

=== Magical Half-Dozen ===

The so-called "magical half-dozen" refers to Shulgin's self-rated most important phenethylamine compounds, all of which except mescaline he developed and synthesized himself. They are found within the first book of ''PIHKAL'', and are as follows:

* [[Mescaline]] (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine)
* [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|DOM]] (2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine, DOM being short for '''d'''es'''o'''xy '''m'''ethyl, referring to the removal of the Oxygen atom from the Methoxy group on the "4" carbon.
* [[2C-B]] (2,5-dimethoxy-4-'''b'''romophenethylamine)
* [[2C-E]] (2,5-dimethoxy-4-'''e'''thylphenethylamine)
* [[2C-T-2]] (2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl'''t'''hiophenethylamine)
* [[2C-T-7]] (2,5-dimethoxy-4-propyl'''t'''hiophenethylamine)

As of July 9, 2012 all six are Schedule I controlled substances in the United States.

'''James Nachtwey''' (born March 14, 1948<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.biography.com/articles/James-Nachtwey-38952 biography.com | accessdate = 23 April 2013 | publisher = A+E Television Networks, LLC | title = James Nachtwey biography}}</ref>) is an American [[photojournalist]] and war photographer.

He grew up in [[Massachusetts]] and graduated from [[Dartmouth College]], where he studied [[Art History]] and [[Political Science]] (1966–70).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.401projects.com/index.php?mode=gallery&section_id=155 | accessdate = 23 April 2013 | publisher = 401 Projects | title = James Nachtwey| quote = James Nachtwey grew up in Massachusetts and graduated from Dartmouth College, where he studied Art History and Political Science (1966-70)}}</ref>

He has been awarded the [[Overseas Press Club]]'s [[Robert Capa Gold Medal]] five times. In 2003, he was injured by a grenade in an attack on his convoy while serving as a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' contributing correspondent in [[Baghdad]], from which he has made a full recovery. On February 1, 2014, Nachtwey was grazed by a bullet on his left leg whilst photographing the Thailand political protests.<ref>http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/02/01/3906382/fear-of-violence-grips-thai-capital.html</ref>

==Photography==
Nachtwey started working as a newspaper photographer in 1976 at the [[Albuquerque Journal]]. In 1980, he moved to New York and began working as a [[freelance]] photographer.  In 1981, Nachtwey covered his first overseas assignment in [[Northern Ireland]] illustrating civil strife.  He has documented a variety of armed conflicts and social issues, spending time in [[South Africa]], [[Latin America]], the [[Middle East]], [[Russia]], [[Eastern Europe]], the former [[Soviet Union]] shooting pictures of war, conflict and famine, and images of socio-political issues ([[pollution]], [[prison|crime and punishment]]) in [[Western Europe]] and the [[United States]]. He currently lives in New York City.

In 1994, Nachtwey was covering the upcoming elections in South Africa, the first non-racial ones in decades.  As an associate of the [[Bang-Bang Club]], he was at the scene when [[Ken Oosterbroek]] was killed and [[Greg Marinovich]] was seriously injured.

Nachtwey had been injured previously in his work, but it was during his extensive coverage of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|United States invasion of Iraq]] that he received his first combat injury.  As Nachtwey, along with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' [[correspondent]] [[Michael Weisskopf]] rode in the back of a [[Humvee]] with the [[United States Army]] "Tomb Raiders" Survey Platoon, an [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|insurgent]] threw a [[grenade]] into the vehicle. Weisskopf grabbed the grenade to throw it out of the humvee, but it exploded in his hand. Two soldiers were injured in the explosion, along with the ''Time'' journalists. Nachtwey managed to take several photographs of medic Billie Grimes treating Weisskopf before passing out.  Both journalists were [[airlift]]ed to [[Germany]] and later to hospitals in the United States.  Nachtwey recovered sufficiently to return overseas to cover the [[tsunami]] in Southeast Asia of December 26, 2004.<ref name="poyplatoon">{{cite news|last=Ratnesar|first=Ramesh|author2=Weisskopf, Michael|title=Portrait of a Platoon|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=December 2003|url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/2003/poyplatoon.html}}</ref>

Nachtwey has worked with ''Time'' as a contract photographer since 1984.  He worked for Black Star from 1980 until 1985 and was a member of [[Magnum Photos]] from 1986 until 2001. In 2001, he was a founding member of the [[VII Photo Agency]] (he disassociated from VII in August 2011)<ref>{{citation |title=Nachtwey leaves VII|date=August 2011|url=http://pdnpulse.com/2011/08/nachtwey-has-left-vii-photo-agency-prepares-for-expansion.html}}</ref>

Nachtwey was present during the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the World Trade Center, and produced a well known related body of work. He also compiled a photo essay on the effects of the [[Sudan conflict]] on civilians.

==Awards, honors and films==
Nachtwey photographs have been exhibited throughout Europe and the United States and he has received numerous prizes and awards including the World Press Photo award in 1994. Nachtwey has also been awarded the [[Overseas Press Club]]'s Robert Capa Gold Medal  in 1983, 1984, 1986, 1994 and 1998. In 2001, the documentary ''[[War Photographer]]'' was released, focusing on Nachtwey and his work. Directed by [[Christian Frei]], the film received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for best documentary film.

Lanting was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of The Royal Photographic Society in 1999.<ref>http://www.rps.org/annual-awards/Honorary-Fellowships Accessed 2 December 2013</ref> These are awarded to distinguished persons having, from their position or attainments, an intimate connection with the science or fine art of photography or the application thereof.

Nachtwey received the prestigious [[Dan David Prize]] in 2002 for his haunting photos aimed to burden viewers with an uncomfortable awareness that will force them to seek justice and change.

In 2006, Nachtwey was awarded the 12th Annual [[Heinz Award]] in Arts and Humanities from the [[Heinz Family Foundation]] for his body of work,<ref>[http://heinzawards.net/recipients/james-nachtwey The Heinz Awards, James Nachtwey profile]</ref> an honor that includes a monetary prize of US $250,000. Nachtwey is one of three winners of the 2007 [[TED (conference)|TED]] Prize. Each recipient was granted $100,000 and one "world-changing wish" to be revealed at the 2007 TED conference, in Monterey, California. Many members of the TED Community, and a group of world-class companies, have pledged support to help fulfill the wishes. Nachtwey's wish, revealed March 8, 2007, is this: "There's a vital story that needs to be told, and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era."<ref>{{citation |title=James Nachtwey's TED Prize acceptance talk|publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]]|date=March 2007|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/james_nachtwey_s_searing_pictures_of_war.html}}</ref> Those who wish to help him will sign an NDA and help him "gain access to a place in the world where a critical situation is occurring and fully document it with photography; set a date to unveil the pictures and find a series of innovative ways to create powerful impact with them, using novel display technologies and the power of the Internet as well as media; and use the campaign to generate resources for organizations that are working to address and transform the situation." Early results of this work have been unveiled at XDRTB.org to document [[extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis]] throughout the world.

In 2008, Nachtwey exhibited a series of original photographs at Le Laboratoire in Paris, France. The exhibit entitled "Struggle For Life"<ref>{{citation |title=Un salutaire coup de poing|date=February 2008|url=http://www.lalibre.be/culture/arts-visuels/article/403367/un-salutaire-coup-de-poing.html}}</ref> documented the human toll of TB and AIDS presented the work of Nachtwey with text by Dr. Anne Goldfeld of work they began together in Cambodia in 2003<ref>{{citation |title=Picture of the Year 2004|date=March 2004|url=http://www.poyi.org/61/mpoy/nachtweythree01.php}}</ref> as well as photos from Thailand, Africa and Siberia. The work was accompanied by film portraits of Nachtwey and several leading medical scientists participating in the Attention! Symposium by American filmmaker [[Asa Mader]].

This drag force occurs in airplanes due to [[wing]]s or a [[lifting body]] redirecting air to cause [[lift (force)|lift]] and also in cars with airfoil wings that redirect air to cause a [[downforce]]. With other parameters remaining the same, induced drag increases as the [[angle of attack]] increases.<ref name=Clancy5.17>Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.17</ref>

==Source of induced drag==
[[Image:Induce drag downwash.png|right|thumb|400px|Induced drag is related to the amount of induced [[downwash]] in the vicinity of the wing. 
The grey vertical line labeled "L" is perpendicular to the free stream and indicates the orientation of the lift on the wing. The red vector labeled "L<sub>eff</sub>" is perpendicular to the actual airflow in the vicinity of the wing; it represents the lift on the airfoil section in two–dimensional flow at the same angle of attack. The lift generated by the wing has been tilted rearwards through an angle equal to the angle of the downwash in three-dimensional flow. The component of "L<sub>eff</sub>" parallel to the free stream is the induced drag on the wing.<ref>Hurt, H. H. (1965) ''Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators'', Figure 1.30, NAVWEPS 00-80T-80</ref><ref>Clancy, L.J. (1975) ''Aerodynamics'' Fig 5.24. Pitman Publishing Limited, London. ISBN 0-273-01120-0</ref><ref>Kermode, A.C. (1972). ''Mechanics of Flight'', Figure 3.29, Ninth edition. Longman Scientific & Technical, England. ISBN 0-582-42254-X</ref>]]
[[Lift (force)|Lift]] is produced by the changing direction of the flow around a wing. The change of direction results in a change of velocity (even if there is no speed change, just as seen in uniform circular motion), which is an acceleration. To change the direction of the flow therefore requires that a force be applied to the fluid; lift is simply the reaction force of the fluid acting on the wing.

When producing lift, air below the wing is generally at a higher pressure than the air pressure above the wing, while air above the wing is generally at a lower than atmospheric pressure. On a wing of finite span, this pressure difference causes air to flow  from the lower surface wing root, around the wingtip, towards the upper surface wing root. This spanwise flow of air combines with chordwise flowing air, causing a change in speed and direction, which twists the airflow and produces vortices along the wing trailing edge. The vortices created are unstable, and they quickly combine to produce [[wingtip vortices]].<ref>Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.14</ref>  The resulting vortices change the speed and direction of the airflow behind the trailing edge, deflecting it downwards, and thus inducing [[downwash]] behind the wing.

Wingtip vortices modify the airflow around a wing. Compared to a wing of infinite span, vortices reduce the effectiveness of the wing to generate lift, thus requiring a higher angle of attack to compensate, which tilts the total aerodynamic force rearwards.  The angular deflection is small and has little effect on the lift. However, there is an increase in the drag equal to the product of the lift force and the angle through which it is deflected. Since the deflection is itself a function of the lift, the additional drag is proportional to the square of the lift.<ref name=Clancy5.17/>

The total [[aerodynamic force]] is usually thought of as two components, lift and drag. By definition, the component of force parallel to the oncoming flow is called '''drag'''; and the component perpendicular to the oncoming flow is called '''lift'''.<ref>Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.3</ref> At practical [[Angle of attack|angles of attack]] the lift greatly exceeds the drag.<ref>[[Ira H. Abbott|Abbott, Ira H.]], and Von Doenhoff, Albert E., ''Theory of Wing Sections'', Section 1.2 and Appendix IV</ref>

==Reducing induced drag==
According to the equations below, a wing of infinite aspect ratio ([[wingspan]]/chord length) and constant [[airfoil]] section would seemingly produce no induced drag per unit of surface area (although this depends on what happens to the factor ''e''). The characteristics of such a wing can be measured on a section of wing spanning the width of a [[wind tunnel]], since the walls block spanwise flow and create what is effectively two-dimensional flow. However, in reality, there will still be more drag (induced drag) when the angle of attack is high than when it is zero or slightly negative.

A rectangular wing produces much more severe wingtip vortices than a tapered or [[elliptical wing]], therefore many modern wings are tapered. However, an elliptical planform is more efficient as the induced downwash (and therefore the effective angle of attack) is constant across the whole of the wingspan. Few aircraft have this planform because of manufacturing complications — the most famous examples being the [[World War II]] [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and [[P-47 Thunderbolt|Thunderbolt]]. Tapered wings with straight leading and trailing edges can approximate to elliptical lift distribution. Typically, straight wings produce between 5–15% more induced drag than an elliptical wing.

Similarly, a high [[wing aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] wing will produce less induced drag than a wing of low aspect ratio because the size of the wing vortices will be much reduced on a longer, thinner wing. Induced drag can therefore be said to be inversely proportional to aspect ratio. The lift distribution may also be modified by the use of [[Washout (aviation)|washout]], a spanwise twist of the wing to reduce the incidence towards the wingtips, and by changing the [[airfoil]] section near the wingtips. This allows more lift to be generated at the wing root and less towards the wingtip, which causes a reduction in the strength of the wingtip vortices.

Some early aircraft had fins mounted on the tips of the tailplane which served as endplates. More recent aircraft have wingtip mounted [[Wingtip device|winglets]] or wing fences to oppose the formation of vortices. Wingtip mounted fuel tanks may also provide some benefit, by preventing the spanwise flow of air around the wingtip.

==Calculation of induced drag==
[[Image:Lift drag graph.JPG|right|thumb|400px|Lift and Drag curves for a typical airfoil]]
For a ''planar'' wing with an elliptical lift distribution, induced drag is often calculated as follows. These equations make the induced drag depend on the square of the lift, for a given aspect ratio and surface area (while varying the angle of attack), but as the accompanying graph shows, this is only an approximation and is not valid at high angles of attack (and probably not for very high values of aspect ratio either).

:<math>D_i = \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S C_{Di} = \frac{1}{2} \rho_0 V_e^2 S C_{Di}</math>
where
:<math>C_{Di} = \frac{C_L^2}{ \pi e AR} </math>   and

:<math>C_L = \frac{L}{ \frac{1}{2} \rho_0 V_e^2 S} </math>

Thus
:<math>C_{Di} = \frac{L^2}{\frac{1}{4} \rho_0^2 V_e^4 S^2 \pi e AR} </math>

Hence
:<math>D_i = \frac{L^2}{\frac{1}{2} \rho_0 V_e^2 S \pi e AR} </math>

where:
:<math>AR \, </math> is the [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]],
:<math>C_{Di} \, </math> is the induced [[drag coefficient]] (see [[Lifting-line theory]]),
:<math>C_L \, </math> is the [[lift coefficient]],

:<math>\rho_0 \, </math> is 1.225 kg/m&sup3;, the air density at sea level, [[International Standard Atmosphere|ISA]] conditions.

==Combined effect with other drag sources==
Induced drag must be added to the [[parasitic drag]] to find the total drag. Since induced drag is inversely proportional to the square of the airspeed (at a given lift) whereas parasitic drag is proportional to the square of the airspeed, the combined overall drag curve shows a minimum at some airspeed - the minimum drag speed (V<sub>MD</sub>). An aircraft flying at this speed is at its optimal aerodynamic efficiency.  According to the above equations, the minimum drag speed occurs at the speed where the induced drag is equal to the parasitic drag. This is the speed at which the best gradient of climb{{clarify|date=December 2013}}, or for unpowered aircraft, minimum gradient of descent, is achieved.<ref name=Clancy5.25>Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.25</ref> This is also the speed for greatest range (although V<sub>MD</sub> will decrease as the plane consumes fuel and becomes lighter).
The speed for greatest range (i.e., distance travelled) is the speed at which a straight line from the origin is tangent to the fuel flow rate curve. The curve of range versus airspeed is normally very flat and it is customary to operate at the speed for 99% best range since this gives about 5% greater speed for only 1% less range. (Of course, flying higher where the air is thinner will raise the speed of minimum drag, and so permits a faster voyage for the same amount of fuel. If the plane is flying at the maximum permissible speed, then there is an altitude at which the air density will be what is needed to keep it aloft while flying at the angle of attack that minimizes the drag. The optimum altitude at maximum speed, and the optimum speed at maximum altitude, may change during the flight as the plane becomes lighter.)

The speed for best endurance (i.e., time in the air) is the speed for minimum fuel flow rate, and is less than the speed for greatest range. The fuel flow rate is calculated as the product of the power required and the engine specific fuel consumption (fuel flow rate per unit of power<ref>The engine specific fuel consumption is normally expressed in units of fuel flow rate per unit of thrust or per unit of power depending on whether the engine output is measured in thrust, as for a jet engine, or power, as for a turbo-prop engine. To convert fuel rate per unit thrust to fuel rate per unit power one must divide by the speed.</ref>). The power required is equal to the drag times the speed.

==Minimum induced drag for generic non-planar systems==
The problem is translated in finding the optimal circulation distribution which minimizes the induced drag for a given wingspan and total lift. The concepts of Optimal Aerodynamic Efficiency Ratio, Augmented Munk's Minimum Induced Drag Theorem, Minimum Induced Drag Curvature-Invariance Theorem, and Quasi-Closed C-Wing Zero  Gradient  Optimal Circulation  Theorem are now discussed.

===Optimal aerodynamic efficiency ratio===
The ''optimal aerodynamic efficiency ratio'' for a given wing represents the ratio between its aerodynamic efficiency and the corresponding efficiency of a reference classical cantilevered wing with the same wing span and total lift. Both efficiencies are evaluated under their respective optimal conditions.<ref>Demasi Luciano, Dipace Antonio, Monegato Giovanni, Cavallaro Rauno, ''An Invariant Formulation for the Minimum Induced Drag Conditions of Non-planar Wing Systems'', AIAA Journal, in press (2014); sections VII and VIII</ref>

The optimal aerodynamic efficiency ratio should not be confused with the wing span efficiency value ''e''.

[[File:OPTIMAL AERODYNAMIC EFFICIENCY RATIO.jpg|thumb|500px|alt=Optimal Aerodynamic Efficiency Ratio|Optimal Aerodynamic Efficiency Ratio]]

===Augmented Munk's minimum induced drag theorem===
When the lifting system has been translated into a single plane (Munk's stagger theorem), the induced drag will be minimum when the component of the induced velocity normal to the lifting element at each point is proportional to the cosine of the angle of inclination of the lifting element at that point.<ref>M. Munk, ''The Minimum Induced Drag in Airfoils'', NACA Report 121, 1921</ref> The constant of proportionality is the ratio between the freestream velocity and the optimal aerodynamic efficiency.<ref>Demasi Luciano, Dipace Antonio, Monegato Giovanni, Cavallaro Rauno ''An Invariant Formulation for the Minimum Induced Drag Conditions of Non-planar Wing Systems'', AIAA Journal, in press (2014); Section V</ref>

[[File:MUNK REVISITED.jpg|thumb|500px|alt=Augmented Munk's Minimum Induced Drag Theorem|Augmented Munk's Minimum Induced Drag Theorem]]

===Minimum induced drag curvature-invariance theorem===
Changing the sign of the curvature of the lifting line (i.e., the arc from convex is changed to concave or viceversa) does not modify the optimal induced drag and circulation distribution: the optimal solution is then invariant if the sign of the curvature is modified.<ref>Demasi Luciano, Dipace Antonio, Monegato Giovanni, Cavallaro Rauno, ''An Invariant Formulation for the Minimum Induced Drag Conditions of Non-planar Wing Systems'', AIAA Journal, in press (2014); Section IX</ref>

[[File:Minimum Induced Drag Curvature-Invariance Theorem.jpg|thumb|500px|alt=Minimum Induced Drag Curvature-Invariance Theorem|Minimum Induced Drag Curvature-Invariance Theorem]]

===Quasi-closed C-wing zero gradient optimal circulation theorem===
If the two tips of a C wing are brought indefinitely close to each other, then both the optimal circulation and its first derivative tend to zero at those points.<ref>Demasi Luciano, Dipace Antonio, Monegato Giovanni, Cavallaro Rauno, ''An Invariant Formulation for the Minimum Induced Drag Conditions of Non-planar Wing Systems'', AIAA Journal, in press (2014); Section X</ref>

[[File:ZERO GRADIENT THEOREM.jpg|thumb|500px|alt=Quasi-Closed C-Wing Zero  Gradient  Optimal Circulation  Theorem|Quasi-Closed C-Wing Zero  Gradient  Optimal Circulation  Theorem]]

===Optimal induced drag: minimization procedure and results===
The optimal conditions are found by solving an integral equation (see figure). Several non-planar wings are presented.

'''Rodrigues day gecko''' ('''''Phelsuma edwardnewtoni''''') is a now [[extinct]] [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] [[species]] of [[gecko]]s. It lived on the island of [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]] and typically inhabited [[forest]]s and dwelt in [[tree]]s. The Rodrigues day gecko fed on [[insect]]s and [[nectar]].

== Description ==
[[File:Rodrigues day gecko.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1885 illustration]] 
This day gecko is now extinct. It was described also as ''P. newtonii'', yet this name was also used as a synonym for ''[[Phelsuma gigas]]''. ''P. edwardnewtoni'' belonged to the largest day geckos. It reached a total length of about 23&nbsp;cm. Earlier investigators describe the animal as being quite common. However, this species has not been sighted since 1917, in spite of thorough searches in the 1960s and 1970s on Rodrigues and all offshore islets. Today, only 5 preserved specimens remain, three of which are in The [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in [[London]], the two others being in the [[Muséum national d'histoire naturelle|Paris Natural History Museum]]. These specimens have been preserved in alcohol and show a thick-bodied, robust Phelsuma. The body colour has been described as bright green with bright blue spots on the back. The underside of the tail was whitish yellow. The chin had a deep yellow colour.

== Behaviour and ecology==

This species inhabited Rodrigues Island and its surrounding islets. ''P. edwardnewtoni'' has been observed on coconut trees and other palms. Their habitat has been largely destroyed by humans and introduced animals such as cats and rats, which may have been the main cause of their extinction.

These day geckos fed on various insects and other [[invertebrate]]s. They also liked to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

''P. edwardnewtoni'' was documented as being unafraid of [[human]]s. It was quite tame and would even eat [[fruit]] from one's hand. Leguat described the behaviour as follows:
{{Quotation|The Palmtrees and Plantanes are always loaden with Lizards about a foot long, the Beauty of which is very Extraordinairy; some of them are blue, some black, some green, some red, some grey, and the colour of each the most lively and bright of any of its kind. Their common Food is the Fruit of the Palm-Trees. They are not mischievous, and so Tame, that they often come and eat the Melons on our Tables, and in our Presence, and even in our Hands; they serve for Prey to some Birds, specially the Bitterns. When we beat 'em down from the Trees with a Pole, these Birds wou'd come and devour them before us, tho' we did our utmost to hinder them; and when we offered to oppose them, they came on still after their Prey, and still followed us when we endeavoured to defend them.<ref name="Lost Land">{{cite book | last1 = Cheke | first1 = A.

'''''Under Ash''''' (Arabic name: "''Taht-al-ramad''", '''??? ??????''') is a [[first-person shooter]] sometimes explained to be a response to how [[Arab]]s are pictured in [[video game]]s in general and ''[[America's Army]]'' in particular. Like ''America's Army'', it is considered to be video game [[propaganda]]; however, it differs from ''America's Army'' in that it is not available free.

The player takes the role of Ahmed, a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] opposed to [[Israel]]i occupation ([[Zionism|"Zionists"]]). Through the course of the game, Ahmed progresses from throwing rocks at Israeli soldiers to destroying Israeli military positions. The game has been criticized for being too hard, and is designed so that it's easy to be killed.<ref name=BBC>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2019677.stm BBC: Syria launches Arab war game]</ref> If you shoot a civilian, the game ends automatically. In the end it isn't even possible to achieve a victory.<ref name=BBC/>

The game was published by [[Dar al-Fikr]], a [[Syria]]n publishing company, and the first pressing of ten thousand copies sold out in a week. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Its relevance to the fighting in the [[Middle East]] makes it a [[controversial video game]]. The developers say it was made with a similar motive to  ''[[Delta Force (video game)|Delta Force]]'' and ''[[America's Army]]''.

''Under Ash'' was followed up with ''[[Under Siege (2005 video game)|Under Siege]]''.

'''Genesis3D''' was a project by Eclipse Entertainment to create a real-time [[3D engine]] for [[Microsoft Windows]].  It was released as [[source code]] in 1998. The first released version supported hardware acceleration and a software renderer. Genesis3D had RGB lightmaps, fogging, [[binary space partitioning]] (the same visibility algorithm used in ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' and ''[[Quake II]]''), a sprite system, alpha masking and blending, and a map and model editor.

Genesis3D allows the game creators to animate 3D models using now-standard "skeletal animation", allowing for complex smoothed movement (instead of interpolated vertex keyframes used in the Quake games).

An early game using the Genesis3D Engine was ''G-Sector'' by Freeform Interactive and was released as a free game/technology demo in December 1998.

The free editor "[[Reality Factory]]" uses the Genesis 3D engine.

'''Tezpur''' (Pron: tez?p??) ({{lang-as|??????}}) is a city and the administrative headquarters and [[municipal board]] of [[Sonitpur]] district in the [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Assam]] in northeastern [[India]]. Tezpur is an ancient city on the banks of the river [[Brahmaputra]] and is the largest of the north bank towns with a population exceeding 100,000 . It is situated {{convert|175|km|mi|0}} north east of [[Guwahati]], considered to be the "Cultural Capital of Assam".

== Geography ==
The town is situated beside the [[Brahmaputra River]].

The rivers in and around Tezpur are fast flowing, especially from the Himalayas foothills.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} {{clarify|use data to describe what "fast" is|date=August 2014}} Tezpur has a number of small hillocks, so that flooding doesn't occur during the monsoons.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}{{clarify|reason=seems that would cause flooding, not alleviate it!|date=August 2014}}

===Climate===
Tezpur has mild winters and hot summers.{{clarify|use data not adjectives|date=August 2014}} The [[humidity]] is high during the summer.{{clarify|reason=what is high, exactly?|date=August 2014}} Rainfall is high.{{clarify|reason=what is High? use data, not adjectives|date=August 2014}}

==Government==

==Etymology==
The name Tezpur is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] words 'Teza' (meaning blood) and 'Pura' (meaning town or city). [[Legend]] has it that the original name of this place was 'Sonitpur' ("sonit" in [[Sanskrit]] also means blood!) but when the battle between [[Krishna]]'s army and [[Banasura]]'s army fought for the rescue of [[Aniruddha]] (who was the grandson of [[Lord Krishna]], according to legend) there was so much bloodshed that the whole place was stained in red. This led to the name of the place becoming Tezpur.

== History ==
Historical ruins from the 8th and 9th centuries dot the surrounding areas of the city. The ruins of [[Bamuni Hills]] are the most famous. They bear resemblance to the [[Gupta period]] art. Accordingly there are plenty of myths as well. The ruins of [[Da Parbatia]] are an example of the architecture around the 4th Century AD. 
[[File:Kanaklata Udyan, Tezpur.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A bas-relief displaying a historical incident at [[Kankalata Udyan]], Tezpur]]

Modern Tezpur was founded by the [[British India|British colonial administration]] in 1835 as the headquarters of Darrang district. During [[World War II]], Tezpur received large numbers of refugees fleeing from [[Burma]], particularly the corps of [[Anglo-Burmese]] and [[Anglo-Indian]] nurses. After independence of India in 1947, it remained the headquarters of Darrang district.  During the [[Sino-Indian War]] of 1962 the Chinese army advanced to the [[Tawang]] city, [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. The town was evacuated. The jails were opened and the prisoners released.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 1983 a part of the district was carved out to form a separate district, Darrang. Tezpur was made the headquarters of the new district of Sonitpur.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Tezpur Balipara Light Railway: The existing MG ({{convert|1000|mm}}) rail line is the oldest on the North Bank, descending from the Tezpur Balipara Light Railway built in 1885 to carry tea from upcountry estates to the then riverport of Tezpur.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Rock inscriptions: In 1897, Sir [[Edward Albert Gait]] discovered a copper inscription in Tezpur the deciphering of which provided information regarding the Ahom rulers.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} He referenced the nine line inscription of Harjjar Varma in his ‘’A History of Assam’’.  The inscription, dating to 829 A.D., is the first historical record of Assam.  The inscription was found engraved on a massive stone some {{convert|2|km}} away from Tezpur town situated near Rudrapad Temple.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Hazara Pukhuri: A king of the dynasty Harjjar Varma excavated a large pond in {{convert|70|acre|m2}} of land, later came to be known as Hajara Pukhuri (Harjjara Pukhuri).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Christian cemetery: The cemetery dates to the 17th century. It contains the graveyard of [[Alexander Bruce (merchant)|Alexander Bruce]], founder of the Tea Industry in India and also of various Europeans who died here before independence.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Power station: The Electric first power station in this part of India was established at Tezpur by the Britishers at 1913.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Tezpur is considered to be the cultural capital of Assamese culture.  Being from the core [[Culture of Assam|Assamese]] cultural region, several notables including Dr. [[Bhupen Hazarika]], [[Jyoti Prasad Agarwala]] (1903–51), [[Bishnuprasad Rabha|Kalaguru Bishnu Prasad Rabha]] (1909–69), and [[Phani Sarma]] (1909–70), were from Tezpur.

==Economy==
The economy of Tezpur is dependent on its Tea Gardens. There are many 
tea gardens surrounding the town of Tezpur. The surrounding tea gardens 
and agriculture contribute to the local economy. Presently Tezpur is a 
commercial, administrative and educational centre. It also houses a 
major base of the [[Indian Army]] and Airforce (Salonibari).  The 
population is largely heterogeneous.  [[Assamese people|Assamese]], 
[[Bengali people|Bengali]], [[Nepali Indian|Nepali]], [[Bihari people|Bihari]], [[Marwaris|Marwari]] communities form the majority.  
People from various tribes such as the [[tea-tribes]] (brought in by the colonial [[planters]] as indentured labourers from the [[Chhotanagpur plateau]] region), [[Bodos]], [[Mishing People|Mishings]] etc. have also made it their home.  Like other places in Assam, the issue of illegal migration from Bangladesh adds religious spice to the regular political 
debates and name-calling.{{original research?|date=December 2012}}  
Passing through Tezpur, at Dadhara the Jyoti-Bishnu khelpathar is an 
important attraction. The fields are used for various cultural 
events.

'''Sweden Democrat Youth''' ('''Sverigedemokratisk Ungdom''', '''SDU''') is the youth league of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] political party [[Sweden Democrats]] (''Sverigedemokraterna'').

The youth league was initially founded in 1993 as an independent youth league to its parent party. The original name was ''Sverigedemokraternas Ungdomsförbund'', but the organization was fairly quickly renamed to ''Sverigedemokratisk Ungdom''. The youth league was for a time abandoned by the parent party, but was again formed as an independent organization in 1998.

== Chairmen of the SDU ==

UXF is a XML-based model interchange format for UML, which is a standard software modeling language. UXF is a structured format described in 1998 and intended to encode, publish, access and exchange UML models.<ref>{{cite journal|id = {{citeseerx|10.1.1.19.474}}|title=Making UML Models Interoperable with UXF|year=1999|last1=Suzuki  |first1=Junichi|last2=Yamamoto|first2=Yoshikazu|journal=Selected papers from the First International Workshop on The Unified Modeling Language - UML '98: Beyond the Notation|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]]|accessdate=2011-11-23 }}</ref>

A '''glitch''' is a short-lived [[fault (technology)|fault]] in a system. It is often used to describe a transient fault that corrects itself, and is therefore difficult to troubleshoot.   The term is particularly common in the [[computing]] and [[electronics]] industries, and in [[circuit bending]], as well as among players of [[video game]]s, although it is applied to all types of systems including human [[organization]]s and nature.

[[Glitch#Etymology|The term derives from]] the German ''glitschig'', means 'slippery', possibly entering [[English language|English]] through the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] term ''glitsh''.<ref name="dictionary">{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/glitch?s=t|title=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2012-10-15}}</ref><ref name="etymonline">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=glitch&searchmode=term|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-10-15}}</ref>

==Electronics glitch==
An '''[[electronics]] glitch''' is an undesired transition that occurs before the signal settles to its intended value. In other words, glitch is an electrical pulse of short duration that is usually the result of a fault or design error, particularly in a [[digital circuit]].  For example, many electronic components, such as [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s, are triggered by a pulse that must not be shorter than a specified minimum duration; otherwise, the component may malfunction.  A pulse shorter than the specified minimum is called a glitch. A related concept is the [[runt pulse]], a pulse whose amplitude is smaller than the minimum level specified for correct operation, and a [[Voltage spike|spike]], a short pulse similar to a glitch but often caused by [[Ringing (signal)|ringing]] or [[crosstalk]]. A ''glitch'' can occur in the presence of [[race condition]] in a poorly designed [[Digital data|digital]] logic circuit.

==Computer glitch==
A '''computer glitch''' is the failure of a system, usually containing a computing device, to complete its functions or to perform them properly.

In public declarations, glitch is used to suggest a minor fault which will soon be rectified and is therefore used as a [[euphemism]] for a [[software bug|bug]], which is a factual statement that a programming fault is to blame for a system failure.

It frequently refers to an error which is not detected at the time it occurs but shows up later in data errors or incorrect human decisions.  While the fault is usually attributed to the [[computer hardware]], this is often not the case since hardware failures rarely go undetected.  Situations which are frequently called computer glitches are:
* Incorrectly written software ([[software bug]])
* Incorrect instructions given by the operator ([[ID-Ten-T Error|operator error]]) (failure to account for this possibility might also be considered a software bug)
* Undetected invalid input data (this might also be considered a software bug)
* Undetected communications errors
* [[Computer virus]]
* Computer [[Exploit (computer security)|exploiting]] (sometimes called "hacking")

Such glitches could produce problems such as:
* Keyboard malfunction
* Number key failure
* Screen abnormalities (turned left, right or upside down)
* Random program malfunctions
* Abnormal program registering

Examples of computer glitches causing disruption include an unexpected shutdown of a [[water filtration]] plant in New Canaan, 2010;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watertechonline.com/news.asp?N_ID=75429|title=Water filtration plant temporarily shut down due to computer glitch|date=December 6, 2010|accessdate=2010-12-11|work=watertechonline.com}}</ref> failures in the [[Computer Aided Dispatch]] system used by the police in Austin, resulting in unresponded 911 calls;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kxan.com/dpp/news/investigations/911-computer-glitch-led-to-police-delay|title=911 computer glitch led to police delay|work=Austin News kxan.com|date=15 November 2010|accessdate=2010-12-11}}</ref> and an unexpected [[Bitwise operation#NOT|bit flip]] causing the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] spacecraft to enter "safe mode" in November 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40364176/ns/technology_and_science-space/|title=NASA revives Saturn probe, three weeks after glitch |work=msnbc.com|date=2010-11-24|accessdate=2010-12-11}}</ref>

==Video game glitches==
{{See also|Software bug}}

Glitches/bugs are software errors that can cause drastic problems within the code, and typically go unnoticed or unsolved during the production of said software. These errors can be game caused or otherwise exploited until a developer/development team repairs them. Complex software is rarely bug-free or otherwise free from errors upon first release.

Texture/model glitches are a kind of bug or other error that causes any specific model or texture to either become distorted or otherwise to not look as intended by the developers.	Bethesda's ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' is notorious for texture glitches, among many other errors which affect most of their popular titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://games.slashdot.org/story/10/11/09/068231/bethesda-criticized-over-buggy-releases|title=Bethesda Criticised over buggy releases}}</ref> Many games that uses [[Ragdoll physics|rag-doll physics]] in their character models in the modern era can have this happen to them. Another game that is known for its physical glitches is the ''[[Rocky (2002 video game)|Rocky]]'' boxing game for the PS2 where the bodies of the boxers are sometimes known to be morphed and distorted beyond recognition.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdWRTleizFU|title=Game Glitches - Angry Video Game Nerd (YouTube video summarizing some well known video game glitches, including Rocky)}}</ref>

Physics glitches are errors in a game's physics engine that causes a specific entity, be it a physics object or an NPC (Non-Player Character), to be unintentionally moved to some degree. These kinds of errors can be exploited, unlike many. The chance of a physics error happening can either be entirely random or accidentally caused. Once again, Bethesda's ''Skyrim'' and ''Fallout'' games are notorious for this glitch, as it can happen without warning and possibly result in the player being unable to start or complete certain quests due to the quest giver disappearing.<ref>{{ cite web|url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Glitches|title=Page containing all known Skyrim glitches}}</ref>

Sound glitches are in which there is an error with the game's sound. These can range from sounds playing when not intended to play or even not playing at all. Occasionally, a certain sound will loop or otherwise the player will be given the option to continuously play the sound when not intended. Often, games will play sounds ''incorrectly'' due to corrupt data altering the values predefined in the code. Examples include, but are not limited to, extremely high or low pitched sounds, volume being mute or too high to understand, and also rarely even playing in reverse order/playing reversed.

The following are some examples of well-known{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} glitches:
* In ''[[Kerbal Space Program]]'' When a Kerbal falls into Jool, The kerbal will start to glitch out, and the game cuts into black and displays random numbers, this is known as the Hell Kraken
* In ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' an infamous swing set in a park would launch the player's vehicle and do extreme damage to it. This damage can glitch the car model into having no rear end or a caved in beyond the point of even moving.
* In ''[[Pokémon Red and Blue]]'' getting to fight with [[MissingNo.]] is a glitch that also causes other graphical and inventory glitches.
* In the 2007 [[first-person shooter]] ''[[Bioshock]]'' a glitch could occur during the looting of Langford's safe. The safe will open, but its contents—required to proceed—will be missing, effectively bringing the player to a halt.
* In ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron]]'' multiplayer, a player can replace one class for another. An example could be a scout embodied in the form of a leader or truck.
* Prior to being patched, areas in ''[[Minecraft]]'' 12,550,820 blocks away from spawn (popularly known as the Far Lands) were corrupted, alien places, due to a bug in the world generation.  One side effect of visiting this world is an extreme slowdown in game speed.<ref>http://www.unwinnable.com/2013/10/01/far-lands/#.VFeJAjJ-eB8</ref>
* In the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.|Super Mario Bros]]'', there is a well-known glitch where it is possible to access "World -1", commonly referred to as "Minus World". The level was not intentionally programmed into the game; it only exists as a result of an error in the game's programming. The world is actually 'World 36-1' but id '36' is used for blank tiles, ending up the world counter saying ' -1'.
* In ''LittleBigPlanet'', some or all levels on a user's 'Craft Earth' may either be invisible, or just have the white dotted circle. Dotted levels are still playable, but not the invisible ones.
* In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', you can do a few adjustments to "wrong warp" to the very end of the game. This significantly helps to let the game be beat in under 20 minutes.
Glitches may include incorrectly displayed graphics, collision detection errors, game freezes/crashes, sound errors, and other issues. Graphical glitches are especially notorious in platforming games, where malformed textures can directly affect gameplay (for example, by displaying a ground texture where the code calls for an area that should damage the character, or by ''not'' displaying a wall texture where there should be one, resulting in an [[invisible wall]].). Some glitches are potentially dangerous to the game's stored data.<ref name="mirror">{{cite web |url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/2008/030608/games1.html |title=Testing, testing, testing |accessdate=2008-06-17 |last=Ofoe |first=Emmanuel-Yvan |author2=William Pare |date= March 06 - March 12.2008 |publisher=Montreal Mirror}}</ref> In ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', during [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]'s final hallucination, the game purposely suffers a glitch before his nightmare begins.

"[[Glitching]]" is the practice of a player exploiting faults in a video game's programming to achieve tasks that give him an unfair advantage in the game, over NPC's or other players, such as running through walls or defying the game's physics.. Glitches can be deliberately induced in certain home video game consoles by manipulating the game medium, such as tilting a [[ROM cartridge]] to disconnect one or more connections along the [[edge connector]] and interrupt part of the flow of data between the cartridge and the console.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5933722/its-not-a-glitch-its-a-feature-its-art-its-beautiful|title=It’s Not A Glitch. It’s A Feature. It’s Art. It’s Beautiful.}}</ref> This can result in graphic, music, or gameplay errors.  Doing this, however, carries the risk of crashing the game or even causing permanent damage to the game medium.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf6BNtCYJwE|title=Killing a Sega Genesis Cartridge (YouTube Video of a cartridge becoming permanently broken during the process of cartridge tilting)}}</ref>

Heavy use of Glitches are used in performing a [[speedrun]] of a video game.

Part of the [[quality assurance]] process (as performed by [[game tester]]s for [[video game]]s) is locating and reproducing glitches, and then compiling reports on the glitches to be fed back to the programmers so that they can repair the bugs. Certain games have a cloud-type system for updates to the software that usually repairs coding faults and other errors in the games.<ref name="mirror"/>

==TV glitch==

In broadcasting, a corrupted signal may glitch in the form of jagged lines on the screen, misplaced squares, static looking effects, freezing problems, or inverted colors. The glitches may affect the video and/or audio (usually audio dropout) or the transmission. These glitches may be caused by a variety of issues, interference from portable electronics or microwaves, damaged cables at the broadcasting center, or weather.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.highdefforum.com/local-hdtv-info-reception/98525-signal-strength-variables.html | title = Signal Strength Variables | accessdate = 2012-05-17 }}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary}}
''Canadian Oxford'' lists it as a 20th-century word of unknown origin.
Some reference books, including ''Random House's American Slang'', claim it comes from the German word ''glitschen'' ("to slip") and the Yiddish word ''gletshn'' ("to slide or skid"). Either way it is a relatively new term. So new, in fact, that on July 23, 1965, ''Time Magazine'' felt it necessary to define it in an article: "Glitches—a spaceman's word for irritating disturbances." In relation to the reference by Time Magazine, the term has been believed to enter common usage during the American Space Race of the 1950s, where it was used to describe minor faults in the rocket hardware that were difficult to pinpoint.<ref name="dictionary" /><ref name="etymonline" />

The '''Blond Ambition World Tour''' was the third [[concert tour]] by American singer-songwriter [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. The tour was launched in support of her fourth [[studio album]], ''[[Like a Prayer (album)|Like a Prayer]]'', and the soundtrack, ''[[I'm Breathless]]''. The tour reached North America, Europe and Asia. It was a highly controversial tour, mainly for its juxtaposition of Catholic iconography and sexuality. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called it an "elaborately choreographed, sexually provocative extravaganza" and proclaimed it "the best tour of 1990."<ref name="Walters">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10463868/crucifixes_leather_and_hits|title=Crucifixes, Leather and Hits|date=2006-06-01|accessdate=2008-07-13|last=Walters|first=Barry|work= Rolling Stone}}</ref> In 1991, a documentary film, ''[[Truth or Dare (documentary)|Truth or Dare]]'' (''In Bed with Madonna'' outside North America), was released chronicling the tour.

The concert was filmed several times, including dates in the United States, France, Japan and Spain. An [[Home Box Office|HBO]] TV special, titled ''Madonna - Live! Blond Ambition World Tour 90'', was filmed in Nice, France and was later released commercially as ''[[Blond Ambition World Tour Live]]'' by [[Pioneer Electronics|Pioneer Artists]], exclusively on the [[Laserdisc]] format. The title went on to win a [[Grammy Award]] in 1992 for [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video|Best Long Form Music Video]]. Another title, ''Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90'', was released exclusively in Japan by [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner-Pioneer]].

==Background==
[[File:ExpressYourselfUnderGround cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Madonna performing "[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]" as the opening number from the tour]]
Originally to be called the "Like a Prayer World Tour",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madonnashop.com/like-a-prayer-pepsi-can-p-579.html|title=Madonna - Like A Prayer Pepsi can [PepsiCan] - [Germany]|accessdate=2008-12-27|work=Madonna Shop}}</ref> [[Sire Records]] announced the Blond Ambition World Tour in November 1989, following the success of Madonna's fourth studio album, ''Like a Prayer'', and Madonna's performance of "[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]" at the [[1989 MTV Video Music Awards]] - considered as a tour preview. Initially, the tour was only to reach Japan and North America, as Madonna was considering roles in several films.
By the end of 1989 plans were announced to bring the tour to Europe as well because of popularity and fan demand. In December 1989, when preparations for the tour began, Madonna herself announced during a pre-recorded interview on German TV channel ZDF, that she would tour Germany during 1990.<ref name="Madonna announces Blond Ambition Tour">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Azwf2QRG9A Madonna announces German Tour]</ref> In April 1990, additional dates in Europe were added.<ref>{{Cite news| last =Kolson| first =Ann| publication-date =1990-06-14| title =Putting "Blond Ambition Tour" on its feet| periodical =Philadelphia Inquirer| publication-place =[[Philadelphia, PA|Philadelphia]]| publisher =Philadelphia Media Holdings LLC| page =C1| accessdate =2008-10-11| postscript =.}}</ref>
Stage preparations and dress rehearsals took place at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Disney Studios]], [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], [[California]], before the tour kicked off in Japan.

The tour incorporated as central themes, sexuality and [[Catholicism]], a combination which engendered controversy. The catholic associations called for a boycott of the show in [[Rome]], and one of three scheduled Italian dates was eventually canceled. The show has achieved a measure of cult status, with elements such as the [[bullet bra]] and false ponytail hairpiece becoming cultural icons in their own right.

Madonna herself called the concert "like musical theater" and choreographer [[Vincent Paterson]] stated she wanted to "break every rule we can... She wanted to make statements about sexuality, cross-sexuality, the church... But the biggest thing we tried to do was change the shape of concerts. Instead of just presenting songs, we wanted to combine fashion, Broadway, and performance art."

The show's explicit overtone caused problems. In [[Toronto]], police were alerted that the show might possibly contain lewd and obscene content (particularly a masturbation scene) and threatened charges unless parts of the show were changed. The show went on unaltered, however, and no charges were made after the tour manager gave the police an ultimatum: "Cancel the show, and you'll have to tell 30,000 people why."<ref>"Random Notes" by Sheila Rogers, Rolling Stone magazine, 12–26 July 1990, page 13</ref>

[[France|French]] fashion designer [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]] designed the costumes for the tour, including the now-infamous cone brassiere. Additional costume pieces were designed by Marlene Stewart, who had previously worked with Madonna on the 1987 [[Who's That Girl World Tour]].

Director [[Alek Keshishian]] captured more than 250 hours of film of Madonna and her troupe during the tour. This footage was edited and released to movie theaters as ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare|Truth or Dare (aka In Bed with Madonna)]]''.

Due to ongoing throat problems, six shows had to be canceled, bringing the tour down from 63 shows to 57; altogether, 125,000 tickets had to be refunded. The proceeds of the last American date in [[New Jersey]], was donated to the [[Nonprofit organization]] [[amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research|amfAR]] and dedicated to her friend ''Keith Haring'' who died of [[AIDS]], grossing over $300,000.<ref>http://books.google.it/books?id=mqqFX9lU98IC&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=madonna+landover+1990&source=bl&ots=f2raSAeEzK&sig=rsyZRD8y8-zPtQelVRER2415640&hl=it&sa=X&ei=CyVDUaWlL8SM7QbPj4GADA&ved=0CIIBEOgBMAg4KA#v=onepage&q=madonna%20landover%201990&f=false

==Concert synopsis==
[[File:MaterialGirlUnderGround cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Madonna and her back up dancers, performing "[[Material Girl]]" as part of the ''Art Deco'' segment of the tour]]
The show was separated into five different sections: ''Metropolis'', ''Religious'', ''Dick Tracy'', ''Art Deco'' and ''Encore''. It began with the ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' segment, which was inspired by the [[Fritz Lang]] [[silent film]]. It begins with "[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]", which includes an introduction from her 1982 song "[[Everybody (Madonna song)|Everybody]]". The stage was inspired by the "Express Yourself" music video and set in a large industrial machine-room with shirtless male dancers. Madonna enters the stage at the top of a long staircase, dressed in a pinstripe suit, with cone-bra and garters from her [[bustier]] visible. In this segment, Madonna also performs "[[Open Your Heart (Madonna song)|Open Your Heart]]" and has a mock-fight with her back-up dancers in "[[Causing a Commotion]]" (dressed in colorful bicycling gear). The final performance on this segment is "[[Where's the Party (song)|Where's the Party]]"; Madonna leaves the stage early for a costume change, while three male dancers continue dancing until the song ends.

The second segment was passionate and religious-themed, beginning with a [[Middle-Eastern]] version of "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]" sung on a red silk bed. Madonna is dressed in a gold corset and performs with two [[hermaphrodite]] dancers on each side of the bed and concludes the song by simulating [[masturbation]]. The set is then transformed into a church; Madonna wears a black robe and a large [[crucifix]] during "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]", with her back-up singers and dancers dressed as nuns and priests. A medley of "[[Live to Tell]]" and "[[Oh Father]]" and a performance of "[[Papa Don't Preach]]" end this section.

The third segment was a [[cabaret]] inspired by the 1990 motion picture ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'', in which Madonna starred as "Breathless Mahoney". During this segment, Madonna was wearing a green and white striped showgirl outfit. It included performances of "[[Sooner or Later (Madonna song)|Sooner or Later]]", sung atop a grand piano, "[[Hanky Panky (Madonna song)|Hanky Panky]]" and "Now I'm Following You", in which she danced and lip-synched with the dancer Salim Gauwloos, who was dressed like Dick Tracy.

The fourth segment was inspired by 1930s [[Hollywood]] films using the work of artist [[Tamara de Lempicka]] and an [[Art Deco]] set design. Madonna performs "[[Material Girl]]" in a mocking [[dumb blonde]] voice, wearing hair rollers and bathrobe, (later removed to reveal a dress with pink fur). "[[Cherish (Madonna song)|Cherish]]" is performed with three male dancers dressed as [[Merman|mer-men]] whilst Madonna simulates playing the [[harp]]. Madonna ends the section with "[[Into The Groove]]" (with a sample from the 1989 [[Inner City (band)|Inner City]] song "Ain't Nobody Better") and a minimal version of "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]" performing choreography from its music video, dressed in a black sports bra and lycra shorts.

The fifth and final segment includes the two encores to the show; "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]", with Madonna in 1970s polka-dots and ruffles singing a sample from "Do the Bus Stop" and "[[Keep It Together (Madonna song)|Keep It Together]]" inspired by the work of [[Bob Fosse]] with Madonna dressed in bowler hat and performing chair-juggling. The "Keep It Together" routine was also inspired by the film ''A Clockwork Orange'' and found Madonna speaking with a cockney accent. The show finale has Madonna singing "Keep it together, Keep people together, forever and ever" over and over, finishing with her removing her hat and the spotlight zooming on to it.

The Japan and North American shows featured Madonna in her trademark blonde ponytail [[hair extensions]]. However, because the hairpiece kept getting caught in her headset [[microphone]] and was pulling her real hair out by the root, she switched to short blonde curls for the European leg of the tour.

After the tour, Madonna and her entire Blond Ambition tour stage troupe recreated a neoclassic-themed performance of [[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]] at the [[1990 MTV Video Music Awards]].

The official tourbook and promotional posters for the tour used photography from the 1989 music video "[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]" and [[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]].

Two shows were released commercially; the August 5 show in [[Nice, France]], was taped and aired on [[HBO]] in the United States becoming the most-watched entertainment special in HBO's 18-year history, the program had a 21.5 rating, reaching an audience of more than 4.3 million households.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-08/news/vw-418_1_madonna-telecast-record | work=Los Angeles Times | title=NAMES IN THE NEWS : Madonna Sets Telecast Record | date=August 8, 1990}}</ref> Time Warner's HBO, paid $1 million for the rights to broadcast the final concert in Nice.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/danbigman/2013/06/24/forbes-celebrity-covers-madonna-october-1990/3/ | work=Forbes | first=Dan | last=Bigman}}</ref> The show was released worldwide with the title ''[[Blond Ambition World Tour Live]]'' on [[Laserdisc]], as part of a sponsorship deal with [[Pioneer Electronics]]. One of the [[Yokohama, Japan]] dates was also taped and released on [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]] in the [[Japan]]ese market as ''Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90''. Pioneer signed an exclusive deal to release these concerts on laser disc only and thus no video or DVD has yet been released.

In addition to these shows, the August 1 show in [[Barcelona, Spain]] was taped and aired on television in Europe, Australia and Canada by SACIS-RAI. This show is known by fans for numerous technical mistakes (including Madonna forgetting part of the lyrics to "[[Sooner or Later (Madonna song)|Sooner or Later]]" and "[[Material Girl]]," getting her monocle caught on her headset microphone at the beginning of "Express Yourself", and not realizing that her headset microphone was still live as she exited the stage after "[[Where's the Party (song)|Where's the Party]]," resulting in her command at a backstage crewmember to "get the fuck out of my fuckin' way"). All three Parisian dates were taped by [[Alek Keshishian]] for ''[[Truth or Dare (documentary)|Truth or Dare]] (aka In Bed with Madonna)''.

Video of the second night of the USA leg of the tour (May 5, 1990, Houston, Texas) taken from the video screens has been widely circulated among the fan community. In addition a poor quality [[Germany]]-only DVD ''Blond Ambition Tour 1990'' is from the same Houston show, not to be confused with the first night of the USA leg of the tour (May 4, 1990, Houston, Texas) which was also partially aired live on the MTV special ''Blond Date'' during the ''Madonna Weekend''.

In the UK, BBC Radio 1 broadcast the full show, live from Wembley Stadium in London on Saturday 21 July which led to controversy over the amount of swear words Madonna uttered live on air and the BBC had to issue an apology. Highlights of the show were lated aired after the 1992 interview with Madonna and Simon Bates.

The second show in Dallas was recorded for radio broadcast in the USA with the in-between song chatter removed. 'Express Yourself' and 'Open Your Heart' are recorded from the first Dallas show, whereas the remainder of the recording is from the second Dallas show.

Radio NRG broadcast highlights from the first European show in Sweden on June 30.

==Legacy==
The Blond Ambition World Tour has been regarded as an iconic musical performance by many critics and media, such as the ''Rolling Stone'' magazine which acclaimed its elaborated choreography and sexual provocativeness, calling it the best tour of 1990<ref name="Walters"/> and later the best tour of the 1990s.<ref name="Ciccone, Christopher 2008 pp. 277"/>

Within the show, Madonna continued to influence the fashion world in her most shocking and expensive way. She popularized the idea of wearing underwear as outer wear and has since been associated with the pink satin conical bra designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier. She also wore a long blonde ponytail hairpiece for the Japanese and North American legs of the tour. The ponytail was based on a Tressy Tessy doll Madonna had played with as a child, and she decided to use it as she felt it added a feminine playfulness and contrast to the hard fashions she was wearing.  After the US leg of the tour ended, Madonna stopped wearing the ponytail on stage as it was reportedly causing her hair to break off.

A '''katabatic wind''', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''[[katabatic|katabatikos]]'' meaning "to flow downhill", is the technical name for a drainage [[wind]], a wind that carries high density air from a higher elevation down a slope under the force of gravity. Such winds are sometimes also called '''fall winds'''. Katabatic winds can rush down elevated slopes at hurricane speeds, but most are not as intense as that, and many are of the order of 10 [[Knot (unit)|knots]] (18 km/h) or less.

Not all downslope winds are katabatic.  For instance, winds such as the [[Foehn wind|foehn]], [[Chinook wind|Chinook]], or [[bergwind]], are [[rain shadow]] winds where air driven upslope on the windward side of a mountain range drops its moisture and descends leeward drier and warmer. Examples of true katabatic winds include the [[Bora (wind)|bora]] (or bura) in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], the Bohemian Wind or ''Böhmwind'' in the [[Ore Mountains]], the [[Santa Ana wind|Santa Ana]] in southern California, and the [[oroshi]] in [[Japan]]. Another example is "the Barber," an enhanced katabatic wind that blows over the town of [[Greymouth]] in [[New Zealand]] when there is a southeast flow over the South Island. It is a wind that is known in the area for its coldness.

== Theory ==
[[File:Katabatic-wind hg.png|thumb|Sketch of the generation of katabatic winds in Antarctica]]
A katabatic wind originates from radiational cooling of air atop a plateau, a mountain, glacier, or even a hill. Since the [[density]] of [[air]] is [[Inverse proportion#Inverse_proportionality|inversely proportional]] to [[temperature]], the air will flow downwards, warming [[adiabatic process|adiabatically]] as it descends.  The temperature of the wind depends on the temperature in the source region and the amount of descent.  In the case of the Santa Ana, for example, the wind can (but does not always) become hot by the time it reaches sea level.  In the case of Antarctica, by contrast, the wind is still intensely cold.

The entire near-surface wind field over Antarctica is largely determined by the katabatic winds, particularly outside the summer season, except in coastal regions when storms may impose their own windfield.

== Impacts ==
[[File:Antarctic shelf ice hg.png|thumb|Coastal [[polynya]]s are produced in the Antarctic by katabatic winds]]
<!-- [[File:Sea ice by fruchtzwerg's world.jpg|thumb|Katabatic wind spilling off an ice shelf]]-->
Katabatic winds are most commonly found blowing out from the large and elevated ice sheets of [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]].  The buildup of high density cold air over the ice sheets and the elevation of the ice sheets brings into play enormous gravitational energy. Where these winds are concentrated into restricted areas in the coastal valleys, the winds blow well over hurricane force,<ref>[http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/southpole/577 Climate: The South Pole] [http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/admin/directory.html Stanford Humanities Lab], Retrieved 2008-10-01</ref> reaching around {{convert|300|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>Trewby, M. (Ed., 2002): ''Antarctica. An encyclopedia from Abbott Ice Shelf to Zooplankton'' Firefly Books Ltd. ISBN 1-55297-590-8</ref>  In Greenland these winds are called [[piteraq]] and are most intense whenever a low pressure area approaches the coast.

In a few regions of continental Antarctica the snow is scoured away by the force of the katabatic winds, leading to "dry valleys" (or "[[Antarctic oasis]]") such as the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]]. Since the katabatic winds are descending, they tend to have a low relative humidity which desiccates the region. Other regions may have a similar but lesser effect, leading to "blue ice" areas where the snow is removed and the surface ice evaporates, but is replenished by glacier flow from upstream.

In the Fuegian Archipelago (or [[Tierra del Fuego]]) in South America as well as in Alaska, a wind known as a
[[williwaw]] is a particular danger to harboring vessels.  Williwaws originate in the snow and ice fields of the coastal mountains, and they can feature winds stronger than {{convert|120|kn|mph km/h}}. <ref>[http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/wind/The-Williwaw.htm Williwaw] ''weatheronline.co.uk''.

On 3 September 2003 a [[NASA]] press release wrote,
:"Newly discovered asteroid {{mp|2003 QQ|47}} has received considerable media attention over the last few days because it had a small chance of colliding with the Earth in the year 2014 and was rated a "1" on the [[Torino Scale|Torino Impact Hazard Scale]], which goes from 0 to 10. The odds of collision in 2014, as estimated by [[JPL]]'s Sentry impact monitoring system, peaked at 1 chance in 250,000, a result which was posted on our Impact Risk Page on Saturday, August 30, 2003. Impact events at the Torino Scale 1 level certainly merit careful monitoring by astronomers, but these events do not warrant public concern. In fact, each year several newly discovered asteroids reach Torino Scale 1 for a brief period after discovery; {{mp|2003 QQ|47}} is the fourth such case this year.
:On September 2, 2003, new measurements of {{mp|2003 QQ|47}}'s position allowed us to narrow our prediction of its path in 2014, and thus we could rule out any Earth impact possibilities for 2014."<ref name="QQ47"/>

{{mp|(143649) 2003 QQ|47}} has a diameter of approximately 1.24&nbsp;km, and a [[mass]] of approximately 2.0&times;10<sup>12</sup> kg<!--- Originally read 2.6, but a diam of 1.24 at an assumed density of 2 (asteroid average) is 2.0 --->. If it were to hit the Earth, it would be a major event, with an energy of approximately 350,000 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]] of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (1.5 [[Zetta|Z]][[joule|J]]), enough to cause global damage.

Dr. [[Sara Russell]], a [[meteorite]] researcher at [[London]]'s [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], told the [[BBC]] on 2 September 2003 that she was not worried that {{mp|(143649) 2003 QQ|47}} would be a danger.

:"The odds are very, very low... We have to keep some kind of perspective," she said.<ref name="BBC-QQ47"/>

As a result of the press coverage of asteroids such as {{mp|(143649) 2003 QQ|47}}, astronomers are now planning to re-word the Torino scale, or to phase it out completely in favour of a scale which is less likely to generate false alarms which may reduce public confidence in genuine alerts.

== In Fiction ==
The asteroid was mentioned in Anonymous Rex (Les Reptilians) (2004) as the asteroid which the dinosaurs were counting on to destroy human civilization.

The option is usually [[Option style|European]], exercisable only at one date in the future at a specific [[strike price]] defined as a coupon on the credit default swap.

Credit default options on single credits are extinguished upon default without any cashflows, other than the upfront premium paid by the buyer of the option, of course.  Therefore buying a payer option is not a good protection against an actual default, only against a rise in the credit spread.  This may explain why such options are very illiquid. They may also feature quite high implied volatilities, as shown by [[Damiano Brigo]] (2005). However options on credit indices such as [[iTraxx]] and [[Credit default swap index|CDX]] include any defaulted entities in the intrinsic value of the option when exercised. This is expressed at times by stating that the options offer "front-end protection". Proper inclusion of front end protection complicates index options valuation, see for example [[Claus M. Pedersen]] (2003), or Brigo and Morini (2008).

'''[[Ayatollah]] Seyyed Abol-Ghasem Mostafavi Kashani''' ({{lang-fa|???????? ??? ????????? ?????? ??????}}) (1882 in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]] &ndash; 14 March 1962 in Tehran, Iran) was a prominent [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Muslim]] cleric and former Chairman of the Parliament of [[Iran]].

==Early life==

His father, Ayatollah Hajj Seyyed Mostafavi Kashani ({{lang-fa|???????? ??? ??? ????? ??????}}), was a noted clergyman of Shiism in his time. Abol-Ghasem was trained in Shia Islam by his religious parents and began study of the [[Quran]] soon after learning to read and write.

At 16, Abol-Ghasem went to an Islamic [[seminary]] to study [[literature]], [[Arabic language]], [[logic]], [[semantics]] and speech, as well as the principles of Islamic jurisprudence, or [[Fiqh]]. He continued his education at the seminary in 
an-[[Najaf]] in the [[Qur'an]] and [[Hadith]]s as interpreted in Shia law, receiving his jurisprudence degree when he was 25.

==Later life ==

=== Personal life ===
His son Mostafa died in an accident in 1955; the new prime minister, [[Hossein Ala']], escaped an assassination attempt at the funeral.<ref>Abbas Milani (2008), ''[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ixU33FaG_dgC Eminent Persians: The Men and Women Who Made Modern Iran, 1941-1979, Volumes One and Two, Volume 1]'', Syracuse University Press, p348</ref> According to British intelligence, around this time two of his sons were involved in a lucrative business buying and selling import-export licenses for restricted goods.<ref>Ervand Abrahamian (1993), [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6CuEgJwEvmYC&pg=PA108 Khomeinism: Essays on the Islamic Republic], I.B.Tauris, p108</ref>

One of Kashani's children, [[Mahmoud Kashani]], went on to become head of the Iranian delegation to the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[The Hague]], Netherlands, in Iran's case with the United States and a presidential candidate in the [[Iranian presidential election, 1985|Iranian presidential elections of 1988]] and [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|2005]]. His second son is [[Ahmad Kashani]], a former member of [[Parliament of Iran|Iranian parliament]].

Kashani is also the great grandfather of Iranian-American filmmaker [[Sam Ali Kashani]].

===Political life===
Abol-Ghasem expressed [[Anti-capitalism|Anti-capitalist]] leanings from early on in his career and opposed what he saw as "[[oppression]], [[Despotism|despot]]ism and [[colonization]]." Because of these beliefs, he was especially popular with the poor in Tehran.<ref>[http://www.dangoor.com/70023.html Dabby, Elias. "The Ayatollah and Me." <u>''The Scribe'' - Journal of Babylonian Jewry.</u> Issue 70, October 1998.]</ref> He also advocated the return of Islamic government to Iran, though this was most likely for political reasons.<ref name="multiple">[http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/notes/vol2/falsafi.htm Samii, A.W. "Falsafi, Kashani and the Baha'is]</ref>

Due to [[nationalist]] positions, Ayatollah Kashani was arrested and exiled by the British and Soviets. He continued to oppose foreign, especially British, control of Iran's oil industry while in [[exile]]. After he returned from exile on 10 June 1950, he continued to protest. Angered by the fact that the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] paid Iran much less than it did the British, he organized a movement against it and was the "virtually alone among the leading mujtahids in joining" nationalist Prime Minister [[Mohammed Mosaddeq]], in his campaign to [[nationalize]] the Iranian oil industry in 1951.<ref>MacKay, Sandra, ''The Iranians'', (Plume, 1998) p.198</ref>
<ref>Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Khomeinism : essays on the Islamic Republic'', University of California Press, c1993. p.107</ref>  
Kashani served as speaker of the [[Majles of Iran|Majles]] (or lower house of Parliament), during the oil nationalization.

'''Parsing''' or '''syntactic analysis''' is the process of analysing a [[String (computer science)|string]] of symbols, either in [[natural language]] or in [[computer languages]], conforming to the rules of a [[formal grammar]].  The term ''parsing'' comes from Latin ''pars'' (''orationis''), meaning [[Part of speech|part (of speech)]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/33/P0083300.html |title=Bartleby.com homepage |accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref><ref name="dictionary.com">{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=parse&x=0&y=0 |title=parse |publisher=dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=27 November 2010}}</ref>

The term has slightly different meanings in different branches of [[linguistics]] and [[computer science]].  Traditional sentence parsing is often performed as a method of understanding the exact meaning of a sentence, sometimes with the aid of devices such as [[sentence diagram]]s.  It usually emphasizes the importance of grammatical divisions such as [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]].

Within [[computational linguistics]] the term is used to refer to the formal analysis by a computer of a sentence or other string of words into its constituents, resulting in a [[parse tree]] showing their syntactic relation to each other, which may also contain semantic and other information.

The term is also used in [[psycholinguistics]] when describing language comprehension.  In this context, parsing refers to the way that human beings analyze a sentence or phrase (in spoken language or text) "in terms of grammatical constituents, identifying the parts of speech, syntactic relations, etc."<ref name="dictionary.com" />  This term is especially common when discussing what linguistic cues help speakers to interpret [[garden path sentence|garden-path sentences]].

Within computer science, the term is used in the analysis of [[computer languages]], referring to the syntactic analysis of the input code into its component parts in order to facilitate the writing of [[compilers]] and [[interpreter (computing)|interpreters]].

== Human languages ==
{{main category|Natural language parsing}}

===Traditional methods===

The traditional grammatical exercise of parsing, sometimes known as ''clause analysis'', involves breaking down a text into its component parts of speech with an explanation of the form, function, and syntactic relationship of each part.<ref>{{cite web | title=Grammar and Composition | url=http://grammar.about.com/od/pq/g/parsingterm.htm}}</ref> This is determined in large part from study of the language's [[conjugation (grammar)|conjugation]]s and [[declensions]], which can be quite intricate for heavily inflected languages. To parse a phrase such as 'man bites dog' involves noting that the singular noun 'man' is the subject of the sentence, the verb 'bites' is the third person singular of the present tense of the verb 'to bite', and the singular noun 'dog' is the object of the sentence.  Techniques such as [[sentence diagram]]s are sometimes used to indicate relation between elements in the sentence.

Parsing was formerly central to the teaching of grammar throughout the English-speaking world, and widely regarded as basic to the use and understanding of written language.  However the teaching of such techniques is no longer current.

===Computational methods===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
{{Main category|Natural language parsing}}

In some [[machine translation]] and [[natural language processing]] systems, written texts in human languages are parsed by computer programs{{clarify|date=February 2013}}. Human sentences are not easily parsed by programs, as there is substantial [[syntactic ambiguity|ambiguity]] in the structure of human language, whose usage is to convey meaning (or [[semantics]]) amongst a potentially unlimited range of possibilities but only some of which are germane to the particular case. So an utterance "Man bites dog" versus "Dog bites man" is definite on one detail but in another language might appear as "Man dog bites" with a reliance on the larger context to distinguish between those two possibilities, if indeed that difference was of concern. It is difficult to prepare formal rules to describe informal behaviour even though it is clear that some rules are being followed.

In order to parse natural language data, researchers must first agree on the [[grammar]] to be used. The choice of syntax is affected by both [[language|linguistic]] and computational concerns; for instance some parsing systems use [[lexical functional grammar]], but in general, parsing for grammars of this type is known to be [[NP-complete]]. [[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] is another linguistic formalism which has been popular in the parsing community, but other research efforts have focused on less complex formalisms such as the one used in the Penn [[Treebank]]. [[Shallow parsing]] aims to find only the boundaries of major constituents such as noun phrases. Another popular strategy for avoiding linguistic controversy is [[dependency grammar]] parsing.

Most modern parsers are at least partly [[statistics|statistical]]; that is, they rely on a corpus of training data which has already been annotated (parsed by hand). This approach allows the system to gather information about the frequency with which various constructions occur in specific contexts. ''(See [[machine learning]].)'' Approaches which have been used include straightforward [[PCFG]]s (probabilistic context-free grammars), [[maximum entropy classifier|maximum entropy]], and [[neural net]]s. Most of the more successful systems use ''lexical'' statistics (that is, they consider the identities of the words involved, as well as their [[part of speech]]). However such systems are vulnerable to [[overfitting]] and require some kind of [[smoothing]] to be effective.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Parsing algorithms for natural language cannot rely on the grammar having 'nice' properties as with manually designed grammars for programming languages. As mentioned earlier some grammar formalisms are very difficult to parse computationally; in general, even if the desired structure is not [[context-free]], some kind of context-free approximation to the grammar is used to perform a first pass. Algorithms which use context-free grammars often rely on some variant of the [[CKY algorithm]], usually with some [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] to prune away unlikely analyses to save time. ''(See [[chart parsing]].)'' However some systems trade speed for accuracy using, e.g., linear-time versions of the [[Shift-reduce parsing|shift-reduce]] algorithm. A somewhat recent development has been [[parse reranking]] in which the parser proposes some large number of analyses, and a more complex system selects the best option.

===Psycholinguistics===

In [[psycholinguistics]], parsing involves not just the assignment of words to categories, but the evaluation of the meaning of a sentence according to the rules of syntax drawn by inferences made from each word in the sentence.  This normally occurs as words are being heard or read.  Consequently, psycholinguistic models of parsing are of necessity ''incremental'', meaning that they build up an interpretation as the sentence is being processed, which is normally expressed in terms of a partial syntactic structure.  Creation of the wrong structure can lead to the phenomenon known as [[garden path sentence|garden-pathing]].

== Computer languages ==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}

=== Parser ===

A '''parser''' is a software component that takes input data (frequently text) and builds a [[data structure]] – often some kind of [[parse tree]], [[abstract syntax tree]] or other hierarchical structure – giving a structural representation of the input, checking for correct syntax in the process. The parsing may be preceded or followed by other steps, or these may be combined into a single step. The parser is often preceded by a separate [[Lexical analysis|lexical analyser]], which creates tokens from the sequence of input characters; alternatively, these can be combined in [[scannerless parsing]]. Parsers may be programmed by hand or may be automatically or semi-automatically generated by a [[parser generator]]. Parsing is complementary to [[templating language|templating]], which produces formatted ''output.'' These may be applied to different domains, but often appear together, such as the [[scanf]]/[[printf]] pair, or the input (front end parsing) and output (back end code generation) stages of a compiler.

The input to a parser is often text in some [[computer language]], but may also be text in a natural language or less structured textual data, in which case generally only certain parts of the text are extracted, rather than a parse tree being constructed. Parsers range from very simple functions such as [[scanf]], to complex programs such as the frontend of a [[C++ compiler]] or the [[HTML]] parser of a [[web browser]]. An important class of simple parsing is done using [[regular expression]]s, where a regular expression defines a [[regular language]], and then the regular expression engine automatically generates a parser for that language, allowing pattern matching and extraction of text. In other contexts regular expressions are instead used prior to parsing, as the lexing step whose output is then used by the parser.

The use of parsers varies by input. In the case of data languages, a parser is often found as the file reading facility of a program, such as reading in HTML or [[XML]] text; these examples are [[markup language]]s. In the case of [[programming language]]s, a parser is a component of a [[compiler]] or [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]], which parses the [[source code]] of a [[computer programming language]] to create some form of internal representation; the parser is a key step in the [[compiler frontend]]. Programming languages tend to be specified in terms of a [[deterministic context-free grammar]] because fast and efficient parsers can be written for them. For compilers, the parsing itself can be done in one pass or multiple passes – see [[one-pass compiler]] and [[multi-pass compiler]].

The implied disadvantages of a one-pass compiler can largely be overcome by adding fix-ups, where provision is made for fix-ups during the forward pass, and the fix-ups are applied backwards when the current program segment has been recognized as having been completed. An example where such a fix-up mechanism would be useful would be a forward GOTO statement, where the target of the GOTO is unknown until the program segment is completed. In this case, the application of the fix-up would be delayed until the target of the GOTO was recognized. Obviously, a backward GOTO does not require a fix-up.

Context-free grammars are limited in the extent to which they can express all of the requirements of a language. Informally, the reason is that the memory of such a language is limited. The grammar cannot remember the presence of a construct over an arbitrarily long input; this is necessary for a language in which, for example, a name must be declared before it may be referenced. More powerful grammars that can express this constraint, however, cannot be parsed efficiently. Thus, it is a common strategy to create a relaxed parser for a context-free grammar which accepts a superset of the desired language constructs (that is, it accepts some invalid constructs); later, the unwanted constructs can be filtered out at the [[Semantic analysis (compilers)|semantic analysis]] (contextual analysis) step.

For example, in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] the following is syntactically valid code:
<source lang=python>
x = 1
print(x)
</source>
The following code, however, is syntactically valid in terms of the context-free grammar, yielding a syntax tree with the same structure as the previous, but is syntactically invalid in terms of the context-sensitive grammar, which requires that variables be initialized before use:
<source lang=python>
x = 1
print(y)
</source>
Rather than being analyzed at the parsing stage, this is caught by checking the ''values'' in the syntax tree, hence as part of ''semantic'' analysis: context-sensitive syntax is in practice often more easily analyzed as semantics.

===Overview of process===
[[File:Parser Flow.gif|right|Flow of data in a typical parser]]
The following example demonstrates the common case of parsing a computer language with two levels of grammar: lexical and syntactic.

The first stage is the token generation, or [[lexical analysis]], by which the input character stream is split into meaningful symbols defined by a grammar of [[regular expression]]s. For example, a calculator program would look at an input such as "<code>12*(3+4)^2</code>" and split it into the tokens <code>12</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>(</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>)</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>2</code>, each of which is a meaningful symbol in the context of an arithmetic expression. The lexer would contain rules to tell it that the characters <code>*</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> mark the start of a new token, so meaningless tokens like "<code>12*</code>" or "<code>(3</code>" will not be generated.

The next stage is parsing or syntactic analysis, which is checking that the tokens form an allowable expression. This is usually done with reference to a [[context-free grammar]] which recursively defines components that can make up an expression and the order in which they must appear. However, not all rules defining programming languages can be expressed by context-free grammars alone, for example type validity and proper declaration of identifiers. These rules can be formally expressed with [[attribute grammar]]s.

The final phase is [[Semantic analysis (computer science)|semantic parsing]] or analysis, which is working out the implications of the expression just validated and taking the appropriate action. In the case of a calculator or interpreter, the action is to evaluate the expression or program, a compiler, on the other hand, would generate some kind of code. Attribute grammars can also be used to define these actions.

==Types of parsers==
The ''task'' of the parser is essentially to determine if and how the input can be derived from the start symbol of the grammar. This can be done in essentially two ways:
*[[Top-down parsing]]- Top-down parsing can be viewed as an attempt to find left-most derivations of an input-stream by searching for [[parse tree]]s using a top-down expansion of the given [[formal grammar]] rules. Tokens are consumed from left to right. Inclusive choice is used to accommodate [[ambiguity]] by expanding all alternative right-hand-sides of grammar rules.<ref name=" AhoSethiUllman 1986">Aho, A.V., Sethi, R. and Ullman ,J.D.  (1986) " Compilers: principles, techniques, and tools." '' [[Addison-Wesley Longman]] Publishing Co., Inc. Boston, MA, USA. ''</ref>
*[[Bottom-up parsing]] - A parser can start with the input and attempt to rewrite it to the start symbol. Intuitively, the parser attempts to locate the most basic elements, then the elements containing these, and so on. [[LR parser]]s are examples of bottom-up parsers. Another term used for this type of parser is Shift-Reduce parsing.

[[LL parser]]s and [[recursive-descent parser]]  are examples of top-down parsers which cannot accommodate [[left recursion|left recursive]] [[Formal grammar#The syntax of grammars|production rules]]. Although it has been believed that simple implementations of top-down parsing cannot accommodate direct and indirect left-recursion and may require exponential time and space complexity while parsing ambiguous [[context-free grammar]]s, more sophisticated algorithms for top-down parsing have been created by Frost, Hafiz, and Callaghan<ref name="FrostHafizCallaghan 2007">Frost, R., Hafiz, R. and Callaghan, P. (2007) " Modular and Efficient Top-Down Parsing for Ambiguous Left-Recursive Grammars ." ''10th International Workshop on Parsing Technologies (IWPT), ACL-SIGPARSE '', Pages: 109 - 120, June 2007, Prague.</ref><ref name="FrostHafizCallaghan 2008">Frost, R., Hafiz, R. and Callaghan, P. (2008) " Parser Combinators for Ambiguous Left-Recursive Grammars." '' 10th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages (PADL), ACM-SIGPLAN '', Volume 4902/2008, Pages: 167 - 181, January 2008, San Francisco.</ref> which accommodate [[ambiguity]] and [[left recursion]] in polynomial time and which generate polynomial-size representations of the potentially exponential number of parse trees. Their algorithm is able to produce both left-most and right-most derivations of an input with regard to a given [[context-free grammar|CFG]] (context-free grammar).

An important distinction with regard to parsers is whether a parser generates a ''leftmost derivation'' or a ''rightmost derivation'' (see [[context-free grammar]]). LL parsers will generate a leftmost [[Parse tree|derivation]] and LR parsers will generate a rightmost derivation (although usually in reverse).<ref name=" AhoSethiUllman 1986" />

==Lookahead ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
Lookahead establishes the maximum incoming tokens that a parser can use to decide which rule it should use. Lookahead is especially relevant to [[LL parser|LL]], [[LR parser|LR]], and [[LALR parser]]s, where it is often explicitly indicated by affixing the lookahead to the algorithm name in parentheses, such as LALR(1).

Most [[programming language]]s, the primary target of parsers, are carefully defined in such a way that a parser with limited lookahead, typically one, can parse them, because parsers with limited lookahead are often more efficient. One important change{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} to this trend came in 1990 when [[Terence Parr]] created [[ANTLR]] for his Ph.D. thesis, a [[parser generator]] for efficient LL(''k'') parsers, where ''k'' is any fixed value.

Parsers typically have only a few actions after seeing each token. They are shift (add this token to the stack for later reduction), reduce (pop tokens from the stack and form a syntactic construct), end, error (no known rule applies) or conflict (does not know whether to shift or reduce).

Lookahead has two advantages.
* It helps the parser take the correct action in case of conflicts. For example, parsing the if statement in the case of an else clause.
* It eliminates many duplicate states and eases the burden of an extra stack. A C language non-lookahead parser will have around 10,000 states. A lookahead parser will have around 300 states.

Example: Parsing the Expression  1 + 2 * 3
{| class="toccolours"
| colspan=3 | Set of expression parsing rules (called grammar) is as follows,
|-
| Rule1: || E ? E + E  || style="padding-left:1em" | Expression is the sum of two expressions.
|-
| Rule2: || E ? E * E  || style="padding-left:1em" |Expression is the product of two expressions.
|-
| Rule3: || E ? number || style="padding-left:1em" |Expression is a simple number
|-
| Rule4: || colspan=2 | + has less precedence than *
|}
Most programming languages (except for a few such as APL and Smalltalk) and algebraic formulas give higher precedence to multiplication than addition, in which case the correct interpretation of the example above is (1 + (2*3)).
Note that Rule4 above is a semantic rule. It is possible to rewrite the grammar to incorporate this into the syntax. However, not all such rules can be translated into syntax.

;Simple non-lookahead parser actions

Initially Input = [1,+,2,*,3]
# Shift "1" onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule3). Input = [+,2,*,3] Stack = [1]
# Reduces "1" to expression "E" based on rule3. Stack = [E]
# Shift "+" onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule1). Input = [2,*,3] Stack = [E,+]
# Shift "2" onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule3). Input = [*,3] Stack = [E,+,2]
# Reduce stack element "2" to Expression "E" based on rule3. Stack = [E,+,E]
# Reduce stack items [E,+] and new input "E" to "E" based on rule1. Stack = [E]
# Shift "*" onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule2). Input = [3] Stack = [E,*]
# Shift "3" onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule3). Input = [] (empty) Stack = [E,*,3]
# Reduce stack element "3" to expression "E" based on rule3. Stack = [E,*,E]
# Reduce stack items [E,*] and new input "E" to "E" based on rule2. Stack = [E]

The parse tree and resulting code from it is not correct according to language semantics.

To correctly parse without lookahead, there are three solutions:
* The user has to enclose expressions within parentheses. This often is not a viable solution.
* The parser needs to have more logic to backtrack and retry whenever a rule is violated or not complete. The similar method is followed in LL parsers.
* Alternatively, the parser or grammar needs to have extra logic to delay reduction and reduce only when it is absolutely sure which rule to reduce first. This method is used in LR parsers. This correctly parses the expression but with many more states and increased stack depth.

;Lookahead parser actions
# Shift 1 onto stack on input 1 in anticipation of rule3. It does not reduce immediately.
# Reduce stack item 1 to simple Expression on input + based on rule3. The lookahead is +, so we are on path to E +, so we can reduce the stack to E.
# Shift + onto stack on input + in anticipation of rule1.
# Shift 2 onto stack on input 2 in anticipation of rule3.
# Reduce stack item 2 to Expression on input * based on rule3. The lookahead * expects only E before it.
# Now stack has E + E and still the input is *. It has two choices now, either to shift based on rule2 or reduction based on rule1. Since * has more precedence than + based on rule4, so shift * onto stack in anticipation of rule2.
# Shift 3 onto stack on input 3 in anticipation of rule3.
# Reduce stack item 3 to Expression after seeing end of input based on rule3.
# Reduce stack items E * E to E based on rule2.
# Reduce stack items E + E to E based on rule1.
The parse tree generated is correct and simply more efficient {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} than non-lookahead parsers. This is the strategy followed in [[LALR parser]]s.

'''Phil Silvers''' (May 11, 1911 – November 1, 1985) was an American [[entertainer]] and [[comedy]] actor, known as "The King of [[Chutzpah]]." He is best known for starring in ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'', a 1950s [[sitcom]] set on a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] post in which he played Sergeant Bilko.

His siblings were Lillian, Harry, Jack, Saul, Pearl, Michael, and Reuben Silver. His father, a sheet metal worker, helped build the early New York skyscrapers.

Silvers started entertaining at age 11, when he would sing in theaters when the projector broke down (a common occurrence in those days, to the point where he was allowed to keep attending the same movie theater free of charge, to sing through any future breakdowns).<ref name=master>[http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/artist/phil-silvers "Phil Silvers"] masterworksbroadway.com, accessed November 25, 2011</ref> By age 13 he was working as a singer in the Gus Edwards Revue, and then worked in vaudeville and as a burlesque comic.<ref>Monush, Barry.[http://books.google.com/books?id=toTIb1Ek2WwC&pg=PA681&lpg=PA681&dq=%22Phil+Silvers%22+%22This+Laugh+Is+On+Me%22&source=bl&ots=ek0036OgNE&sig=ntlkIhyt02VCsdV_v5HOayb3pOw&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22Phil%20Silvers%22%20%22This%20Laugh%20Is%20On%20Me%22&f=false "Phil Silvers"]''Screen World Presents the Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors: From the silent era to 1965'' (2003), Hal Leonard Corporation, ISBN 1-55783-551-9, p. 681</ref>

Silvers next worked in short films for the [[Vitaphone]] studio, such as ''[[Ups and Downs (1937 film)|Ups and Downs]]'' (1937), and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], where he made his debut in the short-lived show ''Yokel Boy'' in 1939. Critics raved about Silvers, who was hailed as the bright spot in the mediocre play.<ref>Bordman, Gerald and Norton, Richard.[http://books.google.com/books?id=OVdShkzkX74C&pg=PA575&dq=%22Yokel+Boy%22+%22Phil+Silvers%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22Yokel%20Boy%22%20%22Phil%20Silvers%22&f=false "'Yokel Boy'"] ''American Musical Theatre: A Chronicle'' (2010), Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-972970-0, p.575</ref> The Broadway revue ''High Kickers'' (1941) was based on his concept.<ref>Suskin, Steven.[http://books.google.com/books?id=yy_9UJLhAUMC&pg=PT407&dq=''High+Kickers''+%22Phil+Silvers%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=''High%20Kickers''%20%22Phil%20Silvers%22&f=false "'High Kickers of 1942'"]''The Sound of Broadway Music'' (2011), Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-979084-1</ref>

He made his feature film debut in ''Hit Parade of 1941'' in 1940<ref>Crowther, Bosley.[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9502EED61E3CE73ABC4D53DFB467838B659EDE "Movie Review: 'Hit Parade of 1941' at Loew's Criterion"] ''The New York Times'', December 5, 1940</ref> (his previous appearance as a 'pitch man' in ''[[Strike Up the Band (film)|Strike Up the Band]]'' was cut). Over the next two decades, he worked as a [[character actor]] for [[MGM]], [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], and [[20th Century Fox]], in such films as 1941's ''[[All Through the Night (film)|All Through the Night]]'' with [[Humphrey Bogart]], ''[[Lady Be Good (1941 film)|Lady Be Good]]'' (1941), ''[[Coney Island (1943 film)|Coney Island]]'' (1943), ''[[Cover Girl (film)|Cover Girl]]'' (1944), and ''[[Summer Stock]]'' (1950).<ref>[http://www.fandango.com/philsilvers/filmography/p65703 "Phil Silvers Filmography"] fandango.com, accessed November 25, 2011</ref> When the studio system began to decline, he returned to the stage.  ''[[Cover Girl (film)|Cover Girl]]'' demonstrates that Silvers was an accomplished dancer, performing flawlessly in quick-tempo trios with famed dancers Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth.

Silvers wrote the lyrics for [[Frank Sinatra]]'s "[[Nancy (With the Laughing Face)]]". Although he was not a songwriter, he wrote the lyrics while visiting composer [[Jimmy Van Heusen]]. The two composed the song for Van Heusen's writing partner Johnny Burke, for his wife Bessie's birthday. Substituting Sinatra's little daughter's name Nancy at her birthday party, the trio impressed the singer to record it himself. The song became a popular hit in 1944 and was a staple in Sinatra's live performances.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Yw40lISdzJkC&pg=PA443&dq=Van+Heusen+%22Phil+Silvers%22+%22Nancy%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=Van%20Heusen%20%22Phil%20Silvers%22%20%22Nancy%22&f=false "Nancy"]''Frank Sintra : The Complete Guide'', Google eBook, accessed November 25, 2011, p. 443</ref>

Silvers scored a major triumph in ''[[Top Banana (musical)|Top Banana]]'', a Broadway show of 1952. Silvers played Jerry Biffle, the egocentric, always-busy star of a major television show. (The character is said to have been based on [[Milton Berle]].) Silvers dominated the show and won a [[Tony Award]] for his performance. He repeated the role in [[Top Banana (film)|the 1954 film version]] that was originally released in [[3-D film|3-D]].<ref name=master/>

According to the documentary on the DVD of ''It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'', Silvers was not a traditional comedian: he was a comic actor. Silvers never did stand-up, and, out of character, he was not known for cracking jokes.

==1950s fame and later career==
[[File:Phil silvers as bilko.JPG|thumb|170px|Silvers as Sgt. Bilko.]]
Silvers became a household name in 1955 when he starred as Sergeant Ernest G. Bilko in ''You'll Never Get Rich'', later retitled ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]''. The military comedy became a television hit, with the opportunistic Bilko fast-talking his way through one obstacle after another. In 1958 CBS switched the show to be telecast on Friday nights and moved the setting to Camp Fremont in California. A year later the show was off the schedule.<ref name=museum>Gomery, Douglas.[http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=silversphil "Phil Silvers"]''The Museum of Broadcast Communications'' (museum.tv), accessed November 25, 2011</ref>

Silvers returned to Broadway in the musical ''[[Do Re Mi (musical)|Do Re Mi]]'' in December 1960, receiving a nomination for the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical]]. Stanley Green wrote that "It was particularly blessed by offering two outstanding clowns in Phil Silvers as the pushiest of patsies and [[Nancy Walker]]."<ref>Green, Stanley and Green, Kay.[http://books.google.com/books?id=KDKFHniTy1YC&pg=PA194&dq=%22Jule+Styne%22+%22Do+Re+Mi%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22Jule%20Styne%22%20%22Do%20Re%20Mi%22&f=false "'Do Re Mi'"]''Broadway Musicals, Show By Show'' (1996, 5ed.), Hal Leonard Corporation, ISBN 0-7935-7750-0, p.194</ref> Throughout the 1960s he appeared in films such as ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963)<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/79559/It-s-a-Mad-Mad-Mad-Mad-World/ "'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' Listing"] tcm.com, accessed November 25, 2011</ref> and ''[[40 Pounds of Trouble]]'' (1963).<ref>Crowther, Bosley.[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B03E1DA173CEF3BBC4C51DFB7668388679EDE "Movie Review:'40 Pounds of Trouble'"] ''The New York Times'', January 24, 1963</ref> He was featured in [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s last film, the unfinished ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' (1962).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217055/ "'Something's Got to Give' Listing"] imdb.com, accessed November 25, 2011</ref> In the 1963–1964 television season, he appeared as Harry Grafton, a factory foreman interested in get-rich-quick schemes, much like the previous Bilko character, in CBS's 30-episode ''[[The New Phil Silvers Show]]'',<ref>Newcomb, Horace.[http://books.google.com/books?id=CFXgj7a55agC&pg=PA1758&dq=Grafton+%22The+New+Phil+Silvers+Show%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=Grafton%20%22The%20New%20Phil%20Silvers%20Show%22&f=false "'Phil Silvers Shw'"]''Encyclopedia of Television, Volume 1'' (2004, 2ed.), CRC Press, ISBN 1-57958-411-X, p. 1758</ref> with co-stars [[Stafford Repp]], [[Herbie Faye]], [[Buddy Lester]], [[Elena Verdugo]] as his sister, Audrey, and her children, played by [[Ronnie Dapo]] and [[Sandy Descher]]. In 1967 he starred as a guest in one of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Carry On films]], ''[[Follow That Camel]]'', a [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] parody in which he played a variation of the Sergeant Bilko character, Sergeant Nocker.<ref>Munden, Kenneth White.[http://books.google.com/books?id=s1k1RsGvFwwC&pg=PA360&dq=%22Follow+That+Camel%22+%22+Phil+Silvers%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22Follow%20That%20Camel%22%20%22%20Phil%20Silvers%22&f=false "'Follow That Camel'"]''The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures'' (1971), University of California Press, ISBN 0-520-20970-2, p.360</ref>
Producer [[Peter Rogers]] employed him to ensure the [[Carry On films]]' success in [[United States|America]], though Silvers' presence did not ensure the film's success on either side of the Atlantic.<ref>Childs, Peter and Storry, Mike.[http://books.google.com/books?id=iS4hsxKiMNgC&pg=PA83&dq=%22Follow+That+Camel%22+%22+Phil+Silvers%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22Follow%20That%20Camel%22%20%22%20Phil%20Silvers%22&f=false "Carry On Films"]''Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture'' (1999), Taylor & Francis, ISBN 0-415-14726-3, p.83</ref> His salary was £30,000, the largest [[Carry On films|Carry On]] salary ever, only later met by the appearance of [[Elke Sommer]] in ''[[Carry On Behind]]''.
[[File:Silvers hillbillies 1970.JPG|thumb|left|170px|Silvers had recurring roles in ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' as Shifty Shafer or "Honest John" in 1969 and 1970.]]
Silvers was offered the leading role of conniving Roman slave Pseudolus in the Broadway musical comedy ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]''. Silvers declined,<ref name=master/> and the role went instead to [[Zero Mostel]], who was so successful in the role that he repeated the role in the 1966 film version. By this time Silvers realized his error, and agreed to appear in the film as a secondary character, flesh merchant Marcus Lycus. When actor-producer [[Larry Blyden]] mounted a Broadway revival of ''Forum'' in 1972, he wanted Phil Silvers to play the lead, and this time Silvers agreed.<ref>Green, Stanley and Green, Kay.[http://books.google.com/books?id=KDKFHniTy1YC&pg=PA198&dq=%22A+Funny+Thing+Happened%22+%22Phil+Silvers%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22A%20Funny%20Thing%20Happened%22%20%22Phil%20Silvers%22&f=false "'A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'"]''Broadway Musicals, Show by Show'' (1996), Hal Leonard Corporation, ISBN 0-7935-7750-0, p.198</ref> The revival was a hit and Silvers became the first leading actor ever to win a [[Tony Award]] in a revival of a musical.

Silvers also guested on ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', and various TV variety shows such as ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'', and ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]''. Perhaps Silvers' most memorable guest appearance was as curmudgeonly Hollywood producer Harold Hecuba in an episode (titled ''[[The Producer]]'') on ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' (broadcast in 1966),<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0588103/ "'Gilligan's Island' Episode"] imdb.com, accessed November 25, 2011</ref> where he and the castaways performed a musical version of ''[[Hamlet]]''.<ref>Cantor, Paul A.[http://books.google.com/books?id=A6Qr6BFJUjoC&pg=PA19&dq=%22Gilligan's+Island%22+%22Phil+Silvers%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22Gilligan's%20Island%22%20%22Phil%20Silvers%22&f=false "The Courage of the Fearless Crew"]''Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization'' (2003), Rowman & Littlefield, ISBN 0-7425-0779-3, p. 19</ref> (Silvers' production company Gladasya – named after his catchphrase "Gladdaseeya!" – financed the show.)

==Illness and death==
Silvers suffered a [[stroke]] during the run of ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' in August 1972.<ref>"Phil Silver's Illness Threatens 'Forum' Run", ("Mr. Silvers has been out of the cast since he was stricken a week ago and hospitalized".) ''The New York Times'', August 8, 1972, p. 21</ref> He was left with slurred speech. Despite his poor health, he continued working, playing Harry Starman in the 1974 "Horror in the Heights" episode of [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0621537/ ''The Night Stalker''] starring [[Darren McGavin]]. His guest appearances would continue into the early 1980s including co-starring in 1977's ''[[The Chicken Chronicles]]'',<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&dat=19770825&id=-gVZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IVADAAAAIBAJ&pg=5022,1883586 "Phil Silvers Rough Road Back"] ''The Prescott Courier'', August 25, 1977</ref> an appearance on ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' as an old comic trying to reunite with his old partner, and on ''[[Happy Days]]'' as the father of Jenny Piccolo (played by his daughter [[Cathy Silvers]]).<ref>Brant, Marley.[http://books.google.com/books?id=_3XnpqmYAxcC&pg=PA59&dq=%22Happy+Days%22+%22+Phil+Silvers%22+Piccolo&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22Happy%20Days%22%20%22%20Phil%20Silvers%22%20Piccolo&f=false "Jennie Piccolo"]''Happier Days: Paramount Television's Classic Sitcoms 1974-1984'' (2006), Random House Digital, Inc., ISBN 0-8230-8933-9, p. 59</ref>  In 1978 Silvers played the cab driver "Hoppy" in [[The Cheap Detective]]. In his cab, Silvers can be heard (three words) and seen turning his head towards the camera and breaking into a smile (1/4 fps) at the end of the movie, immediately prior to Falk entering "Hoppy's" cab.  His final appearance was in an episode of [[CHiPs]] in 1983.

A frail Silvers, interviewed shortly before his death, revealed one of his secrets: "I’m an impatient comedian. And I feel the audience is as impatient as me."

Silvers died in his sleep on November 1, 1985 in [[Century City]], [[California]]. "Mr. Silvers's family said he died of natural causes."<ref>Kerr, Peter. "Phil Silvers, TV'S Sergeant Bilko, Dead At 73", ''The New York Times'', November 2, 1985, p. 32</ref> He was interred at [[Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].<ref>Farah, Judy. "Kings of Comedy Mourn Funnyman Phil Silvers", ("Sid Caesar, Carl Reiner, Nanette Fabray, Dudley Moore, Danny Thomas and Morey Amsterdam were among those attending the funeral services Sunday at Mount Sinai Cemetery.") ''The Associated Press'', November 4, 1985</ref>

==Personal life==
Phil Silvers was married twice, to Evelyn Patrick and to [[Jo-Carroll Dennison]].<ref name=tvgbio>[http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/phil-silvers/bio/170182 "Phil Silvers: Biography"], [[TV Guide|TVGuide.com]]</ref> Both of his marriages ended in divorce.<ref name=museum/> He had five daughters — Candace, Cathy, Laurie, Nancey<!--sp OK-->, and Tracey Edythe<ref name=tvgbio /> — all by his second wife.<ref name=master/>

Like his alter-ego Ernie Bilko, Silvers was a compulsive gambler and suffered from depression on and off over the years.<ref>Maslon, Lawrence and Kantor, Michael.[http://books.google.com/books?id=uV2gZKvQwR0C&pg=PT229&dq=compulsive+gambler+%22+Phil+Silvers%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=compulsive%20gambler%20%22%20Phil%20Silvers%22&f=false "Phil Silvers"]''Make 'em Laugh: The Funny Business of America'' (2008), Hachette Digital, Inc., ISBN 0-446-50531-5</ref> He suffered a severe mental breakdown while performing in Spain in 1962. While staying in [[Reno, Nevada]], in the 1950s, he would often gamble all night. On one occasion, at the tiny Cal-Neva Lodge in nearby [[Lake Tahoe, Nevada]], Silvers spent an entire night playing [[craps]] until he lost all his money, and then went through $1,000 in credit. A taxi was called to return him to Reno. It was "[o]ne of the worst nights of my life', Silvers told the driver, adding, "Don't wait for any lights and don't wait for any tip . . . I left it at the Cal-Neva!"<ref>Moe, Albert Woods. ''Nevada's Golden Age of Gambling'', Puget Sound Books, (2001), ISBN 0-9715019-0-4.</ref>

His memoirs are titled ''This Laugh Is On Me''.

==Legacy==
In 1996 [[TV Guide]] ranked him number 31 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list<ref>{{cite book |title=TV Guide Guide to TV |year=2004 |publisher=Barnes and Noble |isbn=0-7607-5634-1 |pages=596}}</ref>

In a 2005 poll to find ''[[The Comedian's Comedian]]'', Silvers was voted #42 on the list of the top 50 comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders. [[Dick Van Dyke]], who made his TV debut on ''Bilko'', says he "was always fascinated with Phil's sense of timing. Incredible."

Voice actor [[Daws Butler]] employed an [[impressionist (entertainment)|impression]] of Silvers as the voice of the [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon character [[Hokey Wolf]]<ref>[http://www.cartoonscrapbook.com/H/hokeywolf1960.htm "Hokey Wolf"] cartoonscrapbook.com, accessed November 25, 2011</ref> and also used the same voice in numerous cartoons for [[Jay Ward]].{{citation needed |date=January 2011}} The premise of ''The Phil Silvers Show'' was the basis for the Hanna-Barbera cartoon ''[[Top Cat]]'', for which [[Arnold Stang]] moderately imitated Silvers' voice for the title character.<ref>Weber, Bruce.[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/arts/television/22stang.html "Arnold Stang, Milquetoast Actor, Dies at 91"]''The New York Times'', December 22, 2009</ref> The 1993 cartoon series ''[[The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' featured a character called Wes Weasley, who had a very similar appearance and voice to Silvers.<ref>[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog?from=Main.AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog "Western Animation: Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"] tvtropes.org, accessed November 25, 2011</ref>

The ''[[Playboy]] cartoon'' "[[Little Annie Fanny]]" featured the character of manager Solly Brass, who was based on Phil Silvers.{{citation needed |date=January 2011}}

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Homer the Vigilante]]" (Episode #1F09, 6 January 1994), Bart tricks Phil Silvers' character Otto Meyer from the 1963 film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' into driving into a river."<ref>{{cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Groening |editor1-first=Ray |editor1-last=Richmond |editor1-link=Ray Richmond |editor2-first=Antonia |editor2-last=Coffman |title=[[The Simpsons episode guides#The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family|The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family]] |others={{smallcaps|Created by Matt Groening; edited by Ray Richmond and Antonia Coffman}}. |edition=1st |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=[[HarperPerennial]] |lccn=98141857 |ol=433519M |oclc=37796735 |isbn=0060952520 |ref={{harvid|Richmond & Coffman|1997}}}} [[ISBN]] {{ISBNT|0-06-095252-0}}, {{ISBNT|978-0-06-095252-5}}. p. 132.</ref>

'''Tee-ball''' (also '''teeball''', '''tee ball''' or '''t-ball''') is a [[team sport]] based on and simplifying [[baseball]] and [[softball]]. It is intended as an introduction for children aged 4 to 8 to develop ball-game skills and have fun. 

The principal difference between tee-ball and its adult counterparts is that the child usually hits the ball off of a stationary [[tee]]; the ball is generally not pitched. Thus, tee-ball allows a young child to learn the skills of batting, catching, running the bases, and throwing, while making it both easier to hit the ball and less likely for batters to be injured since they do not need to dodge wayward pitches (the ball is also softer).   

Despite the implication of some of the spellings of the game's name, the tee used in tee-ball is not T-shaped, but simply an upright, flexible shaft on a movable base.  The capitalized, spaced-apart name "Tee Ball" is a registered trademark in the US, by a church-affiliated Florida league, as is the abbreviated "T-Ball" (stylized "T•BALL" in logos), by a national, non-profit, secular league.  

== Description ==
Tee-ball associations generally allow children between the ages of four and eight to play in their leagues.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  A tee-ball coach sets the team lineup and fielding positions in the team's [[Baseball scorekeeping|scorebook]].  The positions that get the most action in tee-ball are [[pitcher]] and [[first base]], followed by the rest of the [[infield]] positions.  In some leagues, [[catcher]] is also a special position due to the added gear that is worn; in other leagues, there is no catcher.  In tee-ball, the pitcher is usually used for defensive purposes only, though gently pitched balls may be used with older or more advanced players in place of the fixed tee. The [[Baseball (ball)|ball]] is placed on an adjustable [[tee]] atop the [[home plate]] at a suitable height for the [[batting (baseball)|batter]] to strike.  (In some clubs, adult coaches give the batter an opportunity to try and hit a few pitched balls before going to the tee in the hope that this will further develop batting skills.)<ref name="T-Ball USA rules">{{cite web |url= http://www.teeballusa.org/rules.asp |title=Rules |work=TeeBallUSA.org |publisher=T-Ball USA Association |location=West Palm Beach, Florida, US |date=2014}}</ref> Most of the other rules are similar or identical to those of baseball,<ref name="T-Ball USA rules" /> though the game is played on a smaller field, typically one used for [[Little League]] or other youth baseball.<ref name="T-Ball USA FieldPlay">{{cite web |url= http://www.teeballusa.org/FieldPlay.asp |title=Field of Play |work=TeeBallUSA.org |publisher=''Op. cit'' |date=2014}}</ref>  In addition, for the youngest tee-ball players, runs and outs are often not recorded, and every player gets to bat each inning.

[[Image:Tee ball sign.PNG|right|thumb|Example tee-ball roster sign that is displayed so the fans can cheer the kids by name.]]Many parents assist during the game by coaching players in the dugout, in the field, on the bases, and at the plate.  They often also perform the task of [[Umpire|umpiring]].

== History ==
The game's origins date back to at least the 1950s, with several people claiming to be the father of the game, and it appears to have been independently invented in several places. [[Albion, Michigan]] claims to be the earliest place of invention of the sport, in 1956.<ref>[http://www.albionmich.com/history/histor_notebook/020428.shtml "T-Ball Invented in Albion"], Frank Passic, ''Morning Star'', April 28, 2002, pg. 5</ref>  Claude Lewis, director of the Warner Robins, Georgia, Recreation Department, formed a tee-ball league in March 1958, in which 20 children played the first year.  Lewis designed rules for the new game and mailed the rule books out to rec departments all over the country and overseas.  Nevertheless, [[Starkville, Mississippi]] claims to have independently created tee-ball in their town in 1961.  According to the Starkville Rotary Club's website: "In 1961, when it was apparent that younger children needed some way to participate in the program, Rotarians Dr. Clyde Muse and W. W. Littlejohn devised the game of {{sic|hide=y|t-ball}} and added it to the summer baseball program."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.starkvillerotary.com/info/history.html |title=A Look at the Starkville Rotary Club Through the Years |publisher=Starkville Rotary Club}}</ref>

A "Tee Ball" trademark was registered in the early 1970s{{clarify|date=June 2014|reason=Give a specific date.}} with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] by Robert Dayton Hobbs (1924–2006), the [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] pastor of a church he founded in [[Milton, Florida]], and also the organizer in the late 1950s of the first organized youth baseball program in [[Santa Rosa County, Florida]].<ref>Hobbs, a 1959 graduate of [[Bob Jones University]], founded Santa Rosa [County, Florida] Christian Schools in 1962, and instrumental in forming the Christian Educators' Association. {{cite journal |title=All Things for Jesus: The Ministry of Dayton Hobbs |journal=Voice of the Alumni |publisher=Bob Jones University |volume=82 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=14–16 |location=Greenville, South Carolina, US}}</ref> Hobbs's "Tee Ball" trademark was still asserted by Gospel Projects, Inc., of Milton, Florida, at least {{as of|lc=y|2009}} (last year of publication of their "Tee Ball Baseball Organization Rules").<ref name="GospelProjectsRules">{{cite web |url= http://geocities.com/teeballbaseball/org.htm |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20091025185045/http://geocities.com/teeballbaseball/org.htm |archivedate=October 25, 2009 |title=Tee Ball Baseball Organization Rules |publisher=Gospel Projects, Inc |location=Milton, Florida |date=2001}}</ref>

Hobbs credited the [[United States Navy]] with spreading the game overseas.{{citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=This appears to be a paraphrase of a direct quotation that is missing.}}

It is estimated that 2.2 million children play tee-ball.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In the "[[White House Tee Ball Initiative]]", U.S. president [[George W Bush]] hosted tee-ball games on the South Lawn of the [[White House]].<ref>http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/teeball/2008/sept7.html</ref>

'''The Designers Republic''' ('''tDR''' for short) is a [[graphic design]] studio and based in [[Sheffield]], England, founded by graphic designer Ian Anderson in February 1986. It was known for its [[anti-establishment]] aesthetics, while simultaneously embracing brash [[consumerism]] and the uniform style of corporate [[brand]]s, such as [[Orange (brand)|Orange]] and [[Coca-Cola]]. The studio in its larger form closed in January 2009, with Anderson stating that it would continue in a more 'slimline' form. <ref name=EyeMagazine>{{cite web |url=http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-ian-anderson |title=Reputations: Ian Anderson |accessdate=21 August 2014 |last=Farrelly |first=Liz |date=Spring 2009 |work= |publisher=''[[Eye Magazine]]'' Blog }}</ref>  <ref name=CRBlog>{{cite web |url=http://www.creativereview.co.uk/crblog/the-designers-republic-is-dead-long-live-the-designers-republic/ |title=The Designers Republic Is Dead; Long Live The Designers Republic |accessdate=24 January 2009 |last=Burgoyne |first=Patrick |date=23 January 2009 |work= |publisher=''[[Creative Review]]'' Blog }}</ref>

== History ==
Initially, Ian Anderson founded The Designers Republic to design [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]]s for the band Person to Person, which he managed at the time. His first ideas were inspired by [[Russia]]n [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]].

An early client was [[Leeds]] band [[Age of Chance]], for whom they developed a series of record covers between 1986 and 1987. The sleeve of the 1987 [[12-inch single|12-inch]] "Don't Get Mad... Get Even! (The New York Remixes)" was selected as one of ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''’s "100 Best Record Covers of All Time" in 2001.<ref name="Q">{{cite book |last= Harrison |first= Ian |title= Q: The 100 Best Record Covers of All Time |chapter=Age of Chance: Don't Get Mad Get Even!

In 1994, [[Emigre (magazine)|''Emigre'' magazine]] devoted a whole issue to the Designers Republic, a copy of which was bought by [[Museum of Modern Art|NY MoMA]]. This issue is still ''Emigre''’s best-ever seller and is now sold out<ref name="Emigre 29">{{cite web |url=http://www.emigre.com/EMag.php?issue=29 |title=Back Issues: Emigre 29 |accessdate=24 January 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Emigre]] |date= }}</ref>

The Designers Republic was introduced to a larger audience by their [[album cover|record cover]]s for the English [[electronica]] label [[Warp Records]] (also based in Sheffield). In addition to designing the covers for much of Warp's roster of artists, such as [[Autechre]] and [[Aphex Twin]], tDR has also created covers for other label artists such as [[Moloko]], [[Fluke (band)|Fluke]], [[Funkstörung]], [[The Orb]], [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] (and [[Jarvis Cocker]]), [[Pop Will Eat Itself]], [[Supergrass]] and [[Towa Tei]].

Outside the musical sector, tDR created the visuals, packaging and manual for the [[PlayStation]]–[[Sega Saturn]] game ''[[Wipeout (game)|Wipeout]]'' (1995), the interface for the [[Personal computer game|PC game]] ''[[Hardwar (video game)|Hardwar]]'' (1998), and packaging and posters for the first ''[[Grand Theft Auto (video game)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' (1997). They cooperated with the [[Swatch]] company in 1996 to design their own watch. They also designed the packaging for [[Sony]]'s [[AIBO]].

The book ''3D ? 2D: Adventures in And Out Of Architecture'', released in 2001, was an architectural examination of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of [[Slovenia]] presented in the graphic style of their previous work.

tDR has consulted on the re-branding of the city of [[Quito]], capital of [[Ecuador]], and was the only non-national design company to be invited to propose a new flag for [[Slovenia]].<ref>[http://www.dexigner.com/design_events/1686.html Brain Aided Design SoYo: The Designers Republic]{{broken citation|date=March 2013}}</ref> tDR was also commissioned to create a logo and general graphic design by French musician-producer [[Julien Civange]] for its [[Music2Titan]] mission to take music on the [[European Space Agency]]'s Cassini–Huygens probe to the moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] in 2004.<ref>http://www.music2titan.com/</ref>

On [[20 January 2009]], after 23 years in operation, tDR went into voluntary liquidation, Anderson bought back the company name and assets, and relaunched tDR as a smaller outfit. <ref name=EyeMagazine /><ref name=CRBlog />

== Style ==

The Designers Republic's works are often playful and bright, and considered [[Maximum]]-[[Minimalism|minimalist]], mixing images from Japanese [[anime]] and [[subvertising|subvertised]] corporate logos, with a [[postmodern]] tendency towards controversial [[irony]], featuring statements like ''"Work Buy Consume Die"'', ''"Robots Build Robots"'', ''"Customized Terror"'', ''"Buy nothing, pay now"'', and ''"Made in the Designers Republic"''. They also celebrated their northern roots with phrases like ''"Made in the Designers Republic, North of Nowhere"'' and ''"SoYo"'' (referring to [[Sheffield]]'s county of [[South Yorkshire]]) — affirming they were not from [[London]]'s design community in Soho.

'''Layered Image File Format''' (LIFF) is a [[file format]] used in the [[Openlab]] suite for [[microscope image processing]]. It is a proprietary format, but has an open, extensible form analogous to [[TIFF]]. It was specifically designed to contain a large number of high resolution images, and also all of the meta data generated by analysis of such images.

Apart from being an acronym, the name LIFF was chosen to honour [[Douglas Adams]] and [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]]'s ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]'', which was in turn named after [[Liff, Scotland|Liff]], a town in Scotland.

==Hardware==
The VT220 improved on the earlier [[VT100]] series of terminals with a redesigned keyboard, much smaller physical packaging, and a much faster microprocessor. To meet the needs of various national [[regulatory agency|regulatory agencies]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}, the VT220 was available with [[cathode ray tube|CRT]]s that used white, green, or amber [[phosphor]]s.

Several of the VT2xx models were pyramid shaped, allowing them to sit on a table top, leaving the surface of the display at an angle to the user; this angle could be adjusted. Because it was lower than head height, the result was an especially ergonomic terminal. The [[LK201]] keyboard supplied with the VT220 was one of the first full length low profile keyboards available; it was developed at DEC's [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], [[Massachusetts]] facility.

The '''VT240''' and '''VT241''' were variants of the VT220, both capable of displaying [[vector graphics]] using the [[ReGIS]] instruction set. The VT241 was equipped with a color screen. The successor of the VT220 was the [[VT320]], itself followed by the [[VT420]].

[[Image:VT220 Irssi.jpg|thumb|DEC VT220 connected to the [[serial port]] of a modern computer.]]

==Software==
The VT220 was designed to be compatible with the [[VT100]], but added features to make it more suitable for an international market.  This was accomplished with the [[National Replacement Character Set]] feature (e.g., [[Multinational Character Set]]) and support for 8-bit downloadable character sets.

'''James Gaius Watt''' (born January 31, 1938) served as [[U.S. Secretary of the Interior]] from 1981 to 1983.  He was one of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s most controversial [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]] appointments.

==Early life and career==
Watt was born in [[Lusk, Wyoming]], the son of Lois Mae (née Williams) and William Gaius Watt.  He attended the [[University of Wyoming]], earning a [[bachelor's degree]] in 1960 and a [[juris doctor]] degree in 1962. Watt's first political job was as an aide to [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] Senator [[Milward L. Simpson]] of [[Wyoming]], whom he met through Simpson's son, [[Alan K. Simpson|Alan]].

A lifelong [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he served as secretary to the natural resources committee and environmental pollution advisory panel of the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]], a conservative organization that supports primarily Republican candidates.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/08/news/la-pn-chamber-ads-20101009 | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Matea | last1=Gold | first2=Kim | last2=Geiger | title=Republican-leaning U.S. Chamber of Commerce buys ads supporting Democrats | date=8 October 2010}}</ref> In 1969, Watt was appointed the deputy assistant secretary of water and power development at the [[Department of the Interior]]. In 1975, Watt was appointed vice chairman of the [[Federal Power Commission]]. In 1977, Watt became the first president and chief legal officer of [[Mountain States Legal Foundation]], a public interest law firm "dedicated to individual liberty, the right to own and use property, limited and ethical government and economic freedom."<ref>[http://www.mountainstateslegal.org/ Mountain States Legal Foundation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A number of attorneys who worked for Watt at the firm later became high-ranking officers of the federal government, including [[Ann Veneman]] and [[Gale Norton]].<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/research/james-g-watt-1938--american-former--enve-02/]</ref>

==Secretary of Interior==
In 1980, President-elect Reagan nominated Watt as his Secretary of the Interior. The [[United States Senate]] subsequently confirmed the nomination.

Watt's tenure as Secretary of the Interior was controversial, primarily because he was perceived as being hostile to [[environmentalism]], and endorsed development of federal lands by [[forestry|foresting]] and [[ranch]]ing, and for other commercial interests.

According to the [[Center for Biological Diversity]], Watt had the record, among those who served as Interior of Secretary, of listing the fewest number of [[species]] protected under the [[Endangered Species Act]]. The record was later surpassed by [[Dirk Kempthorne]], a [[George W. Bush]] appointee who, as of August 27, 2007, had not listed a single species in the 15-month period since his confirmation.<ref name=ewire>[http://www.ewire.com/display.cfm/Wire_ID/4171 Kempthorne Wins 2007 Rubber Dodo Award : Protects Fewer Species Than Any Interior Secretary in History]</ref>

[[Greg Wetstone]], the chief environment counsel at the [[House Energy and Commerce Committee]] during the [[Reagan administration]], who subsequently served as director of advocacy at the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], argued that Watt was one of the two most "intensely controversial and blatantly anti-environmental political appointees" in American history. The other was [[Anne Gorsuch]], director of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] at the time.<ref>[http://www.grist.org/news/muck/2004/06/10/griscom-reagan/ A look back at Reagan's environmental record | By Amanda Griscom | Grist | Muckraker | 10 Jun 2004<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Environmental groups accused Watt of reducing funding for environmental programs,<ref name="ee">[http://www.bookrags.com/James_G._Watt James G.

Watt resisted accepting donation of private land to be used for [[conservation ethic|conservation]].<ref name="time1983">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926267,00.html The Legacy of James Watt] ''Time'' Oct. 24, 1983</ref> He suggested that 80 million acres (320,000&nbsp;km²) of undeveloped land in the United States all be opened for drilling and mining by 2000.<ref name="time1983"/> The area leased to [[coal mining]] quintupled during his term as Secretary of the Interior.<ref name="time1983"/> Watt boasted that he leased "a billion acres" (4 million km²) of coastal waters, even though only a small portion of that area would ever be drilled.<ref name="time1983"/>  Watt once stated, "We will mine more, drill more, cut more timber."<ref>[http://www.mediatransparency.org/recipientprofile.php?recipientID=1082 Mountain States Legal Foundation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Watt periodically mentioned his [[Dispensationalism|Dispensationalist]] [[Christianity|Christian]] faith when discussing his method of environmental management. Speaking before Congress, he once said, "I do not know how many future generations we can count on before the [[Second Coming|Lord returns]], whatever it is we have to manage with a skill to leave the resources needed for future generations."

One apocryphal quote attributed to Watt is "After the last tree is felled, [[Christ]] will come back", although the statement has not been confirmed. Glenn Scherer, writing for [[Grist Magazine|Grist magazine]], erroneously attributed this remark to the 1981 testimony by Watt before Congress.<ref>{{cite web|

===Other controversies===
From 1980 through 1982, [[The Beach Boys]] and [[The Grass Roots]] separately performed at [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] concerts at the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], attracting large crowds.<ref>"July 4: Day of Music, Parades, Fireworks", ''The Washington Post'', Washington, D.C., July 3, 1982, p.

==Later life==
In 1995, Watt was indicted on 25 counts of felony [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]] by a federal [[grand jury]], accused of making false statements before the grand jury investigating [[influence peddling]] at the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]], which he had [[lobbyist|lobbied]] in the 1980s.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/5939345/crimes_against_nature/ Crimes Against Nature : Rolling Stone<!-- Bot generated title -->] ([http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/5939345/crimes_against_nature/3 p. 3])</ref> On January 2, 1996, Watt pleaded guilty to one count of [[misdemeanor]] of withholding documents from the grand jury. On March 12, 1996, he was sentenced to five years' [[probation]], and ordered to pay a fine of $5,000 and perform 500 hours of [[community service]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/US/Newsbriefs/9603/03-12/index.html | title=CNN – U.S. Briefs – March 12, 1996|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041029025129/http://www.cnn.com/US/Newsbriefs/9603/03-12/index.html|archivedate=October 29, 2004}}</ref>

In a 2001 interview, Watt applauded the energy policy of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], stating that its preference of oil drilling and coal mining to conservation was just what he recommended in the early 1980s.<ref name="denver">http://courses.washington.edu/alisonta/pbaf590/pdf/watt_applauds_energy.pdf</ref> "Everything [[Dick Cheney|Cheney]]'s saying, everything the president's saying – they're saying exactly what we were saying 20 years ago, precisely ... Twenty years later, it sounds like they've just dusted off the old work."<ref name="denver"/>

==Personal life==
Watt married Leilani Bomgardner on November 2, 1957. They had two children: (Erin Watt and Eric Watt).

In the fiction of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], '''Mardil Voronwë''' was the first Ruling [[Steward of Gondor]].

Mardil 'the Faithful' was born in [[Third Age|T.A.]] 1960. The position of Steward was already hereditary since the days of his grandfather [[Pelendur]] and Mardil inherited the title of Steward from his father [[Vorondil the Hunter]] in T.A. 2029. He was Steward during the last part of the reign of King [[Eärnil II]] and throughout the reign of [[Eärnur]], Eärnil's son.<ref>{{ME-ref|PoME|"The Heirs of Elendil"}}</ref>

Mardil had the difficult task of restraining Eärnur's urge to fight the [[Witch-king of Angmar]], the chief of the [[Ringwraith]]s, who accused Eärnur after the [[Battle of Fornost]] of being afraid to fight him.

The King of [[Minas Morgul]] (one of the titles of the Ringwraith) reminded Eärnur of this and challenged him at the start of his reign (T.A. 2043). Although Eärnur wanted to fight the King of Morgul he was restrained with difficulty by Mardil. But when the King of Morgul issued another challenge in 2050, Eärnur would not be restrained. He marched to Minas Morgul and was never seen again.

Eärnur had never married and had no children, so Mardil took it upon himself to rule [[Gondor]]. There was no one with a clear and unassailable claim to the throne, so the rule of the Stewards was a way of averting [[Kin-strife|civil war]]. Because the fate of the King was unknown, Mardil made an oath to rule until "the King returns". This oath would be sworn by all of the Ruling Stewards.

Mardil ruled Gondor with a steady hand and earned the nickname ''Voronwë'', which means "the Steadfast" in [[Quenya]].

It was soon learned that Eärnur had met certain death at Minas Morgul, and upon Mardil's death in T.A. 2080, his son [[Eradan]] succeeded him as the second Ruling Steward of Gondor.

'''Irish Recorded Music Association''' ('''IRMA''') is the Irish [[record industry]] association. IRMA is a non-profit association<ref>http://www.irma.ie/index2.htm</ref> set up to manage and control the music industry in Ireland.

==Goals and activities==
*On 12 June 2013, IRMA secured an Order of the High Court to block access to The Pirate Bay to all Irish internet users.<ref>http://torrentfreak.com/high-court-gives-irish-isps-30-days-to-block-the-pirate-bay-130612/</ref>
* IRMA  operates to promote and protect the welfare and interests of the Irish record industry. Specifically, IRMA is involved in lobbying to protect and enhance the interest of member companies and lobby to prevent illegal downloading of music content from local and international artists.<ref>http://www.independent.ie/business/technology/is-censorship-the-order-of-the-day-in-protecting-the-music-industry-1653919.html</ref>

*In the past IRMA have organised "The IRMA Honours," an awards ceremony which honours the life work of Ireland's leading musicians and people who have influenced the Irish music industry. Past recipients include [[Bob Geldof]],<ref>http://www.irma.ie/irma_honours.htm</ref> [[Larry Gogan]] and [[Christy Moore]].

*IRMA also compile and manage the official music charts for Ireland. These include: [[Irish Albums Chart|Top 100 Albums]], [[Irish Singles Chart|Top 100 Singles]], Top 10 Classical Albums, Top 10 Dance Singles, Top 20 Multi-Artist Compilation Albums, Top 30 Videos, Top 20 DVDs and Top 10 Music DVDS.

*On 12 April 2005, the association began to take legal action against "serial filesharers" in Ireland who illegally distribute music on the Internet. On 15 November 2005, the IRMA began "Phase II" of its plan to battle filesharing.

* Only Irish companies can become members of the IRMA. All members pay a yearly fee based on company size. Currently, the IRMA has 51 member companies.

*In the mid-1990s IRMA presented the IRMA Music Awards. These have been replaced by the annual music awards show [[Meteor Ireland Music Awards]].

== Filesharing controversy ==
{{see also|Internet censorship in Ireland}}
IRMA and [[Eircom]] reached an agreement over file sharing which uses a third-party organisation to monitor Eircom users for downloading of pirated music.<ref name="irish-times-feb-6-2009">[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2009/0206/1233796244239.html Specialists to police music downloads], John Collins, [[The Irish Times]], 6 February 2009. Retrieved 27 February 2009.</ref> The agreed system was reported to use a "three-strikes-and-you're-out" system.<ref name="irish-times-feb-6-2009"/> The agreement was criticised by [[Digital Rights Ireland]] and [[IrelandOffline]].<ref name="irish-times-feb-6-2009"/><ref name="silicon-republic-ireland-offline">[http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/article/12374/digital-life/lobby-group-calls-for-stop-to-censorship-plans Lobby group calls for stop to censorship plans], Marie Boran, Silicon Republic, 26 February 2009. Retrieved 27 February 2009.</ref>

The association sent solicitors' letters to several organisations, including [[Internet hosting service|hosting service]] Blacknight Solutions, whose MD, Michele Neylon, made the copy sent to his company publicly available on the company site.<ref name="blacknight-letter">[http://www.enn.ie/story/show/10125049 "IRMA warning letter goes public"], Ralph Averbuch, ENN.ie, 26 February 2009. Retrieved 27 February 2009.</ref> Although Blacknight Solutions isn't an ISP they still received the letter, which stated ''in the event of a positive response to this letter it is proposed to make practical arrangements with Blacknight of a like nature to those made with eircom''.<ref name="blacknight-letter"/><ref name="dri-filtering-and-strikes">[http://www.digitalrights.ie/2009/02/26/music-industry-pushing-for-internet-filtering-as-well-as-three-strikes-what-can-you-do-about-it/ "Music industry pushing for internet filtering as well as 'three strikes' – what can you do about it?"]</ref>

Protests against the actions of IRMA are being organised by Digital Rights Ireland, as well as Blackout Ireland.<ref name="dri-filtering-and-strikes"/>

== Board member companies==
The recording companies and other music-related companies that are on the IRMA board are:
*[[Warner Music Group|Warner Music Ireland]]
*[[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music Ireland]] (formerly Sony BMG Ireland)
*RMG Chart Entertainment
*Independent Records
*[[EMI|EMI Ireland]]

'''Modernisme''' ({{IPA-ca|muð?r?nizm?}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] for "modernism"), also known as '''[[Catalan people#Culture and society|Catalan]] modernism''', is the historiographic denomination given to an art and literature movement. Its main form of expression was in architecture, but many other arts were involved (painting, sculpture, etc.), and especially the design and the decorative arts (cabinetmaking, carpentry, forged iron, ceramic tiles, ceramics, glass-making, silver and goldsmith work, etc.), which were particularly important, especially in their role as support to architecture. Modernisme was also a literary movement (poetry, fiction, drama). Although it was part of a general trend that emerged in [[Europe]] around the [[turn of the century|turn of the 20th century]], in [[Catalonia]] the style acquired its own unique personality. Its distinct name comes from its special relationship, primarily with [[Catalonia]] and [[Barcelona]], which were intensifying their local characteristics for socio-ideological reasons after the revival of Catalan culture and in the context of spectacular urban and industrial development. It is equivalent to a number of other [[fin de siècle]] art movements going by the names of [[Art Nouveau]] in [[France]] and [[Belgium]], [[Jugendstil]] in [[Germany]], [[Secession (art)|Sezession]] in [[Austria]], [[Liberty style]] in [[Italy]] and Modern or [[Glasgow Style]] in [[Scotland]], and was active from roughly 1888 (the [[Exposición Universal de Barcelona|First Barcelona World Fair]]) to 1911 (the death of [[Joan Maragall]], the most important ''Modernista'' poet). The ''Modernisme'' movement was centred in the city of [[Barcelona]], though it reached far beyond, and is best known for its architectural expression, especially in the work of [[Antoni Gaudí]], but was also significant in sculpture, poetry, theatre and painting. Notable painters include [[Santiago Rusiñol]], [[Ramon Casas]],<ref>Hughes, Robert (1993) 'Barcelona', London, ISBN 0-00-272167-8, p. 253.</ref> [[Isidre Nonell]], [[Hermen Anglada Camarasa]], Joaquim Mir, Eliseu Meifren, Lluïsa Vidal and Miquel Utrillo. Notable sculptors are [[Josep Llimona]], Eusebi Arnau and Miquel Blai.

[[Catalan nationalism]] was an important influence upon ''Modernista'' artists, who were receptive to the ideas of [[Valentí Almirall]] and [[Enric Prat de la Riba]] and wanted Catalan culture to be regarded as equal to that of other European countries. Such ideas can be seen in some of Rusiñol's plays against the Spanish army (most notably ''[[L'Hèroe]]''), in some authors close to [[anarchism]] ([[Jaume Brossa]] and [[Gabriel Alomar]], for example) or in the articles of [[federalism|federalist]] anti-[[monarchism|monarchic]] writers such as [[Miquel dels Sants Oliver]]. They also opposed the traditionalism and religiousness of the [[Renaixença]] Catalan Romantics, whom they ridiculed in plays such as [[Santiago Rusiñol]]'s ''[[Els Jocs Florals de Canprosa]]'' (roughly, "The Poetry Contest of Proseland"), a satire of the revived [[Jocs Florals]] and the political milieu which promoted them.

''Modernistes'' largely rejected bourgeois values, which they thought to be the opposite of art. Consequently, they adopted two stances: they either set themselves apart from society in a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] or culturalist attitude (Decadent and Parnassian poets, Symbolist playwrights, etc.) or they attempted to use art to change society (''Modernista'' architects and designers, playwrights inspired by [[Henrik Ibsen]], some of [[Joan Maragall|Maragall]]'s poetry, etc.)

==Architecture and the plastic arts==
The earliest example of ''Modernista'' [[architecture]] is the café Castell dels tres Dragons designed by [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] in the Parc de la Ciutadella for the [[Exposición Universal de Barcelona|1888 Universal Exhibition]]. It is a search for a particular style for Catalonia drawing on Medieval and Arab styles. Like the currents known in other countries as [[Art Nouveau]], Jugendstil, Stile Liberty, Modern Style or [[Sezessionstil]], ''Modernisme'' was closely related to the English [[Arts and Crafts movement]] movement and the [[Gothic revival]]. As well as combining a rich variety of historically-derived elements, it is characterized by the predominance of the curve over the straight line, by rich decoration and detail, by the frequent use of vegetal and other organic motifs, the taste for asymmetry, a refined aestheticism and dynamic shapes.<ref>Solà-Morales, I, (1992) 'Arquitectura Modernista, fi de segle a Barcelona', Barcelona, ISBN 84-252-1563-3.</ref>

[[Antoni Gaudí]] is the best-known architect of this movement. Other influential architects were [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] and [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]], and later [[Josep Maria Jujol]] and [[Enrique Nieto (architect)|Enrique Nieto]].<ref>Mackay, David, 'Modern architecture in Barcelona, 1854-1929', Barcelona, 1985. http://www.anglo-catalan.org/op/monographs/issue03.pdf</ref>

While Barcelona was the centre of ''Modernista'' construction, the Catalan industrial bourgeoisie built industrial buildings and summer residences - ''cases d'estiueig'' - in many Catalan towns, notably [[Terrassa]] and [[Reus]]. The textile factory which is now home to the Catalan national technical museum [[MNACTEC]] is an outstanding example.

==Literature==
In literature, ''Modernisme'' stood out the most in narrative. The ''nouvelles'' and novels of decadent writers such as [[Prudenci Bertrana]] (whose highly controversial ''[[Josafat (book)|Josafat]]'' involved a demented priest who ends up killing a prostitute), [[Caterina Albert]] (also known as Víctor Catala), author of bloody, expressionistic tales of rural violence, opposed to the idealisation of nature propugned by Catalan Romantics, or [[Raimon Casellas]] have been highly influential upon later Catalan narrative, essentially recovering a genre that had been lost due to political causes since the end of the Middle Ages. Those writers often, though not always, show influences from Russian literature of the 19th Century and also [[Gothic novel]]s. Still, works not influenced by those sources, such as [[Joaquim Ruyra]]'s slice-of-life tales of the North-Eastern Catalan coast are perhaps even more influential than that of the aforementioned authors, and Rusiñol's well-known ''[[L'Auca del Senyor Esteve]]'' (roughly "The Tale of Mr. Esteve"; an ''[[auca (cartoon)|auca]]'' is a type of illustrated [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]], similar to a one-sheet comic book) is an ironic critique of Catalan bourgeoisie more related to ironic, pre-Realist Catalan ''costumisme''.

In poetry, ''Modernisme'' closely follows Symbolist and Parnassian poetry, with poets frequently crossing the line between both tendencies or alternating between them. Another important strain of ''Modernista'' poetry is [[Joan Maragall]]'s "Paraula viva" (''Living word'') school, which advocated Nietzschean vitalism and spontaneous and imperfect writing over cold and thought-over poetry. Although poetry was very popular with the ''Modernistes'' and there were lots of poets involved in the movement, Maragall is the only ''Modernista'' poet who is still widely read today.

''Modernista'' theatre was also important, as it smashed the insubstantial regional plays that were popular in 19th century Catalonia. There were two main schools of ''Modernista'' theatre: social theatre, which intended to change society and denounce injustice—the worker stories of [[Ignasi Iglésias]], for example ''[[Els Vells]]'' ("The old ones"); the Ibsen-inspired works of [[Joan Puig i Ferreter]], most notably ''[[Aigües Encantades]]'' ("Enchanted Waters"); Rusiñol's antimilitaristic play ''[[L'Hèroe]]''—and symbolist theatre, which emphasised the distance between artists and the bourgeoisie—for example, Rusiñol's ''[[Cigales i Formigues]]'' ("Cicadas and Ants") or ''[[El Jardí Abandonat]]'' ("The Abandoned Garden").

==Linguistics==
''Modernista'' ideas impelled ''[[L'Avenç]]'' collaborator [[Pompeu Fabra]] to devise a new [[orthography]] for Catalan. However, only with the later rise of [[Noucentisme]] did his projects come to fruition and end the orthographic chaos which reigned at the time.

==The end of Modernisme==
By 1910, ''Modernisme'' had been accepted by the bourgeoisie and had pretty much turned into a fad. It was around this time that [[Noucentisme|Noucentista]] artists started to ridicule the rebel ideas of ''Modernisme'' and propelled a more bourgeois art and a more right-of-center version of Catalan Nationalism, which eventually rose to power with the victory of the [[Regionalist League|Lliga Regionalista]] in 1912. Until [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]'s dictatorship suppressed all substantial public use of Catalan, Noucentisme was immensely popular in Catalonia. However, ''Modernisme'' did have a revival of sorts during the [[Second Spanish Republic]], with ''[[avant-garde]]'' writers such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurist]] [[Joan-Salvat Papasseit]] earning comparisons to Joan Maragall, and the spirit of [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] such as [[Josep Vicent Foix]] or [[Salvador Dalí]] being clearly similar to the rebellion of the ''Modernistes'', what with Dalí proclaiming that Catalan Romanticist [[Àngel Guimerà]] was ''a putrefact pervert''. However, the ties between Catalan art from the 1930s and ''Modernisme'' are not that clear, as said artists were not consciously attempting to continue any tradition.

''Modernista'' architecture survived longer. The Spanish city of [[Melilla]] in Northern Africa experienced an economic boom at the turn of the 20th century, and its new bourgeoisie showed its riches by massively ordering ''Modernista'' buildings. The workshops established there by Catalan architect [[Enrique Nieto (architect)|Enrique Nieto]] continued producing decorations in this style even when it was out of fashion in Barcelona, which results in Melilla having, oddly enough, the second largest concentration of ''Modernista'' works after Barcelona.

== UNESCO World Heritage ==
Some of the works of Catalan Modernism have been listed by [[UNESCO]] as [[World Cultural Heritage]]:

== Architects ==
There were more than 100 architects who made buildings of the ''Modernista'' style, three of whom are particularly well known for their outstanding buildings: [[Antoni Gaudí]], [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] and [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]].

* [[Antoni Gaudí]], who went beyond mainstream ''Modernisme'', creating a personal style based on observation of the nature and exploitation of traditional Catalan construction traditions. He was using regulated geometric shapes as the [[hyperbolic paraboloid]], the hyperboloid, the helicoid and the conoide.<ref>http://noticias.arq.com.mx/Detalles/9955.html.</ref>
* [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] created a genuine alternative architecture. Along with [[Josep Vilaseca i Casanovas]] he worked towards a modern and international style. Domènech continued on from Viollet-le-Duc, his work characterized by a mix of constructive rationalism and ornaments inspired in the Hispano-Arab architecture as seen in the [[Palau de la Música Catalana]], in the [[Hospital de Sant Pau]] or in the [[Institut Pere Mata]] of Reus.<ref>http://www.arteespana.com/arquitecturamodernista.htm</ref> His Hotel Internacional at Passeig de Colom in Barcelona (demolished after the 1888 World Fair) was an early example of industrial building techniques.
* [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]] was a Catalan architect, politician and historian who was involved in many projects to retore older buildings. One of his most well-known buildings is his rebuilding of the [[Casa Amatller]] in [[Passeig de Gràcia]]. It has elements in both the Catalan tradition and others originating in the [[Netherlands]] or the [[Germany|German]] [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. [[Neo-Gothic]] is also apparent in his Codorniu Winery (Caves Codorniu, 1904). He built Casa Amatller and [[Casa Trinxet]].

=== Other architects ===
* [[Enric Sagnier i Villavecchia]], the great builder of buildings for the bourgeoisie to the [[Eixample|l'Eixample]].
* [[Josep Maria Jujol|Josep Maria Jujol i Gibert]], Gaudi's collaborator, creator of the fountain of the Plaça Espanya in Barcelona, and professor of the Escola Superior d'Arquitectura.
* [[Cèsar Martinell i Brunet]], author of nearly 40 [[Wine Cellar|winerie]]s (The Cathedrals of the Wine), and agricultural buildings.
* [[Josep Vilaseca i Casanovas]], author of the [[Arc de Triomf]] of Barcelona (gate entrance to the Exposition of 1888) and the Casa Pia Batlló of the Rambla Catalunya, Gran Via.
* [[Joan Rubió i Bellver]], pupil of Domènech i Montaner and disciple and assistant of Gaudí between 1893 and 1905 to the [[Sagrada Família]], to the [[Casa Batlló]] and the [[Parc Güell]]. He built the Casa Golferichs, the Casa Pomar and the building of the [[Escola del Treball de Barcelona|Escola Industrial]].

The '''Heinkel He 70''' was a [[Germany|German]] [[mail plane]] and fast [[passenger]] aircraft of the 1930s, that also saw use in auxiliary [[bomber]] and [[reconnaissance]] roles. It had a relatively brief commercial career before it was replaced by types which could carry more passengers. The He 70 was a leading design for its day, setting eight world speed records by the beginning of 1933.

==Design and development==
The Heinkel He 70 ''Blitz'' (lightning) was designed in the early 1930s to serve as a fast mailplane for ''[[Deutsche Luft Hansa]]''. The He 70 was developed in response to a [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]] request for a faster aircraft than the [[Lockheed Vega]] and [[Lockheed Model 9 Orion|Orion]] (as used by [[Swissair]]) for employment on short routes.

It was a low-wing [[monoplane]], with the main characteristics of its revolutionary design its [[elliptical wing]], which the Günther brothers had already used in the [[Bäumer Sausewind]] sports plane before they joined Heinkel, and its small, rounded [[Flight control surfaces|control surface]]s. In order to meet the demanding speed requirements, the design minimised drag, with countersunk [[flush rivet]]s giving a smooth surface finish and a retractable [[Landing gear|undercarriage]], a novel feature for a German aircraft. It was powered by a [[BMW VI]] V-12 engine, cooled by [[ethylene glycol]] rather than water, allowing a smaller [[Radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] and therefore reducing drag. The pilot and radio operator were seated in tandem, with a [[Aircraft cabin|cabin]] housing four passengers on two double seats facing each other.<ref name="smith&kayp233">Smith and Kay 1972, p.233.</ref>

The first prototype flew on 1 December 1932,<ref name="smith&kayp234">Smith and Kay 1972, p.234.</ref> and proved to have excellent performance, setting eight world records for speed over distance, and reaching a maximum speed of 377&nbsp;km/h (222&nbsp;mph).<ref name="donald civilp494">Donald 1999, p.494.</ref>

==Operational history==
Luft Hansa operated He 70s between 1934 and 1937 for fast flight service which connected [[Berlin]] with [[Frankfurt]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Cologne]], as well as on the Cologne/Hamburg route.

He 70s were flown abroad from [[Stuttgart]] to [[Seville]] between 1934 and 1936. The route was part of the South America mail service provided by Luft Hansa that continued via [[Banjul|Bathurst]], [[The Gambia]] to [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], [[Brazil]], using [[Junkers Ju 52|Junkers Ju 52/3m]] and [[Dornier Do J|Dornier Wal]] flying boats.<ref>{{cite web | title = Transatlantic | publisher = [[Flight International|Flight]] | pages = 1349–1350 | date = 1934-12-10 | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/1934.html | accessdate = 2011-05-18}}</ref>

Remaining aircraft were transferred to the ''Luftwaffe'' in 1937.

===Military use===

Twenty-eight aircraft were sent with the ''[[Condor Legion|Legion Condor]]'', where they were used during the [[Spanish Civil War]] as fast [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] aircraft. Their high speed gave them the nickname ''Rayo'' (lightning).

The He 70K (later He 170), a fast reconnaissance airplane variant was used by the [[Hungarian Air Force|Royal Hungarian Air Force]] in early World War II during 1941-42.
The ''Luftwaffe'' operated He 70s from 1935, initially as a [[light bomber]] and reconnaissance aircraft. As soon as purpose build designs became available, it was relegated as a liaison and courier aircraft.

The main weakness of the He 70 in military use was that crews considered it a fire risk. Elements of the airframe were made out of so-called "[[Elektron (alloy)]]", though the majority of the monocoque fuselage was Duralumin. Elektron is a very light, yet strong, alloy of [[magnesium]], which burns readily when ignited, and is difficult to extinguish. Moreover, the wings contained a 47-gallon fuel tank apiece, which may have further added to the aircraft's reputation for being flammable. A single hit from a light [[machine gun]] is reputed to have usually set the entire plane ablaze. The Hungarian He 170A (a military version derived from the He-70 with a new WM-K-14 radial engine), fleet was retired for this and other reasons, including poor defensive armament, short range and poor view from the cabin, and replaced with vintage, high-wing [[Heinkel He 46|He 46]] monoplanes, until modern Bf 109 fighter-recce and specialized Fw 189 "Uhu" medium altitude observation aircraft could be introduced.

==Influence==
{{Synthesis|section|date=October 2014}}
While the He 70 saw only limited service in training capacities during World War II, it was the ''[[Luftwaffe]]''{{'}}s first ''[[Schnellbomber]]'' and served as the antecedent for the majority of bombers involved in both the [[Battle of Britain]] and the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

===Influence on German designs===

The He 70 is known mainly as the direct ancestor of the [[Heinkel He 111]] which used its distinctive oval wings and streamlined [[fuselage]] in a twin-engine configuration. One can also see the close similarity of the designs in the tail section and cockpit of the early He 111. The He 111, which began service with the ''Luftwaffe'' in 1936, went on to become the most numerous bomber type of the Luftwaffe - with just over 5,600 examples produced during the war in total<ref>{{cite book |last=Regnat |first=Karl-Heinz |authorlink= |title=Black Cross Volume 4: Heinkel He 111 |url= |accessdate= |year=2004 |publisher=Midland Publishers |location=Hersham, Surrey, UK |isbn=978-1-85780-184-2 |page=74 |pages=}}</ref> - in the early years of [[World War II]], before the growing numbers of [[Junkers Ju 88]] bomber variants (the -A and -S subtypes) overtook it later in World War II.

Heinkel's pioneering design was also a model for the [[Heinkel He 112|He 112]] fighter which competed unsuccessfully against the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] to become the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s first monoplane fighter.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The He 112 was nonetheless built in small numbers and its performance proved once again the strength of the He 70's original design. The fighter was basically a scaled down version of the He 70 and shared its all-metal construction and inverted gull-wings.

===Influence on Japanese designs===

The He 70 was exported to Japan for study and inspired the [[Aichi D3A]] ("Val") carrier-launched light bomber.<ref>Mark Peattie, "Sunburst: The Rise of Japanese Naval Air Power, 1909-1941", pg. 94</ref> This plane too shared the He 70's distinctive low-mounted oval wings and was only one of several collaborations between Heinkel and the Japanese aviation industry.

===Influence on British designs===

It has been said that the He 70 was an inspiration or influence for the [[Supermarine Spitfire]]'s elliptical wing planform, although this seems unlikely.  The He 70 used as an engine test bed by Rolls Royce did not arrive in the UK until three weeks after the Spitfire's first flight.

Part of a letter that R J Mitchell wrote to Heinkel after seeing the aircraft perform with the Rolls Royce Kestrel engine fitted: <blockquote>
"We, at Supermarine Aviation, were particularly impressed, since we have been unable to achieve such smooth lines in the aircraft that we entered for the [[Schneider Trophy]] Races....
In addition to this, we recently investigated the effect that installing certain new British fighter engines would have on the He 70, We were dismayed to find that your new aircraft, despite its larger measurements, is appreciably faster than our fighters. It is indeed a triumph."
</blockquote>

However, Beverly Shenstone, RJ Mitchell's aerodynamic advisor refuted the idea that the Spitfire wing was copied from the He 70. In Alfred Price's 'Spitfire - A Documentary History' Shenstone is quoted as saying:

<blockquote>It has been suggested that we at Supermarine had cribbed the wing shape from that of the He 70 transport. This was not so. The elliptical wing had been used on other aircraft and its advantages were well known. Our wing was much thinner than that of the Heinkel and had a quite different section. In any case it would have been simply asking for trouble to have copied a wing shape from an aircraft designed for an entirely different purpose.<ref name="document p33–34">Price 1977, pp. 33—34.</ref></blockquote>

Shenstone said that the He 70's influence on the Spitfire design was limited to use as a criterion for aerodynamic smoothness which is to some extent verified by the extract of the letter from Mitchell to Heinkel quoted above.

The '''Trinovantes''' or '''Trinobantes''' were one of the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[tribe]]s of pre-[[Roman Britain]].  Their territory was on the north side of the [[Thames]] [[estuary]] in current [[Essex, England|Essex]] and [[Suffolk]], and included lands now located in [[Greater London]].  They were bordered to the north by the [[Iceni]], and to the west by the [[Catuvellauni]].  Their name derives from the Celtic intensive prefix "tri-" and "novio" - new, so meaning "very new" in the sense of "newcomers", but possibly with an applied sense of vigorous or lively - so the name could mean "the very vigorous people". Their capital was [[Camulodunum]] (modern [[Colchester]]), one proposed site of the legendary [[Camelot]].

Shortly before [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Roman invasion of Britain|invasion of Britain]] in 55 and 54 BC, the Trinovantes were considered the most powerful tribe in Britain. At this time their capital was probably at [[Braughing]] (in modern-day [[Hertfordshire]]). In some manuscripts of Caesar's ''[[Gallic War]]'' their king is referred to as [[Imanuentius]], although in other manuscripts no name is given. Some time before Caesar's second expedition this king was overthrown by [[Cassivellaunus]], who is usually assumed to have belonged to the [[Catuvellauni]]. His son, [[Mandubracius]], fled to the protection of Caesar in [[Gaul]]. During his second expedition Caesar defeated Cassivellaunus and restored Mandubracius to the kingship, and Cassivellaunus undertook not to molest him again. [[Tribute]] was also agreed.

[[File:Trinovantes 2.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of the Trinovantes.]]
The next identifiable king of the Trinovantes, known from [[numismatic]] evidence, was [[Addedomarus]], who took power c. 20-15 BC, and moved the tribe's capital to Camulodunum. For a brief period c. 10 BC [[Tasciovanus]] of the Catuvellauni issued coins from Camulodunum, suggesting that he conquered the Trinovantes, but he was soon forced to withdraw, perhaps as a result of pressure from the Romans, as his later coins no longer bear the mark "''Rex''", and Addedomarus was restored.  Addedomarus was briefly succeeded by his son [[Dubnovellaunus]] c. 10&ndash;5 BC, but a few years later the tribe was finally conquered by either Tasciovanus or his son [[Cunobelinus]]. Mandubracius, Addedomarus and Dubnovellaunus all appear in later, post-Roman and medieval British Celtic genealogies and legends as Manawydan, Aedd Mawr (Addedo the Great) and Dyfnwal Moelmut (Dubnovellaunus the Bald and Silent). The [[Welsh Triads]] recall Aedd Mawr as one of the founders of Britain.

[[File:Trinovantes 1.jpg|thumb|Coin of the Trinovantes.]]
The Trinovantes reappeared in history when they participated in [[Boudica]]'s revolt against the [[Roman Empire]] in 60 AD. Their name was given to one of the ''civitates'' of [[Roman Britain]], whose chief town was Caesaromagus (modern [[Chelmsford]], Essex). The style of their rich burials (see [[facies]] of [[Aylesford]]) is of continental origin and evidence of their affiliation to the [[Belgae|Belgic]] people. 
Their name was re-used as ''Trinovantum'', the supposed original name of [[London]], by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his fictitious ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', in which he claimed the name derived from ''Troi-novantum'' or "New [[Troy]]", connecting this with the legend that Britain was founded by [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]] and other refugees from the [[Trojan War]].

==Popular culture==
In [[Chelmsford 123]], a British television [[situation comedy]] produced for [[Channel 4]] by [[Hat Trick Productions]], the main character of Badvoc (played by [[Rory McGrath]]) was the leader of The Trinovantes.

'''Lamlash''' ({{lang-gd|An t-Eilean Àrd}}) is the largest village by population on the [[Isle of Arran]], in the [[Firth of Clyde]], [[Scotland]]. It lies 4 miles to the south of ferry port [[Brodick]], in a sheltered bay on the island's east coast, facing [[Holy Isle, Firth of Clyde|Holy Isle]]. Lamlash is the seat of Arran's local government offices and police. The only secondary school and only hospital in Arran are also located in Lamlash.

== History ==

A [[prehistoric]] ring of stones indicates that an ancient settlement has existed near Lamlash since antiquity.<ref name="Auto0E-6"/> The name ''Lamlash'' dates back to the 6th Century hermitage of [[Molaise of Leighlin|Saint Molaise]] a Celtic [[monk]] born in [[Ireland]] but raised in [[Scotland]], who in c.590 spent some time in a cave on the neighbouring [[Holy Isle, Firth of Clyde|Holy Island]]. Commonly known as ''MoLaise'' the Gaelic name of Holy Island was, as a result, ''Eilean MoLaise''. This gradually evolved through ''Elmolaise'' and ''Lemolash'' to Lamlash, which is what Holy Island was called until early in the 19th century. After that time the name was more normally attached to the village that grew up facing it.<ref name="undiscovered" />

Lamlash was peripherally involved in the 13th century [[Battle of Largs]]. It was the birthplace of artist [[James Kay (artist)|James Kay]].<ref name="Fullarton"/>

The village was also the training place for [[No. 11 (Scottish) Commando]] during the early years of the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref name="Auto0E-7"/>

== Location ==

Lamlash is located in the southern half of the island, some three miles to the south of [[Brodick]] and five miles to the north of [[Whiting Bay]]. It is on the eastern side and sits on a bay facing the [[Holy Isle, Firth of Clyde|Holy Isle]] and the [[Firth of Clyde]].

== Layout and notable sights ==
[[File:Scotland, Isle of Arran, Lamlash, the seafront .JPG|thumb|left|240px|"An elongated settlement character"]]

The basic character of the village is formed by a long building line of two and three storey roughcast or stone houses lining the inland side of the shore road. The parish church and the former St George's church sit at either end of this series of buildings. Only the scattered buildings around the pierhead break this pattern. This elongated settlement character was already well established in the 19th century. The creation of Hamilton Terrace and its shorefront public space added to the image of Lamlash as it looks today.
Lamlash has several characteristic buildings, some of them listed for their special architectural or historical interest. These include:

Hamilton Terrace consists of two rows of idyllic single storey-and-attic cottages of which numbers 1-27 are on the Lamlash seafront, arranged in pairs. Numbers 1a-24a are positioned behind these and are probably coeval with numbers 1-27 and assumed to have been built for residents' summer occupation allowing the main houses to be let to visitors, an accepted practice in Arran. The terrace is a major architectural feature of the village, designed by Sir John James Burnet and constructed in the late 19th century. The houses have survived with a minimum of changes, even to their rear elevation. Some still have original glazing. One of the houses functions as the Lamlash Post Office at no 27. On the front side (seaside) the complex had two rectangular garden enclosures; one of these is currently a car park. On the lawn between the enclosures is a modern monument in remembrance of the Arran clearance emigrants in the form of 3 standing stones.<ref name="Auto0E-8"/>

[[File:Scotland, Isle of Arran, Lamlash, St. Georges church (1).JPG|thumb|177px|St. George's church]]

St George's United free Church stands on the northern end of Lamlash, on Bungalow Road in the Margnaheglish neighborhood. The church was erected between 1885-1892 in early English style by the Duke of Hamilton to replace a church of 1774. It is built in cream-colored sandstone and has a striking square stone pyramidal spire with an iron weathervane.<ref name="Auto0E-9"/> The church was used by the Lamlash Free Church congregation from 1892 until the union of the Free and United Presbyterian Churches in 1900, when it became the United Free Church. From 1929 it formed one of the congregations of Lamlash Parish church at that year's union with the Church of Scotland. The church was in use until 1947 and stands empty since. Its future is uncertain. It is currently (2010) in a state of decay; the masonry is damp in places where the rainwater goods have failed and an array of vegetation including large tree saplings are growing from the masonry joints, also at higher elevations. The boundaries are also overgrown. The windows are boarded up. The lawn in front has turned into an unkept weed field that together with the sign on the front porch "Private Keep Out" blights this part of Lamlash's seafront. The Arran Theatre and Arts Trust, established in 1989 had as its main objective to convert St George's Church into a theatre. As part of that objective, the Trust ran many events and brought touring companies to Arran, but because of "wider political issues" the plan never materialized.<ref name="Auto0E-10"/> Similarly, plans to turn it into an Childhood Heritage Museum also failed in 1999.<ref name="Auto0E-11"/> In the meantime the Scottish Civic Trust added the church to the register of "Buildings at Risk" in 1993.<ref name="buildingsatrisk.org.uk"/> A chance to save the building arose in October 2004 when CRGP Architects & Surveyors from Glasgow applied for permission for the conversion of the church to form 8 flats and the erection of an extension to the rear to form 6 flats with associated parking. The application was granted on 7 Feb. 2005 by the North Ayrshire Council, subject to a number of conditions.<ref name="Auto0E-12"/> However, the development was not realized. Then, in February 2007 the North Ayrshire Council commissioned ARP Lorimer and Associates (ARPL) to carry out a townscape audit for the Lamlash seafront with the specific assignment (i.a.) to evaluate the potential for the Church.<ref name="north-ayrshire.gov.uk"/> In its report ARPL considers the state of the church poor but saveable. It recommends that -as a category B listed building- the retention of this historic structure is of importance. ARPL suggests to convert the church into three apartments and to build some new development to the rear to make it financially viable (just as CRGP Architects had requested 3 years earlier), and advises the Council to encourage the owner to progress the development to ensure the building does not decline to the point where demolition is required.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Again, nothing happened and as of summer 2010 the building still stands neglected. Minutes of the Arran Community Council show that the future of the church is a regular topic of debate, but difficulty in contacting the private owner or convincing him to cooperate seem to be (part of) the reason that there has been no progress to date.<ref name="Auto0E-13"/>

The church's former manse (next door) is also a category B listed building. It was built in 1898 and remained in use as manse for the united congregation until circa 1990.<ref name="Auto0E-14"/>

Lamlash Community Centre on Benlister Road is a large former military hall from 1914. The hall (rectangular, single storey, corrugated-iron) was built by the Admiralty in 1914 as accommodation for the fleet arriving at Lamlash. It was supplied in prefabricated form, assembled on site quickly and cheaply. It comprised a canteen, reading rooms, offices, lavatories, a stage and gymnasium. Tents were erected in the surrounding playing fields for the soldiers. In 1917 the hall was converted for use as a hospital for recovering soldiers. The hall was given to the village of Lamlash after World War I on the condition that it be used again when necessary for troops. This indeed happened during World War II when it was used as a troops' canteen.<ref name="Auto0E-15"/> Lamlash community centre was demolished in 2010 or 2011 following the opening of community facilities in the new Arran High School nearby,

Lamlash and Kilbride Parish Church and the church hall. It is a T-plan, aisleless, Gothic-style church built in 1886 by [[Hugh Barclay (architect)]] in red sandstone with a massive campanile-like tower. The church is prominently situated on the Shore Road and is listed in category A in consideration of the prominent tower. It replaces an earlier plain building of 1773, itself replacing the earlier Kilbride church, the remains of which survive at the present Lamlash graveyard. The cross and baptismal font in the church were both unearthed in the graveyard of the old Kilbride Church in 1892, and are thought to be of 14th-century origin. In the tower is a 9-bell carillon. The church hall -a separate, adjacent building- was built and used for worship some years before the church itself (around 1880), and included a reading room and library. It is a single storey, rectangular-plan hall, made into a T-plan by lower wings.<ref name="Auto0E-16"/>

[[File:Scotland, Isle of Arran, Lamlash, Villa the Lookout.JPG|thumb|left|Abandoned villa "The Lookout"]]

The Lookout is an early to mid 19th century classical villa with prominent corner pilasters and Tudor Jacobean details, located on the main road close to the shore. It has some later additions and unfortunate alterations to the facade. The current condition is poor and deteriorating. Roof flashings are missing and the rainwater goods are leaking. Windows are smashed and boarded up, making the building an eyesore rather than a monument to be admired. The interior too is likely to need significant renewal. The Lookout remains a building of local value and character though. Probably originally a villa, it possibly became a bank in the 1850s or 60s. The building was marked as 'Bank' on Ordnance Survey maps of 1868, 1897 and 1924. In October 2002, the North Ayrshire Council turned down an application by John Thomson Construction Limited (from Lamlash) to have the building demolished. It was argued that demolition would be contrary to national policy and to the Isle of Arran Local Plan as it would have an adverse impact on the Lamlash Conservation Area. The Council also considered that it had not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the Lookout could not be restored and brought back into use as advised by Historic Scotland.<ref name="Auto0E-17"/> In 2004 the Scottish Civic Trust added the villa to the register of "Buildings at Risk".<ref name="buildingsatrisk.org.uk"/> Then, in February 2007 the North Ayrshire Council commissioned ARP Lorimer and Associates (ARPL) to carry out a townscape audit for the Lamlash seafront with the specific assignment (i.a.) to evaluate the potential for the "Lookout".<ref name="north-ayrshire.gov.uk"/> In its report ARPL suggested a residential conversion into four flats as the most economically viable option to save the building. But there was no follow-up and in September 2009 an inspection revealed that the condition of the building had further deteriorated. Several of the windows have missing or broken glazing and the building was neither wind nor watertight. This was still the case as of summer 2010. The Lookout was demolished in March 2012.<ref name="buildingsatrisk.org.uk"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="Auto0E-18"/>

Some of the smaller listed buildings in Lamlash are:

Glenkiln, a mid-19th-century farmhouse and includes two adjoining cottages from the early 19th century.<ref name="Auto0E-19"/> It is one of the two remaining farms in Lamlash (of the 7 there once were), the other one being the Clauchlands Farm.

Monamore Bridge Millhouse, an early 19th-century single storey former mill house in L-form.<ref name="Auto0E-20"/>

Whitehouse Lodge, a late 19th-century lodge, formerly belonging to the (demolished) White House mansion. The lodge is single storey-and-attic with a basically rectangular-plan. The site of the former White House itself is now designated for development.<ref name="Auto0E-21"/>

Bellhaven, a single storey and attic 3-bay cottage from 1808 next to the Parish Church.<ref name="Auto0E-22"/>

Other notable buildings are the former pier house with clock tower (1885); the 'Crafts Made in Arran' Shop (late 19th century); the early 19th century Pier of red rubble blocks; the Sea Gate, part of the former Steamer Pier Office (1902) and the Bay Hotel, the latter being a good example of an early [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] villa.

[[File:Scotland, Isle of Arran, Lamlash, Hamilton Terrace.JPG|thumb|left|"Hamilton Terrace" and the Clearances Monument]]

The [[Clearances]] (Scottish Gaelic: Fuadach nan Gàidheal, the expulsion of the Gael) is a period in the 18th and 19th centuries where large forced displacements of the rural population in Scotland took place as part of a process of agricultural change. The clearances led to mass emigration to the sea coast, the Scottish Lowlands and the North American colonies. In general the Clearances on Arran seem to have been less brutal than in many other places in Scotland, but when the [[Croft (land)|crofters]] in Glen [[Sannox]] had to make way for large scale sheep farming, many of them saw no other option than to emigrate, and they departed from Lamlash. For this reason Arran's Clearance Monument is situated in Lamlash, in front of Hamilton Terrace. A plaque on the monument recalls their departure and their new life as settlers in Canada with the following words: ''Erected on behalf of Arran clearance descendents across North America to their brave forefathers who departed from their beloved island home to Canada during the clearance years 1829 to 1840. Here at Lamlash on April 25th 1829 part of the clearance (86 souls) when embarking on the brig Caledonia (196 ton) the Rev.A.Mackay preached from The Mound (opposite) formed by the departing his text "Casting all your care upon him: for he careth for you" 1st Peter ch.5 v.7. The Caledonia arrived at Quebec City June 25th 1829. The group was the first of more than 300 Arran colonists of Megantic County, Province of Quebec. The largest group, more than 400, had as their destination the seaport town of Dalhousie, New Brunswick to be pioneer settlers of the Restigouche-Bay Chaleur District. "Yet still the blood is strong, the heart is highland". A chlann eilean mo ghaoil bithibh dileas d'a cheile.''

The monument was erected at the initiative of the Canadian descendants of the Arran emigrants.

== Employment ==

In common with the rest of the island the village's main industry is [[tourism]]. In Lamlash the public sector is also an important employer. Fisheries is no longer important; although the [[Firth of Clyde|Clyde]] was once the finest fishery in Europe it is now all but gone. There are strictly speaking no fish left in the Clyde for commercial capture and the few fishermen left are reduced to scraping the seabed for [[scallop]]s and prawns.<ref name="Auto0E-32"/>

== Harbour and lifeboat ==
[[File:Holy Isle from Lamlash.jpg|thumb|[[Holy Isle, Firth of Clyde|Holy Isle]] from Lamlash]]

According to Glasgow's Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, Lamlash Bay is a good natural harbour offering very good shelter.<ref name="Auto0E-24"/> It has accommodated the [[Royal Navy]] [[Home Fleet]] and [[British Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]].{{citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Lamlash has an [[RNLI]] Lifeboat station with a B class [[Atlantic 75 class lifeboat|Atlantic 75]] lifeboat,<ref name="Auto0E-25"/> covering the inshore waters around the coast of Arran.
In summer, there is a regular ferry service from Lamlash harbour to [[Holy Isle, Firth of Clyde|Holy Isle]].

== Lamlash Bay Community Marine Protected Area ==

On 20 September 2008 the so-called "Inshore Fishing Order 2008" entered into effect, prohibiting commercial and recreational fishing in the northern portion of Lamlash Bay, between Holy island and the Margnaheglish neighborhood of Lamlash. This No Take Zone (NTZ) aims to protect [[Maerl]] seaweed beds and the regeneration of all marine life. It is hoped this NTZ will benefit the Lamlash economy by attracting scuba divers and by providing bigger and better catches for fishermen in the neighbouring overspill area. The prohibition area is defined as follows: from Mount Pleasant Farm (55 degrees 32.603 minutes North, 005 degrees 06.512 minutes West) in a straight line in a south to south easterly direction to Holy Isle West (55 degrees 31.556 minutes North, 005 degrees 05.216 minutes West) thence in an easterly direction around the northern end of Holy Island by the mean high water mark of ordinary spring tides to Holy Isle East (55 degrees 31.876 minutes North, 005 degrees 04.304 minutes West); thence by a straight line in a north to north westerly direction to Hamilton Rock (55 degrees 33.000 minutes North, 005 degrees 04.823 minutes West); thence in a west to north westerly direction by a straight line to Clauchlands Point (55 degrees 33.002 minutes North, 005 degrees 04.957 minutes West); and thence in a west to south westerly direction by the mean high water mark of ordinary spring tides to Mount Pleasant Farm. The area includes both the sea and the seabed.<ref name="Auto0E-26"/>

This NTZ is the first one in Scotland. It is also the first time that statutory protection has been given to a marine area as a result of proposals being developed at a grassroots level; in this case after a long campaign by the [[Community of Arran Seabed Trust|Community of Arran Seabed Trust (C.O.A.S.T.)]],<ref name="Auto0E-27"/> which represents 1600 islanders who wanted fishing banned to regenerate the seabed.<ref name="Auto0E-28"/> Violation of the fishing ban can lead to an unlimited fine upon conviction on indictment.<ref name="Auto0E-29"/> The whole remainder of Lamlash Bay is to become a Fisheries Management Area, focusing primarily on [[scallop]]s.<ref name="Auto0E-30"/> Press reports from the time that the NTZ was established show optimism that the creation of the Fisheries Management Area would soon follow. According to C.O.A.S.T. this was even a promise by the Scottish Government. But as of May 2010 it had still not happened. Also, the NTZ is still not marked. There is not one interpretation board to alert anglers. All this has led the Community of Arran Seabed Trust to call into question the government's commitment to the overall project.<ref name="Auto0E-32"/><ref name="Auto0E-31"/>

The NTZ and the Fisheries Management Area would jointly have been known as the "Lamlash Bay Community Marine Protected Area".

The '''yellow-throated day gecko''' (''Phelsuma flavigularis'') is a [[diurnality|diurnal]] [[species]] of [[gecko]]s from eastern [[Madagascar]]. It typically inhabits rainforests and dwells on trees. The Yellow-throated day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

== Description ==
This lizard belongs to the medium-sized day geckos. Males can reach a total length of about 15&nbsp;cm while females are often much smaller. The body colour is dark green or bluish green. On the snout there are two red transversal bars. One to three rust-coloured stripes may be present on the neck. On the back there are small brownish or reddish dots and spottings. The throat is light yellow and the ventral side is beige. ''P. flavigularis'' has blue eye rings.

== Distribution ==
This species has a limited distribution. It is only known from the area around Andasibe on the east coast of [[Madagascar]], about 100&nbsp;km east of [[Antananarivo]].

== Habitat ==
''P. flavigularis'' is found on banana trees and palms. Its original habitat are rainforests. The east coast of Madagascar has a humid and warm climate.

[[Image:P. flavigularis throat.jpg|thumb|throat of species]]

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit; pollen; and nectar. 

== Behaviour ==
Like most ''Phelsuma spec.'', this species can be quite quarrelsome and do not accept other males in their neighbourhood. In captivity, where the females cannot escape, the males can also sometimes seriously wound a female during courtship. In this case, the male and female must be separated immediately.

== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be between 25 and 28°C. The humidity should be maintained between 75 and 100%. In captivity, these animals can be fed with [[cricket (insect)|crickets]],  [[pyralidae|wax moths]], fruit flies, [[mealworm]]s, and [[housefly|houseflies]].

A '''polyphyletic''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for "of many races") group is characterized by one or more [[Convergent evolution | homoplasies]]: character states which have converged or reverted so as to appear to be the same but which have not been inherited from common ancestors.

For example, the group consisting of [[warm-blooded]] animals is polyphyletic because it contains both [[mammals]] and [[birds]], but the most recent common ancestor of mammals and birds was cold-blooded{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}. Warm-bloodedness evolved separately in the ancestors of mammals and the ancestors of birds{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}. Other examples of polyphyletic groups are [[protozoan]]s and [[algae]].

Many biologists aim to avoid homoplasies in grouping [[species]] together and therefore it is frequently a goal to eliminate groups that are found to be polyphyletic. This is often the stimulus for major revisions of the classification schemes.

Researchers concerned more with ecology than with systematics may take polyphyletic groups as legitimate subject matter;  the similarities in activity within the fungus group ''[[Alternaria]]'', for example, can lead researchers to regard the group as a valid [[genus]] while acknowledging its polyphyly.<ref>{{cite journal |first1= Erik T. |last1=Aschehoug|first2= Kerry L. |last2=Metlen| first3= Ragan M. |last3=Callaway| first4=George |last4=Newcombe |year=2012 |title=Fungal endophytes directly increase the competitive effects of an invasive forb |journal=Ecology |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=3–8 |url=http://plantecology.dbs.umt.edu/plantecology/People/documents/Aschehougetal.2012ENDOPHYTEINVASIONCOMPETITION.pdf |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |doi=10.1890/11-1347.1}}</ref>

== Polyphyly is often avoided ==

{{See also|Phylogenetic nomenclature#Philosophy}}

In many schools of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], the existence of polyphyletic groups in a classification is discouraged. [[Monophyletic]] groups (that is, [[clades]]) are considered by these schools of thought to be the most important grouping of [[organism]]s.

One reason for this view is that some clades are simple to define in purely [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] terms without reference to clades previously introduced: a [[Phylogenetic nomenclature#Phylogenetic definitions of clade names|node-based clade definition]], for example, could be "All descendants of the last common ancestor of species X and Y". On the other hand, polyphyletic groups can often be delimited in terms of clades, for example "the flying vertebrates consist of the bat, bird, and pterosaur clades". Because polyphyletic  groups can frequently be defined as a sum of clades, some consider them less fundamental than monophyletic (single, whole) clades.

A stronger reason is that grouping species monophyletically facilitates prediction far more than does polyphyletic grouping. For example, classifying a newly discovered grass in the monophyletic family [[Poaceae]], the true grasses, immediately results in numerous predictions about its structure and its developmental and reproductive characteristics, inherited from the common ancestor of this family. In contrast, Linnaeus' assignment of plants with two [[stamen]]s to the polyphyletic class Diandria turns out to be useless for prediction, since the presence of exactly two stamens has developed convergently in many groups.<ref>{{cite journal |first =Clive A.|last=Stace|year=2010 |title=Classification by molecules: What’s in it for field botanists? |journal=Watsonia |volume=28 |pages=103–122  |url=http://www.archive.bsbi.org.uk/Wats28p103.pdf |accessdate=July 31, 2013}}</ref> Predictive success is the touchstone by which theories are evaluated in all experimental sciences.

A '''sore throat''' (or '''throat pain''') is pain or irritation of the [[throat]]. A common physical [[symptom]], it is usually caused by acute [[pharyngitis]] ([[inflammation]] of the throat), although it can also appear as a result of [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[diphtheria]], or other conditions. A sore throat may cause mild to extreme pain.

==Definition==
A sore throat is pain anywhere in the throat.<ref name=Rosen2010>{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition |last=Marx |first=John |authorlink= |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |page=Chapter 30 |url= }}</ref>

==Differential diagnosis==
A sore throat is usually from irritation or inflammation. The most common cause (80%) is [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] [[Virus|viral]] pharyngitis, a viral [[infection]] of the throat.<ref name=Rosen2010/>  Other causes include other infections (such as [[streptococcal pharyngitis]]), trauma, and [[tumor]]s.<ref name=Rosen2010/> [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|Gastroesophageal (acid) reflux disease]] can cause [[stomach acid]] to back up into the throat and also cause the throat to become sore.<ref>http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/tc/sore-throat-topic-overview</ref> In children streptococcal pharyngitis is the cause of 37% of sore throats.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shaikh N, Leonard E, Martin JM |title=Prevalence of streptococcal pharyngitis and streptococcal carriage in children: a meta-analysis |journal=Pediatrics |volume=126 |issue=3 |pages=e557–64 |date=September 2010 |pmid=20696723 |doi=10.1542/peds.2009-2648 |url=}}</ref>

The '''Quickshot Trackball''' is an unlicensed controller designed for a number of gaming consoles, including the [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari computer line]], the [[Sega Master System]] and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The joystick is often confused with a [[trackball]] due to the similar shape, however its design is not a complete sphere, but a large dome attached to a switching mechanism that slides forward, backward, left, and right. The Quickshot can be changed from right to left hand use via a slider switch on the side of the unit.

The '''NES Lockout''' was a [[combination lock]] device made by SafeCare Products, Inc. and [[Master Lock]] that featured a "Self-Setting" combination that attached to the open bay of a front-loading [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] via a hole under the control deck directly below the chamber lid which enabled the lock to grab the console like a [[vise]] to prevent removal. The device was intended to allow parents to keep children from playing an NES when they weren't supposed to.

The '''''Miracle Piano Teaching System''''' is a [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] keyboard/[[non-game|teaching tool]] created in 1990<ref name="innovation_avoiding_trap">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9cqmVLoQRvwC&lpg=PA197&dq=&pg=PA197#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=197 |title=Innovation and Marketing in the Video Game Industry: Avoiding the Performance Trap |last1=Barczak |first1=Gloria |last2=Wesley |first2=David |year=2012 |publisher=[[Gower Publishing|Gower Publishing, Ltd.]] (retrieved via Google Books) |accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref> by [[The Software Toolworks]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], [[Apple Macintosh]], [[Commodore Amiga|Amiga]], [[Sega Genesis]] and [[personal computer|PC]].

==Description==
The Miracle system consisted of a keyboard, connecting cables, power supply, soft foot pedals, and software either on 3.5" floppies or standard, licensed NES/SNES/Genesis cartridges.  After the supplied MIDI keyboard was connected to a [[Video game console|console]] or computer and the included software was loaded, a user followed the on-screen notes.  Its marketed value was as a tool to teach kids and to play the [[piano]].  It provided hundreds of lessons,<ref name="pc_mag_patient_teacher">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hqQJaNzN9IcC&lpg=PA618&dq=&pg=PA618#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] (retrieved via Google Books) |author=Kendall, Robert |title=Miracle System Turns Your PC Into a Patient Piano Teacher |date=1992-08 |page=618 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref> and was advertised as the perfect adjunct to formal lessons.  Due to its high price (US$500) and low sales, the keyboard with all of the original cables together are a rare find. The Sega Genesis version can be worth up to US$412.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rarityguide.com/genesis_view.php |title=Sega Genesis Rarity Guide}}</ref>  Aside from being released in the United States, the Miracle Keyboard was also released in multiple regions within Europe.  The European versions are, however, much harder to find.  Some of the NES Miracle keyboards were also later converted for PC use - the [[Nintendo Seal of Quality]] on these boards was covered up with a piece of plastic.

The Miracle Piano did not ever generate sounds from the NES hardware; all NES MIDI information was converted into audio by the instrument's built-in ROM and played through the instrument's stereo speakers, allowing the keyboard to be used independently of the console.

==Features==
[[File:Miracle-Piano-Teaching-System-screenshot.png|thumb|right|alt=A screenshot of the "Robo Man" game activity in the Miracle system software.|Game activities in the Miracle system (such as "Robo Man," shown here) combine video gaming-type gameplay and practicing of musical skills.]]Students can learn to play [[European classical music|classic piano]], [[rock and roll|rock piano]] or [[show tunes]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_pcmMWnxp80C&lpg=PA31&pg=PA30#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Electronics Newsfront |publisher=[[Popular Science]] (retrieved via Google Books) |page=30 |author=Free, John |date=1993-02 |accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref> The Miracle system would use artificial intelligence to assess the player's ability before creating custom lessons.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lgEAAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA32&dq=&pg=PA32#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Electronics Newsfront |author=Stover, Dawn |publisher=[[Popular Science]] (retrieved via Google Books) |page=32 |date=1990-08 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref> Fun exercises were meant to make learning the piano seem less like a chore and more like playing a video game. Instead of using the traditional NES controller, the [[piano]] became the controller as players aimed at targets in order to perfect their [[music]] skills.

There are multiple games that students can play to help teach musical skills. One game is called Robo Man where the player has to press the correct keys at the right time to create a bridge. If they miss, Robo Man falls and the player loses. Another game is a duck hunting game. The player has to press the keys that correspond to the positions of the ducks on a musical staff to shoot them.<ref name="miracle_major_key_lakeland_ledger">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Dt0vAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TPwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5295%2C707585 |title='Miracle' in a major key |author=Brown, Lonnie |page=10C |date=1992-08-22 |publisher=[[Lakeland Ledger]] (retrieved via Google Books) |accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref> In the "Ripchord" game, players must press the correct combination of keys for a chord to land [[paratroopers]] onto a target.<ref name="miracle_major_key_lakeland_ledger"/>

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' liked the Miracle system's games and graphics, describing them as "not only entertaining and challenging, but they are also cleverly designed to reinforce the lessons". The magazine concluded, "everything that Software Toolworks promises about this system is true [but] there is still no substitute for parental involvement".{{r|rich199204}} David Wesley and Gloria Barczak mentioned that the system was praised by educators and that in 1990 it was the highest-rated third-party NES title by Nintendo's software review team.<ref name="innovation_avoiding_trap"/> At the same time, the Miracle system failed commercially with its expensive price and in comparison to later music-related titles such as [[Guitar Hero]] it was not well suited to average gamers who lacked musical experience or who were not highly committed and dedicated to undertaking long-term electronic piano learning.<ref name="innovation_avoiding_trap"/> [[PC Magazine]] mentioned the system as being easy to use and likely more patient than a live piano teacher though the system did not cover certain aspects of piano playing such as hand position.<ref name="pc_mag_patient_teacher"/>

==Successors==
Around 1995, technology from the Miracle system was incorporated into the Piano Discovery System, an interactive PC software title that worked with a MIDI keyboard and which was published by Jump! Music.<ref>{{cite web |title=Piano Discovery System Uses PC to Make Music Lessons Easy and Fun. |date=1995-05-05 |publisher=[[BusinessWire]] |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Piano%20Discovery%20System%20Uses%20PC%20to%20Make%20Music%20Lessons%20Easy%20and%20Fun.-a016903666 |accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Jump!%20Music%20to%20Publish%20Piano%20Discovery%20System;%20Multimedia%20music...-a017441929 |title=Jump!

The freely available [http://ambrosepianotabs.com/page/ambrosegame Ambrose Method Interactive Game] software is similar to the Miracle system and works with a MIDI keyboard.

Its frontage runs from [[Chelsea Bridge]] along the [[Chelsea Embankment]], [[Cheyne Walk]], [[Lots Road power station|Lots Road]] and [[Chelsea Harbour]]. Its eastern boundary was once defined by the [[River Westbourne]], which is now in a pipe above [[Sloane Square tube station]]. The modern eastern boundary is [[Chelsea Bridge Road]] and the lower half of [[Sloane Street]], including [[Sloane Square]]. To the north and northwest, the area fades into [[Knightsbridge]] and [[South Kensington]], but it is safe to say that the area north of [[King's Road]] as far northwest as [[Fulham Road]] is part of Chelsea. The well-known football club [[Chelsea F.C.]], is reasonably considered to be based in Chelsea, despite being located in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.

The district is part of the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]]. From 1900, and until the creation of [[Greater London]] in 1965, it formed the [[Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea]] in the [[County of London]].

The exclusivity of Chelsea as a result of its high property prices has historically resulted in the term [[Sloane Ranger]] to be used to describe its residents. From 2011, [[Channel 4]] has broadcast a reality television show called [[Made in Chelsea]], documenting the "glitzy" lives of several young people living in Chelsea. Moreover, Chelsea is home to one of the largest communities of [[American people|Americans]] living outside of the United States, with 6.53% of Chelsea-residents being born in the United States.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/born_abroad/countries/html/usa.stm BBC Born Abroad Data].

}}
</ref>) originates from the Old English term for "landing place [on the river] for chalk or limestone" (''Cealc-hyð'': [[chalk]]-[[wharf]], in [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]]). The first record of the [[Chelsea Manor|Manor of Chelsea]] precedes the [[Domesday Book]] and records the fact that Thurstan, governor of the King's Palace during the reign of [[Edward the Confessor]] (1042–1066), gave the land to the Abbot and Convent of Westminster. Abbot Gervace subsequently assigned the manor to his mother, and it passed into private ownership. The modern-day Chelsea hosted the [[Synod of Chelsea]] in 787 AD. In the ancient records, it appears as ''Chelchith'', which Norden, a writer of considerable note, derives from the Saxon words ''ceale'' or ''cele'', meaning "coldness", and ''hyd'', meaning "hythe", (landing-place, port or haven).

[[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] acquired the manor of Chelsea from [[William Sandys, 1st Baron Sandys|Lord Sandys]] in 1536; Chelsea Manor Street is still extant. Two of King Henry's [[Wives of Henry VIII|wives]], [[Catherine Parr]] and [[Anne of Cleves]], lived in the Manor House; Princess Elizabeth – the future [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] – resided there; and [[Sir Thomas More|Thomas More]] lived more or less next door at Beaufort House. In 1609 [[James I of England|James I]] established a theological college, [[Chelsea College (17th century)|"King James's College at Chelsey"]] on the site of the future [[Chelsea Royal Hospital]], which [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] founded in 1682.

[[Image:Royal-hospital-chel-fig.jpg|thumb|250px|Figure Court of Royal Hospital Chelsea]]

By 1694, Chelsea – always a popular location for the wealthy, and once described as "a village of palaces" – had a population of 3,000. Even so, Chelsea remained rural and served London to the east as a [[market garden]], a trade that continued until the 19th-century development boom which caused the final absorption of the district into the metropolis. The street crossing that was known as [[Little Chelsea]], Park Walk, linked Fulham Road to King's Road and continued to the Thames and local ferry down Lover's Lane, renamed "Milmans Street" in the 18th century.

[[Image:Rhc-charles2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Statue of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] on the site of the [[Chelsea Flower Show]]]]

King's Road, named for Charles II, recalls the King's private road from [[St James's Palace]] to [[Fulham]], which was maintained until the reign of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. One of the more important buildings in King's Road, the former Chelsea Town Hall – a fine [[neo-classical building]] – contains important [[fresco]]s. Part of the building contains the Chelsea Public Library. Almost opposite stands the former [[Odeon Cinema]], now [[Habitat (retailer)|Habitat]], with its iconic façade which carries high upon it a large sculptured medallion of the now almost-forgotten [[William Friese-Greene]], who claimed to have invented celluloid film and cameras in the 1880s before any subsequent patents.

[[Image:Chelsea thomas more statue 1.jpg|right|thumb|Statue of Thomas More on [[Cheyne Walk]]. [[Chelsea Old Church]] is in the background. (January 2006)]]

According to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', "the better residential portion of Chelsea is the eastern, near Sloane Street and along the river; the western, extending north to [[Fulham Road]], is mainly a poor quarter". This is no longer the case, although housing trusts and Council property do remain. The areas to the west also attract very high prices.

The memorials in the churchyard of [[Chelsea Old Church (All Saints)|Chelsea Old Church]], near the river, illustrate much of the history of Chelsea. These include [[Gregory Fiennes, 10th Baron Dacre|Lord]] and [[Anne Fiennes|Lady Dacre]] (1594/1595); [[Sir John Lawrence]] (1638); [[Jane Cavendish|Lady Jane Cheyne]] (1698); [[Francis Thomas]], "director of the china porcelain manufactory"; [[Hans Sloane|Sir Hans Sloane]] (1753); [[Thomas Shadwell]], [[Poet Laureate]] (1692). [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]]'s tomb can also be found there.

In 1718, the Raw Silk Company was established in [[Little Chelsea|Chelsea Park]], with mulberry trees and a hothouse for raising silkworms. At its height in 1723, it supplied silk to [[Caroline of Ansbach]], then Princess of Wales.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=28708 |title=Economic history: Trade and industry |author=Patricia E.C. Croot (editor) |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |date=2004 |work=A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 12: Chelsea}}</ref>

Chelsea once had a reputation for the manufacture of [[Chelsea bun]]s (made from a long strip of sweet [[dough]] tightly coiled, with [[Zante currant|currant]]s trapped between the layers, and topped with sugar). The area is still famous for its "Chelsea China" ware, though the works, the [[Chelsea porcelain factory]] – thought to be the first workshop to make [[porcelain]] in England – were sold in 1769, and moved to [[Derby]]. Examples of the original Chelsea ware fetch high values.

The best-known building is [[Chelsea Royal Hospital]] for old soldiers, set up by Charles II (supposedly on the suggestion of [[Nell Gwynne]]), and opened in 1694. The beautifully proportioned building by [[Christopher Wren]] stands in extensive grounds, where the Chelsea Flower show is held annually. The former [[Duke of York's Barracks]] (built 1801-3) off King's Road is now part of Duke of York Square, a redevelopment including shops and cafes and the site of a weekly "farmers' market". The Saatchi Gallery opened in the main building in 2008. [[Chelsea Barracks]], at the end of Lower Sloane Street, was also in use until recently, primarily by ceremonial troops of the [[Household Division]]. Situated on the Westminster side of Chelsea Bridge Road, it was bought for re-development by a property group from [[Qatar]].

[[Image:Chelsea Bridge, River Thames, London, England.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chelsea Bridge]] from the south bank]]

Chelsea's modern reputation as a centre of innovation and influence originated in a period during the 19th century, when the area became a Victorian artists' colony (''see [[#The borough of artists|Borough of artists]] below''). It became prominent once again as one of the centres of the "[[Swinging London]]" of the 1960s, when house prices were lower than in the staid Royal Borough of Kensington.

== The borough of artists ==

Chelsea once had a reputation as London's [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] quarter, the haunt of artists, radicals, painters and poets. Little of this seems to survive now – the comfortable squares off King's Road are homes to, amongst others, investment bankers and film stars. The [[Chelsea Arts Club]] continues ''in situ''; however, the [[Chelsea School of Art|Chelsea College of Art and Design]], originally founded in 1895 as the Chelsea School of Art, moved from Manresa Road to Pimlico in 2005.

[[Image:Wildehouse.JPG|right|thumb|[[Oscar Wilde]]'s house on [[Tite Street]], Chelsea]]

[[Image:Chelsea crosby hall 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Crosby Hall, London|Crosby Hall]] on Cheyne Walk. Parts of this building date back to the time of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], its first owner. But it is not native to Chelsea – it is a survivor of the [[Great Fire of London]]. It was shipped brick by brick from [[Bishopsgate]] in 1910 after being threatened with demolition. (January 2006)]]

Its reputation stems from a period in the 19th century when it became a sort of Victorian artists' colony: painters such as [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[William Holman Hunt]], and [[John Singer Sargent]] all lived and worked here. There was a particularly large concentration of artists in the area around [[Cheyne Walk]] and Cheyne Row, where the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement had its heart.

Chelsea was also home to writers such as [[George Meredith]], [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]]. [[Jonathan Swift]] lived in Church Lane, [[Richard Steele]] and [[Tobias Smollett]] in Monmouth House. Carlyle lived for 47 years at No. 5 (now 24) Cheyne Row. After his death, the house was bought and turned into a shrine and literary museum by the Carlyle Memorial Trust, a group formed by [[Leslie Stephen]], father of [[Virginia Woolf]]. Virginia Woolf set her 1919 novel ''[[Night and Day (Woolf novel)|Night and Day]]'' in Chelsea, where Mrs. Hilbery has a Cheyne Walk home.

In a curious book, ''Bohemia in London'' by [[Arthur Ransome]] which is a partly fictional account of his early years in London, published in 1907 when he was 23, there are some fascinating, rather over-romanticised accounts of bohemian goings-on in the quarter. The American artist [[Pamela Colman Smith]], the designer of [[A. E. Waite]]'s [[Tarot]] card pack and a member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], features as "Gypsy" in the chapter "A Chelsea Evening".

A central part of Chelsea's artistic and cultural life was Chelsea Public Library, originally situated in Manresa Road. Its longest serving member of staff was Armitage Denton, who joined in 1896 at the age of 22, and he remained there until his retirement in 1939; he was appointed Chief Librarian in 1929. In 1980, the building was purchased by [[Chelsea College of Art and Design]].

The [[Chelsea Collection]] is a priceless anthology of prints and pictures of old Chelsea. Begun in 1887, it contains works by artists as notable and diverse as Rossetti and Whistler. During his time at the Library, Armitage Denton built the Collection assiduously, so that by the time of his death in July 1949 it numbered more than 1,000 items. At the end of the 20th century, the Collection totalled more than 5,000 works, and it continues to grow.

The [[Chelsea Society]], formed in 1927, remains an active amenity society concerned with preserving and advising on changes in Chelsea's built environment. Chelsea Village and [[Chelsea Harbour]] are new developments outside of Chelsea itself.

== Swinging Chelsea and today ==
Chelsea shone again, brightly but briefly, in the 1960s [[Swinging London]] period and the early 1970s. The [[Swinging Sixties]] was defined on King's Road, which runs the length of the area.
The Western end of Chelsea featured boutiques Granny Takes a Trip and The Sweet Shop, the latter of which sold medieval silk velvet caftans, tabards and floor cushions, with many of the cultural cognoscenti of the time being customers, including [[Keith Richards]], [[Twiggy]], and many others.

Chelsea at this time was home to both [[the Beatles]], and [[Rolling Stones]] members [[Brian Jones]], [[Mick Jagger]], and [[Keith Richards]]. In the 1970s, the [[World's End, Chelsea|World's End]] area of King's Road was home to Malcolm McLaren and [[Vivienne Westwood]]'s boutique "[[SEX (boutique)|SEX]]", and saw the birth of the British [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement.

By the late 1970s, the growing bohemian and punk population moved from Chelsea into nearby [[Notting Hill]] and further north to [[Camden Town]], which lead to rapid gentrification of the two areas, both of which remain places with a significantly high population of artists, musicians and those who work in other creative industries, particularly [[Camden Town]].

King's Road remains the major artery through Chelsea and a very busy road, despite its continuing reputation as a shopping mecca, it is now home to many of the same shops found on other British [[high street]]s, such as [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]], and [[McDonald's]]. [[Sloane Street]] is quickly catching up with [[Bond Street]] as one of London's premier shopping destinations, housing a variety of high-end fashion or jewellery boutiques such as [[Cartier SA|Cartier]], [[Tiffany & Co]], [[Dolce & Gabbana]], [[Prada]], [[Gucci]], [[Harrods]], [[Dior]], [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Jimmy Choo]], [[Giorgio Armani]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Chanel]], [[Valentino SpA|Valentino]], [[Bvlgari]], [[Gianni Versace]] and [[Graff Diamonds|Graff]].

==Sports==
;Football

;Running
Chelsea Running Club is an active running club. The club caters for all levels from beginners to competitive runners.

[[Image:Royal army medical college 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The north block of [[Chelsea College of Art and Design]] (formerly the [[Royal Army Medical College]]) is actually in [[Pimlico]].]]

Chelsea consists of two main postcodes (SW3 and SW10) but also includes small sections of SW1. All of Chelsea is, by definition, in the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]] (RBKC). On the eastern side RBKC meets the borough of the [[City of Westminster]] (COW), this meets at Chelsea Bridge Road where the postcode is SW1W, with one side of the road being in COW and the other in RBKC.

The vast majority of Chelsea lies in the prestigious SW3 postcode. The far west of Chelsea is SW10 and SW5 but due to the absence of tube coverage in large parts of the Borough, most people in SW10 use Earls Court or Fulham Broadway tube stations.

The most desirable part of Chelsea is around [[Sloane Square]] and [[Knightsbridge]] tube. Around here, Chelsea meets [[Knightsbridge]]. This property market attracts considerable (international) attention, and is a very complex market as it consists mainly of short leases under [[Charles Gerald John Cadogan, 8th Earl Cadogan|Earl Cadogan]] as [[freehold (law)|freehold]]er. Much of Chelsea is now viewed as a "Global Ultra Prime Residential Area".

[[Image:Chelsea-pensioners.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Chelsea pensioner]]s in scarlet coats and tricorne hats at the Founder's Day parade in the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]]]]

Much of Chelsea (SW3) and [[Knightsbridge]] (SW1X) is still owned by [[Earl Cadogan]], through the [[Cadogan Estates]]. Most of the property owned is in and around Cadogan Square. This has a major influence on the markets as the Earl is the [[freehold (law)|freehold]]er and generally has no desire to sell; although changes in legislation now mean the [[freehold (law)|freehold]]er is obliged to sell lease extensions to a [[leaseholder]] at prices which are determined by the [[Leasehold valuation tribunal]]. Lord Cadogan is generally regarded as an effective and successful property developer/landlord being responsible, together with his management team, for bringing all of the fashion labels to [[Sloane Street]], and also forward thinking developments on his own account at Duke of York Square on [[Kings Road]], at [[Peter Jones (department store)|Peter Jones]] and on [[Sloane Street]]. The Cadogan Estate has a considerable portfolio of retail property throughout Chelsea but notably on [[Fulham Road]], [[Kings Road]], and [[Sloane Street]] including [[Peter Jones (department store)|Peter Jones]], [[Harvey Nichols]], and 12 hotels including the [[Cadogan Hotel]]. The Estate maintains many of the garden squares, (to which local residents can gain access by subscribing for an annual fee – and optionally the tennis courts where applicable). The area is home to several open spaces including Albert Bridge Gardens, Battersea Bridge Gardens, Chelsea Embankment Gardens, [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]]: the grounds of which are used by the annual [[Chelsea Flower Show]] and [[Chelsea Physic Garden]].

===Tube and Rail===
Chelsea does not currently have its own [[London Underground|Underground]] station, although two stations are close to the area are [[Sloane Square tube station|Sloane Square]] ([[District line|District]] and [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle line]]s) and [[South Kensington tube station|South Kensington]] (District, Circle and [[Piccadilly line]]s).

The [[London Overground]] [[West London Line]] passes the western edge of Chelsea which serves the area with [[Imperial Wharf railway station]] at [[Chelsea Harbour]]. A [[Chelsea and Fulham railway station|Chelsea railway station]] (later remained ''Chelsea and Fulham'') previously existed on this line, located between the [[King's Road]] and the [[Fulham Road]] in neighbouring Fulham, but this was closed in 1940 following [[the Blitz|World War II bomb damage]] and later demolished.<ref name=subbrit>{{cite web|title=Chelsea & Fulham|url=http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/c/chelsea_fulham/index.shtml|work=Disused Stations|publisher=Subterranea Britannica|accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref>

There is a proposal to construct a [[Chelsea tube station]] on the King's Road as part of the [[Crossrail 2]] project (also known as the ''Chelsea-Hackney line''). The project, run by [[Transport for London]], has not yet been approved or funded but is at the consultation stage.<ref name=tflcr2>{{cite web|title=Regional route|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/27551.aspx|work=Projects and Schemes – Crossrail 2|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=1 August 2013}}</ref> According to plans published by TfL in 2008, it is envisaged that the station would be located on the Dovehouse Green area of King's Road.<ref name=crossrail>{{cite web|title=Chelsea-Hackney Line Safeguarding Directions|url=http://www.crossrail.co.uk/assets/library/document/c/original/chelsea_hackney_safeguarding_directions_june_2008_part_11.pdf|publisher=TfL/Crossrail|accessdate=1 August 2013|page=Sheet 8|date=June 2008}}</ref>

'''Paul de Man''' (December 6, 1919 – December 21, 1983), born Paul Adolph Michel Deman,<ref name=Barish2014>Evelyn Barish, 2014, "The Double Life of Paul de Man", New York: W. W. Norton/[[Liveright & Company|Liveright]]|, e.g., p. 3. 560 pp., ISBN 978-0-87140-326-1.  See http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=4294972279, accessed 3 May 2014.</ref> was a [[Belgium|Belgian]]-born [[Literary criticism|literary critic]] and [[Literary theory|literary theorist]]. At the time of his death, de Man was one of the best-known literary critics in the United States—known particularly for his importation of German and French [[philosophy|philosophical]] approaches into Anglo-American literary studies and critical theory.{{citation needed (lead)|date=May 2014}} Along with [[Jacques Derrida]], he was part of an influential critical movement that went beyond traditional interpretation of literary texts to reflect on the epistemological difficulties inherent in any textual, literary, or critical activity.{{citation needed (lead)|date=May 2014}} This approach aroused considerable opposition, which de Man attributed to "resistance" inherent in the difficult enterprise of literary interpretation itself.<ref>de Man, Paul, date unknown, "[[The Resistance to Theory]]," in ''The Resistance to Theory'', University of Minnesota Press, publisher, city, and page numbers unknown.</ref>

De Man began his teaching career in the United States at [[Bard College]]. In the late 1950s he completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at [[Harvard University]], then taught at [[Cornell University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]],{{citation needed (lead)|date=May 2014}} and the [[University of Zurich]]. He joined the faculty in French and Comparative Literature at [[Yale University]], where he was considered part of the [[Yale school (deconstruction)|Yale School]] of [[Deconstruction]]. At the time of his death from cancer, he was [[Sterling Professor]] of the Humanities and chairman of the Department of Comparative Literature at Yale. De Man oversaw the dissertations of [[Gayatri Spivak]] (at Cornell), [[Barbara Johnson]] (at Yale),{{citation needed (lead)|date=May 2014}} [[Samuel Weber]] (at Cornell), and many other noted scholars.

After his death, a researcher uncovered some two hundred previously unknown articles which de Man had written in his early twenties for Belgian [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]]{<Evelyn Marish "The Double Life of Paul de Man", Liveright>} newspapers during [[World War II]], five of them implicitly and one explicitly [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]]. These, in combination with explosive revelations about his domestic life and financial history, caused a scandal and provoked a reconsideration of his life and work.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/28/magazine/the-case-of-paul-de-man.html</ref>

==Early life==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
Paul de Man was born in [[Antwerp]], Belgium, to a prominent and cultivated upper-class [[Flemish people|Flemish]] family. His maternal great-grandfather was the noted Flemish Poet, [[Jan Van Beers]], and the family maintained a continuing interest in [[French literature]]. His uncle [[Henri de Man|Hendrik de Man]] was a famous [[socialist]] theorist and politician, who became a Nazi-collaborator during World War II. Paul's father, Robert ("Bob") de Man, was a successful businessman whose firm manufactured X-ray equipment. De Man's father and his mother, Madeleine de Braey, who were first cousins, married over the family's opposition. The marriage proved unhappy.

De Man's early life was difficult and shadowed by tragedy. His mother Madeleine's first pregnancy with her oldest son Henrik ("Rik", b. 1915) coincided with the intense German bombings of [[World War I]] and strained her fragile physical and mental health. The  stillbirth of a daughter two years later pushed her into a seemingly permanent suicidal [[depression (mood)|depression]]. She was a mental invalid and had to be watched constantly. The family walked on eggshells and "Bob" de Man found solace with other women. In contrast to Rik, who was backward and a failure in school, Paul dealt with his difficult home life by becoming a brilliant student and accomplished athlete. He was among the few Dutch-speaking boys admitted to the prestigious and highly competitive Royal Athenaeum of Antwerp. There, he followed his father's career path in choosing to study science and engineering, consistently receiving top marks in mathematics. He took no courses in literature or philosophy but developed an extracurricular interest in religious mysticism. In 1936, his brother Rik de Man was killed at the age of 21 when his car was struck by a train while parked at a railroad crossing. The following year, Paul, then seventeen, discovered the body of their mother, who had hanged herself on the anniversary of Rik's death.<ref>Barish 2014, pp. 43–46</ref>{{nonspecific|date=May 2014}}

That fall Paul enrolled in the [[Free University of Brussels]]. He wrote for student magazines and continued to take courses in science and engineering. For stability he turned to his uncle Hendrik as a patron and surrogate emotional father, sometimes telling people Hendrik was his real father and his real father was his uncle. He fathered a son with [[Romanians|Romanian]]-born Anaïde Baraghian, the wife of his landlord. Baraghian left her husband to marry Paul, and the couple had two more sons together.<ref name=Smallwood2014>Christine Smallwood, 2014, "New Books (The Double Life of Paul de Man)", ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers Magazine]]'', March 2014, pp. 77''f''. See http://harpers.org/archive/2014/03/new-books-56/, accessed 3 May 2014.</ref>{{better source|date=May 2014}}

De Man told people that when the Nazis occupied Belgium in 1940, he and Baraghian tried to flee into Spain but were turned back at the Spanish border. Uncle Hendrik, whose views had been moving ever rightward, welcomed the Nazi invaders, whom he saw as essential for instituting his brand of socialism.<ref>James Tuttleton, 1991, "Quisling criticism: the case of Paul de Man: a review of David Lehman, 'Signs of the Times: Deconstruction & the Fall of Paul de Man'," ''New Criterion'', April 1991. See https://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Quisling-criticism--the-case-of-Paul-de-Man-5464, access date unknown.</ref>{{update after|2014|5|3}}{{page needed|date=May 2014}} For a year, Hendrik de Man was appointed as de facto puppet Prime Minister of Belgium under the Nazis. He used his influence to secure his nephew a position as cultural editor for ''[[Le Soir]]'', the largest Belgian [[French-language]] newspaper, and the Flemish daily ''Het Vlaamsche Land'', both violently anti-Semitic and under Nazi control. As a cultural critic, de Man would contribute hundreds of articles and reviews to these publications, and some of his pieces were overtly anti-semitic. Most of his writings, however, were artfully evasive about matters political; and he maintained friendships with individual Jews.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In 1942, Uncle Hendrik, mistrusted by his fellow collaborators on the right and marked for death as a traitor by the [[Belgian Resistance]], took refuge in [[Paris]]. (Later he fled to [[Savoy]] and then to [[Switzerland]]). Paul resigned from newspaper work in November 1942. Two months later, a fellow cultural critic at ''Le Soir'' was assassinated by a member of the Resistance.

De Man spent the rest of the war in seclusion doing literary translations; his translation into Dutch of ''[[Moby Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]] was published in 1945. He would be interrogated{{by whom|date=May 2014}} but not charged after the war. Hendrik de Man was [[Tried in absentia|tried]] and convicted in absentia for [[treason]]; he died in Switzerland in 1953, after crashing his car into an oncoming train, an accident that was almost certainly a suicide.<ref name=Atlas1988>James Atlas, 1988, "The Case of Paul de Man", ''New York Times'', August 28, 1988.

==Post-war years==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
In 1948 de Man left Belgium and immigrated to [[New York City]].<ref name=Atlas1988/> Baraghian, who had no work permit, sailed with their three young sons to [[Argentina]], where her parents had recently emigrated. De Man found work stocking books at the Doubleday Bookstore at New York City's [[Grand Central Station]]. There he befriended [[Georges Bataille]], an [[antinomian]] mystic and surrealist, and through him, [[Dwight MacDonald]], a key figure on the New York intellectual and literary scene. At MacDonald's apartment, de Man met the beautiful and celebrated novelist [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]]. McCarthy recommended de Man to her friend, Artine Artinian, a professor of French at Bard College, as a temporary replacement while Artinian spent the academic year of 1949–50 in France as a [[Fulbright fellow]].

<blockquote>"De Man was to teach Mr. Artinian's courses, advise Mr. Artinian's advisees, and move into Mr. Artinian's house. By December [1949], de Man had married one of the advisees, a French major named Patricia Kelley, and when the first Mrs. de Man turned up with their three young boys, Hendrik, Robert, and Marc, in the spring of 1950, Patricia de Man [sic] was pregnant."<ref name="lehman"/></blockquote>De Man persuaded the devastated Baraghian to accept a sum of money, agree to a divorce, and to let Kelley's parents raise the eldest boy while she took the younger ones back to Argentina, with a promise of [[child support]] that he was never to honor.<ref name="lehman">David Lehman, 1992, "Paul de Man: The Plot Thickens," ''New York Times'', May 24, 1992, page numbers unknown.

A heavily fictionalized account of this period of de Man's life is the basis of [[Henri Thomas|Henri Thomas's]] 1964 novel ''Le Parjure'' (''The Perjurer'').<ref>Lindsay Waters. "Paul de Man: Life and Works." Introduction to Paul de Man, ''Critical Writings: 1953–1978.'' Ed. Lindsay Waters. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. 1989. lxiv. See also Jacques Derrida, "Le Parjure: ''Perhaps'', Storytelling and Lying", pp. 161–201, in ''Without Alibi'' (Stanford University Press, 2002).</ref> De Man and his partner Kelly underwent a second marriage ceremony in August 1960, when his divorce from Baraghian was finalized. They later had a third ceremony in Ithaca.<ref name=Smallwood2014/> In addition to their son, Michael, born while the couple was at Bard College, they had a daughter, Patsy. The couple remained together until de Man's death, aged 64, in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

==Academic career==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
The de Mans moved to Boston, where Paul earned money teaching conversational French at [[Berlitz Corporation|Berlitz]] and did translations, assisted by Kelley; he also gave private French lessons to Harvard student [[Henry Kissinger]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} There, de Man met [[Harry Levin]], the Harvard Professor of Comparative Literature, and "was invited to join an informal literary seminar that met at Levin's house (alongside, e.g., [[George Steiner]] and [[John Simon]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} By the fall of 1952, he was officially admitted to graduate study in comparative literature."<ref name=Brooks2014>Peter Brooks, 2014, "The Strange Case of Paul de Man", ''New York Review of Books'', March 2014, see http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/apr/03/strange-case-paul-de-man/?insrc=hpss, accessed 2 May 2014.</ref> In 1954 someone sent Harvard an anonymous letter denouncing de Man as a wartime collaborator and questioning his immigration status (a letter not surviving, and known only on the basis of de Man's response to it).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} According to Harvard faculty members, de Man offered a thorough and more than satisfactory account of his immigration status and the nature of his political activities.<ref name=Brooks2014/> After graduation De Man was awarded a prestigious appointment at the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Subsequently de Man taught at Cornell University.

[[Peter Brooks (writer)|Peter Brooks]], later de Man's friend and colleague at Yale, wrote that rather than brand de Man as a confidence man, as his critics were inclined to do:
<blockquote>"One might consider this a story of remarkable survival and success following the chaos of war, occupation, postwar migration, and moments of financial desperation: without any degrees to his name, de Man had impressed, among others, [[Bataille]], Macdonald, McCarthy, and Levin, and entered the highest precincts of American academia. During the following decade, he contributed nine articles to the newly established ''[[New York Review]]'': astute and incisive short essays on major European writers—[[Hölderlin]], [[Gide]], [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[Sartre]], [[Heidegger]], as well as [[Borges]]—that display notable cultural range and critical poise.<ref name=Brooks2014/></blockquote>

In 1966, de Man attended a conference on [[structuralism]] held at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where [[Jacques Derrida]] delivered his celebrated essay, "[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences]]"; de Man and Derrida soon became fast friends.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Both were to become identified with [[Deconstruction]]. De Man came to reflect the influence primarily of [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and used deconstruction to study [[Romanticism]], both [[List of romantics|English]] and [[German Romanticism|German]], as well as French literature, specifically the works of [[William Wordsworth]], [[John Keats]], [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Friedrich Hoelderlin]] and [[Rainer Maria Rilke]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Following an appointment in [[Zurich]], de Man returned to the United States in the 1970s to teach at Yale University, where he served for the rest of his career.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} At the time of his death of cancer at age 64, he was a [[Sterling Professor]] and chairman of the department of comparative literature at Yale.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Contributions to literary theory==
Although de Man's work in the 1960s differs from his later deconstructive endeavors, considerable continuity can also be discerned. In his 1967 essay "Criticism and Crisis," he argues that because literary works are understood to be fictions rather than factual accounts, they exemplify the break between a [[Semiotics|sign and its meaning]]: literature "means" nothing, but critics resist this insight: 
<blockquote>"When modern critics think they are demystifying literature, they are in fact being demystified by it. But since this necessarily occurs in the form of a crisis, they are blind to what takes place within themselves. What they call anthropology, linguistics, psychoanalysis, is nothing but literature reappearing like the hydra's head in the very spot where it had been suppressed. The human mind will go through amazing feats to avoid facing 'the nothingness of human matters'."<ref>"Criticism and Crisis" 18 in ''Blindness and Insight''. The phrase "nothingness of human matters" – ''le néant des choses humaines'' – is from a well-known passage about the imagination from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s [[Julie, or the New Heloise|''Julie ou La Nouvelle Héloïse'']] (VI: VIII), which asserts that human happiness lies only in desire and not fulfillment: "The world of illusions is the only one worth inhabiting. Such is the vanity of human matters, outside the realm of the Self-Created Being, that nothing here is beautiful but what is not."</ref></blockquote>De Man would later observe that, due to this resistance to acknowledging that literature does not "mean", English departments had become "large organizations in the service of everything except their own subject matter" ("The Return to Philology"). He said that the study of literature had become the art of applying [[psychology]], [[politics]], [[history]], [[philology]] or other disciplines to the literary text, in an effort to make the text "mean" something.

Among the central threads running through de Man's work is his attempt to tease out the tension between rhetoric (which de Man's uses as a term to mean figural language and [[Trope (linguistics)|trope]]) and meaning, seeking  moments in the text where linguistic forces "tie themselves into a knot which arrests the process of understanding."<ref>de Man, Paul, "Shelley Disfigured", in Bloom, Harold, et al. ''Deconstruction and Criticism'' (New York, Continuum: 1979), p. 44.</ref> De Man's earlier essays from the 1960s, collected in ''Blindness and Insight'',<ref>See de Man, Paul, ''Blindness and Insight: Essays in the Rhetoric of Contemporary Criticism'' (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1971).</ref> represent an attempt to seek these [[paradox]]es in the texts of [[New Criticism]] and move beyond [[Formalism (literature)|formalism]]. One of De Man's central [[Topos|topoi]] is of the blindness on which these critical readings are predicated, that the "insight seems instead to have been gained from a negative movement that animates the critic's thought, an unstated principle that leads his language away from its asserted stand. . . as if the very possibility of assertion had been put into question."<ref>de Man, Paul, "The Rhetoric of Blindness", ''Blindness and Insight'', 103.</ref> Here de Man tries to undercut the notion of the poetic work as a unified, atemporal [[Symbol|icon]], a self-possessed repository of meaning freed from the [[Intentionalism|intentionalist]] and affective fallacies. In de Man's argument, formalist and New Critical valorization of the "organic" nature of poetry is ultimately self-defeating: the notion of the verbal icon is undermined by the irony and ambiguity inherent within it. Form ultimately acts as "both a creator and undoer of organic totalities," and "the final insight...annihilated the premises which led up to it."<ref>de Man, Paul, "The Rhetoric of Blindness", ''Blindness and Insight'', p. 104.</ref>{{nonspecific|date=May 2014}}{{page needed|date=May 2014}}

In ''Allegories of Reading'',<ref>See de Man, Paul, ''Allegories of Reading'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1979).</ref>{{nonspecific|date=May 2014}}{{page needed|date=May 2014}} de Man further explores the tensions arising in figural language in Nietzsche, Rousseau, Rilke, and Proust. In these essays, he concentrates on crucial passages which have a [[Metalinguistics|metalinguistic]] function or metacritical implications, particularly those where figural language has a dependency on classical philosophical oppositions ([[essence]]/accident, [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]]/[[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]], appearance/reality) which are so central to Western [[discourse]]. Many of the essays in this volume attempt to undercut figural totalization, the notion that one can control or dominate a discourse or phenomenon through [[metaphor]]. In de Man's discussion of Nietzsche's ''The Birth of Tragedy'', for instance, he claims that "genetic"{{clarify|date=May 2014}} conceptions of history appearing in the text are undercut by the [[rhetoric]]al strategies Nietzsche employs: "the deconstruction does not occur between statements, as in a logical refutation or a dialectic, but happens instead between, on the one hand, metalinguistic statements about the rhetorical nature of language and, on the other hand, a rhetorical [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] that puts these statements into question."<ref>de Man, ''Allegories of Reading'', 98.</ref> For de Man, an "Allegory of Reading" emerges when texts are subjected to such scrutiny and reveal this tension; a reading wherein the text reveals its own assumptions about language, and in so doing dictates a statement about [[undecidable problem|undecidability]], the difficulties inherent in totalization, their own readability, or the "limitations of textual authority."<ref>de Man, ''Allegories of Reading'', 99.</ref>

De Man is also known for his readings of English and [[German Romanticism|German]] [[Romanticism|romantic]] and post-romantic poetry and philosophy (''The Rhetoric of Romanticism''), and concise and deeply ironic essays. Specifically noteworthy is his critical dismantling of the Romantic ideology and the linguistic assumptions which underlie it. His arguments follow roughly as follows. First, de Man seeks to deconstruct the privileged claims in Romanticism of [[symbol]] over [[allegory]], and [[metaphor]] over [[metonymy]]. In his reading, because of the implication of [[Self-concept|self-identity]] and wholeness which is inherent in the Romantics' conception of metaphor, when this self-identity decomposes, so also does the means of overcoming the [[dualism]] between [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]], which Romantic metaphor sought to transcend. In de Man's reading, to compensate for this inability, Romanticism constantly relies on allegory to attain the wholeness established by the totality of the symbol.<ref>See de Man, "The Rhetoric of Temporality", ''Blindness and Insight''.</ref>

In addition, in his essay "[[The Resistance to Theory]]", which explores the task and philosophical bases of [[literary theory]], de Man uses the example of the classical ''[[Trivium (education)|trivium]]'' of grammar, rhetoric, and logic to argue that the use of linguistic sciences in literary theory and criticism (i.e. a [[structural linguistics|structuralist]] approach) was able to harmonize the logical and grammatical dimension of literature, but only at the expense of effacing the rhetorical elements of texts which presented the greatest interpretive demands. He posits that the resistance to theory is the resistance to reading, thus the resistance to theory is theory itself. Or the resistance to theory is what constitutes the possibility and existence of theory. Taking up the example of the title of Keats' poem ''The Fall of Hyperion'', de Man draws out an irreducible interpretive undecidability which bears strong affinities to the same term in Derrida's work and some similarity to the notion of incommensurability as developed by [[Jean-François Lyotard]] in ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]'' and ''[[The Differend]]''. De Man argues that the recurring motive of theoretical readings is to subsume these decisions under theoretical, futile generalizations, which are displaced in turn into harsh [[polemic]]s about theory.

}}
De Man's influence on literary criticism was considerable, in part through his numerous and vocal disciples. Although much of his work brought to bear insights on literature drawn from German philosophers such as Kant and Heidegger, De Man also closely followed developments in contemporary [[French language|French]] literature, criticism, and theory

Much of de Man's work was collected or published posthumously. His book, ''Resistance to Theory'' was virtually complete at the time of his death. In 1996 a collection of essays, edited by his former Yale colleague Andrzej Warminski, was published by the [[University of Minnesota Press]] under the title,  ''Aesthetic Ideology''.

==Wartime journalism and posthumous controversies==
In 1988, Ortwin de Graef, a Belgian graduate student at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|University of Leuven]], discovered some two hundred articles which de Man had written during World War II for ''[[Le Soir]]''.<ref>For facsimiles of the articles, see Warner Hamacher, Neil Hertz and Thomas Keenan, eds., ''Wartime Journalism 1939–1943 by Paul de Man'' (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1988).</ref> That year a conference on Paul de Man took place at the University of Antwerp. "On the last day, Jean Stengers, a historian at the Free University of Brussels, addressed a topic pointedly titled: "Paul de Man, a Collaborator?"<ref name=Atlas1988/> Then Georges Goriely, professor emeritus of sociology at the Free University of Brussels, rose to deliver what he called "A Personal Testimony":

<blockquote>M. Goriely began by extolling de Man, whom he had known intimately in his youth, as "a charming, humorous, modest, highly cultured" ''homme de lettres'' renowned in Belgian literary circles during their youth. Then the professor dropped his bombshell. De Man, he asserted, wasn't all that he appeared to be. He was "completely, almost pathologically, dishonest," a crook who had bankrupted his family. "Swindling, forging, lying were, at least at the time, second nature to him."<ref name=Atlas1988/> </blockquote>

The European press was in an uproar. "There were stories in La ''Quinzaine Litteraire'', the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', The ''(Manchester) Guardian''. ''Newsweek'' juxtaposed a photograph of de Man with another of Nazis on the march. ''Le Soir'' reported 'a Waldheim ''academique'''."<ref name=Atlas1988/>

De Man's disciples tried to portray the attacks on de Man as a cover for his critics' dislike of Deconstruction, alleging that the attacks were a ruse that used de Man's youthful errors as evidence of what they considered the decadence at the heart of the Continental thought behind de Man and his theories. The controversies quickly spread from the pages of scholarly journals<ref>Jacques Derrida, "Like the Sound of the Sea Deep within a Shell: Paul de Man's War", ''Critical Inquiry'' 14 (Spring 1988), 597–98.</ref> to the broader media. ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' and the front page of the  ''New York Times'' exposed the sensational details of de Man's personal life, particularly the circumstances of his marriage and his difficult relationships with his children.<ref>"Yale Scholar Wrote for Pro-Nazi Newspaper", ''New York Times'', Dec. 1, 1987, p. 1.</ref>

In the most controversial and explicitly anti-semitic essay from this war-time journalism, titled "Jews in Contemporary Literature" (1941), de Man described how "[v]ulgar anti-semitism willingly takes pleasure in considering post-war cultural phenomenon (after the war of 14–18) as degenerate and decadent because they are [enjewished]."<ref name=deMan127-129>Paul de Man. "The Jews in Contemporary Literature." Originally published in ''Le Soir'' (March 4, 1941), Martin McQuillan, translator, in Martin McQuillan, ''Paul de Man. USA'' (Routledge. 2001), pp. 127–29.</ref> He notes that 
<blockquote>"Literature does not escape this lapidary judgement: it is sufficient to discover a few Jewish writers under Latinized pseudonyms for all contemporary production to be considered polluted and evil. This conception entails rather dangerous consequences ... it would be a rather unflattering appreciation of western writers to reduce them to being mere imitators of a Jewish culture which is foreign to them."<ref name=deMan127-129/></blockquote>The article claimed that contemporary literature had not broken from tradition as a result of the First World War and that
<blockquote>"the Jews cannot claim to have been its creators, nor even to have exercised a preponderant influence over its development. On any closer examination, this influence appears to have extraordinarily little importance since one might have expected that, given the specific characteristics of the Jewish Spirit, the later would have played a more brilliant role in this artistic production."<ref name=deMan127-129/></blockquote> The article concluded that "our civilization... [b]y keeping, in spite of semitic interference in all aspects of European life, an intact originality and character... has shown that its basic character is healthy." It concluded that "the creation of a Jewish colony isolated from Europe" as "a solution to the [[Jewish Question|Jewish problem]]" would not entail any "deplorable consequences" for "the literary life of the west."<ref>"Les Juifs dans la litterature actuelle" appears in the same issue, p. 45.</ref> This is the only known article in which de Man pronounced such views so openly, though two or three other articles also accept without demurral the disenfranchisement and ostracization of Jews, as some contributors to ''Responses'' have noted.

De Man's colleagues, students, and contemporaries tried to respond to his early writings and his subsequent silence about them in the volume ''Responses: On Paul de Man's Wartime Journalism'' (edited by Werner Hamacher, Neil Hertz, and Thomas Keenan; Nebraska, 1989). His longtime friend, Jacques Derrida, who was Jewish, published a long piece responding to De Man's critics, declaring:
<blockquote>"To judge, to condemn the work or the man on the basis of what was a brief episode, to call for closing, that is to say, at least figuratively, for censuring or burning his books is to reproduce the exterminating gesture which one accuses de Man of not having armed himself against sooner with the necessary vigilance. It is not even to draw a lesson that he, de Man, learned to draw from the war."<ref>Jacques Derrida, "Like the Sound of the Sea Deep within a Shell: Paul de Man's War", ''Critical Inquiry'' 14 (Spring 1988), 590–65; quote from 651; see also the "Critical Responses" in ''Critical Inquiry'' 15 (Summer 1989, 765–811) and Derrida's reply, "Biodegradables: Seven Diary Fragments", 812–873.</ref></blockquote>Some readers objected to what they considered was Derrida's objectionable effort to relate criticism of de Man to the greater tragedy of extermination of the Jews.<ref>See, for example, Jon Wiener, "The Responsibilities of Friendship", ''Critical Inquiry'' 15 (Summer 1989): 797.</ref>

Since the late 1980s, some of de Man's followers, many of them Jewish, have pointed out that de Man at no time in his life displayed personal animus against Jews. Shoshana Felman, recounted that 
<blockquote>"about a year after the journalistic publication of his compromising statement, he and his wife sheltered for several days in their apartment the Jewish pianist Esther Sluszny and her husband, who were then illegal citizens in hiding from the Nazis. During this same period, de Man was meeting regularly with Georges Goriely, a member of the Belgian Resistance. According to Goriely's own testimony, he never for one minute feared denunciation of his underground activities by Paul de Man."<ref>Shoshana Felman, "Paul de Man's Silence", ''Critical Inquiry'' 15: 4 (Summer, 1989): 704–744</ref></blockquote>But, his disciples and defenders have failed to agree about the nature of de Man's silence about his wartime activities. His critics, on the other hand, point out that throughout his life de Man was not only passively silent but also engaged in an active coverup through lies and misdirections about his past.

==New biography: 2014==
In 2014 Evelyn Barish published a new biography, ''The Double Life of Paul de Man'',<ref name=Barish2014/> the result of extensive archival research and interviews with close family and colleagues. Barish charges de Man with a long list of personal,{{page needed|date=May 2014}} professional,{{page needed|date=May 2014}} and criminal misdeeds.{{page needed|date=May 2014}} In an advance review published in ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers Magazine]]'', Christine Smallwood concluded that, as portrayed by Barish, de Man turns out to have been: "a slippery Mr. Ripley, a confidence man, and a hustler who embezzled, lied, forged, and arreared his way to intellectual acclaim."<ref name=Smallwood2014/> Writing in the ''New York Review of Books'', [[Peter Brooks (writer)|Peter Brooks]] defended his friend and former colleague at Yale, calling some of Barish's accusations overblown and identifying numerous errors in her footnotes: "One could do a review of Barish's footnotes that would cast many doubts on her scholarship", he complains.<ref name=Brooks2014/> For example, he cites the footnote Barish provides to support her claim that in 1942 de Man planned to launch a Nazi literary magazine: "I shared this information, and it has since been previously published in Belgian sources not now available to me", noting that this sort of thing "does not pass any sort of muster."<ref name=Brooks2014/> 

Harvard professor [[Louis Menand]], on the other hand, in his review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', finds Barish's biography important and credible, notwithstanding the presence of occasional errors and exaggerations. Menand writes that Barish is:
<blockquote>not a hundred per cent reliable on the historical background; she is a little over her head with the theoretical issues; and she sometimes characterizes as manipulative or deceptive behavior that might have a more benign explanation. Her book is a brief for the prosecution. But it is not a hatchet job, and she has an amazing tale to tell. In her account, all guns are smoking. There are enough to stock a miniseries.<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2014/03/24/140324crat_atlarge_menand?currentPage=all  Louis Menand, "The de Man Case: Does a Critic's Past Explain His Criticism?"], ''The New Yorker'', March 24, 2014.</ref></blockquote>

'''Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak''' (born 24 February 1942) is an Indian [[literary theory|literary theorist]], [[Contemporary Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[University Professor (Columbia)|University Professor]] at [[Columbia University]], where she is a founding member of the school's Institute for Comparative Literature and Society.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/english/fac_profiles.htm#gcs4 Columbia faculty profile]</ref> She is best known for the essay "[[Can the Subaltern Speak?]]" considered a founding text of [[postcolonialism]]; and for her translation of, and introduction to [[Jacques Derrida]]'s ''[[Of Grammatology|De la grammatologie]]''. In 2012 she was awarded the [[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy]] for being "a critical theorist and educator speaking for the humanities against intellectual colonialism in relation to the globalized world".<ref>{{cite web|title=The 2012 Kyoto Prize Laureate|url=http://www.kyotoprize.org/en/28k-laureates-c.html|publisher=Inamori Foundation|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> She received the [[Padma Bhushan]], the third highest civilian award given by the Republic of India, in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Padma awardees|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/list-of-padma-awardees/article4345496.ece=26 January 2013}}</ref>

Spivak is best known for her contemporary cultural and critical theories to challenge the "legacy of colonialism" and the way readers engage with literature and culture. She often focuses on the cultural texts of those who are marginalised by dominant western culture: the new immigrant, the working class, women, and other positions of the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]].<ref name="sharp6">{{cite book

==Life==
Spivak was born Gayatri Chakravorty, to parents Pares Chandra and Sivani Chakravorty, in [[Calcutta]], [[India]], 24 February 1942.<ref name="spivak_reader">{{cite book|title=The Spivak reader: selected works of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|pages=1–4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gCHcsaSi-sUC&pg=PT12|chapter=Reading Spivak}}</ref> After completing her school education from the [[St. John's Diocesan Girls' Higher Secondary School]], she received an undergraduate degree in English at the [[Presidency College, Kolkata]] under the [[University of Calcutta]] (1959), graduating with first class honours and received gold medals for English and Bengali literature.<ref name="spivak_reader" /> After this, she attended [[Cornell University]] where she completed her MA in English and pursued her PhD in [[comparative literature]], while teaching at the [[University of Iowa]].<ref name="spivak_reader" />

Her dissertation was on [[William Butler Yeats|W.B. Yeats]], directed by [[Paul de Man]] at [[Cornell]], titled ''Myself Must I Remake: The Life and Poetry of W.B. Yeats''.<ref name="spivak_reader" />  At Cornell, she was the second woman elected to membership in the [[Telluride Association]]. She was briefly married to [[Talbot Spivak]] in the 1960s. ''The Bride Wore the Traditional Gold'' by Talbot Spivak is an autobiographical novel that deals with the early years of this marriage.<ref>http://www.abebooks.com/bride-wore-traditional-gold-Talbot-Spivak/3212317138/bd</ref>

In March 2007 Spivak became the [[University Professor (Columbia)|University Professor]] at [[Columbia University]], making her the only [[person of color|woman of color]] to be bestowed the University's highest honour in its 264-year history.<ref name=thehindu>{{cite news|last=LAHIRI|first=BULAN|title=Speaking to Spivak|url=http://www.hindu.com/lr/2011/02/06/stories/2011020650020100.htm|accessdate=7 February 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=6 February 2011|location=Chennai, India}}</ref>

In June 2012, she was awarded the [[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/US-computer-scientist-wins-Kyoto-Prize/articleshow/14338078.cms|title=Kyoto Prize|accessdate=22 June 2012 | work=The Times of India}}</ref>

==Work==
In "[[Can the Subaltern Speak?]]" Spivak discusses the race and power dynamics involved in the banning of [[Sati (practice)|sati]]. Spivak writes that all we hear about sati are accounts by British colonizers or Hindu leaders of how [[self-immolation]] oppressed women, but we never hear from the sati-performing women themselves. This lack of an account leads Spivak to reflect on whether the [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] can even speak.<ref name="sharp6" /> Spivak recounts how Sati appears in colonial archives.<ref>Spivak, Can the Sublatern, 214.</ref> Spivak demonstrates that the Western academy has obscured subaltern experiences by assuming the transparency of its scholarship. Leftist intellectuals such as [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]] inaugurate the Western, Eurocentric [[Subject (philosophy)|Subject]] as they disavow the problem of representation; and by invoking the Subject of Europe, these intellectuals constitute the subaltern Other of Europe as anonymous and mute. Spivak also performs a deconstruction of representation as deployed by Foucault, Deleuze, and [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. Spivak demonstrates Marx's use of two terms in the original German for representation: one in the sense of [[representation (politics)|political proxy]], and the other in the sense of [[representation (arts)|figurative re-presenting]].

Spivak's translation of [[Derrida]]'s ''[[Of Grammatology|De la grammatologie]]'', which included a translator's introduction that has since been described as "setting a new standard for self-reflexivity in prefaces,"<ref name="spivak_reader" /> brought her to prominence. After this, she carried out a series of historical studies as a member of the "[[Subaltern Studies Collective]]" and literary critiques of imperialism and international feminism. She has often referred to herself as a "practical Marxist-feminist-deconstructionist."<ref name="thehindu"/> Her over-riding ethico-political concern has been for the site occupied by the [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]], especially subaltern women, both in discursive practices and in institutions as much as Western cultures. [[Edward Said]] wrote that, "She pioneered the study in literary theory of non-Western women and produced one of the earliest and most coherent accounts of that role available to us."<ref>Dinitia Smith, [http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/09/arts/creating-a-stir-wherever-she-goes.html "Creating a Stir Wherever She Goes,"] ''New York Times'' (9 February 2002) B7.</ref>
In "Can the Subaltern Speak?"<ref>Spivak, Gayatri. "Can the subaltern speak?." Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture (1988): 271–313.</ref> Spivak highlights how [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Michel Foucault]] confine the decentering of the subject to the subject of the West, which problematises the non-Western other as real and knowable. In concluding her essay, she rebuffs Deleuze and Foucault for making it impossible to confer with the subaltern in a discursive practice, and suggests the possibilities [[Jacques Derrida]] offers for thinking the subaltern insomuch as he appertains to a classically philosophical interpretation of the subject, rather than a socio-political, cultural or historical interpretation, which might assume that the subject is always already the subject of the West.

Her  ''A Critique of Postcolonial Reason,'' published in 1999, explores how major works of European [[metaphysics]] (e.g., Kant, Hegel) not only tend to exclude the subaltern from their discussions, but actively prevent non-Europeans from occupying positions as fully human subjects.

Spivak coined the term "[[strategic essentialism]]," which refers to a sort of temporary solidarity for the purpose of social action. For example, the attitude that women's groups have many different agendas makes it difficult for feminists to work for common causes. "Strategic essentialism" is about the need to accept temporarily an "essentialist" position to be able to act. While others have built upon this idea of "strategic essentialism," Spivak has since retracted use of this term.

Spivak taught at several universities before arriving at Columbia in 1991.  She has been a [[Guggenheim fellow]], has received numerous academic honours including an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Oberlin College]],<ref>[http://www.oberlin.edu/commencement/ Oberlin College Commencement 2011 – Oberlin College]. Oberlin.edu. Retrieved on 21 June 2011.</ref> and has been on the editorial board of academic journals such as [[boundary 2]]. On 9 March 2007, Columbia University President [[Lee Bollinger]] appointed Spivak University Professor, the institution's highest faculty rank. In a letter to the faculty, he wrote,
{{cquote|Not only does her world-renowned scholarship—grounded in deconstructivist literary theory—range widely from critiques of post-colonial discourse to feminism, Marxism, and globalization; her lifelong search for fresh insights and understanding has transcended the traditional boundaries of discipline while retaining the fire for new knowledge that is the hallmark of a great intellect.}}

Spivak's writing has been described by some as opaque.<ref>[http://www.newpartisan.com/home/clarity-is-king-eric-adler-on-postmodernists-limpid-bursts.html Clarity Is King – Eric Adler on Postmodernists' Limpid Bursts]. New Partisan. Retrieved on 21 June 2011.</ref> It has also been suggested that her work puts style ahead of substance.<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/199908090039.html Death sentences]. New Statesman. Retrieved on 21 June 2011.</ref>

In her defence, it has been argued that this sort of criticism reveals an unwillingness to substantively engage with her texts.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n12/letters.html |journal=London Review of Books|volume =21|issue=12 |date=10 June 1999|title=letters}}</ref> [[Judith Butler]] has noted that Spivak's supposedly inaccessible language has, in fact, resonated with, and profoundly changed the thinking of, "tens of thousands of activists and scholars."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n13/letters.html |journal=London Review of Books|volume =21|issue=13 |date=1 July 1999|title=letters}}</ref> And Marxist literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]], who has called her writing "inaccessible," noted nevertheless that, "there can thus be few more important critics of our age than the likes of Spivak. [...] She has probably done more long-term political good, in pioneering feminist and post-colonial studies within global academia than almost any of her theoretical colleagues."<ref>Terry Eagleton, "[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n10/eagl01_.html In the Gaudy Supermarket]," ''London Review of Books'' (13 May 1999).</ref>

In speeches given and published since 2002, Spivak has addressed the issue of terrorism.  Clearly stating that her intention is to bring an end to suicide bombing, she has explored and, "tried to imagine what message [such acts] might contain."<ref name="terror">{{cite journal | title=Terror: A Speech After 9-11 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/boundary/v031/31.2spivak.html | volume=31 | issue=2 | journal=boundary 2 |publisher=Duke University Press | year=2004 | pages=93}}</ref> These ruminations have included descriptions such as: "Suicidal resistance is a message inscribed in the body when no other means will get through."<ref name="terror"/>

One critic has suggested that this sort of stylised language may serve to blur important moral issues relating to terrorism.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/276661721.html?dids=276661721:276661721&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jan+10%2C+2003&author=EDWARD+ALEXANDER&pub=Jerusalem+Post&edition=&startpage=09.A&desc=Evil+educators+defend+the+indefensible | work=Jerusalem Post | first=Edward | last=Alexander | title=Evil educators defend the indefensible | date=10 January 2003}}</ref> However, she stated in the text of the speech that, "Single coerced yet willed suicidal 'terror' is in excess of the destruction of dynastic temples and the violation of women, tenacious and powerfully residual.

Spivak founded The Pares Chandra Chakravorty Memorial Literacy Project Inc., a not-for-profit [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3) organisation]], in 1997, to provide a primary education of quality for children in some of the poorest regions of the globe, continuing work that Spivak had started doing in 1986.  The Project currently operates schools in rural areas of West Bengal, India. By setting up schools and giving sustained training to local teachers who operate them with the help of local supervisors, the Project seeks to offer children in these areas the resources to enter the mainstream education system for high school and beyond.

The Project is committed to using the existing state curriculum and textbooks to train teachers, in the belief that by using these materials they can better enable their students to enter the national education system on equal terms with others.  "Since India constantly brags about being the world's largest democracy, and this is a large sector of the electorate, what I'm trying to do is develop rituals of democratic habits," she said of the Project.<ref>Quoted in Liz McMillen, [http://www.wretch.cc/blog/shihlun/25427515 "The Education of Gayatri Spivak,"] ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' (14 September 2007) B16.</ref>

'''Munich''' ({{lang-de|Landkreis München}}) is a district in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. It borders (from the north and clockwise) the districts of [[Dachau (district)|Dachau]], [[Freising (district)|Freising]], [[Erding (district)|Erding]], [[Ebersberg (district)|Ebersberg]], [[Rosenheim (district)|Rosenheim]], [[Miesbach (district)|Miesbach]], [[Bad Tölz-Wolfratshausen]], [[Starnberg (district)|Starnberg]], [[Fürstenfeldbruck (district)|Fürstenfeldbruck]], and almost encircles (except for the west and northwest sides) district-free city [[Munich]] itself, which is the district seat.

==History==
The history of the region is connected to the city of Munich.

The district was established in 1852 and underwent several changes due to the ongoing incorporation of municipalities into the city of Munich. In 1972 the constant shrinking of the district was compensated by adding nine municipalities from the former district of Wolfratshausen.

==Geography==
The district is located in the east and the south of the city Munich, mostly covering the [[moraine]] plain around Munich. In the south of the district the foothills of the [[Alps]] start, which also contain the highest elevation of the district, two hills 703 m above sea level in the municipality Schäftlarn. The lowest elevation with 471 m is near Unterschleißheim in the north of the district. The main river is the [[Isar]], which also flows through the city of Munich.

The '''Principality of Achaea''' or '''of the [[Morea]]''' was one of the three [[vassal]] states of the [[Latin Empire]] which replaced the [[Byzantine Empire]] after the capture of [[Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]].<ref name="crusade-en">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Lock | first = Peter | title = Achaia | editor = Alan V.

After this, Achaea became for a while the dominant power in [[Greece]].

==Foundation==
[[File:Coa France Family William of Champlitte.svg|thumb|left|100px|Arms of the pretenders family of Savoia-Acaia, a branch of the [[Savoy family]]]]
Achaea was founded in 1205 by [[William of Champlitte]] and [[Geoffrey I of Villehardouin]], who undertook to conquer the [[Peloponnese]] on behalf of [[Boniface of Montferrat]], [[Kingdom of Thessalonica|King of Thessalonica]]. With a force of no more than 100 knights and 500 foot soldiers, they took [[Achaea]] and [[Elis]], and after defeating the local Greeks in the [[Battle of the Olive Grove of Koundouros]], became masters of the [[Morea]]. The victory was decisive, and after the battle all resistance from the locals was limited to a few forts, that continued to hold out. The fort  of [[Araklovon Castle|Araklovon]]<ref>Miller William (1908)''The Latins in the Levant : a history of Frankish Greece, 1204-1566'' E.P. Dutton and Company, New York. p38</ref> in [[Elis]], was defended by [[Doxapatres Boutsaras]] and withstood the attacks until 1213, when the garrison finally surrendered. The fort of [[Monemvasia]],  and the castles of [[Argos]], [[Nauplia]] and [[Acrocorinth|Corinth]] under [[Leo Sgouros]] held out until his suicide in 1208. By 1212, these too had been conquered, and organized as the lordship of [[Argos and Nauplia]], and only Monemvasia continued to hold out until 1248. William of Champlitte ruled Achaea until he departed for [[France]] to assume an inheritance, but died on the way there in 1209. He was succeeded by Geoffrey I of Villehardouin, who ruled until his own death in 1219.

==Organization of the Principality==

=== Territorial organization and feudal structure ===
[[File:Peloponnese Middle Ages map-en.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map of the Peloponnese with its principal locations during the late Middle Ages.]]
Achaea was rather small, consisting of the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula (then known as the [[Morea]]), but it was fairly wealthy, exporting wine, raisins, wax, honey, oil and silk. The capital of the principality was originally at [[Andravida]]. It was bordered on the north by [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] and the [[Duchy of Athens]] and surrounded by [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]-held territories in the [[Aegean Sea]], including the forts of [[Methoni, Messenia|Modon]] and [[Koroni|Coron]] on the Peloponnese.

In 1208/9, after Champlitte's departure, William I created a commission, composed of two Latin bishops, two bannerets and five Greek magnates and chaired by himself, to assess the land and divide it, according to Latin practice, in [[fief]]s. The resulting register was presented at a parliament held at the princely residence at [[Andravida]], and divided the country into twelve [[barony|baronies]], mostly centred around a newly constructed castle—a testament to the fact that the Franks were a military elite amidst a potentially hostile Greek population.<ref>Setton (1976), p. 30</ref><ref>Miller (1921), p. 71</ref> The twelve temporal barons were joined by seven ecclesiastic lords, headed by the [[Latin Archbishop of Patras]]. Each of the latter was granted a number of estates as [[knight]]ly fiefs, with the Archbishop receiving eight, the other bishops four each, and likewise four granted to each of the [[Military order (society)|military order]]s: the [[Templars]], [[Hospitallers]] and the [[Teutonic Knights]].<ref>Miller (1921), pp. 72–73</ref> The twelve secular baronies were:<ref name="Setton31">Setton (1976), p. 31</ref><ref>Miller (1921), pp. 71–72</ref>

Shortly after 1260, a thirteenth barony, that of [[Barony of Arcadia|Arcadia]] (modern [[Kyparissia]]) was established, which was also a personal fief of the Villehardouins.<ref name="Setton31"/> Aside from Kalamata (and later Arcadia), which became the Villehardouins' personal fief, the Prince's own domain encompassed the region of Elis, where the capital Andravida, the port of [[Glarentza]] (Clarence) and the fortress of [[Chlemoutsi]] (Clermont) were situated, [[Corinthia]], with the [[Acrocorinth]] as the chief site, as well as most of Messenia and Laconia around the fertile valley of [[Eurotas]]. When [[Tsakonia]] and the other mountainous regions of the southeast were subdued in the late 1240s, these too came under the Prince's control.<ref>Bon (1969), p. 104</ref>

The twelve barons retained considerable powers and privileges, so that the Prince was not an absolute sovereign but rather a "first among equals" among them. Thus they had the right to construct a castle without the Prince's permission, or to decree [[capital punishment]]. Since [[Salic Law]] was not adopted in Achaea, women could also inherit the fiefs.<ref>Miller (1921), p. 74</ref> The high secular and ecclesiastic lords formed the High Court (''la Haute Court'') of the principality, presided over by the Prince, which acted as the Prince's advisory council and judged affairs pertaining to [[feudal law]].<ref name="Setton32">Setton (1976), p. 32</ref><ref>Miller (1921), pp. 71, 72</ref> In addition, a Lower Court (''la Court de la Borgesie'') is mentioned, which abjudicated in matters of common law.<ref name="Setton32"/>

On the other hand, all vassals owed the Prince four months service in the field and four months garrison duty every year, retiring after the age of sixty, but only if a replacement could be provided. This put the principality on constant war footing. Indeed, the knights of Achaea enjoyed a considerable reputation both in the [[Levant]] and in Western Europe.<ref>Miller (1921), p. 72</ref><ref>Setton (1976), pp. 31–32</ref>

With the Byzantine recovery of the region around [[Mystras]] after 1261, however, the rapid extinction of the original families and the expansion of Achaean influence across [[Frankish Greece]], the initial organization of the Principate changed. By the time the principality's laws, the ''[[Assizes of Romania]]'', were codified in the 1330s, the peers of the Prince were: the [[Duke of Athens]], the [[Duke of Naxos]], the [[Triarchs of Negroponte]], the [[Marquisate of Bodonitsa|Margrave of Bodonitza]], the [[Count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos]], the barons of Patras, Matagrifon and Kalavryta, as well as the [[marshal]] of the principality.<ref name="Setton31"/>

===Government and administration===
[[File:Clarentia coin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Achaean ''[[tornese]]'' from Glarentza (Clarentia)]]
The most important secular and ecclesiastical lords participated in the council of  the "Grand Court", which was presided over by the Prince. The council had great authority, and its decisions were binding for the Prince. The Principality's higher officials were the [[chancellor]], the Prince's chief minister, the [[marshal]], the [[constable]], the treasurer, the ''[[protovestiarius]]'', in charge of the Prince's personal treasury, and the ''pourveur des chastiaux'', who was responsible for the replenishment of the castles.

The Principality also produced a unique set of laws, the "Assizes of Romania", which combined aspects of Byzantine and French law, and became the basis for the laws of the other Crusader States. Several [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|Byzantine titles]] such as ''[[logothete]]s'' and ''protovestarius'' continued in use, although these titles were adapted to fit the conceptions of Western [[feudalism]]. The Byzantine ''[[pronoia]]'' system was also adapted to fit Western feudalism; peasants (''paroikoi'') technically owned their land, but military duties and taxes that they had not been subject to under the ''pronoia'' system were imposed on them by their new French lords.

The Frankish barons were subjected to heavy military obligations. They had to serve four months each year with the Principality's army and further four months of guard duty on various castles.<ref>''Chronicle of the Morea'', verses 1995-2004</ref> They could not leave the Principality, except with the Prince's permission, and even then had to return within two years and two days or have their property confiscated.<ref>''Assizes'' Articles 111 & 120</ref>

==The Principality in the 13th century==
Geoffrey I was succeeded by his son [[Geoffrey II of Villehardouin|Geoffrey II]], who ruled until his death in 1245. By confiscating the ecclesiastical taxes, in the years 1221-1223 he built himself a powerful castle at [[Chlemoutsi]], near modern [[Kyllini, Elis|Kyllini]], which he used as his main residence. Because of this, he came into conflict with the Catholic Church, and was briefly excommunicated by the Pope. When [[John III Doukas Vatatzes|John III of Nicaea]] besieged Constantinople in 1236, Geoffrey II came to the aid of the [[Latin Empire]] with 100 knights, 800 archers and 6 vessels.

Under his son and successor, Prince [[William II Villehardouin]], the Principality reached its zenith. William was a [[poetry|poet]] and [[troubadour]], and his court had its own [[mint (coin)|mint]] at [[Glarentza]], and a flourishing literary culture, using a distinct form of spoken [[French language|French]]. In 1249, William II moved the capital of Achaea to the newly built fortress of [[Mistra]], near ancient [[Sparta]]. In 1255 he became embroiled in the [[War of the Euboeote Succession]], and in 1259 he allied with [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas|Michael II]], despot of Epirus, against [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]] of Nicaea. However, Michael II then deserted to join the Nicaean side, and William was taken prisoner at the [[Battle of Pelagonia]]. After Michael recaptured Constantinople in 1261, William was released in 1262 in return for Mistra and much of Laconia, which became a Byzantine province (the nucleus of the future [[Despotate of the Morea]]), as well as an oath of allegiance to the Emperor.

However, soon after his release, William broke his oath of allegiance, and begun seeking alliances with and help from various Western nations.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=rUs-hHd89xAC&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&ots=aeEFYKzXhg&dq=Constantine+brother+Michael+VIII#PPA49,M1 Bartusis, M.C., ''The Late Byzantine Army'' (1997), p. 49]</ref> Informed by the local Byzantine governor of William's actions, [[Michael VIII Palaeologus|Michael VIII]] sent an army under the command of his half-brother, [[Constantine Palaiologos (half-brother of Michael VIII)|Constantine]], against William, but the expedition was unsuccessful, the Byzantines first being routed at the [[Battle of Prinitza]] in 1263 and then, after Constantine's return to Constantinople, suffering a heavy defeat at the [[Battle of Makryplagi]] in 1264.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=rUs-hHd89xAC&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&ots=aeEFYKzXhg&dq=Constantine+brother+Michael+VIII#PPA50,M1 Bartusis, M.C., ''The Late Byzantine Army'' (1997), pp. 49-50]</ref><ref>Hooper, N. & Bennett, M., ''The Cambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare'' (1996), p. 104 [http://books.google.com/books?id=Sf8UIynR0koC&pg=PA104&lpg=PA104&dq=Battle+Prinitza&source=bl&ots=ThOwXY8RWP&sig=ISe9dhEMLx2tbh51oax8520Wd7k]</ref>

Despite his successes at Prinitza and Makryplagi, the war with the Byzantines had taken a toll on Achaean resources, and their empire remained a looming threat. A proposal to marry William's elder daughter [[Isabella of Villehardouin|Isabella]] to [[Andronikos II Palaiologos|Andronikos]], eldest son of Michael VIII, was strongly opposed by the Achaean nobility, who had no desire to come under Byzantine rule. Both William and his overlord [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]], now dispossessed of Constantinople, had hoped for aid from King [[Manfred of Sicily]], who had sent troops to aid William at Pelagonia. But Manfred fell under Papal sanction and was killed in 1266, when [[Charles of Anjou]] conquered his kingdom. Charles was now ascendant in Italy, and William and Baldwin came to terms with him in the [[Treaty of Viterbo]] (1267). In return for the military aid and funds they so greatly needed, Charles obtained the [[suzerainty]] over Achaea from Baldwin, and the Principality itself from William. The latter was to retain the Principality for life, and it was to pass to his daughter, Isabella, who was to marry one of Charles' sons.{{sfn|Setton|Wolff|Hazard|1969|pp=254–255}}

These were hard terms, essentially detaching Achaea from the Latin Empire and making it a dependency of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. Nonetheless, William fulfilled his obligations, leading an Achaean force to aid Charles against the invasion of [[Conradin]] at the [[Battle of Tagliacozzo]] (1268), and bringing Isabelle to Italy to marry Charles' son Philip in 1271.{{sfn|Setton|Wolff|Hazard|1969|p=256}} The military support of Charles allowed William to resist the Byzantines, and the last years of his reign were relatively quiet.{{sfn|Setton|Wolff|Hazard|1969|p=258}}

However, after the death of William in 1278, the seeds of a calamitous succession dispute were laid. In the normal course of events, Achaea would have passed to a [[cadet branch]] of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|House of Anjou]]. However, his son-in-law Philip had died in 1277 without an heir, and a reversionary clause in the Treaty of Viterbo provided that Charles of Anjou, rather than Isabelle, should this occur.{{sfn|Setton|Wolff|Hazard|1969|p=258}} Charles duly took possession of the Principality, which he ruled through a series of [[bailli]]s; he would never personally visit it.{{sfn|Setton|Wolff|Hazard|1969|p=259}}

A renewed commitment by Charles to retake the Latin Empire ([[Treaty of Orvieto]], 1281) was forestalled by the [[War of the Sicilian Vespers]], and this struggle with the [[Crown of Aragon]] consumed the remainder of his life. His son [[Charles II of Naples|Charles II]] succeeded him in Achaea as well as Sicily (now reduced to the [[Kingdom of Naples]]), but was a prisoner in Aragonese hands. In the interim, the rule of Achaea devolved upon a series of baillis chosen from the Morean nobility. Not long after his release and coronation in 1289, he granted the Principality to Isabelle of Villehardouin upon her marriage with [[Florent of Hainaut]], in part to redress the grasping application of the Treaty of Viterbo at William's death. However, he retained feudal overlordship over the Principality, and his grant provided that neither Isabelle nor any daughter who was her heir might marry without his consent.{{sfn|Setton|Wolff|Hazard|1969|p=260–261}}

==The feudal conflict of the Morea (1307-1383)==
For this period the principality was under a violent succession dispute, which originated from the dispossessed [[Latin Emperor]] Baldwin II's gift of the overlordship of Achaea to [[Charles I of Sicily]] in return for support in his attempt to reconquer the throne in [[Constantinople]], an action which ignored the rights of the [[Villehardouin family|Villehardouin]] Princes of Achaea. The [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]]  kings of Naples subsequently gave Achaea as their fief to a series of their own relatives and creatures, who fought against Princess [[Marguerite of Villehardouin, Lady of Akova|Margaret of Villehardouin]] and her heirs.

[[Charles II of Naples]] had at first granted the fiefdom of Morea or Achaea to Princess [[Isabella of Villehardouin]] (from the Villehardouin dynasty), but he deposed her in 1307 and granted it to his son [[Philip I of Taranto]], who in 1313 transferred it to Matilda (or Mafalda, or Maud) of Hainaut, heiress of Isabella of Villehardouin, who was married to [[Louis of Burgundy]], titular King of Thessalonica. But Margaret, younger daughter of [[William II Villehardouin]], claimed her rights from 1307. In 1313 she claimed them again without success and then transferred her rights to her daughter [[Isabelle of Sabran]], wife of [[Ferdinand of Majorca]]. The son of Ferdinand and Isabelle, known as [[James III of Majorca|James the Unfortunate]], was proclaimed prince of the Morea in 1315 under the regency of his father, who conquered the principality between 1315 and 1316 but was defeated and executed by Louis of Burgundy and Matilda in 1316. In 1316 Louis of Burgundy died and King [[Robert of Naples]] deposed Matilda and gave the principality to his brother [[John of Durazzo]], to whom Matilda was briefly married under duress before being imprisoned.

From 1331 the feudal lords began to recognize the rights of James, and in 1333 the recognition was total. Then John transferred his rights to his sister-in-law, [[Catherine II of Valois, Princess of Achaea|Catherine of Valois]], titular Empress of Constantinople, wife of Philip I of Taranto, whose stepson Robert claimed her rights until 1346 when she died. Then the claim was issued by the son of Philip and Catherine, [[Philip II of Taranto]]. In 1349 James was succeeded by his son [[James IV of Majorca|James IV]] (II of the Morea). In 1364 Robert of Taranto, stepson of Catherine and eldest surviving son of Philip I of Taranto, died. In 1373 Philip II transferred his rights to his cousin, overlord and former sister-in-law Queen [[Joan I of Naples]], whose third husband James IV of Majorca, when he died in 1375, left her his own claim to the principality, at which point she became more or less uncontested Princess of Achaea. However, when Joan was imprisoned in Naples in 1381, another, much younger, James, [[James of Baux]], grandson of Catherine and nephew of Philip II, who in 1374 had become titular Emperor of Constantinople, used the opportunity and seized Achaea. In 1383, Achaea was annexed by [[Charles III of Naples]], successor and murderer of Queen Joan of Naples, who was the grandson of John of Durazzo, and James of Baux was driven away. In 1383 the Vicary government began, lasting until 1396, under the Durazzo kings of Naples.

In 1404, [[Ladislaus of Naples|Ladislaus]], [[King of Naples]], installed [[Centurione II Zaccaria]], the lord of Arkadia (modern [[Kyparissia]]), as prince. Centurione continued to hold the post until 1430, when invasions by the Despots of the Morea, [[Constantine Palaiologos]] and [[Thomas Palaiologos]], conquered the heartland of the Principality in Achaea. Centurione married off his daughter and heiress, [[Catherine Zaccaria|Catherine]], to Thomas, and retreated to his ancestral Messenian castle. On his death in 1432, this too was seized by the Byzantines. In about 1450, his illegitimate son, [[John Zaccaria|John Asen]], was the focus  of rebellions against the despot [[Constantine XI|Constantine Dragases]]. The Byzantine reconquest proved short-lived, however, as in 1460, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] conquered the Despotate.

===Claimants to the Principality===
[[Ferdinand of Majorca]] began to claim the Principality from 1313 on behalf of his wife Isabelle of Sabran, daughter of Marguerite of Villehardouin, younger daughter of [[William II of Villehardouin|William II]] and sister to [[Isabella of Villehardouin]]. The claim passed to Ferdinand and Isabelle's son [[James III of Majorca|James III]] and thereafter to his son [[James IV of Majorca|James IV]]. He willed his claim to his wife Joan I of Naples, and after his death she held the title relatively without contest.

Although [[Philip I of Piedmont]] only held power in Achaea through his first wife, the title Prince of Achaea was claimed by his son by his second wife, [[James of Piedmont]], and subsequently his sons [[Philip II of Piedmont|Philip II]], [[Amadeo, Prince of Achaea|Amadeo]] and [[Louis of Piedmont|Louis]]. None of these three had sons and their claim died with Louis.

Centurione II willed his lands to [[Thomas Palaiologos]], [[Despot of the Morea]] and eventual titular [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine Emperor]], husband of his daughter Catherine Zaccaria. Thomas's son [[Andreas Palaiologos|Andreas]] later willed all of his titles to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]. Centurione II's bastard son [[John Asen Zaccaria]] claimed his father's title during the [[Morea revolt of 1453–54]].

[[File:Captain Cat.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A statue in Swansea's Maritime Quarter representing Thomas's fictional ''Captain Cat'']] 
'''''Under Milk Wood''''' is a 1954 [[radio drama]] by [[Welsh people|Welsh]] poet [[Dylan Thomas]], commissioned by the [[BBC]] and later adapted for the stage. A film version, ''[[Under Milk Wood (film)|Under Milk Wood]]'' directed by [[Andrew Sinclair]], was released in 1972.

An omniscient narrator invites the audience to listen to the dreams and innermost thoughts of the inhabitants of a fictional small Welsh fishing village Llareggub ("[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bugger_all bugger all]" backwards).

They include Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard, relentlessly nagging her two dead husbands; Captain Cat, reliving his seafaring times; the two Mrs Dai Breads; Organ Morgan, obsessed with his music; and Polly Garter, pining for her dead lover. Later, the town awakens and, aware now of how their feelings affect whatever they do, we watch them go about their daily business.

==Origins and development==
When Thomas was staying at [[New Quay]], [[Ceredigion]], in [[West Wales]], one winter, he went out early one morning into the still sleeping town and verses came to his mind about the inhabitants. He wrote the account of this as a short story named "Quite Early One Morning" (recorded for [[BBC Wales]] on 14 December 1944 and broadcast 31 August 1945). He continued to work on the idea for the remaining eight years of his life.

In 1931 a 17-year-old Dylan created a piece for the Swansea Grammar School magazine which included a conversation of Milk Wood stylings with Mussolini, Wife, Mr. Pritchard & Mr. Ogmore. In it are lines which are near identical to those that would later be found in Milk Wood. A year later in 1932, Dylan talks at length with his mentor and friend 'The socialist grocer of Brynmill' Bert Trick about creating a play about a Welsh seaside town. At Bert Trick's bungalow in Caswell, Gower in 1933 Dylan reads an embryonic 'Under Milk Wood'.

In an interview with Colin Edwards, Bert Trick recalls:
“He read it to Nell and me in our bungalow at Caswell around the old Dover stove, with the paraffin lamps lit at night … the story was then called Llareggub, which was a mythical village in South Wales, a typical village, with terraced houses with one ty bach to about five cottages, and the various characters coming out and emptying the slops and exchanging greetings and so on; that was the germ of the idea which … developed into Under Milkwood. (Dylan Remembered Volume 1, page 165)

In "Quite Early One Morning" there are numerous ideas and characters that would be further developed for ''Under Milk Wood.'' For instance, the short story includes a 28-line poem, of which this is the fourth verse (the name and the final line reappear in ''Under Milk Wood''):

:Open the curtains, light the fire, what are servants for?
:I am Mrs Ogmore Pritchard and I want another snooze.
:Dust the china, feed the canary, sweep the drawing-room floor;
:And before you let the sun in, mind he wipes his shoes.

Thomas wrote to his wife, Caitlin (about 23 May 1953, from the United States, on notepaper from the Poetry Centre), towards the end of a long letter:<ref>Paul Ferris (ed.), ''Dylan Thomas: The Collected Letters''. Macmillan, 1985.</ref> "I've finished that infernally eternally unfinished 'Play' & have done it in New York with actors."

He had, in fact, promised to deliver the work on his arrival in New York on 21 April, but had completed it, in the afternoon of the day it was to be premiered, only after being locked in a room to finish it by his literary agent Liz Reitell{{spaced ndash}} the last lines of the script were handed to the actors as they were putting on their make-up.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book|title=Fatal Neglect: Who Killed Dylan Thomas? |first=David N. |last=Thomas |publisher=Seren |year=2008|ISBN=978-1854114808}}</ref>

The same year, he read a part of the script in public for the first time in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], at The Poetry Centre. Soon after, with others, he sound-recorded a performance at the [[92nd Street Y]] in [[New York City]], [[New York]].

On 9 September 1953, he delivered a full draft of ''Under Milk Wood'' to the [[BBC]] as he left for a tour of America, intending to revise the manuscript on his return. But on 9 November 1953 he died in New York City.

Thomas is reported to have commented that ''Under Milk Wood'' was developed in response to the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], as a way of reasserting the evidence of beauty in the world{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}.

==Llareggub==
[[File:Llareggub boat.jpg|thumb|upright|A boat bearing the name of the fictional location of ''Under Milk Wood'']]
The fictional name ''Llareggub'' bears some resemblance to many actual [[List of towns in Wales#L|Welsh place names]], which often begin with ''Llan-'' (meaning Church{{spaced ndash}} more correctly, a holy site, not just a church building, which is "Eglwys") although, being technical it translates as 'demesne'. somewhere built around a church or chapel and not quite big enough to be a village, but the name was actually derived by reversing the phrase "bugger all". In early published editions of the play, it was often rendered (contrary to Thomas's wishes) as ''Llaregyb'' or similar. A double-g is not used in written [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. If the name were to be pronounced in Welsh as spoken in South Wales, it would be {{IPA-cy|?a?re????b|}}.

The geographical inspiration for the town has generated intense debate. [[Laugharne]] was the village where Thomas lived intermittently from the 1930s. This town was probably the inspiration for the people of Llareggub, although the [[topography]] of the town is thought to be based on New Quay, where Thomas was staying when he started writing the play seriously in 1944. Both towns use the ''Under Milk Wood'' association to attract tourists, hence the rivalry, and [[The Dylan Thomas Trail]] has been opened in New Quay.<ref>''The Dylan Thomas Trail'', Y Lolfa, 2002.</ref>

More recent research has indicated that most of the first half of the play was written in [[South Leigh]], [[Oxfordshire]], whilst the second half was mostly written in America in May 1953. Fewer than 300 lines were written in Laugharne.<ref>See pp. 285-313 of D. N. Thomas (2004), ''Dylan Remembered 1935-53'', vol. 2, Seren, as well as published articles collected at http://undermilkwood.webs.com.</ref>

Thomas drew a sketch map of the fictional town. This is now at the [[National Library of Wales]] and can be viewed online.<ref>[http://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id=dylanthomasandthemapofllar Dylan's Llareggub map at The National Library of Wales's website].</ref>

The name Llareggub was first used by Thomas in a short story ''The Burning Baby''<ref>''The Burning Baby''. Dated October 1934 in the "Red Notebook" and first published in the magazine ''Contemporary Poetry and Prose,'' issue for May 1936. This information listed by [[Walford Davies]] in ''Dylan Thomas: Collected Stories''. Phoenix, 2000.</ref> published in 1936. ("Death took hold of his sister's legs as she walked through the calf-high heather up the hill... She was to him as ugly as the sowfaced woman Llareggub who had taught him the terrors of the flesh.")

In the play, the Rev Eli Jenkins writes a poem that describes Llareggub Hill and its "mystic [[tumulus]]". This was based on a lyrical description of [[Twmbarlwm]]'s "mystic tumulus" in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] that Thomas imitated from [[Arthur Machen]]'s autobiography ''Far Off Things'' (1922).<ref>Dylan Thomas, ''Under Milk Wood, The Definitive Edition'' (Dent: 1995), p. 91.</ref>

The town's name is the inspiration for the country of [[Llamedos]] (sod 'em all) in Terry Pratchett's [[Discworld]]. In this setting, Llamedos is a parody of Wales.

==Plot==
The play opens at night, when the citizens of Llareggub are asleep. The narrator (First Voice/Second Voice) informs the audience that they are witnessing the townspeople's dreams.

Captain Cat, the blind sea captain, is tormented in his dreams by his drowned shipmates, who long to live again and enjoy the pleasures of the world. Mog Edwards and Myfanwy Price dream of each other; Mr. Waldo dreams of his childhood and his failed marriages; Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard dreams of her deceased husbands. Almost all of the characters in the play are introduced as the audience witnesses a moment of their dreams.

Morning begins. The voice of a guide introduces the town, discussing the facts of Llareggub.  The Reverend Eli Jenkins delivers a morning sermon on his love for the village. Lily Smalls wakes and bemoans her pitiful existence. Mr. and Mrs. Pugh observe their neighbors; the characters introduce themselves as they act in their morning. Mrs. Cherry Owen merrily rehashes her husband's drunken antics. Butcher Beynon teases his wife during breakfast. Captain Cat watches as Willy Nilly the postman goes about his morning rounds, delivering to Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard, Mrs. Pugh, Mog Edwards and Mr. Waldo ("It's another paternity summons").

At Mrs. Organ-Morgan's general shop, women gossip about the townspeople. Willy Nilly and his wife steam open a love letter from Mog Edwards to Myfanwy Price; he expresses fear that he may be in the poor house if his business does not improve. Mrs. Dai Bread Two swindles Mrs. Dai Bread One with a bogus fortune in her crystal ball. Polly Garter scrubs floors and sings about her past paramours. Children play in the schoolyard; Gwennie urges the boys to "kiss her where she says or give her a penny." Gossamer Beynon and Sinbad Sailors privately desire each other.

During dinner, Mr. Pugh imagines poisoning Mrs. Pugh. Mrs. Organ-Morgan shares the day's gossip with her husband, but his only interest is the organ. The audience sees a glimpse of Lord Cut-Glass's insanity in his "kitchen full of time". Captain Cat dreams of his lost lover, Rosie Probert, but weeps as he remembers that she will not be with him again. Nogood Boyo fishes in the bay, dreaming of Mrs. Dai Bread Two and geishas.

On Llareggub Hill, Mae Rose Cottage spends a lazy afternoon wishing for love. Reverend Jenkins works on the White Book of Llareggub, which is a history of the entire town and its citizens. On the farm, Utah Watkins struggles with his cattle, aided by Bessie Bighead. As Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard falls asleep, her husbands return to her. Mae Rose Cottage swears that she will sin until she explodes.

[[File:The Seahorse Inn, previously known as the Sailor's Home Arms - Geograph-2675847.jpg|thumb|The Sailor's Home Arms, [[New Quay]], now known as the Seahorse Inn, which provided the name for the Sailors Arms.<ref>[http://www.newquay-westwales.co.uk/trail.htm The Dylan Thomas Trail in New Quay, West Wales.]</ref>]]

As night begins, Reverend Jenkins recites another poem. Cherry Owen heads to the Sailor's Arms, where Sinbad still longs for Gossamer Beynon. The town prepares for the evening, to sleep or otherwise. Mr. Waldo sings drunkenly at the Sailors Arms. Captain Cat sees his drowned shipmates—and Rosie—as he begins to sleep. Organ-Morgan mistakes Cherry Owen for [[Bach|Johann Sebastian Bach]] on his way to the chapel. Mog and Myfanwy write to each other before sleeping. Mr. Waldo meets Polly Garter in a forest. Night begins and the citizens of Llareggub return to their dreams again.

==Productions==
The play had its first reading on stage on 14 May 1953, in New York City, at The Poetry Center at the [[92nd Street Y]].<ref>''Dylan Thomas: The Collected Letters'' edited by Paul Ferris. Macmillan 1985. Footnote by editor.</ref> Thomas himself read the parts of the First Voice and the Reverend Eli Jenkins. Almost as an afterthought, the performance was recorded on a single-microphone tape recording (the microphone was laid at front center on the stage floor) and later issued by the Caedmon company. It is the only known recorded performance of ''Under Milk Wood'' with Thomas as a part of the cast. A studio recording, planned for 1954, was precluded by Thomas's death in November 1953.<ref>"Dylan Thomas Unabridged: The Caedmon Collection", [http://www.greenmanreview.com/book/book_thomas_caedmonaudio.html ''Green Man Review''.]</ref>

The BBC first broadcast ''Under Milk Wood,'' a new "'Play for Voices", on the [[Third Programme]] on 25 January 1954 (two months after Thomas's death), although several sections were omitted. The play was recorded with a distinguished, all-Welsh cast including [[Richard Burton]] as 'First Voice', with production by [[Douglas Cleverdon]]. A repeat was broadcast two days later. [[Daniel Jones (composer)|Daniel Jones]], the Welsh composer who was a lifelong friend of Thomas's (and his literary trustee), wrote the music; this was recorded separately, on 15 and 16 January, at Laugharne School. The play won the [[Prix Italia]] award for radio drama that year.<ref>[http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2008/pdf/vincitori_edizionipassate_en.pdf Prix Italia "PAST EDITIONS&nbsp;— WINNERS 1949 - 2007"]</ref> In 1963, the original radio producer, Douglas Cleverdon, revisited the project and recorded the complete play, which was broadcast on 11 October 1963.

The [[Under Milk Wood (film)|1972 film adaptation]], with Burton reprising his role, also featured [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Glynis Johns]], [[Vivien Merchant]], and other well-known actors, and [[Ryan Davies]] as the "Second Voice". The movie was filmed on location in [[Fishguard]], [[Pembrokeshire]], and at [[Lee International Film Studios]], London.

In 1988, [[George Martin]] produced an album version, featuring more of the dialogue being sung, with music by Martin and [[Elton John]], among others; [[Anthony Hopkins]] played the part of "First Voice". This was subsequently done as a one-off stage performance (as ''An Evening with Dylan Thomas''), for [[The Prince's Trust]] and in the presence of HRH Prince Charles, to commemorate the opening in December 1992 of the new [[AIR Studios]] at Lyndhurst Hall. It was again produced by Martin and directed by Hopkins, who once again played 'First Voice'. Other roles were played by [[Harry Secombe]], [[Freddie Jones]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], [[Siân Phillips]], [[Jonathan Pryce]], [[Alan Bennett]] and, especially for the occasion, singer [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]. The performance was recorded for television (directed by [[Declan Lowney]]) but has never been shown.

In 1992, [[Brightspark Productions]] released a 50-minute animation version, using an earlier BBC soundtrack with Burton as narrator. This was commissioned by [[S4C]] (a Welsh-language public service broadcaster). Music was composed specially by Trevor Herbert, and performed by Treorchy Male Voice Choir and the Welsh Brass Consort. Producer Robert Lyons. Director, Les Orton. It was made by Siriol Productions in association with Onward Productions and BBC Pebble Mill. This was released on DVD in October 2008. DVD ref: 5 037899 005798.

In 1997, [[Australia]]n pianist and composer [[Tony Gould]]'s adaptation of ''Under Milk Wood'' (written for narrator and chamber orchestra) was first performed by actor [[John Stanton (actor)|John Stanton]] and the [[Queensland Philharmonic Orchestra]].<ref>[http://www.tonygould.com.au/biography.htm].</ref>

In November 2003, as part of their commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of Thomas's death, the BBC broadcast a new production of the play, imaginatively combining new actors with the original 1954 recording of Burton playing "First Voice". (Broadcast 15 November 2003, [[BBC Radio 4]]; repeated 24 December 2004.) Digital noise reduction technology allowed Burton's part to be incorporated unobtrusively into the new recording, which was intended to represent Welsh voices more realistically than the original.

In 2006, Austrian composer Akos Banlaky composed an opera with the [[libretto]] based on the German translation by [[Erich Fried]] (''Unter dem Milchwald'', performed at [[Tiroler Landestheater Innsbruck|Tiroler Landestheater]] in [[Innsbruck]], Austria).

In 2008, a ballet version of ''Under Milk Wood'' by [[Independent Ballet Wales]] toured the UK. It was choreographed by Darius James with music by British composer [[Thomas Hewitt Jones]]. A suite including music from the ballet was recorded by Court Lane Music in 2009.

In 2009 and 2010, a translation in Dutch by the Belgian writer [[Hugo Claus]] was performed on stage by Jan Decleir and Koen De Sutter on a theatre tour in Belgium and the Netherlands (e.g. the Zeeland Late-Summer Festival, the Vooruit in Ghent, etc.).

In 2010, a one-woman production of the text was performed at the Sidetrack Theatre in [[Sydney]], Australia, presented by Bambina Borracha Productions and directed by Vanessa Hughes. Actress Zoe Norton Lodge performed all 64 characters in the play.<ref>[http://www.ozbabyboomers.com.au/theatre/2010/07_10/milk/milk.html Reviewed by John Rozentals], Oz Baby Boomers, 5 July 2010.</ref>

Presented by the Ottawa Theatre School in March 2011, directed by Janet Irwin and featuring the graduating class of the Ottawa Theatre School, as well as other Ottawa Actors.

In July 2011, Progress Youth Theatre (Reading, Berkshire, UK) performed a stage adaptation of the radio script. All visual aspects, such as stage directions, costume, set and lighting design were therefore devised entirely by the youth theatre. The voice parts were shared equally between seven actors, with other actors playing multiple "named" parts (with the exception of Captain Cat, who remained on stage throughout the production).

The BBC Formula 1 introduction to the 2011 Singapore Grand Prix features extracts of the audio for their opening VT.

In 2012, the [[Sydney Theatre Company]] staged a production starring [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as First Voice and [[Sandy Gore]] as Second Voice, with a cast including [[Bruce Spence]], [[Paula Arundell]], [[Drew Forsythe]], [[Alan John]], and [[Helen Thomson]].<ref>[http://blogs.crikey.com.au/curtaincall/2012/05/29/review-under-milk-wood-drama-theatre-sydney/ Lloyd Bradford Syke, "Review: Under Milk Wood | Drama Theatre, Sydney"], Crikey, 29 May 2012.</ref> The production was staged in the Drama Theatre of the [[Sydney Opera House]].

In 2012, Gould's 1997 adaptation of ''Under Milk Wood'' (written for narrator and chamber orchestra) was again performed by actor John Stanton as part of the [[Victorian College of the Arts Secondary School]]'s, inaugural performance at the [[Melbourne Recital Centre]]. Gould played piano and worked with the students as a musical mentor.

Guy Masterson of Theater Tours International, has produced and performed a solo version of the play over 2,000 times since its world premier in 1994. It has been performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in 1994, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2007 and 2010; in [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]] in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2012; and in London`s [[West End of London|West End]] [[Arts Theatre]].<ref>[http://www.theatretoursinternational.com/]</ref>

In October 2014 the [[BBC]] launched an interactive [[ebook]] entitled [[Dylan Thomas]]: The Road To Milk Wood, written by Jon Tregenna and Robin Moore. It deals with the journey from [[Swansea]] via the [[BBC]] to [[New York]] and beyond. <ref>https://itunes.apple.com/gb/book/bbc-dylan-thomas-road-to-milk/id928536953?mt=11&ls=1</ref>

In [[economics]], '''bimetallism''' is a [[monetary standard]] in which the value of the [[monetary unit]] is defined as equivalent both<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]], [http://oed.com/view/Entry/19090?redirectedFrom=bimetallism# bimetallism],  "The system of allowing the unrestricted currency of two metals (e.g. gold and silver) at a fixed ratio to each other, as coined money."</ref> to a certain quantity of gold and to a certain quantity of silver; such a system establishes a fixed rate of exchange between the two metals. The defining characteristics of bimetallism are<ref>Velde and Webber, A Model of Bimetallism, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Research Department</ref>
* Both gold and silver money are [[legal tender]] in unlimited amounts.
* The government will convert both gold and silver into legal tender coins at a fixed rate for individuals in unlimited quantities.  This is called free coinage because the quantity is unlimited, even if a fee is charged.
The combination of these conditions distinguishes bimetallism from a ''limping standard'', where both gold and silver are legal tender but only one is freely coined (example: France, Germany, or the United States after 1873), or ''trade money'' where both metals are freely coined but only one is legal tender and the other is trade money (example: most of the coinage of western Europe from the 1200s to 1700s.)  Economists also distinguish legal bimetallism, where the law guarantees these conditions, and de facto bimetallism where both gold and silver coins actually circulate at a fixed rate.

Bimetallism was intended to increase the supply of money, stabilize prices, and facilitate setting exchange rates.<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, Bimetallism</ref>  Some authors, such as [[Angela Redish]]<ref>Redish, Angela, 1995, “The persistence of bimetallism in nineteenth century France”. Economic History Review, 717–736</ref> or [[Charles Kindleberger]]<ref>Kindleberger, Charles, 1984, A financial history of Western Europe, London: Allen and Unwin.</ref> have argued that bimetallism was, by construction, unstable. Changes in gold-silver exchange were, in their eyes, leading to massive changes in the money supply. Bimetallism was thus inherently flawed and the advent of the [[gold standard]] was inevitable. This view has been challenged by Friedman<ref>Friedman, Milton, 1990, “Bimetallism Revisited”, Journal of Economic Perspectives, American Economic Association, 4(4), 85–104.</ref> and Flandreau<ref>Flandreau, Marc, 1996, “The French Crime of 1873: An Essay on the Emergence of the International Gold Standard, 1870–1880”, The Journal of Economic History, 56(4), 862–897.</ref> who wrote that the option to pay in gold or in silver had in fact a stabilizing effect.

==Argentina==
In 1881, a currency reform in [[Argentina]] introduced a bimetallic standard, which went into effect in July 1883.<ref name="acbsms46">{{cite web|last1=della Paolera|first1=Gerardo|last2=Taylor|first2=Alan M.|title=The Argentine Currency Board and the Search for Macroeconomic Stability, 1880–1935|url=http://www.nber.org/chapters/c8835.pdf|publisher=University of Chicago Press|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64JrNBdam|archivedate=2011-12-30|pages=46–48|year=2001}}</ref> Units of gold and silver [[peso]]s would exchange with paper peso notes at given par values, and fixed exchange rates against key international currencies would thus be established.<ref name="acbsms46"/> Unlike many metallic standards the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue.<ref name="acbsms46"/> The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes.<ref name="acbsms46"/> The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the Argentine government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it.<ref name="acbsms46"/>

==France==
An 1803 French law granted anyone who brought gold or silver to its mint the right to have it coined at a nominal charge over the official rate of 5 grams of 0.9 silver per franc or 3100 francs per kilogram of 0.9 fine gold.<ref name=Leavens>Dickson Leavens, Silver Money, Chapter IV Bimetallism in France and the Latin Monetary Union, page 25</ref>   This effectively established a bimetallic standard at the rate which had been used for French coinage since 1785, i.e. a relative valuation of gold to silver of 15.5 to 1.  This rate was still close to the market rate in 1803, but for most of the next half century the market rate was above 15.5 to 1.<ref name=Leavens />  As a consequence, silver powered the French economy and gold was exported.  Then the [[California Gold Rush|Forty-Niners]] went to California and found enough gold to make it a less precious metal.  Now the market rate fell below 15.5 to 1 and stayed there until 1866.  Frenchmen responded by exporting silver to India and importing nearly two-fifths of the world’s production of gold in the period from 1848 to 1870.<ref name=Levens26>Dickson Leavens, op. cit. page 26</ref>  Napoleon III introduced five franc gold coins which provided a substitute for the silver five franc coins which were hoarded<ref>John Porteous, Coins in History, page 238</ref> but still maintained the formal bimetalism implicit in the 1803 law.

==Latin Monetary Union==
The national coinages introduced in Belgium (1832), Switzerland (1850), and Italy (1861) were based on France’s bimetallic currency. These countries joined France in a treaty signed on 23 December 1865 which established the [[Latin Monetary Union]](LMU).<ref name=Levens26 />  Greece joined the LMU in 1868 and about twenty other countries adhered to its standards.<ref>Robert Friedberg, Gold Coins of the World, fourth edition, page 11</ref>  The LMU effectively adopted bimetallism by allowing unlimited free coinage of gold and silver at the 15.5 to 1 rate used in France, but also began to back away from bimetallism by allowing limited issues of low denomination silver coins struck to a lower standard for government accounts.<ref name=Porteous241>John Porteous, op. cit.  page 241</ref>  A surplus of silver led the LMU to limit free coinage of silver in 1874 and to end it in 1878, effectively abandoning bimetallism for the gold standard.<ref name=Porteous241/>

==United States==
In 1787 the [[United States Constitution]] established gold and silver as the [[legal tender]] of the [[United States]]<ref>[http://www.constitution.org/constit_.htm#con1.10.1.5 U.S. Constitution]</ref> at a [[floating exchange rate]]. Then in 1792, Secretary of the Treasury [[Alexander Hamilton]] proposed [[price fixing|fixing]] the silver to gold [[exchange rate]] at 15:1, as well as establishing the [[United States mint|mint]] for the public services of [[Free Silver|free coinage]] and [[currency]] [[regulation]] "in order not to abridge the quantity of circulating medium.".<ref>2 Annals of Cong. 2115 (1789–1791), cited in [[Arthur Nussbaum]], [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1116782?seq=3 The Law of the Dollar], ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', Vol. 37, No. 7 (Nov., 1937), pp. 1057–1091</ref> With its acceptance, [[Wikisource:United States Statutes at Large/Volume 1/2nd Congress/1st Session/Chapter 16|Sec.11]] of the [[Coinage Act of 1792]] established: "That the proportional value of gold to silver in all coins which shall by law be current as money within the United States, shall be as fifteen to one, according to quantity in weight, of pure gold or pure silver;" the proportion had slipped by [[Coinage Act of 1834|1834]] to sixteen to one. Bimetallism was effectively abandoned by the [[Coinage Act of 1873]], but not formally outlawed as legal currency until the early 20th century.  The merits of the system were the subject of debate in the late 19th century. If the market forces of supply and demand for either metal caused its bullion value to exceed its nominal currency value, it [[Gresham's Law|tends to disappear from circulation]] by hoarding or melting down.

===Political debate===
In the United States, bimetallism became a center of political conflict toward the end of the 19th century. During the [[US Civil War|Civil War]], to finance the war the U.S. switched from bimetallism to a [[fiat money]] currency. After the war, in 1873, the government passed the [[Coinage Act of 1873|Fourth Coinage Act]] and soon resumption of specie payments began without the free and unlimited coinage of silver. This put the U.S. on a mono-metallic gold standard. This angered the proponents of monetary silver, known as the [[silverite]]s. They referred to this act as "The Crime of '73," as it was judged to have inhibited inflation. The [[Panic of 1893]] was a severe nationwide depression that brought the money issue to the fore. The "silverites" argued that using silver would inflate the money supply and mean more cash for everyone, which they equated with prosperity.  The gold advocates said silver would permanently depress the economy, but that [[sound money]] produced by a [[gold standard]] would restore prosperity.
[[Image:1896GOP.JPG|thumb|380px|right|1896 Republican poster warns against free silver.]]

Bimetallism and "[[Free Silver]]" were demanded by [[William Jennings Bryan]] who took over leadership of the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in 1896, as well as the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] and [[Silver Republican Party|Silver Republican]] Parties. The [[History of United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] nominated [[William McKinley]] on a platform supporting the gold standard which was favored by financial interests on the East Coast. A faction of Republicans from silver mining regions in the West known as the Silver Republicans endorsed Bryan.

Bryan, the eloquent champion of the cause, gave the famous [[Cross of Gold speech|"Cross of Gold" speech]] at the National Democratic Convention on July 9, 1896 asserting that "The gold standard has slain tens of thousands." He referred to "a struggle between 'the idle holders of idle capital’ and 'the struggling masses, who produce the wealth and pay the taxes of the country;’ and, my friends, the question we are to decide is: Upon which side will the Democratic party fight?" At the [[peroration]], he said "You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold."  However, his presidential campaign was ultimately unsuccessful; this can be partially attributed to the discovery of the cyanide process by which gold could be extracted from low grade ore. This process and the discoveries of large gold deposits in South Africa ([[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] of 1887 - with large-scale production starting in 1898) and the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] (1896) increased the world gold supply and the subsequent increase in money supply that free coinage of silver was supposed to bring. The McKinley campaign was effective at persuading voters that poor economic progress and unemployment would be exacerbated by adoption of the Bryan platform. 1896 saw the election of McKinley. The direct link to gold was abandoned in 1934 in [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|FDR]]’s [[New Deal]] program and later the link was broken by [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] when he [[Nixon Shock|closed the gold window]].

===Economic analysis===
In 1992, economist [[Milton Friedman]] concluded that abandonment of the bimetallic standard in 1873 led to greater price instability than would have occurred otherwise, and thus resulted in long-term harm to the US economy.  His retrospective analysis led him to write that the act of 1873 "... was a mistake that had highly adverse consequences."<ref>Milton Friedman, ''Money Mischief'' (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1992) 78.</ref>

'''Harold Eugene''' "'''Hal'''" '''Roach, Sr.''' (January 14, 1892&nbsp;– November 2, 1992) was an American film and television producer, director, and actor from the 1910s to the 1990s, best known today for producing the [[Laurel and Hardy]] and ''[[Our Gang]]'' (later known as ''[[The Little Rascals]]'') film comedy series.

==Early life and career==
Hal Roach was born in [[Elmira, New York]], the grandson of Irish immigrants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laurelandhardycentral.com/roach2.htm |title=Hal Roach |publisher=Laurelandhardycentral.com |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2012}}</ref> A presentation by the great American [[List of humorists|humorist]] [[Mark Twain]] impressed Roach as a young [[Primary education|grade school]] student.

After an adventurous youth that took him to [[Alaska]], Hal Roach arrived in Hollywood, California in 1912 and began working as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]] in [[silent film]]s. Upon coming into an inheritance, he began producing [[short film|short comedies]] in 1915 with his friend [[Harold Lloyd]], who portrayed a character known as Lonesome Luke.

In September 1916 Roach married actress [[Marguerite Nichols]]. They had two children, [[Hal Roach, Jr.|Hal Jr.]] (June 15, 1918 – March 29, 1972) and Margaret M. Roach (March 15, 1921 – November 22, 1964). After 26 years of marriage, Marguerite died in 1940.<ref name="articles.sun-sentinel.com">http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-11-03/news/9202270379_1_hal-roach-studios-bridget-anderson-hardy-film</ref>

Roach married a second time on September 1, 1942, to Lucille Prin (January 20, 1913 – April 4, 1981), a Los Angeles secretary.<ref name="WedsPrin">{{cite news |title=Movie Producer Married at 50 To Secretary, 29 |work=[[Coshocton Tribune|The Coshocton Tribune]]| location=Ohio |page=5 |date=September 1, 1942}}</ref> They were married at the on-base home of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Franklin C. Wolfe and his wife at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright-Patterson Airfield]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]] where Roach was stationed at the time while serving as a major in the [[US Army Air Corps]].<ref name="WedsPrin"/> They had four children, Elizabeth Carson Roach (December 26, 1945 – September 5, 1946), [[Maria May Roach]] (April 14, 1947),<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0139453/bio</ref> Jeanne Alice Roach (October 7, 1949), and Kathleen Bridget Roach (January 29, 1951).<ref name="articles.sun-sentinel.com"/>

==Success as a comedy producer==
Unable to expand his studios in [[downtown Los Angeles]] because of [[zoning]], Roach purchased what became the Hal Roach Studios from [[Harry Culver]] in [[Culver City, California]]. During the 1920s and 1930s, he employed Lloyd (his top money-maker until his departure in 1923), [[Will Rogers]], [[Max Davidson]], the [[Our Gang]] kids, [[Charley Chase]], [[Harry Langdon]], [[Thelma Todd]], [[ZaSu Pitts]], [[Patsy Kelly]] and, most famously, [[Laurel and Hardy]]. During the 1920s Roach's biggest rival was producer [[Mack Sennett]]. In 1925 Roach hired away Sennett's supervising director, [[F. Richard Jones]].

Roach released his films through [[Pathé Exchange]] until 1927, when he went to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. He converted his silent movie studio to sound in late 1928 and began releasing talking shorts early in 1929. In the days before dubbing, foreign language versions of the Roach comedies were created by reshooting each film in the Spanish, French, and sometimes Italian and German languages. Laurel & Hardy, Charley Chase, and the Our Gang kids (some of whom had barely begun school) were required to recite the foreign dialogue phonetically, often working from blackboards hidden off camera.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In 1931, with the release of the Laurel & Hardy film ''[[Pardon Us]]'', Roach began producing occasional full-length features alongside the short product. Short subjects became less profitable and were phased out by 1936, save for ''Our Gang''. In 1937, Roach conceived a joint business venture partnering with [[Vittorio Mussolini]], son of fascist Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] to form a production company called "R.A.M" (Roach and Mussolini). This proposed business alliance with Mussolini caused MGM to intervene and force Roach to pay his way out of the venture. This embarrassment, coupled with the underperformance of much of Roach's new feature product (save for Laurel & Hardy films and the odd non-L&H hit such as 1937's ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]''), led to the end of Roach's relationship with MGM.<ref name="MGMsale">Ward, Richard Lewis (2005). ''A History of Hal Roach Studios''. Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press. Pg. 97–102, 116, 225. ISBN 0-8093-2637-X.</ref> In May 1938, Roach ended his distribution contract with MGM, selling them the production rights to, and actors' contracts for, ''Our Gang'' in the process, and signed with [[United Artists]].<ref name="MGMsale" />

From 1937 to 1940, Roach concentrated on producing glossy features, abandoning low comedy almost completely. Most of his new films were either sophisticated farces (like ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]'' and ''[[The Housekeeper's Daughter]]'') or rugged action fare (like ''Captain Fury''  and ''[[One Million B.C.]]''). Roach's one venture into heavy drama was the acclaimed ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]''. The Laurel and Hardy comedies, once the Roach studio's biggest drawing cards, were now the studio's ''least'' important product and were phased out altogether in 1940.

In 1940, Roach experimented with medium-length [[featurette]]s, running 40 to 50 minutes each. He contended that these "[[Hal Roach's Streamliners|streamliners]]", as he called them, would be useful in [[double-feature]] situations where the main attraction was a longer-length epic. Exhibitors agreed with him, and used Roach's mini-features to balance top-heavy double bills. United Artists continued to release Roach's streamliners through 1943. By this time Roach no longer had a resident company of comedy stars, and cast his films with familiar featured players ([[William Tracy]] and [[Joe Sawyer]], [[Johnny Downs]], [[Jean Porter (actress)|Jean Porter]], [[Frank Faylen]], [[William Bendix]], [[George E. Stone]], etc.).

==World War II and television==
Hal Roach, Sr. was called to active military duty in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] in June 1942, at age 50, and the studio output he oversaw in uniform was converted from entertainment featurettes to military training films. The studios were leased to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]], and the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] made 400 training, morale and propaganda films at "Fort Roach". Members of the unit included [[Ronald W. Reagan]] and [[Alan Ladd]]. After the war the government returned the studio, and the millions of dollars of improvements it had made to it, to Roach.<ref name="betancourt201203">{{cite web | url=http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/World-War-II-The-Movie.html?c=y&story=fullstory | title=World War II: The Movie | work=Air & Space | date=March 2012 | accessdate=September 27, 2013 | author=Betancourt, Mark}}</ref>

In 1946, Hal Roach resumed motion picture production, with former Harold Lloyd co-star [[Bebe Daniels]] as an associate producer. Roach was the first Hollywood producer to go to an all-color production schedule, making four streamliners in [[Cinecolor]], although the increased production costs did not result in increased revenue. In 1948, with his studio deeply in debt, Roach re-established his studio for television production, with [[Hal Roach, Jr.]], producing shows such as ''[[The Stu Erwin Show]]'', ''[[Steve Donovan, Western Marshal]]'', ''[[Racket Squad]]'', ''[[The Public Defender (TV series)|The Public Defender]]'', ''[[The Gale Storm Show]]'', and ''[[My Little Margie]]'', and independent producers leasing the facilities for such programs as ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', ''[[The Life of Riley]]'', and ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]''. By 1951, the studio was producing 1,500 hours of television programs a year, nearly three times Hollywood's annual output of feature movies.<ref>"Hollywood Is Humming", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', October 29, 1951.</ref>

The visionary Roach also recognized the value of his film library. Beginning in 1943, he licensed revivals of his sound-era productions for theatrical and home-movie distribution. Roach's films were also early arrivals on television. His [[Laurel and Hardy]] comedies were a smashing success in [[television syndication]]. He became one of the first significant film producers to venture into television.

==Later years==
In 1955, Roach sold his interests in the production company to his son, [[Hal Roach, Jr.]], and retired from active production. Unfortunately, the younger Roach lacked much of his father's business acumen, and soon lost the studio to creditors. It was finally shut down in 1961.

For two more decades Roach Sr. occasionally worked as a consultant on projects related to his past work. Extremely vigorous into an advanced age, Roach contemplated a comedy comeback at 96. He was a guest on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' in 1982, where he recounted experiences with such stars as [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Jean Harlow]]; he even did a brief, energetic demonstration of a hula dance.

In 1984, 92-year-old Roach was presented with an honorary [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. Former ''Our Gang'' members [[Jackie Cooper]] and [[George McFarland|George "Spanky" McFarland]] made the presentation to a flattered Roach, with McFarland thanking the producer for hiring him 53 years prior.

On Jan 28, 1992, two weeks after his 100th birthday, Roach appeared on the ''[[List of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson episodes (1992)|Tonight Show]]'', guest hosted by [[Jay Leno]]. On March 30, 1992, Roach appeared at the [[64th Academy Awards]] ceremony, hosted by [[Billy Crystal]]. When Mr. Roach rose from the audience for a standing ovation, he decided to give a speech without a microphone, causing Crystal to quip "I think that's appropriate because Mr. Roach started in silent films." At the [[42nd Berlin International Film Festival]], Roach was given the honorary award of the Berlinale Camera.<ref name="Berlinale">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1992/03_preistr_ger_1992/03_Preistraeger_1992.html |title=Berlinale: 1992 Prize Winners |accessdate=March 27, 2011 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>

==Death==
Hal Roach died in his home in [[Bel Air, California]], from [[pneumonia]] on November 2, 1992, two months short of his 101st birthday. He was married twice, and had six children, eight grandchildren and a number of great-grandchildren. Roach outlived three of his children by more than twenty years: Hal Jr. (died in 1972), Margaret (died in 1964) and Elizabeth (died in 1946).<ref name="articles.sun-sentinel.com"/> Roach is buried in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Elmira, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[Elmira, New York]], where he grew up.<ref>{{Find a Grave|1254}}</ref> Roach outlived many of the ''[[Our Gang]]'' children who starred in his pictures.

==Hal Roach Studios==
The 14.5 acre (58,680 m²) studio once known as "The Lot of Fun", containing 55 buildings, was torn down in 1963 (despite tentative plans to reopen the facilities as "Landmark Studios"), after one last movie ([[Dime with a Halo]], with [[Barbara Luna]] ) was made there in 1963 by [[Boris Sagal]] (to Sagal, the forlorn facility looked like a run-down Mexican city).<ref> http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/050153-000/hollywood-l-age-d-or-de-la-comedie</ref>  

They were replaced by light industrial buildings, businesses, and an automobile dealership. Today, Culver City's "Landmark Street" runs down what was the middle of the old studio lot, with the two original sound stages having been located on the north side of Landmark Street, and the backlot/city street sets had been located at the eastern end of Landmark Street. A plaque sits in a small park across from the studio's location, placed there by [[The Sons of the Desert]].<ref>[http://www.culvercity.org/en/Visitors/CulverCityHistory/HalRoachStudios Culver City History: Hal Roach Studios], culvercity.org. Retrieved August 23, 2008</ref>

Most of the film library was bought in 1971 by a Canadian company that adopted the "Hal Roach Studios" name. It primarily handled the business of keeping the library in the public eye and licensing products based upon the classic film series.

In 1983, Hal Roach Studios became one of the first studios to venture into the controversial business of [[film colorization]]. Buying a fifty percent interest in [[Wilson Markle]]'s Colorization Inc, it began creating digitally colored versions of several Laurel and Hardy features, the [[Frank Capra]] film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', and other popular films. In the 1980s, Hal Roach Studios produced ''[[Kids Incorporated]]'' in association with old business partner MGM. During the 1980s, Hal Roach Studios distributed its classic film library, as well as films in the [[public domain]], on home video. From 1988 to 1990, while producing ''Kids Incorporated'', Hal Roach Studios was known as [[Qintex (studio)|Qintex]].

In the years that followed, the Roach company changed hands several more times. Independent television producer Robert Halmi bought the company in the early 1990s, and it became [[RHI Entertainment]]. A short time later, this successor company was acquired by [[Hallmark Entertainment]] in 1994, but Halmi, Robert Halmi Jr. and affiliates of [[Kelso & Company]] reacquired the company in 2006. Hallmark Entertainment was absorbed into RHI Entertainment (with [[Vivendi]] as the current home video output partner).

In that same decade, a new incarnation of Hal Roach Studios (operated by the Roach Trust) was established, and today this new version of the company has released classic films on DVD, many of which are from Roach's own archival prints of his films, while others are public domain titles mastered from the best available [[35 mm]] elements.

It is the second-largest town and [[municipality]] in [[Ibiza]]; an island described by [[Time Out (company)|Time Out magazine]] as "arguably the clubbing capital of the universe".<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/travel/features/528/worlds-best-clubbing-destinations World's best clubbing destinations]</ref> The town is situated on Sant Antoni Bay on the west coast of the island, part of the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[autonomous community]] of the [[Balearic Islands]].

==History==

For two thousand years, Sant Antoni was a small fishing village that rose from the Roman natural harbor Portus Magnus, but it began to grow in the late 1950s when many hotels and tourist resorts were built as part of a mass tourism initiative which took place across [[Spain]]. As the number of tourists grew the development of bars, hotels and other tourist infrastructure spread right around to the other side of San Antonio bay, as far as Cala de Bou which actually lies in the adjacent municipality of [[Sant Josep de sa Talaia]].

Since the 1980s British tourists have made up the majority of summertime visitors to San Antonio, though this is changing as more eastern Europeans and Russians stay in San Antonio, many are attracted by programmes such as the ''Ibiza Uncovered'' series on [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky TV]] as well as the laid-back Ibiza lifestyle. Due to the sheer number of noisy and drunken tourists during the summer season many websites have begun to actively advise against staying in San Antonio, recommending quiter locations like [[Santa Eulària des Riu|Santa Eulària]] [[Portinatx]] or [[Es Canar]]. San Antonio has a bad reputation because of the type of tourists it attracts, but some will argue that it is simply a by-product of the cheap and low quality holiday packages that the town encourages. San Antonio is not a family resort and towns to the north of the island are more suited to this type of holidaymaker.

Since the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global economic crisis]] and the end of the [[Spanish property bubble]] in 2008 the pace of development in San Antonio has slowed and a large number of construction projects remain partially completed. There has also been a dramatic fall in tourist revenue, as many potential visitors have less disposable income to spend on foreign holidays.

==Landmarks and attractions==

===The Egg===
[[Image:sant antoni.egg.large.jpg|upright|thumb|left|The Egg in the port of Sant Antoni]]

The Egg is the best known landmark in Sant Antoni, located in the centre of the main roundabout at the entrance to the town.

The Egg is a statue erected in the early 1990s to commemorate the local claim of having been the birthplace of [[Christopher Columbus]] (there is a similar claim that [[Hannibal]] was born in the region). The statue is in the shape of an egg, containing at its centre a model of his ship; the [[Santa María (ship)|Santa Maria]].

The choice of an egg comes from a story about Columbus, who when seeking funding for his Western route to the Indies, was told it was impossible. He then allegedly asked if standing an egg upright was impossible, and when told that it was, he cracked the base of an egg, thus making it possible for it to stand upright. He was then granted funding. See [[Egg of Columbus]].

===Passeig de ses Fonts===
Part of Sant Antoni's harbourside promenade, Passeig de ses Fonts is an area which was developed in the early 1990s to improve the appearance of the town. There are many plants, including [[palm tree]]s and [[rubber plant]]s, as well as massive fountains, which are illuminated by night. Across the square are a host of restaurants and cafes offering a view over Sant Antoni Bay.  It is also the best place from which to watch the massive Fireworks Display which celebrates the fiesta of Saint [[Bartholomew]] on 24 August.

===West End===
The '[[West End, San Antonio, Ibiza|West End]]' is an area of San Antonio. Only a couple of streets wide; the main street being the Carrer de Santa Agnès, it hosts a variety of bars ranging from the Dance and House music Ibiza is famed for to [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Independent music|indie music]]. PR staff line the street trying to attract tourists into any of the many bars on the strip with special deals on alcohol.
Originally the name "The West End" refers to a night time minibus trip from hotels in Es Cana in the 1970s that would come to San Antonio's bars (as Es Cana had no bar scene) and the name of this tour package was "The West End Experience". Since then the area has become known simply as "The West End".

===Sunset Strip===

Along the coast in the west is the famous Sunset Strip where various bars including [[Café del Mar]] and [[Café Mambo]] are situated, where the likes of [[Swedish House Mafia]], [[Carl Cox]], [[David Guetta]] and [[Pete Tong]] DJ on a regular basis. The West facing strip of coastline means that visitors can enjoy beautiful sunsets.

===Ferries and Boat cruises===

Among the harbour of San Antonio there are various boats and ferries that have multiple connections to beaches such as Cala Bassa, Cala Compte, Pinet Playa, Es Puet, Cala Grasió, Cala Salada and Port es Torrent. These have daily departures from may until end September or October. Also once a week there is a ferry to Formentera.

=== Nightclubs ===
Sant Antoni is home to one of the main Ibiza nightclubs, [[Es Paradis]], established in 1975.

'''Dingle''' ({{Irish place name|An Daingean ''or'' Daingean Uí Chúis|Ó Cúis' fort}})<ref>McKenna 1986:10–11</ref> is a town in [[County Kerry]], Ireland. The only town on the [[Dingle Peninsula]], it sits on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] [[coast]], about {{convert|50|km|-1}} southwest of [[Tralee]] and {{convert|71|km|-1}} northwest of [[Killarney]].<ref>Kerry County Council 2006:1</ref>

Principal industries in the town are tourism, fishing and agriculture: Dingle Mart (livestock market) serves the surrounding countryside. In 2006 Dingle had a population of 1,920.<ref name="cso2006"/> Dingle is situated in a [[Gaeltacht]] region.

==History==

===Development of the port===
In Ireland the town was developed as a port following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. By the thirteenth century more goods were being exported through Dingle than [[Limerick]], and in 1257 an ordinance of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] imposed customs on the port's exports.<ref>McKenna 1986:19–20, Coppage et al 1986:380</ref> By the fourteenth century, importing wine was a major business. [[Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond]], who held [[Count palatine|palatine]] powers in the area, imposed a tax on this activity around 1329.<ref name=McKenna20>McKenna 1986:20</ref> By the sixteenth century, Dingle was one of Ireland's main trading ports, exporting fish and hides and importing wines from the continent of Europe. French and Spanish fishing fleets used the town as a base.<ref name=McKenna20/>

Connections with Spain were particularly strong, and in 1529 [[Thomas Fitzgerald, 11th Earl of Desmond]] and the ambassador of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V of Spain]] signed the [[Treaty of Dingle]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The Treaty of Dingle remembered |newspaper=[[The Kerryman]] |date=29 April 2009 |url=http://www.kerryman.ie/news/the-treaty-of-dingle-remembered-1723306.html |accessdate=3 December 2009 }}</ref> Dingle was also a major embarkation port for pilgrims to travel to the shrine of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] at [[Santiago de Compostela]]. The parish church was rebuilt in the sixteenth century under "Spanish patronage" and dedicated to the saint.<ref>McKenna 1986:60</ref><ref name=coppoge381>Coppage et al, 1986:381</ref>

In 1569 the commerce of the town was increased when it was listed as one of fifteen towns or cities which were to have a monopoly on the import of wine.<ref name=McKenna20/>

===The Second Desmond Rebellion===

The Dingle Peninsula was the scene of much of the military activity of 1579–80. On 17 July 1579 [[James FitzMaurice FitzGerald]] brought a small fleet of ships to Dingle. He made landfall, launching the [[Second Desmond Rebellion]], but was to die soon after in a minor skirmish with the forces of a cousin.<ref>McKenna 1986:23</ref> The fleet left the town after three days, anchoring at [[Dún an Óir]] at the western end of the peninsula, leading eventually to the [[Siege of Smerwick]] of 1580.

===Walled town and chartered borough===
The residents of Dingle applied in 1569 for a "murage grant" to construct [[Defensive wall|walls]] around the town. The grant was not forthcoming on that occasion. Following the defeat of the Desmond Rebellion, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] directed that a [[royal charter]] be granted to incorporate the town as a [[borough]], and to allow for the construction of walls. Traces of these town walls can still be seen, while the street layout preserves the pattern of [[burgage]] plots.<ref name=coppoge381/>

Although Elizabeth intended to grant a charter, the document was only obtained in 1607. On 2 March of that year her successor, [[James I of England|James I]], sealed the charter, although the borough and its corporation had already been in existence for twenty-two years.<ref name=McKenna31>McKenna 1986:31–33</ref> The head of the corporation was the sovereign, fulfilling the role of a mayor. In addition to the sovereign, who was elected annually on the [[Michaelmas|Feast of St Michael]], the corporation consisted of twelve [[burgess (title)|burgesses]]. The area of jurisdiction of the corporation was all land and sea within two [[Mile#Irish mile|Irish miles]] of the parish church. The borough also had an [[admiralty]] jurisdiction over Dingle, [[Ventry]], [[Ard na Caithne|Smerwick]] and [[Ballyferriter|Ferriter's Creek]] " as far as an arrow would fly".<ref name=McKenna31/>

The charter also created Dingle a [[parliamentary borough]], or [[Dingle (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|constituency]], electing two members to the House of Commons of the [[Parliament of Ireland]].<ref name=McKenna31/>

=== Linen ===
Dingle suffered badly in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] and the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], being burnt or sacked on a number of occasions.  The town started to recover in the eighteenth century, due to the efforts of the Fitzgerald family, [[Knight of Kerry|Knights of Kerry]], who established themselves at "The Grove" at this time. Robert Fitzgerald imported [[flax]] seed and by 1755 a flourishing [[linen]] industry had been established, with cloth worth £60,000 produced annually. The trade collapsed following the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] production of cotton in Great Britain, and was virtually extinct by 1837.<ref>McKenna, 1986:45–47</ref> The town fell victim to a [[:File:Dingle cholera plague plaque, 1849.JPG|cholera plague in 1849]].

===Fishing===
Dingle is a major fishing port, and the industry dates back to about 1830. The 1870s saw major development, when "[[Nobby (boat)|nobby]]" fleets from the [[Isle of Man]] came in search of [[mackerel]]. [[Lowestoft]] [[herring]] trawlers subsequently joined the fleet, allowing for a longer fishing season. The pier and maritime facilities were developed by the [[Congested Districts Board for Ireland|Congested Districts Board]], and the arrival of rail transport in 1891 allowed for the transport of fish throughout the country, and a canning and curing industry developed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dingle-peninsula.ie/culture1.html |title=History of Fishing on Ireland's Dingle Peninsula |author=Daniel Graham |year=1996 |work= |publisher=Dingle Peninsula Tourism |accessdate=2 December 2009}}</ref>

Dingle's St.&nbsp;Mary's was a [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]] church built to designs by [[J. J. McCarthy]] and O'Connell. The foundation stone was laid in 1862. It originally had a nave and aisles separated by arcades, supported on columns capped by octagonal tops. The arcades were demolished in one of the most radical reordering schemes to have been executed in Ireland.  The project also saw the demolition of the exterior walls to below the original clerstory level, and, most notably, of the attic and upper ranges of the west elevation.

There are many opportunities to hear traditional [[Music of Ireland|Irish music]] in the town, particularly during the summer tourist season. Dingle has a number of [[public house|pub]]s as well as restaurants and cafes. There is also an aquarium, "Oceanworld Aquarium", in the town, and a number of art and craft shops.

[[Dingle Distillery]]—one of only five in Ireland—was launched in Dingle in 2012.

== Fungie the Dingle Dolphin ==
Since 1984 a [[common bottlenose dolphin]] has frequented the Dingle harbour area. He has been given the name Fungie and has become a major attraction for visitors. He regularly shows up when tour boats go out to meet him. Normally bottlenose dolphins swim in pods, but Fungie seems to prefer human contact rather than interaction with his own species.<ref>The [[Irish Independent]] article [http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/forget-fungi-we-need-flipper-124452.html Forget Fungi we need Flipper]</ref> It is estimated that he was born in the mid-1970s and, with a normal life expectancy for his species of 25 years, he is now<ref>2012 august [http://www.tripadvisor.ie/Attraction_Review-g211861-d216383-Reviews-Fungie_the_Dolphin-Dingle_Dingle_Peninsula_County_Kerry.html Fungie the Dolphin Dingle]</ref> very old by bottlenose dolphin standards.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/tv/leargas/about.html Documentary] broadcast by [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTE]]</ref> There is a bronze sculpture of Fungie in Dingle.<ref>Geograph.org [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/546655 Statue of Fungi]</ref>

==Transport==
Dingle was formerly the western terminus of the narrow gauge [[Tralee and Dingle Light Railway]].

The railway station opened on 1 April 1891, closed for passenger traffic on 17 April 1939 and for regular goods traffic on 10 March 1947, finally closing altogether on 1 July 1953, by which time a cattle train once per month was the sole operation.<ref>{{cite web | title=Dingle station | work=Railscot – Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=23 September 2007}}</ref>

==Name==
[[File:Dingle-An Daingean graffiti.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Spray-painted road sign]]
In 2005, [[Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs|Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs]] [[Éamon Ó Cuív]] announced that [[anglicisation|anglicised]] place names (such as 'Dingle') of Gaeltacht towns and villages would no longer feature on official signposts, and only the [[Irish language]] names would appear. The English-language version of the town's name was thus officially dropped in early 2005, with the Irish name ''An Daingean'' being advanced.

In the case of Dingle, the move was particularly controversial, as the town relies heavily on the tourist industry, and there was fear that the change could prevent visitors finding the town. Detractors noted that tourists might not recognise the Irish name on sign-posts, and that there could also be confusion with a similarly named town ([[Daingean]]) in [[County Offaly]]. Supporters rejected this argument, pointing out that there are numerous towns in Ireland with similar names. The minister added to the controversy by suggesting that a name change to English could be brought about by removing the town's Gaeltacht status, thereby losing its entitlement to government grants for Irish-speaking areas.

In late 2005, [[County Kerry|Kerry]] [[County council]] approved the holding of a [[plebiscite]] for the change of name to the [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] "Dingle/Daingean Uí Chúis"<ref name="RTÉ-2005-10-17">

Nevertheless, in 2008 [[Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government|Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government]] [[John Gormley]], announced his intention to amend the local government laws to allow names chosen by plebiscite to supersede any Placenames Order under the [[Official Languages Act (Ireland)|Official Languages Act 2003]].<ref name = "Environment2008">{{cite web | title = Gormley proposes amendments to legislation on changing Placenames – Dingle and Daingean Uí Chúis to be official names of An Daingean | work = Local Government News | publisher = [[Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government|Dept. of the Environment]] |date=April 2008 | url = http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/News/MainBody,17223,en.htm}}</ref> This would mean that "Daingean Uí Chúis" would be the official name of the town in Irish, with "Dingle" the official name in English. However, the name of the town on road signs within the Gaeltacht will continue to display the name of the town in Irish only. In the meantime, some locals took matters into their own hands by spray painting "Dingle" on road signs that bore only the Irish version of the name.

{{Philosophy sidebar}}
[[India]] has a rich and diverse philosophical tradition dating back to the composition of the [[Upanisads]] in the [[Vedic period#The later Vedic period|later Vedic period]]. According to [[Radhakrishnan]], the oldest of these constitute "...the earliest philosophical compositions of the world."<ref>p 22, ''The Principal Upanisads'', Harper Collins, 1994</ref>

Since the late medieval age (ca.1000-1500){{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} various schools ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]: ''Darshanas'') of '''Indian philosophy''' are identified as orthodox ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]: ''[[astika]]'') or non-orthodox (Skt: ''nastika'') depending on whether they regard the [[Veda]] as an infallible source of knowledge.<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', p. 259</ref> There are six schools of orthodox [[Hindu philosophy]] and three heterodox schools. The orthodox are [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisesika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Purva mimamsa]] and [[Vedanta]]. The Heterodox are [[Jainism|Jain]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and materialist ([[C?rv?ka]]). However, [[Vidyaranya|Vidy?ra?ya]] classifies Indian philosophy into sixteen schools where he includes schools belonging to [[Saiva]] and [[Rasesvara|Rase?vara]] thought with others.<ref name="cowell">Cowell and Gough, p. xii.</ref>

The main schools of Indian philosophy were formalised chiefly between 1000 BC to the early centuries AD. Subsequent centuries produced commentaries and reformulations continuing up to as late as the 20th century by [[Aurobindo]] and [[Prabhupada]] among others. Competition and integration between the various schools was intense during their formative years, especially between 800 BC to 200 AD. Some like the [[Jain]], [[Buddhist]], [[Shaiva]] and [[Advaita]] schools survived, while others like [[Samkhya]] and [[Ajivika]] did not, either being assimilated or going extinct. The [[Sanskrit]] term for "philosopher" is ''{{IAST|d?r?anika}}'', one who is familiar with the systems of philosophy, or ''{{IAST|dar?anas}}''.<ref>Apte, p. 497.</ref>

==Common themes==
The Indian thinkers of antiquity (very much like those of the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic schools]]) viewed philosophy as a practical necessity that needed to be cultivated in order to understand how life can best be led. It became a custom for Indian writers to explain at the beginning of philosophical works how it serves human ends ({{IAST|puru??rtha}}).<ref>Chatterjee and Datta, p.12.</ref> Recent scholarship has shown that there was a great deal of intercourse between Greek and Indian philosophy during [[Hellenistic civilisation|the era of Hellenistic expansion]].<ref>See McEvilley (2002)</ref>

Indian philosophy is distinctive in its application of analytical rigour to metaphysical problems and goes into very precise detail about the nature of reality, the structure and function of the human psyche and how the relationship between the two have important implications for human salvation (''[[moksha]]''). [[Rishi]]s centred philosophy on an assumption that there is a unitary underlying order ([[rta]]) in the universe<ref>Flood, (1996) pp. 45, 47.</ref> which is all pervasive and omniscient. The efforts by various schools were concentrated on explaining this order and the metaphysical entity at its source ([[Brahman]]). The concept of natural law ([[Dharma]]) provided a basis for understanding questions of how life on earth should be lived. The sages urged humans to discern this order and to live their lives in accordance with it.

==Schools==

===Hindu philosophy===
{{Main|Hindu philosophy|Hinduism}}
{{See also|l1=Philosophy from Veda|Historical Vedic religion#Philosophy|l2=Philosophy from Upanishada|Upanishads#Philosophy}}
Many [[Hinduism|Hindu]] intellectual traditions were classified during the medieval period of Brahmanic-Sanskritic scholasticism into a standard list of six orthodox ([[Nastika|astika]]) schools ([[darshana]]s), the "Six Philosophies" (''{{IAST|?ad-dar?ana}}''), all of which accept the testimony of the [[Vedas]].<ref>Flood, op. cit., p. 231–232.</ref><ref name="Chatterjee and Datta, p. 5">Chatterjee and Datta, p. 5.</ref><ref>Michaels, p. 264.</ref>{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}

*[[Samkhya]], the enumeration school
*[[Raja Yoga|Yoga]], the school of Patanjali (which provisionally asserts the metaphysics of Samkhya)
*[[Nyaya]], the school of logic
*[[Vaisheshika]], the atomist school
*[[Purva Mimamsa]] (or simply Mimamsa), the tradition of Vedic exegesis, with emphasis on Vedic ritual, and
*[[Vedanta]] (also called Uttara Mimamsa), the [[Upanishad]]ic tradition, with emphasis on Vedic philosophy.

These are often coupled into three groups for both historical and conceptual reasons: Nyaya-Vaishesika, Samkhya-Yoga, and Mimamsa-Vedanta. The Vedanta school is further divided into six sub-schools: [[Advaita]] ([[monism]]/[[nondualism]]), also includes the concept of [[Ajativada]], [[Visishtadvaita]] (monism of the qualified whole), [[Dvaita]] ([[dualism]]), [[Dvaitadvaita]] (dualism-nondualism), Suddhadvaita, and [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]] schools.

Besides these schools M?dhava Vidy?ra?ya also includes the following of the aforementioned theistic philosophies based on the Agamas and Tantras:<ref name="cowell"/>

* [[Pasupata]], school of Shaivism by Nakulisa
* [[Shaiva Siddhanta|Saiva]], the theistic Sankhya school
* [[Pratyabhijna|Pratyabhijña]], the recognitive school
* [[Rase?vara]], the mercurial school
* [[P??ini]] Dar?ana, the grammarian school (which clarifies the theory of [[Spho?a]])<ref name="Chatterjee and Datta, p. 5"/>

The systems mentioned here are not the only orthodox systems, they are the chief ones, and there are other orthodox schools. These systems, accept the authority of [[Vedas]] and are regarded as "[[Orthodoxy|orthodox]]" ([[astika]]) schools of Hindu philosophy; besides these, schools that do not accept the authority of the Vedas are categorised by Brahmins as unorthodox (nastika) systems.<ref name="Chatterjee and Datta, p. 5"/> Chief among the latter category are Buddhism, Jainism and C?rv?ka.
*[[C?rv?ka]] is a [[materialism|materialistic]] and [[atheistic]] school of thought and, is noteworthy as evidence of a [[atheism in Hinduism|materialistic movement]] within [[Hinduism]].<ref>Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore. ''A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy'249. ISBN 0-691-01958-4.</ref>

===Jain philosophy===
{{Main|Jain philosophy|Jainism}}
Jainism came into formal being after [[Mahavira]] synthesised philosophies and promulgations of the ancient [[Sramana]] philosophy, during the period around 550 BC, in the region that is present day [[Bihar]] in northern [[India]]. This period marked an ideological renaissance, in which the Vedic dominance was challenged by various groups like Jainism and Buddhism.

A ''Jain'' is a follower of ''Jinas'', spiritual 'victors' (''Jina'' is Sanskrit for 'victor'), human beings who have rediscovered the ''[[dharma]],'' become fully [[moksha|liberated]] and taught the spiritual path for the benefit of beings. Jains follow the teachings of 24 special Jinas who are known as ''[[Tirthankar]]s'' ('[[Ford (crossing)|ford]]-builders'). The 24th and most recent ''Tirthankar'', Lord [[Mahavira]], lived in [[circa|c]].6th century BC, in a period of cultural revolution all over the world. During this period, [[Socrates]] was born in Greece, [[Zoroaster]] in Iran, Lao?Tse and [[Confucious]] in China and [[Mahavira]] and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in India.<ref name=SinghR>Singh, Ramjee Dr. Jaina Perspective in Philosophy and Religion, Faridabad, Pujya Sohanalala Smaraka Parsvanatha Sodhapitha, 1993.</ref> The 23rd Thirthankar of Jains, Lord [[Parsvanatha]] is recognised now as a historical person, lived during 872 to 772 BC...<ref name=Charpentier>Jarl Charpentier: ''The History of the Jains'', in: ''The Cambridge History of India'', vol. 1, Cambridge 1922, p. 153; A.M.

Jainism is not considered as a part of the Vedic Religion ([[Hinduism]]),<ref>J. L. Jaini, (1916) Jaina Law, Bhadrabahu Samhita, (Text with translation ) Arrah, Central jaina publishing House) " As to Jainas being Hindu dissenters, and, therefore governable by Hindu law, we are not told this date of secession [...] Jainism certainly has a longer history than is consistent with its being a creed of dissenters from Hinduism." P.12-13</ref><ref>P.S. Jaini, (1979), The Jaina Path to Purification, Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, p. 169 "Jainas themselves have no memory of a time when they fell within the Vedic fold. Any theory that attempts to link the two traditions, moreover fails to appreciate rather distinctive and very non-vedic character of Jaina cosmology, soul theory, karmic doctrine and atheism"</ref><ref>Y. Masih (2000) In : A Comparative Study of Religions, Motilal Banarsidass Publ : Delhi, ISBN 81-208-0815-0 “There is no evidence to show that Jainism and Buddhism ever subscribed to vedic sacrifices, vedic deities or caste. They are parallel or native religions of India and have contributed to much to the growth of even classical Hinduism of the present times.” Page 18</ref> even as there is constitutional ambiguity over its status. Jain tirthankars find exclusive mention in the Vedas and the [[Hindu]] [[epic poetry|epics]]. During the [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] age, India had two broad philosophical streams of thought: The [[Shramana]] philosophical schools, represented by [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and the long defunct and [[Ajivika]] on one hand, and the [[Brahmana]]/[[Vedantic]]/[[Puranic]] schools represented by [[Vedanta]], [[Vaishnava]] and other movements on the other. Both streams are known to have mutually influenced each other.<ref>[[Harry Oldmeadow]] (2007) Light from the East: Eastern Wisdom for the Modern West, [[World Wisdom]], Inc ISBN 1-933316-22-5 "What is historically known is that there was a tradition along with vedic Hinduism known as sramana dharma. Essentially, the sramana tradition included it its fold, the Jain and Buddhist traditions, which disagreed with the eternality of the Vedas, the needs for ritual sacrifices and the supremacy of the Brahmins". Page 141</ref>

The Hindu scholar Lokmanya Tilak credited Jainism with influencing Hinduism in the area of the cessation of animal sacrifice in Vedic rituals. [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] has described Jainism as the originator of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]] and wrote in a letter printed in [[Bombay Samachar]], Mumbai:10 Dec 1904: "In ancient times, innumerable animals were butchered in sacrifices. Evidence in support of this is found in various poetic compositions such as the Meghaduta. But the credit for the disappearance of this terrible massacre from the Brahminical religion goes to Jainism." [[Swami Vivekananda]] also credited Jainsim as one of the influencing forces behind the Indian culture.<ref>Dulichand Jain (1998) Thus Spake Lord Mahavir, Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai, ISBN 81-7120-825-8 Page 15</ref>

One of the main characteristics of Jain belief is the emphasis on the immediate consequences of one's physical and mental behaviour.<ref name="Tobias">{{cite book

}}</ref> Because Jains believe that everything is in some sense alive with many living beings possessing a soul, great care and awareness is required in going about one's business in the world. Jainism is a religious tradition in which all life is considered to be worthy of respect and Jain teaching emphasises this [[egalitarianism|equality]] of all life advocating the non-harming of even the smallest creatures. '''Non-violence''' ( [[Ahimsa]]) is the basis of right View, the condition of right Knowledge and the kernel of right Conduct in Jainism.

Jainism encourages [[spirituality|spiritual]] independence (in the sense of relying on and cultivating one's own personal wisdom) and [[self-control]] (????, ''vratae'') which is considered vital for one's spiritual development. The goal, as with other Indian religions, is ''[[moksha]]'' which in Jainism is realisation of the soul's true nature, a condition of omniscience ([[Kevala Jnana]]). [[Anekantavada]] is one of the principles of [[Jainism]] positing that reality is perceived differently from different points of view, and that no single point of view is completely true. Jain doctrine states that only Kevalis, those who have infinite knowledge, can know the true answer, and that all others would only know a part of the answer. Anekantavada is related to the Western philosophical doctrine of [[Subjectivism]].

===Buddhist philosophy===
{{Main|Buddhist philosophy|Buddhism}}
Buddhist philosophy is a system of thought which started with the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], [[Buddhahood|the Buddha]], or "awakened one". From its inception, Buddhism has had a strong philosophical component. Buddhism is founded on elements of the [[shramana]] movement which flowered around 500 BCE, and has had a very strong influence on Hinduism. The Buddha criticised all concepts of metaphysical [[being]] and non-being as misleading [[View (Buddhism)|views]] caused by [[reification (fallacy)|reification]], and this critique is inextricable from the founding of Buddhism.

Buddhism shares many philosophical views with other Indian systems, such as belief in ''[[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]'', a cause-and-effect relationship between all that has been done and all that will be done. Events that occur are held to be the direct result of previous events. A major departure from Hindu and Jain philosophy is the Buddhist rejection of a permanent, self-existent soul (''[[?tman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') in favour of ''[[anatta]]'' (non-Self) and ''[[impermanence|anicca]]'' (impermanence).

Jain thinkers rejected this view, opining that if no continuing soul could be accepted then even the effort to attain any worldly objective would be useless, as the individual acting and the one receiving the consequences would be different. Therefore, the conviction in individuals that the doer is also the reaper of consequences establishes the existence of a continuing soul.<ref>Cowell and Gough, p. 36</ref>

===C?rv?ka philosophy===
{{Main|C?rv?ka}}
C?rv?ka or Lok?yata was a philosophy of [[Philosophical skepticism|scepticism]] and [[materialism]], founded in the [[Mauryan]] period. They were extremely critical of other schools of philosophy of the time. C?rv?ka deemed Vedas to be tainted by the three faults of untruth, self-contradiction, and tautology.<ref name="page4">Cowell and Gough, p. 4</ref> And in contrast to Buddhists and Jains, they mocked the concept of [[Nirvana|liberation]], [[reincarnation]] and accumulation of [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] or demerit through the performance of certain actions.<ref>Bhattacharya, Ramkrishna. [http://www.carvaka4india.com/2011/08/materialism-in-india-synoptic-view.html Materialism in India: A Synoptic View]. Retrieved 27 July 2012.</ref> They believed that, the viewpoint of relinquishing pleasure to avoid pain was the "reasoning of fools".<ref name="page4"/> C?rv?ka thought consciousness was an emanation from the body and it ended with the destruction of the body. They used quotes from [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] to support this claim.<ref name="page3">Cowell and Gough, p. 3</ref> C?rv?ka denied inference as a means of knowledge<ref name="page3"/> and held sensory indulgence as the final objective of life.

C?rv?ka held the view that Invariable Concomitance ([[vyapti]]), a theory of [[Indian logic]] which refers to the relation between [[middle term]] and [[major term]] freed from all [[Upadhi|conditions]],<ref>Satis Chandra Vidy?bh??a?a. A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern Schools. Motilal Banarsidass. P. 140. ISBN 81-208-0565-8.</ref> could not be ascertained. However, Buddhists refuted this view by proposing that Invariable Concomitance was easily cognizable from the relation between cause and effect or from the establishment of identity.<ref>Cowell and Gough, p. 12-13</ref>

== Modern philosophy ==
{{Further|Timeline of Eastern philosophers#Modern Indian philosophers}}
Modern Indian philosophy was developed during British occupation(1750–1947). The philosophers in this era gave contemporary meaning to traditional philosophy. Some of them were [[Swami Vivekananda]], [[Swami Dayananda Saraswati]], [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]], [[Raja Ram Mohan Roy]], [[Kesab Sen]], [[Sri Aurobindo]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Kireet Joshi]], [[Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan]], [[M. N. Roy]], [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], [[Indra Sen]], [[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]]. [[Pandurang Shastri Athavale]], [[U. G. Krishnamurti]], [[Acharya Rajnesh Osho]] and [[Swami Krishnananda|Krishnananda]] are other prominent names in contemporary Indian philosophy.

==Political philosophy==
The [[Arthashastra]], attributed to the [[Mauryan]] minister [[Chanakya]], is one of the early Indian texts devoted to [[political philosophy]]. It is dated to 4th century BCE and discusses ideas of statecraft and economic policy.

The [[political philosophy]] most closely associated with India is the one of [[ahimsa]] (non-violence) and [[Satyagraha]], popularised by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] during the [[Indian independence movement|Indian struggle for independence]]. It was influenced by the Indian [[Dharma|Dharmic]] philosophy, particularly the [[Bhagvata Gita]], as well as secular writings of authors such as [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[John Ruskin]].<ref>Gandhi (1961) p. iii</ref> In turn it influenced the later movements for independence and [[civil rights]], especially those led by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and to a lesser extent [[Nelson Mandela]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Thomas|title=Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=P8nC80pG4GIC&pg=PA136|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45657-9|page=136}}</ref>

'''Harmon Clayton Killebrew''' ({{IPAc-en|?|k|?|l|?|b|r|u?}}; June 29, 1936&nbsp;– May 17, 2011), nicknamed "'''Killer'''" and "'''Hammerin' Harmon'''", was an American professional [[baseball]] [[first baseman]], [[third baseman]], and [[left fielder]]. During his 22-year career in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), primarily with the [[Minnesota Twins]], Killebrew was a prolific power hitter who, at the time of his retirement, was second only to [[Babe Ruth]] in [[American League]] (AL) [[home run]]s and was the AL career leader in home runs by a [[right-handed]] batter (since broken by [[Alex Rodriguez]]).<ref name=Goldstein>{{cite news|last=Goldstein |first=Richard|title=Harmon Killebrew, Twins' Hall of Fame Slugger, Dies at 74|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/sports/baseball/harmon-killebrew-twins-hall-of-fame-slugger-dies-at-74.html?partner=rss&emc=rss |accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 17, 2011}}</ref> He was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1984.

Killebrew was a [[wikt:stocky|stocky]] 5'11" tall, 213-pound hitter with a compact swing that generated tremendous power. He became one of the AL's most feared power hitters of the 1960s, hitting 40 home runs in a season eight times. In 1965, he played in the [[1965 World Series|World Series]] with the Twins, who lost to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. His finest season was 1969, when he hit 49 home runs, recorded 140 [[runs batted in]] (RBIs), and won the AL [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player Award]]. Killebrew led the league six times in home runs and three times in RBIs, and was named to eleven [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] teams.

With quick hands and exceptional upper-body strength, Killebrew was known not just for the frequency of his home runs but also for their distance. He hit the longest measured home runs at [[Metropolitan Stadium|Minnesota's Metropolitan Stadium]], {{convert|520|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Baltimore's Memorial Stadium]], {{convert|471|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and was the first of just four batters to hit a baseball over the [[left field]] roof at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Detroit's Tiger Stadium]]. Despite his nicknames and his powerful style of play, Killebrew was considered by his colleagues to be a quiet, kind man. Asked once what hobbies he had, Killebrew replied, "Just washing the dishes, I guess."<ref name="SIHeilman1">{{cite journal|last=Heilman|first=Barbara|date=April 8, 1963|accessdate=July 7, 2008|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1074683/1/index.htm|title=Out Of The Park On A Half Swing}}</ref>

After retiring from baseball, Killebrew became a television broadcaster for several baseball teams from 1976 to 1988, and also served as a hitting instructor for the [[Oakland Athletics]]. He also divorced and remarried during this time, moving to Arizona in 1990 and chairing the Harmon Killebrew Foundation. Killebrew was diagnosed with [[esophageal cancer]] in December 2010, and died five months later.

==Early life==
Born in [[Payette, Idaho]], Harmon Killebrew was youngest of four children to Harmon Clayton, Sr. and Katherine Pearl (May) Killebrew. His father, a painter and [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], was a member of an undefeated [[Millikin College]] [[American football|football]] team who was later named an [[All-America]]n under eventual [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] coach [[Greasy Neale]].<ref name="Porter807">[[#Porter|Porter]], p. 807.</ref><ref name="Thielman132">[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 132.</ref> According to family legend, Harmon Killebrew's grandfather was the strongest man in the [[Union Army]], winning every available [[Wrestling weight classes|heavyweight wrestling]] championship.<ref name="Thielman132"/> Clayton encouraged Harmon and his brothers to stay active in various sports before his sudden death in 1953 at age 59.<ref name="Thielman132"/>

As a child, Harmon played baseball at [[Walter Johnson]] Memorial Field, named after the [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitcher who spent part of his childhood in Idaho.<ref name="Thielman131">[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 131.</ref> He worked as a farmworker in his youth, where he lifted 10-gallon milk cans, each can weighing about 95&nbsp;lb (43&nbsp;kg).<ref name=Goldstein/> Killebrew earned 12 [[Letterman (sports)|letters]] in various sports and was named an [[All-America#High school sports|All-American]] [[quarterback]] at [[Payette High School]]; his uniform number was later retired by the school.<ref name="Porter807"/><ref name="Thielman134">[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 134.</ref> He was offered an [[athletic scholarship]] by the [[Oregon Ducks|University of Oregon]], but declined the offer.<ref name="Porter8078">[[#Porter|Porter]], pp. 807–808.</ref>

In the early 1950s, [[List of United States Senators from Idaho|Idaho Senator]] [[Herman Welker]] told [[History of the Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] owner [[Clark Griffith]] about Killebrew, who was hitting for an .847 [[batting average]] for a [[semi-professional]] baseball team at the time.<ref name="Thielman131"/><ref name="Porter808">[[#Porter|Porter]], p. 808.</ref> Griffith told his [[Farm team|farm]] director [[Ossie Bluege]] about the tip and Bluege flew to Idaho to watch Killebrew play.<ref name="Thielman133">[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 133.</ref> The [[Boston Red Sox]] also expressed interest but Bluege succeeded in signing him to a $50,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1954|r=0}}}} today) contract on June 19, 1954.<ref name="Thielman134"/><ref name="Porter808"/><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Senators Pay $50,000 To First Bonus Player|date=June 20, 1954|page=3}}</ref>

==Professional baseball career==

===Washington Senators===
Killebrew signed his contract under [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB)'s [[Bonus Rule]], which required that he spend two full seasons on the major league roster.<ref name="Porter808"/> Making his major league debut four days after signing and six days from his 18th birthday (becoming the youngest active player in the majors at the time), Killebrew was called on to run for [[Clyde Vollmer]], who had been [[hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]], with the [[bases loaded]], by [[Chicago White Sox]] starter [[Jack Harshman]] while [[pinch hitting]] for Senators [[relief pitcher|reliever]] [[Chuck Stobbs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHA/CHA195406230.shtml|title=June 23, 1954, Senators at White Sox Box Score and Play by Play|work=[[Baseball-Reference]]|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref><ref name=BBRef>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/k/killeha01.shtml|title=Harmon Killebrew Statistics|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=June 28, 2008}}</ref> On August 23, 1954, Killebrew made his first start in the second game of a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] against the [[Philadelphia Athletics]], hitting two [[single (baseball)|singles]] and a [[double (baseball)|double]] as the Senators won the game, 10–3.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Shirley|last=Povich|title=Kid Killebrew Shines at Bat in Bow as Nat|magazine=[[The Sporting News]]|date=September 1, 1954|page=6}}</ref> A year and one day after making his major league debut, Killebrew hit his first major league home run on June 24, 1955 in the 5th inning off [[Detroit Tigers]] starter [[Billy Hoeft]], five days shy of his 19th birthday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/WS1/WS1195506240.shtml|title=June 24, 1955, Tigers at Senators Play by Play and Box Score|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref> In his first two seasons, Killebrew [[strikeout|struck out]] 34 times in only 93 [[at bat]]s, contributing to a .215 batting average with four [[home run]]s.<ref name="Porter808"/> Killebrew also had defensive difficulties at [[Third baseman|third base]], where he played behind veteran [[Eddie Yost]].<ref name="Porter808"/>

[[File:Harmon Killebrew 1959.png|thumb|170px|left|Killebrew with the Senators in 1959.]]
When Killebrew's bonus period expired in 1956, he was sent to the Senators' [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] affiliate in [[Charlotte Hornets (baseball)|Charlotte]] of the [[Southern League (baseball)|South Atlantic League]].<ref name="RetiredNumbers">{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/min/history/killebrew.jsp|title=Minnesota Twins Retired Numbers&nbsp;– 3: Harmon Killebrew|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=July 23, 2008}}</ref> He returned to the majors in early May.

[[Calvin Griffith]] took over the Senators after his uncle [[Clark Griffith]] died in 1955, and decided Killebrew was ready to become the Senators' regular third baseman. Griffith traded the 32-year-old Eddie Yost to the [[Detroit Tigers]] on December 6, 1958, and Killebrew became the starting third baseman.<ref name="Porter808"/><ref name="BBRefYost">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/y/yosted01.shtml|title=Eddie Yost Statistics|website=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=June 28, 2008}}</ref> From May 1 to May 17, he had five multi-home run games and his first five-RBI game on May 12.<ref name="Porter808"/> With 28 home runs by mid-season, he started the [[1959 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (first game)|first 1959 All-Star Game]] and was a reserve in [[1959 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (second game)|the second]]. Killebrew attracted so much attention in Washington that he was visited by President of the United States [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who frequently attended games,<ref name="Allen76">[[#Allen|Allen]], p. 76.</ref> and Griffith turned down a $500,000 offer for Killebrew from the [[Cincinnati Reds]].<ref name="Allen76"/> Killebrew finished the season with 42 home runs to tie for the [[List of Major League Baseball home run champions|American League lead]]; it also tied the Senator's single-season record set by his teammate [[Roy Sievers]] two years earlier.<ref name="Porter808"/><ref name="DigestClubRecords">{{cite journal|journal=[[Baseball Digest]]|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_6_62/ai_100961691|title= Club home run leaders&nbsp;– Season|date=June 2003|accessdate=July 20, 2008}}</ref> Although 1959 proved his breakout season, he was ineligible for the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] because of his previous sparse experience.

During the 1967 season, Killebrew showed his ability to hit long home runs when, on June 3, 1967, he struck the longest home run recorded at Metropolitan Stadium, a shot off Lew Burdette in the 4th inning that landed in the second deck of the bleachers.<ref name="Rushin1956">[[#Rushin|Rushin]], pp. 195–196.</ref> The Twins, led by Killebrew, were in the pennant race throughout the season, and had a one-game lead as the final two games of the season began against the [[Boston Red Sox]].

Killebrew reached the 40 home runs for the final time in 1970 and also made his last appearance in the postseason.

{{quote|text=The Killer was one of the most feared sluggers in baseball history, but he was also one of the nicest people ever to play the game.

Killebrew was known for his quick hands and exceptional upper-body strength, demonstrated by several "tape measure" home runs that he hit in the prime of his career. Killebrew said that his first home run in the Majors was his favorite, coming off [[Billy Hoeft]] at [[Griffith Stadium]]. He said of it, "[[Frank House (baseball)|Frank House]] was the catcher. When I came to the plate, he said, 'Kid, we're going to throw you a fastball.' I didn't know whether to believe him or not. I hit it out. It was one of the longest home runs I ever hit. As I crossed the plate, House said, 'That's the last time I ever tell you what pitch is coming'."<ref name=Goldstein/>

On August 3, 1962, he was the first batter ever to hit a baseball over the left field roof at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], a seldom-reached target as contrasted with the old ballpark's smaller right field area.

'''Jeanette McGruder''', born {{birth date and age|1954|11|8}},{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} is a [[singer]], comedienne, sketch actress, and writer.

As a child, McGruder discovered a natural ability to sing. Taught by her stepmother, she joined a female trio called "New Dawn" which performed at nightclubs and one [[Black Panthers]] rally. During her schooling, McGruder played violin with [[Earl Klugh]] in a group called the Electrifying Strings. Occasional performances at [[United Sound Studios]] for [[Motown Records]] earned McGruder $20 apiece. McGruder opted against pursuing a career as a violinist, and instead majored in voice at [[Michigan State University]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

McGruder performed with [[P-Funk]], [[Brides Of Funkenstein]], and [[Lynn Mabry & Dawn Silva]]. In 1979, she recorded with Silva and Sheila Horne on "Never Buy Texas From A Cowboy".

McGruder changed her professional name to '''Satori Shakoor''' in mid-1980s and became a [[comedian]] and sketch actress on the Canadian show ''[[Thick and Thin (TV series)|Thick and Thin]]''.

==Early life and career==

Jeanette McGruder was born in Detroit, Michigan (1954).  At any early age, she had a passion for music and began studying the violin.  She became a professional violinist at age 15 as well as  played in her high school orchestra (Cass Technical High School).  Jeanette also played in various orchestras and bands in and around the city of Detroit, including "The Electrifying Strings", a jazz string group with Earl Klugh (guitar), Cecil "Van" Cephus (keyboards), and Ralph Armstrong (bass), and in studio sessions on recordings for local Detroit artists.

Jeanette also sang in her junior high choir and was part of a three-girl group called "New Dawn".  They would sneak into nightclubs and Black Panther rallies to sing, wearing the cast-off gowns of [[Martha Reeves and the Vandellas]].  (Martha Reeves' youngest sister was one of the girls in "New Dawn".)

==Education and later musical career==

In 1972, upon entering the music department of [[Michigan State University]], Jeanette decided to focus on voice and retired her violin.  In 1974, Jeanette was invited to an event honoring Mrs. [[Coretta Scott King]]; when Mrs. King heard her rendition of "We Shall Overcome", she made a special point of telling Jeanette that she had been moved by her voice.

In 1978, after four years of studying at MSU and two years of singing in local bands, Jeanette moved to New York City and began auditioning for Broadway.  Later in 1978, a phone call from a good friend, and now famous artist, Overton (a.k.a. Joe) Loyd, informed her about an audition for The Brides of Funkenstein, a new group created by [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]].  Jeanette flew back to Detroit and got a job singing backup for Parliament, Funkadelic, and the original Brides of Funkenstein, Dawn Silva and Lynn Mabry, whose album ''Funk the Walk'' (1978) was rising on the charts called.  Mabry left the group in less than a year, leaving Dawn Silva and a second album to record.  George Clinton decided to bring Jeanette and Sheila Horne from the background to the foreground, and the Brides of Funkenstein became a three-girl group, recording the second album,  ''Never Buy Texas From A Cowboy'' (1979).  It was voted into ''Billboard''{{'}}s "Top 50 albums" of all time in 2002.  The single, "Didn't Mean To Fall In Love", from the album earned the Brides of Funkenstein a rhythm and blues award in 1981 for "Best New Female Group".

The Brides of Funkenstein disbanded in 1981.  Some time afterward, the original Brides of Funkenstein (Silva and Mabry) reunited briefly, and Sheila Horne went on to sing with [[Rick James]].  Jeanette became the lyricist and lead singer in a Detroit rock band, called "Cherubim".  The group recorded one album and played in Japan.

==Personal life==

In 1982, McGruder had a son, Noah Shakoor. In 2002, he and his wife, Fonda Hollowell, had a daughter, Olivia Washington. She inherited her fathers talents and now is singing and acting. She also plays the trumpet and piano,and wishes to play the violin like her grandmother.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Name change and stage career==

In 1983, Jeanette changed her name to Satori Shakoor and is now an accomplished actress, writer, singer and standup comedienne.

A dramatic and humorous monologue featuring Satori Shakoor was released on ''[[The Moth]]'' (January 21, 2013).<ref>{{cite web|title=Satori Shakoor|url=http://themoth.org/posts/storytellers/satori-shakoor|website=TheMoth.org|publisher=The Moth|accessdate=September 1, 2014}}</ref>

'''Brigitte Helm''' (17 March 1906 &ndash; 11 June 1996) was a [[German people|German]] [[actress]], best remembered for her dual role as Maria and her double, the [[Maschinenmensch]], in [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 [[silent film]] ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.

==Career==
Born '''Brigitte Eva Gisela Schittenhelm''' in [[Berlin]], Helm's first role was that of Maria in ''Metropolis'' which she began work on while only 18 years old. After ''Metropolis'', Helm made over thirty other films, including [[Sound film|talking pictures]], before retiring in 1936. Her other appearances include ''[[The Love of Jeanne Ney]]'' (1927), ''[[Alraune (1928 film)|Alraune]]'' (1928), ''[[L'Argent (1928 film)|L'Argent]]'' (1928), ''Gloria'' (1931), ''The Blue Danube'' (1932), ''[[L'Atlantide (1932 film)|L'Atlantide]]'' (1932), and ''[[Gold (1934 film)|Gold]]'' (1934).

Though having a 10-year contract with [[Universum Film AG|UFA]] expiring in 1935, Helm incurred the wrath of Nazi Germany for "race defilement" in marrying her second husband Dr. Hugo Kunheim, an industrialist of Jewish background.<ref>p.127 Huff, David Stewart ''Film in the Third Reich'' University of California Press</ref> Helm was also involved in several traffic accidents, and was briefly imprisoned.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-brigitte-helm-1337656.html Obituary: Brigitte Helm - Obituaries - News].

In 1935, she moved to [[Switzerland]] where she later had four children with Hugo. After her retirement from films, she refused to grant any interviews concerning her film career. Helm was considered for the title role in ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' before [[Elsa Lanchester]] was given the role.<ref>Curtis, pp. 243–44</ref>

The '''[[flag]] of the [[state of Texas]]''' is defined by law as follows:

{{quote|The state flag is a rectangle that has a width to length ratio of two to three and contains (1) one blue vertical stripe that has a width equal to one-third the length of the flag, (2) two equal horizontal stripes, the upper stripe white, the lower stripe red, each having a length equal to two-thirds the length of the flag, and (3) one white, regular five-pointed star located in the center of the blue stripe, oriented so that one point faces upward, and sized so that the diameter of a circle passing through the five points of the star is equal to three-fourths the width of the blue stripe.  The red and blue of the state flag are the same colors used in the United States flag.<ref name="Texas Flag Code: Sec. 3100">[http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/GV/htm/GV.3100.htm Texas Flag Code: Sec. 3100]</ref>}}

The Texas flag is known as the "Lone Star Flag" (giving rise to the state's nickname "The Lone Star State"). This flag was introduced to the Congress of the [[Republic of Texas]] on December 28, 1838, by Senator [[William H. Wharton]].<ref name=hbot>{{Handbook of Texas|id=msf01|name=Flags of Texas}}</ref> It was adopted on January 25, 1839 as the final [[national flag]] of the Republic of Texas.<ref name=hbot/>  The actual designer of the flag is unknown; Dr. [[Charles B. Stewart]] is credited with drawing the image used by the Third Congress when enacting the legislation adopting the flag.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.texflags.org/stewart.htm | title = The Stewart Myth | accessdate = 2013-05-12 |author = Vexillological Assn. of the State of Texas}}</ref><ref>[{{Handbook of Texas|id=fst53|name=Stewart, Charles Bellinger Tate}}]</ref>

When [[Texas]] became the 28th state of the [[United States|Union]] on December 29, 1845, its national flag became the [[Flags of the U.S. states|state flag]]. While the Lone Star remained the [[de facto]] state flag, from 1879 until 1933 there was no official state flag. All statutes not explicitly renewed were repealed under the Revised Civil Statutes of 1879, and since the statutes pertaining to the flag were not among those renewed, Texas was formally flagless until the passage of the 1933 Texas Flag Code.<ref name=hbot/>  The official [[Pantone]] shades for the Texas flag are 193 (red) and 281 (dark blue).<ref name='flaglaw'/> The flag, flown at homes and businesses statewide, is highly popular among Texans and is treated with a great degree of reverence and esteem within Texas.

In 2001, a survey conducted by the [[North American Vexillological Association]] rated the Texas state flag second best in design quality out of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state and U.S. territory flags ranked. The flag earned 8.13 out of 10 possible points.<ref>[http://www.nava.org/flag-design/survey/state-provincial-survey-2001 New Mexico Tops State/Provincial Flags Survey, Georgia Loses by Wide Margin]</ref>

==Colors==
The exact shades of red, white, and blue to be used in the flag are specified by Texas statute<ref>[http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/GV/htm/GV.3100.htm#3100.002 Texas Flag Code]</ref> to be the same as those of the [[Flag of the United States]], which are as follows:

==Flag protocol==
[[File:Flag of Texas (proper vertical display).svg|thumb|120px|Proper vertical display of the Texas flag]]

The flag is required by law to be displayed on or near the main administration building of each state institution during each state or national holiday, and on any special occasion of historical significance,<ref name="Texas Flag Code: Sec. 3100"/> permanently above both doors of the Texas State Capitol, alone at the north door, and under the US flag at the south door, with the exception being if the flags are at half mast or if the [[POW/MIA flag]] is being flown with the US flag; in which event the Texas flag shall only fly at the North Door.<ref>[http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/SOTWDocs/GV/htm/GV.443.htm Texas Government Code]</ref>  State law also requires that the state flag be flown at or near any International Port of Entry.<ref>[http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TN/htm/TN.201.htm Texas Transportation Code]</ref>  When displayed vertically, the blue stripe should be at top and, from the perspective of an observer, the white stripe should be to the left of the red stripe.<ref>[http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/GV/htm/GV.3100.htm#3100.051 Texas Flag Code: Sec. 3100.059]</ref>

==Symbolism==
The Texas Flag Code assigns the following [[symbol]]ism to the colors of the Texas flag: blue stands for loyalty, white for purity, and red for bravery.<ref name='flaglaw'>{{Cite web|url=http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/GV/content/htm/gv.011.00.003100.00.htm |title=GOVERNMENT CODE: CHAPTER 3100. STATE FLAG |accessdate=2007-10-21 |date=2001-09-01 |publisher=State of Texas |archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20071013074003/http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/GV/content/htm/gv.011.00.003100.00.htm|archivedate = 2007-10-13}}</ref> The code also states that single (''lone'') star "represents ALL of Texas and stands for our unity as one for God, State, and Country."  The "lone star" is, in fact, an older symbol predating the flag which was used to symbolize Texans' solidarity in declaring independence from [[Mexico]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YE1l7gjB0FMC|title=The Shape of Texas: Maps as Metaphors|author=Francaviglia, Richard V.|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|year=1996|page=80 | isbn=978-0-89096-664-8}}</ref> It is still seen today as a symbol of Texas' independent spirit, and gave rise to the state's official nickname "The Lone Star State".

The idea of the single red stripe and single white stripe actually dates back to the short-lived [[Republic of Fredonia]], a small state near modern [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]] which seceded from Mexico in 1826 before being forcibly re-integrated. The new state was formed through an alliance between local [[English American|Anglo]] settlers and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes and the Fredonian flag used a white and red stripe to symbolize the two ethnic/racial groups from which the state was formed.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pnVcfj-MmCEC|title=Origin history American flag naval yacht-club signals, seals arms, principal national songs United States, chronicle symbols, standards, banners, flags ancient modern nations|author=Preble, George Henry; Asnis, Charles Edward|publisher=Central Press Co.|location=Philadelphia|year=1917|page=635}}</ref> Though this rebellion ultimately failed it served as an inspiration to the later [[Texas Revolution]].

==Pledge of allegiance==
The pledge of allegiance to the state flag is as follows:

{{cquote|Honor the Texas flag; I pledge allegiance to thee, Texas, one state under God, one and indivisible.<ref name='pledge'>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ref/abouttx/flagpledge.html |title=Pledge of allegiance to the state flag |accessdate=2007-10-21 |year=2007 |work=Texas State Library and Archives Commission |publisher=State of Texas }}</ref>}}

The pledge was instituted by the Texas Legislature in 1933, and originally referred to the "Texas flag of 1836" (which was the Burnet Flag, and not the Lone Star Flag then in use).  In 1965, the error was corrected by deleting the words "of 1836". In 2007, the phrase "one state under God" was added.<ref name='pledge'/> The addition of "under God" has been challenged in court, though an injunction was denied.<ref>David Wallace Croft, "[http://www.croftpress.com/david/politics/pledge/ State Pledge]."</ref>

==Revolutionary flags==
During the [[Texas Revolution]], a great number and variety of flags appeared. Some of the most well-known are listed:

===The Lone Star and Stripes/Ensign of the First Texas Navy===
[[File:Texas Lone Star and Stripes.svg|thumb|right|180px|Texas Lone Star and Stripes]]

This flag was widely used by both Texan land and naval forces. This flag was simply the [[United States flag]] with a Lone star in the canton. This flag echoes an earlier design, carried by the forces of [[James Long]] in a failed 1818 attempt to separate Texas from Spanish control. This earlier flag was exactly the same, save for the canton having a red background rather than blue. There is evidence that the Lone Star and Stripes was used at the battles of Goliad, the Alamo, and San Jacinto. Although interim President David Burnet issued a decree making the Lone Star and Stripes the first official flag of the Republic of Texas, it never became the legal national flag. It did remain the naval flag of Texas until annexation, and was noted for being "beneficial to our [Texan] Navy and Merchantmen" due to its resemblance to the US flag. Despite its unofficial status, the flag remained well known inside the region and internationally as the symbol of Texas. The official blue and gold "Burnett Flag", on the other hand, was little known by Texans, and no contemporary illustrations of it have been discovered. An 1837 chart of national flags printed in Philadelphia showed the Lone Star and Stripes as the national flag of Texas, and Texas Senator Oliver Jones, who led the 1839 committee which approved the Lone Star Flag, was unaware that the Lone Star and Stripes was not the current official flag.<ref>{{cite book | last=Maberry | first=Robert, Jr.| title=Texas Flags|publisher=Texas A&M University Press |year=2001|isbn=978-1-58544-151-8|location=College Station|pages=28–38}}</ref>  Later, prior to the [[American Civil War]], this flag was carried by Florida Militia in Pensacola during the seizure of Federal property in that city.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===The Come and Take It Flag===
[[File:Texas Flag Come and Take It.svg|thumb|right|180px|The ''Come and Take It'' flag]]
{{Main|Come and take it}}

This flag was created by the people of Gonzales, featuring the phrase, a black five pointed star, and the image of the town cannon Mexican forces had demanded they turn over. In March 1831, Juan Gomez, a Lieutenant in the Mexican Army, granted a small cannon to the colony of San Antonio. The small bronze cannon was received by the colony and signed for by Randy Tumlinson. It was then transported to Gonzales, Texas and later was the object of Texas pride. At the minor skirmish known as the [[Battle of Gonzales]], a small group of Texans successfully resisted the Mexican forces who had orders to seize their cannon. As a symbol of defiance, the Texans had fashioned a flag containing the phrase along with a black star and an image of the cannon which they had received six years earlier from Mexican officials.

===The Alamo Flag===
[[File:Texas Alamo Flag.svg|thumb|180px||right|The Alamo Flag]]
This flag was created by replacing the Eagle in the center of the Mexican tricolor with the year "1824", referencing the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]], in support of which Texas was fighting. This was the first flag approved for use by rebel forces by a Texan legislative body. In 1835, the Texan provisional government approved the use of this flag for privateers preying on Mexican commerce.

It has often been said that the 1824 flag was flown by Texan forces at the [[Battle of the Alamo]]. However, this was never alleged until 1860, long after the battle had occurred. Modern writers have pointed out that the presence of the 1824 flag at the time and place of the battle is highly unlikely. A similar flag was flown at least briefly by Texan Tejano forces, featuring two black, six pointed stars in place of the date. It is likely that the actual "Alamo flag" referred to by accounts of the time was the Lone Star and Stripes, which had been depicted in use at earlier battles such as Goliad, and was widely referred to as the "[[Texian]] flag".<ref>{{cite book | last=Maberry | first=Robert, Jr.| title=Texas Flags |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |year=2001|isbn=978-1-58544-151-8|location=College Station|pages=11, 26, 28–32}}</ref>

===The Dodson Tricolor===
[[File:Texas Dodson Flag.svg|thumb|180px|right|The Dodson Flag]]
This flag was designed and sewn by a Mrs. Sarah Dodson during the Revolution. It resembled the flag of Revolutionary France, but with longer proportions and the Texan Lone Star in the canton. [[Stephen F. Austin]] was initially so alarmed by the obvious symbolism that he requested the flag not be used, but it nevertheless flew over Texan forces in [[Cibolo Creek]], and may have been the first Texan flag raised over San Antonio. The flag was one of two that flew over the small cabin in which Texas delegates ratified their declaration of independence.

== The Burnet Flag ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Bonnie Blue Flag]] -->
[[File:Flag of Texas (1836–1839).svg|thumb|right|180px|The Burnet Flag (1836–1839)]]
The [[David G. Burnet|Burnet]] Flag was adopted by the Texan Congress on December 10, 1836.<ref name=hbot/>   It consisted of an azure background with a large golden star, inspired by the 1810 "[[Bonnie Blue Flag]]" of the [[Republic of West Florida]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Allman | first = T.D.| authorlink = T.

Variants of the Burnet Flag with a white star, virtually identical to the Bonnie Blue Flag, were also common. Other variants featured the star (of either color) upside down, and/or ringed with the word TEXAS, with each letter filling one of the gaps of the star. The flag bears more than a passing resemblance to the flag of the [[Congo Free State]].

==Urban legend==
[[File:Texas Capitol Flags.jpg|thumb|The Texas flag flying below the U.S. flag at the [[Texas State Capitol]]]]
It is a common [[urban legend]] that the Texas flag is the only state flag that is allowed to fly at the same height as the [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]].  Allegedly, Texas has this right inherently (as a former independent nation) or because it negotiated special provisions when it joined the Union (this version has been stated as fact on a PBS website).<ref>''[http://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/texan/ Texas English]'', from the "Do You Speak American?" series. Article by Jan Tillery and Guy Bailey of the University of Texas at San Antonio.</ref> However, the legend is false.<ref>http://www.snopes.com/history/american/texasflag.asp</ref> Neither the [[Joint Resolution]] for [[Texas Annexation|Annexing Texas]] to the United States nor the Ordinance of Annexation<ref>[http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ref/abouttx/annexation/4july1845.html Ordinance of Annexation Approved by the Texas Convention on July 4, 1845]</ref> contain any provisions regarding flags. According to the [[United States Flag Code]], any state flag can be flown at the same height as the U.S. flag, but the U.S. flag should be on its right (the viewer's left). Consistent with the U.S. Flag Code, the Texas Flag Code specifies that the state flag should either be flown below the U.S. flag if on the same pole or at the same height as the U.S. flag if on separate poles.<ref name='flaglaw'/>

==Similar flags==
*Texas's flag is similar to the [[flag of Chile]], first used in 1817. However, the Chilean flag has a blue canton with a white star rather than the entire left side being blue. The red bottom stripe begins below the canton.  The Chilean Flag predates the Lone Star Flag by 22 years.
*The [[flag of North Carolina]] is similar to the flag of Texas; North Carolina's flag has the same basic pattern as Texas's; however, the colors of the fly are reversed. In addition, the star in the hoist is smaller and is surrounded by scrolls and lettering. The Lone Star Flag predates North Carolina's current flag by 47 years.
* The [[flag of Guinea-Bissau]] is also similar, but has different colors, different dimensions and proportions of the sections, and a differently colored star.
*The [[Flag of the Democratic Republic of the Congo#Previous flags|Flag of the Belgian Congo]] and its predecessors are essentially the same as the Burnet Flag.
* The flag of Texas is quite similar to the "Flag of Céspedes" or "[[:es:Archivo:Naval Jack of Cuba.svg|flag of La Demajagua]]", one of the two flags used during the [[Cuban War of Independence]]

==Governor's Flag==
{{See also|Flags of the Governors of the U.S. States}}
[[File:Standard Of Governor Of Texas.svg|thumb|right|200px|Standard of the Governor of Texas]]

The flag of the [[Governor of Texas]] consists of the Seal of Texas centered on a field of azure. Like most U.S. Governor flags, there are 4 five-point stars at the corners of the field.

'''The Brides of Funkenstein''' was a [[funk]] musical group originally composed of singers [[Dawn Silva]] and [[Lynn Mabry]].

==History==
Previously background singers for [[Sly & the Family Stone|Sly Stone]], Mabry and Silva joined the [[P-Funk]] collective in the mid-1970s. [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] named the group (based on a storyline and characters from the [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] album ''[[The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein]]''). The Brides' provided the vocals for the 1977 album ''[[Game, Dames and Guitar Thangs]]'' by P-Funk guitarist [[Eddie Hazel]]. Clinton produced the Brides' debut album, ''[[Funk Or Walk]]'', for [[Atlantic Records]] in 1978. The album was a success, selling over three hundred thousand copies within the first week as well as winning a Record World award for best new female group.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The album charted at #7 on the R&B charts; the single "Disco To Go" was certified gold in America and reached platinum status in Europe and Asia. The duo became an opening act for [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] tours and also performed backing vocals for the ensemble itself. 

Lynn Mabry left the group in 1979. Dawn Silva lead singer invited back-up "Bridesmaids" [[Sheila Horne]] and [[Jeanette McGruder]] to sing on the second Brides album, ''[[Never Buy Texas From A Cowboy]]''. This lineup received a Cashbox Rhythm & Blues award for best new female artist, beating out [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Sister Sledge]], and [[Cheryl Lynn]]. The Brides' second album was rated in 2001 by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as one of the top 50 coolest albums ever released.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The trio recorded a third album, ''Shadows On The Wall, Shaped Like The Hat You Wore'' in 1980, but the album was not released.  Most of the songs from the unreleased album gradually appeared elsewhere in the P-Funk catalog. 

Lynn Mabry resurfaced in 1984 as a backing vocalist with [[Talking Heads]], appearing in the concert film ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'' along with P-Funk colleague [[Bernie Worrell]]. Silva and Mabry had a brief reunion in 1981 as the New Wave Brides, opening for [[Grace Jones]], and a lengthy tour with [[Was (Not Was)]]. Silva would tour and record with the [[Gap Band]] from 1983 to 1991, moving on to work with [[Ice Cube]]. In 2000 Silva released the solo album ''All My Funky Friends'', which received rave reviews in Europe and Asia.  Dawn Silva & The Brides continue to tour.

After he retired from coaching, he served as president and front office executive of the Celtics until his death. As a coach, he won 938 games (a record at his retirement)<ref name="pride" /> and nine [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) [[List of NBA championship head coaches|championships]] in ten years (a number surpassed only by [[Phil Jackson]], who won 11 in twenty years).

Auerbach is remembered as a pioneer of modern basketball, redefining basketball as a game dominated by team play and defense and for introducing the [[fast break]] as a potent offensive weapon.<ref name="jockbio" /> He groomed many players who went on to be inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]]. Additionally, Auerbach was vital in breaking down color barriers in the NBA. He made history by drafting the first [[African-American]] NBA player, [[Chuck Cooper (basketball)|Chuck Cooper]] in 1950, and introduced the first [[African-American]] starting five in 1964.<ref name="color">{{cite news |last=Ryan |first=Bob |title=Red was just full of color |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2006/10/30/red_was_just_full_of_color/ |accessdate=July 10, 2007 |publisher=Boston.com | date=October 30, 2006}}</ref> Famous for his polarizing nature, he was well known for smoking a cigar when he thought a victory was assured, a habit that became, for many, "the ultimate symbol of victory" during his [[Boston]] tenure.<ref name="jockbio" />

In 1967, the [[NBA Coach of the Year]] award, which he had won in 1965, was named the "Red Auerbach Trophy," and Auerbach was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1969.<ref name="pride" /> In 1980, he was named the greatest coach in the history of the NBA by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America,<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/29/sports/basketball/29auerbach.html?ex=1319774400&en=5a9ed5bdbc403098&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |title=Red Auerbach, Who Built Basketball Dynasty, Dies at 89 |accessdate=July 10, 2007 |publisher=The New York Times | first=Richard | last=Goldstein | date=October 29, 2006}}</ref> and was [[NBA Executive of the Year]] in 1980.<ref name="pride" /> In addition, Auerbach was voted one of the [[NBA 50 Greatest Players|NBA 10 Greatest Coaches in history]], was inducted into the [[National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame]], and is honored with a retired number 2 jersey in the [[TD Garden]], the home of the Boston Celtics.

==Early life==
Arnold Jacob Auerbach was one of the four children of Marie and Hyman Auerbach. Hyman was a [[Russian Jewish]] immigrant from [[Minsk]], [[Belarus]], and Marie Auerbach, née Thompson, was American-born. Auerbach Sr. had left Belarus when he was 13,<ref name="team" /> and the couple owned a [[delicatessen]] store and later went into the dry-cleaning business. Little Arnold spent his whole childhood in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], playing basketball. With his flaming red hair and fiery temper, Auerbach was soon nicknamed "Red."<ref name="jockbio" />

Amid the [[Great Depression]], Red played basketball at PS 122 and in the [[Eastern District High School]], where he was named "Second Team All-Brooklyn" by the World-Telegram in his senior year. Auerbach received an athletic scholarship to the basketball program of [[Bill Reinhart]] at [[George Washington University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].<ref name="jockbio" /> Auerbach was a standout basketball player and graduated with a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] in 1941.<ref name="team" /> In those years, Auerbach began to understand the importance of the [[fast break]], appreciating how potent three charging attackers against two back-pedalling defenders could be.<ref name="jockbio" />

==First coaching years (1941–1950)==
In 1941, Auerbach began coaching basketball at the [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)|St. Albans School]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (Washington D.C.)|Roosevelt High School]] in Washington, D.C.<ref name="team" /> Two years later, he joined the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] for three years, coaching the Navy basketball team in [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk]]. There, he caught the eye of Washington millionaire Mike Uline, who hired him to coach the [[Washington Capitols]] in the newly founded [[Basketball Association of America]] (BAA), a predecessor of the NBA.<ref name="jockbio" />

In the [[1946-47 BAA season]], Auerbach led a fast break-oriented team built around early BAA star [[Bones McKinney]] and various ex-Navy players to a 49–11 win–loss record, including a standard-setting [[List of National Basketball Association longest winning streaks|17-game winning streak]] that stood as the single-season league record until 1969. In the playoffs, however, they were defeated by the [[Chicago Stags]] in six games.<ref name="team">{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/auerbach_red.html |title=Auerbach's Celtics played as a team |last=Hilton |first=Lisette |accessdate=July 10, 2007 |publisher=[[ESPN|ESPN.com]]}}</ref>

The [[1947-48 BAA season|next year]] the Capitols went 28–20<ref name="team" /> but were eliminated from the playoffs in a one-game Western Division tie-breaker.<ref name="jockbio" /> In the [[1948-49 BAA season]], the Caps won their first 15 games (still a league-record start) and finished the season at 38–22.<ref name="team" /> The team reached the BAA Finals, but were beaten by the [[Minneapolis Lakers]], who were led by Hall-of-Fame [[center (basketball)|center]] [[George Mikan]]. In the next season, the BAA and the rival league [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] merged to become the NBA, and Auerbach felt he had to rebuild his squad. However, owner Uline declined his proposals, and Auerbach resigned.<ref name="jockbio" />

Auerbach was then approached by [[Ben Kerner]], owner of the [[Tri-Cities Blackhawks]]. After getting a green light to rebuild the team from scratch, Auerbach traded more than two dozen players in just six weeks, and the revamped Blackhawks improved, but ended the [[1949–50 NBA season]] with a losing record of 28–29. When Kerner traded Auerbach's favorite player [[John Mahnken]], an angry Auerbach resigned again.<ref name="jockbio" />

==Boston Celtics (1950–2006)==

===The early years (1950–56)===
Prior to the [[1950–51 NBA season]], Auerbach was approached by [[Walter A. Brown|Walter Brown]], owner of the [[Boston Celtics]]. Brown was desperate to turn around his struggling and financially strapped franchise, which was reeling from a 22–46 record.<ref name="team" /> The still young but already seasoned Auerbach was made coach. In the [[1950 NBA Draft]], Auerbach made some notable moves. First, he famously snubbed Hall-of-Fame New England [[point guard]] [[Bob Cousy]] in the [[1950 NBA Draft]], infuriating the Boston crowd. He argued that the flashy Cousy lacked the poise necessary to make his team, taunting him as a "local [[yokel]]".<ref name="jockbio" /> Second, he drafted African-American [[Chuck Cooper (basketball)|Chuck Cooper]], the first black player to be drafted by an NBA club.<ref name="AfricanAmerican1st">{{cite web |url=http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/1175/Chuck_Cooper_one_of_the_NBAs_first_Black__players |title=Chuck Cooper, one of the NBA's first Black players |accessdate=August 21, 2007 |publisher=The African American Registry |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070701092509/http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/1175/Chuck_Cooper_one_of_the_NBAs_first_Black__players |archivedate = July 1, 2007}}</ref> With that, Auerbach effectively broke down the [[color barrier]] in professional basketball.<ref name="color" />

In that year, the core of the Celtics consisted of Hall-of-Fame center [[Ed Macauley]], Auerbach's old favorite McKinney, and an unlikely addition, Cousy. Cousy had refused to report to the club that had drafted him (ironically, the Blackhawks, Auerbach's old club), and because his next team (the Chicago Stags) folded, he ended up with the Celtics. With Auerbach's fast-break tactics, the Celtics achieved a 39–30 record but lost in the [[1951 NBA Playoffs]] to the [[New York Knicks]]. However, the relationship between Auerbach and Cousy improved when the coach saw that the "[[Harry Houdini|Houdini]] of the Hardwood"—as the spectacular dribbler and flashy passer Cousy was lovingly called—-became the first great [[playmaker]] of the fledgling NBA.<ref name="jockbio" />

In the following [[1951–52 NBA season]], Auerbach made a remarkable draft pick of future Hall-of-Fame guard [[Bill Sharman]]. With the high-scoring Macauley, elite passer Cousy, and new prodigy Sharman, Auerbach had a core that provided high-octane fast-break basketball. Other notable players who joined the Celtics were forwards [[Frank Ramsey (basketball)|Frank Ramsey]] and [[Jim Loscutoff]]. In the next years until 1956, the Celtics would make the playoffs every year, but never won the title. In fact, the Celtics often [[choke (sports)|choked]] in the playoffs, going a mere 10–17 in the postseason from 1951 through 1956.<ref name="team" /> As Cousy put it: "We would get tired in the end and could not get the ball."<ref name="shouler">{{cite web |last=Shouler |first=Ken |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/feature/featureVideo?page=auerbach
| title=The Consummate Coach |accessdate=July 10, 2007 |publisher=[[ESPN|ESPN.com]]}}</ref> As a result, Auerbach sought a defensive big man who could both get easy [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], initiate fast breaks, and close out games.<ref name="jockbio" />

===The dynasty (1956–66)===
[[File:Bill Russell and Red Auerbach 1956.jpeg|thumb|[[Bill Russell]] (left) sitting on the bench next to Auerbach (right) during a game at [[Boston Garden]] on December 26, 1956.]]
Before the [[1956 NBA Draft]], Auerbach had already set his sights on defensive rebounding center [[Bill Russell]]. Via a draft-day trade that sent Macauley and rookie [[Cliff Hagan]] to the rival [[St. Louis Hawks]], he acquired a center in Russell, who would go on to become one of the greatest basketball players of all time. In the same draft, Auerbach picked up [[forward (basketball)|forward]] [[Tom Heinsohn]] and [[guard (basketball)|guard]] [[K.C. Jones]], also two future Hall-of-Famers. Emphasizing team play rather than individual performances, and stressing that defense was more important than offense, Auerbach drilled his players to play tough defense and force opposing [[turnover (basketball)|turnovers]] for easy fast-break points. Forward [[Satch Sanders|Tom Sanders]] recalled that the teams were also regularly among the best-conditioned and toughest squads.<ref name="shouler" />

Anchored by defensive stalwart Russell, the tough Celtics forced their opponents to take low-percentage shots from farther distances (there was no three-point arc at the time); misses were then often grabbed by perennial rebounding champion Russell, who then either passed it on to elite fast-break distributor Cousy or made the outlet pass himself, providing their sprinting colleagues opportunities for an easy [[slam dunk]] or [[layup]].<ref name="jockbio" /> Auerbach also emphasized the need for role players like [[Frank Ramsey (basketball)|Frank Ramsey]] and [[John Havlicek]], who became two of the first legitimate [[sixth man|sixth men]] in NBA history,<ref name="shouler" /> a role later succeeded in by [[Don Nelson]]. Auerbach's recipe proved devastating to the opposition. From 1957 to 1966, the Celtics won nine of ten NBA championships. This included eight consecutive championships—which is the longest championship streak in North American sports—and six victories over the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] of Hall-of-Famers [[Elgin Baylor]] and [[Jerry West]] in the NBA Finals. Perhaps most notably, this also included denying perennial scoring and rebounding champion [[Wilt Chamberlain]] a title during Auerbach's coaching reign.<ref name="feinstein">{{cite web |last=Feinstein |first=Ron |title=Red Auerbach: True Stories and NBA Legends |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4137301 |accessdate=July 10, 2007 |publisher=NPR }}</ref>

Flowing from Auerbach's emphasis on teamwork, what was also striking about his teams was that they never seemed to have a dominant scorer: in the [[1960–61 NBA season]], for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list.<ref name="shouler" /> Auerbach also firmly believed in breaking down color barriers in the NBA. In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, [[Willie Naulls]], Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach would go a step further in the [[1966–67 NBA season]], when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years, and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was already decided, a habit that became [[cult]]-like in popularity in the Boston area.<ref name="shouler" /> Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting [[ejection (sports)|ejected]] more often than any other coach in NBA history.<ref name="shouler" />

All in all, Auerbach coached nine championship teams directly and mentored 4 players—Russell, Sharman, Heinsohn and K.C. Jones—who would go on to win an additional 7 NBA championships as coaches (two each for Russell, Heinsohn and Jones, all with the Celtics, and one for Sharman with the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]]). Ten players who played for Auerbach have been inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]]—Macauley, Ramsey, Cousy, Sharman, Heinsohn, Russell, K. C. Jones, Havlicek, [[Sam Jones (basketball)|Sam Jones]] and [[Bailey Howell]]. Although Don Nelson played for Auerbach only during his last year as coach, his influence was profound: Nelson would later join Auerbach as one of the 10 Greatest Coaches in NBA history.<ref name="jockbio" /> Sharman would become one of only three people to be inducted into the Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach. Few, if any, coaches can match Auerbach's record of wins and successful mentorship of his players.

===General manager (1966–84)===
Prior to the [[1966–67 NBA season]], Auerbach announced his retirement as a coach and named his successor, Bill Russell. Russell took over as a player-coach and so became the first [[African-American]] coach in the NBA.<ref name="jockbio" /> While his pupil led the Celtics to two further titles in 1968 and 1969, Auerbach rebuilt the aging Celtics with shrewd draft picks, among them [[Jo Jo White]] and future Hall-of-Famers [[Dave Cowens]], [[Paul Westphal]], and [[Don Chaney]]. With his ex-player Tom Heinsohn coaching the Celtics and led by former sixth man John Havlicek, Auerbach's new recruits won the [[Atlantic Division (NBA)|Atlantic Division]] every year from 1972 to 1976, winning the NBA title in [[1974 NBA Finals|1974]] and [[1976 NBA Finals|1976]]. Further notable Auerbach signings were veteran forward/center [[Paul Silas]] and ex-[[American Basketball Association|ABA]] star [[Charlie Scott]].<ref name="team" />

However, Auerbach could not prevent the Celtics from going into a slump at the end of the 1970s. He traded away both Silas and Westphal because they wanted salary increases that would have made them higher earners than the best player on the Celtics (Cowens), which was not acceptable to Auerbach, even though Cowens personally begged him to give Silas a new deal. When scoring champion Havlicek retired in 1978, the Celtics went 61–103 in two seasons.<ref name="team" /> But in 1979, Boston's fortunes changed when Auerbach set his eyes on talented college player [[Larry Bird]]. Despite knowing that Bird had a year of college eligibility remaining, he drafted Bird in the [[1978 NBA Draft]] and waited for a year until the future Hall-of-Fame forward Bird arrived, finally setting aside his team salary rules when it became clear that his choices were paying Bird a record-setting rookie salary or watch him simply re-enter the 1980 draft. Bird then became the highest-paid Celtic as a rookie, with a $650,000-per year deal. Auerbach immediately sensed that the brilliant, hardworking Bird would be the cornerstone of a new Celtics generation.<ref name="jockbio" />

In 1980, Auerbach achieved another great coup. Dubbed "The Steal of The Century",<ref>{{YouTube|f64odP09_d8|Bballbreakdown - How Red Auerbach Stole Parish and McHale}}</ref> He convinced the [[Golden State Warriors]] to trade him a #3 overall pick and future Hall-of-Fame center [[Robert Parish]] in exchange for two picks in the [[1980 NBA Draft]]: #1 overall [[Joe Barry Carroll]], who went on to have an unremarkable career, and the #13 pick [[Rickey Brown]]. With the #3 pick, Auerbach selected the player he most wanted in the draft, [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]], who would also be inducted into the Hall of Fame. The [[frontcourt]] of Parish-McHale-Bird became one of the greatest front lines in NBA history. Auerbach hired head coach [[Bill Fitch]] who led the revamped Celtics to the [[1981 NBA Finals|1981]] title.

In 1983, Auerbach named former Celtics player [[K.C. Jones]] coach of the Celtics. Starting in 1984, Jones coached the Celtics to four straight appearances in the [[NBA Finals]], winning championships in [[1984 NBA Finals|1984]] and [[1986 NBA Finals|1986]].

===President and vice chairman (1984–2006)===
In 1984, Auerbach relinquished his general managing duties and became president and later vice-chairman of the Boston Celtics.<ref name="team" /> When the Celtics defeated Houston in the [[1986 NBA Finals|1986 finals]], it was Auerbach's 16th championship, an unmatched feat in the NBA. However, in the next years, tragedy struck the Celtics. Sensing that the 1980s Celtics of Larry Bird needed to be rejuvenated, Auerbach traded Henderson away for the second overall draft pick, and picked college prodigy [[Len Bias]] in the [[1986 NBA Draft]]. But just two days later, Bias died of a cocaine overdose. Several years later, Celtics player [[Reggie Lewis]] died suddenly in 1993, and the team fell into decline, not seeing another Finals in Auerbach's lifetime.<ref name="team" />

In an interview, Auerbach confessed that he lost interest in big-time managing in the early 1990s, preferring to stay in the background and concentrating on his pastimes, [[racquetball]] and his beloved cigar-smoking. He would, however, stay on with the Celtics as president until 1997, as vice chairman until 2001, and then became president again, a position he held until his death,<ref name="shouler" /> although in his final years, he was weakened by heart problems and often used a wheelchair.<ref name="tribute">{{cite web |title=A Tribute to Red |url=http://www.nba.com/news/auerbach_tribute.html
| accessdate=July 10, 2007 |publisher=[[NBA|NBA.com]] }}</ref>
==Personal life==
[[File:RedAuerbach.jpg|thumb|Auerbach being honored for his service in the Navy during World War II just a few days before his death. (25 October 2006)]]
Auerbach was one of four children of American-born Marie Auerbach and [[Russian Jewish]] immigrant Hyman Auerbach in Brooklyn. His brother Zang Auerbach, four years his junior, was a respected cartoonist and portraitist at the ''[[Washington Star]]''.<ref name="feinstein" /> He married Dorothy Lewis in the spring of 1941. The couple had two daughters, Nancy and Randy.<ref name="shouler" />

Auerbach was known for his love for cigar smoking. Because Red made his victory cigars a cult in the 1960s, Boston restaurants would often say "no cigar or pipe smoking, except for Red Auerbach".<ref name="shouler" /> In addition, Auerbach was well known for his love of Chinese food. In an interview shortly before his death, he explained that since the 1950s, Chinese takeout was the most convenient nutrition: back then, NBA teams travelled on regular flights and had a tight time schedule, so filling up the stomach with heavier non-Chinese food meant wasting time and risking travel-sickness. Over the years, Auerbach became so fond of this food that he even became a part-owner of a Chinese restaurant in Boston.<ref name="feinstein" /> Despite a heart operation, he remained active in his 80s, playing racquetball and making frequent public appearances.

Despite his fierce nature, Auerbach was popular among his players. He recalled that on his 75th birthday party, 45 of his ex-players showed up;<ref name="shouler" /> and when he turned 80, his perennial 1960s victim [[Wilt Chamberlain]] showed up, a gesture which Auerbach dearly appreciated.<ref name="feinstein" />

In an interview with [[ESPN]], Auerbach stated that his all-star fantasy team would consist of Bill Russell—who in the former's opinion was the ultimate player to start a franchise with—as well as [[Bob Pettit]], [[Elgin Baylor]], [[Oscar Robertson]] and [[Jerry West]], with [[John Havlicek]] as the [[sixth man]]. Regarding greatest basketballers of all time, Auerbach's candidates were Russell, [[Larry Bird]], [[Magic Johnson]], [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[Michael Jordan]], and Robertson."<ref name="shouler" />

==Writing==
Auerbach was the author of seven books. His first, ''Basketball for the Player, the Fan and Coach,'' has been translated into seven languages and is the best-selling basketball book in print.<ref name="jockbio" /> His second book, co-authored with Paul Sann, was ''Winning the Hard Way.'' He also wrote a pair of books with [[Joe Fitzgerald]]: ''Red Auerbach: An Autobiography'' and ''Red Auerbach On and Off the Court.'' In October 1991 ''M.B.A.: Management by Auerbach'' was co-authored with Ken Dooley. In 1994, ''Seeing Red'' was written with [[Dan Shaughnessy]]. In October 2004, his last book, ''Let Me Tell You A Story,'' was co-authored with sports journalist [[John Feinstein]].

===Death===
Auerbach died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on October 28, 2006 at the age of 89.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/supp/Supplement-A-Bu-and-Obituaries/Auerbach-Red.html |title=Red Auerbach Biography&nbsp;– life, family, parents, name, history, school, mother, son, born, college, contract, house, time, year, Parents Were Russian Immigrants |publisher=Notablebiographies.com |date= |accessdate=February 1, 2011}}</ref> NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] said, "the void caused by his death will never be filled" and players [[Bill Russell]], [[K.C. Jones]], [[John Havlicek]] and [[Larry Bird]], as well as contemporaries like [[Jerry West]], [[Pat Riley]], and [[Wayne Embry]] universally hailed Auerbach as one of the greatest personalities in NBA history.<ref name="tribute">{{cite web |last=nba.com |first= |title=A Tribute to Red |url=http://www.nba.com/news/auerbach_tribute.html
| date=July 10, 2007 }}</ref> Bird stated "Red shared our passion for the game, our commitment to excellence, and our desire to do whatever it takes to win." Auerbach was survived by his two daughters, Nancy and Randy. Auerbach was interred in [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]], [[Virginia]] at King David Memorial Gardens within National Memorial Park on October 31, 2006. Attendees included basketball dignitaries Bill Russell, Kevin McHale, Danny Ainge, and David Stern.

During the [[2006–07 NBA season]], [[NBA TV]] and NBA.com aired [[rerun]]s of Auerbach's four-minute instructional videos known as "Red on Roundball" previously aired during [[NBA on CBS]] halftime shows in the 1970s and 1980s, and as a testament to his importance in the Boston sports world, the [[Boston Red Sox]] honored Auerbach at their April 20, 2007 game against the [[New York Yankees]] by wearing green uniforms and by hanging replicated Celtics championship banners on the "[[Green Monster]]" at [[Fenway Park]]. Boston won 7–6.

Prior to Boston's [[2007–08 NBA season|season opener]] against the [[Washington Wizards|Wizards]], his signature was officially placed on the parquet floor near center court, thereby naming the court as "Red Auerbach Parquet Floor." The ceremony was attended by his daughter Randy and some of the Celtics legends. The signature replaced the Red Auerbach memorial logo used during the [[2006–07 NBA Season|2007 season]].
[[Image:RedMemshamrock.png|thumb|right|150px|Red Auerbach Memorial worn by the Celtics for the [[2006–07 NBA season]].]]

==Legacy==
Among Auerbach's accomplishments during his 20-year professional coaching career were eleven Eastern Division titles (including nine in a row from 1957–65), 11 appearances in the finals (including ten in a row from 1957–66), and nine NBA championships. With a total of 16 NBA championship rings in a span of 29 years (1957–86) as the Celtics coach, general manager, and team president, Auerbach is the most successful team official in NBA history.<ref name="jockbio" /> He is credited with creating several generations of championship Boston Celtics teams, most notably the first Celtics dynasty with [[Bill Russell]] which won an unprecedented eight titles in a row (1959–66). As Celtics general manager, he created championship-winning teams around Hall-of-Famers [[Dave Cowens]] in the 1970s and [[Larry Bird]] in the 1980s.<ref name="jockbio" />

In addition to coaching, Auerbach was a highly effective mentor; several players coached by Auerbach would become successful coaches themselves. [[Bill Russell]] won two titles as Auerbach's successor, [[Tom Heinsohn]] won a pair of championships as a Celtics coach in the 1970s, [[K.C. Jones]] led the Celtics to two further titles in the 1980s, and [[Bill Sharman]] coached the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] to their first title in 1972. In addition, prototypical [[sixth man]] [[Don Nelson]] had a highly successful coaching career and joined his mentor Auerbach as one of [[NBA 50 Greatest Players|10 Greatest Coaches in NBA history]].

One area of Auerbach's legacy that is less positive was his underpaying of his players while he was the Celtics' coach. This played a role in bringing about the players union according to [[David Halberstam]]:<ref>Halberstam. pg. 343</ref>

{{quote|The hard core of the union came from the Celtics. That was not surprising; Red Auerbach went after the players of the highest intelligence and character, and then of course paid them horribly. That made the Celtics a mass of contradictions. They had great coherence as a team, great personal loyalty to each other, great respect and love for Auerbach, who had created this unique institution and honored each of them by making him a part of it, and then of course great anger at him for paying them so little.}}

In Auerbach's honor, the Celtics have retired a number-2 jersey with the name "AUERBACH," memorializing his role as the second most important Celtic ever, behind founder [[Walter A. Brown|Walter Brown]], in whose honor the number-1 "BROWN" jersey is retired.

[[File:Celtics2.png|thumb|left|95px|In 1985, the Boston Celtics retired the #2 jersey with Auerbach's name.]]

His story is documented in [[The First Basket]], the first and most comprehensive documentary on the history of Jews and Basketball. He is also featured as an interviews subject for the film.

===Coaching pioneer===
From his early days, Auerbach was convinced that the [[fast break]], where a team used a quick outlet pass to fast guards who run downcourt and score before the opponent had re-established position, was a potent tactical weapon. This new strategy proved lethal for the opposition.<ref name="jockbio" /> Further, Auerbach moved emphasis away from individual accolades and instilled the teamwork element into his players.<ref name="team" /> He also invented the concept of the role player and of the [[sixth man]],<ref name="jockbio" /> stating: "Individual honors are nice, but no Celtic has ever gone out of his way to achieve them. We have never had the league's top scorer. In fact, we won seven league championships without placing even one among the league's top 10 scorers. Our pride was never rooted in statistics."<ref name="team" />

While Auerbach was not known for his tactical bandwidth, famously restricting his teams to just seven plays,<ref name="team" /> he was well known for his psychological warfare, often provoking opposing players and officials with unabashed [[trash talk]]. For his fiery temper, he was ejected more often and received more fines than any other coach in NBA history.<ref name="shouler" /> Concerning his own team, Auerbach was softer. [[Earl Lloyd]], the first black player to play in the NBA, said: "Red Auerbach convinced his players that he loved them [...] so all they wanted to do was please him."<ref name="shouler" />

===No color barrier===
Auerbach was known for choosing players for talent and motivation, with disregard for skin color or ethnicity. In 1950, he made NBA history by drafting the league's first [[African-American]] player, [[Chuck Cooper (basketball)|Chuck Cooper]]. He constantly added new black players to his squad, including [[Bill Russell]], [[Satch Sanders|Tom Sanders]], [[Sam Jones (basketball)|Sam Jones]], [[K.C. Jones]], and [[Willie Naulls]]. In 1964, these five players became the first African-American starting five in the NBA. When Auerbach gave up coaching to become the Celtics general manager in 1966, he appointed Bill Russell as his successor. Russell became the first [[African-American|black]] NBA coach, and was the first black coach of a professional sports organization since [[Fritz Pollard]] in 1925.<ref name="color" /> Similarly, in the 1980s, as the Celtics GM, Auerbach fielded an earnest, hardworking team that was derided as being "too white."<ref>{{cite web |last=Adande |first=J.A. |title=The truth isn't always black and white for Celtics |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=adande_ja&page=Celtics-071219&lpos=spotlight&lid=tab1pos1 |accessdate=April 12, 2009 |publisher=Espn.com }}</ref> While the 1980s Celts were, in actuality, neither predominantly white nor black, the NBA at the time was predominately black. White players like [[Larry Bird]], [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]], [[Danny Ainge]], and [[Bill Walton]] played alongside [[Tiny Archibald]], [[Dennis Johnson]], [[Robert Parish]], and [[Cedric Maxwell]] to bring three more championships in the '80s under coaches Bill Fitch (white) and K.C. Jones (black).

Auerbach is prominently featured in the documentary film, "[[The First Basket]]" about Jewish basketball history.

===Arnold "Red" Auerbach Award===
To honor Auerbach, the Celtics created the Arnold "Red" Auerbach award in 2006. It is an award given annually to the current Celtic player or coach who "best exemplifies the spirit and meaning of what it is to be a Celtic. This award is named in honor of the legendary Coach, General Manager and President of the organization, Arnold 'Red' Auerbach."

For the soul vocalist who occasionally recorded under the same name, see [[Justine Washington|Justine "Baby" Washington]]''.

'''Jeanette Washington''' is a [[funk]] [[vocalist]] best known as a member of the band [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]]. 

Washington appeared as a background singer on recordings by [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]] in 1975. That year she joined Parliament with [[Debbie Wright]], becoming the first female members of the group. She recorded with Parliament (1977–1980) and [[Funkadelic]] (1978–1980), both featuring [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], and with the [[Sweat Band]] featuring [[Bootsy Collins]] & [[Maceo Parker]] (1980).

Washington formed the female spin-off band [[Parlet]] in 1978 with Wright and [[Mallia Franklin]] for their first album ''Pleasure Principle''. She recorded the group's remaining two albums ''Invasion Of the Booty Snatchers'' in 1979 and ''Play Me Or Trade Me'' in 1980 with [[Shirley Hayden]] and [[Janice Evans]]. Washington is the only Parlet member to have remained in the band for the duration of the group's career.

Washington left Parliament in 1980. She recorded with [[Dawn Silva]] in 2000.

==Confusion with Justine "Baby" Washington==
Soul historian Pete Hoppula has summarized the matter<ref>[http://koti.mbnet.fi/wdd/babywashington.htm Baby Washington<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and has provided a published source that notes the distinction:

{{quote|Meanwhile, during the late '70's, a certain Jeanette Washington began providing background vocals for George Clinton's famed Parliament/Funkadelic, as well as lead vocals for his girl group offshoot, Parlet. This session singer is not to be confused with [[Justine Washington|Baby Washington]], who states emphatically that she has never recorded with any of these groups.|<ref>Huston, Bruce. Baby Washington Part Two: Her Soul Years. ''Soul Survivor'' #10 Spring 1989 (Toronto), p. 15.</ref>}}

Justine (Jeanette) Jackie (Baby) Washington may have also sang the solo lead on a record by the hearts entitled "Loneley Nights."

'''Axum''' or '''Aksum''' ({{lang-ti|????}} {{IPA|/'aq???sum/}}, {{lang-am|????}} {{IPA|/'aksum/}}) is a city in northern [[Ethiopia]]. The town has a population of 56,500 residents (2010), and is governed as an urban [[Districts of Ethiopia|wäräda]].

The original capital of the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], it is [[List of cities by time of continuous habitation#Africa|one of the oldest continuously inhabited places]] in Africa. Axum was a naval and trading power that ruled the region from about 400 BC into the 10th century. The kingdom was also arbitrarily identified as Abyssinia, Ethiopia and India {{Cn|date=July 2014}} in medieval writings. In 1980 [[UNESCO]] added Aksum's archaeological sites to its list of [[World Heritage Site]]s due to their historic value.

Located in the [[Mehakelegnaw Zone]] of the [[Tigray Region]] near the base of the [[Adwa]] mountains, Axum has an elevation of {{convert|2131|m|ft}}. Axum is surrounded by [[La'ilay Maychew]] ''wäräda''.

==History==
{{details|Kingdom of Aksum|the early history of Axum}}
[[File:NE 565ad.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and other polities in 565.]]
Axum was the center of the marine trading power known as the Aksumite Kingdom, which predated the earliest mentions in [[Roman era]] writings. Around 356, its ruler was converted to [[Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity|Christianity]] by [[Frumentius]]. Later, under the reign of [[Kaleb of Axum|Kaleb]], Axum was a quasi-ally of [[Byzantium]] against the [[Persian Empire]]. The historical record is unclear, with ancient church records the primary contemporary sources.

It is believed it began a long slow decline after the 7th century due partly to the Persians (Zoroastrian) and finally the Arabs contesting old Red sea trade routes. Eventually Aksum was cut off from its principal markets in [[Alexandria]], Byzantium and [[Southern Europe]] and its trade share was captured by Arab traders of the era. The Kingdom of Aksum was finally destroyed by [[Gudit]]{{Cn|date=July 2014}}, and eventually some of the people of Aksum were forced south and their civilization declined. As the kingdom's power declined so did the influence of the city, which is believed to have lost population in the decline, similar to Rome and other cities thrust away from the flow of world events. The last known (nominal) king to reign was crowned in about the 10th century, but the kingdom's influence and power ended long before that.

Its decline in population and trade then contributed to the shift of the power center of the Ethiopian Empire south to the Agaw region as it moved further inland. The city of Axum was the administrative seat of an empire spanning 1 million square miles. Eventually,  the alternative name (Ethiopia) was adopted by the central region, and subsequently, the present modern state.<ref>G. Mokhtar, ''UNESCO General History of America, Vol. II, Abridged Edition'' (Berkeley: University of Aksum Press, 1990), pp. 215-35. ISBN 0-85255-092-8</ref>

==Aksum kingdom and Ethiopian Church==
[[File:Church Our Lady Mary Zion Axum Ethio.jpg|thumb|250px|Dome and Belltower of the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]]]]
The [[Kingdom of Axum]] had its own written language, [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]], and developed a distinctive architecture exemplified by giant obelisks, the oldest of which (though much smaller) date from 5000–2000 BC.<ref>Herausgegeben von Uhlig, Siegbert, ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha'' (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), p. 871.</ref> The kingdom was at its height under King [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]], baptized as Abreha, in the 4th century (which was also when it officially embraced [[Christianity]]).<ref>Fage, JD, ''A History of Africa'' (London: Routledge, 2001), pp. 53–4. ISBN 0-415-25248-2</ref>
[[File:Ark of the Covenant church in Axum Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Chapel of the Tablet]]
The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] claims that the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] in Axum houses the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Ark of the Covenant]], in which lie the [[Tablets of Law]] upon which the [[Ten Commandments]] are inscribed.<ref name=Hodd>Hodd, Mike, ''Footprint East Africa Handbook'' (New York: Footprint Travel Guides, 2002), p. 859. ISBN 1-900949-65-2.</ref> The historical records and Ethiopian traditions suggest that it was from Axum that Makeda, the [[Queen of Sheba]], journeyed to visit King [[Solomon]] in Jerusalem. She had a son, [[Menelik I|Menelik]], fathered by Solomon. He grew up in Ethiopia but traveled to Jerusalem as a young man to visit his father's homeland. He lived several years in Jerusalem before returning to his country with the Ark of the Covenant. According to the Ethiopian Church and Ethiopian tradition, the Ark still exists in Axum. This same church was the site where Ethiopian emperors were crowned for centuries until the reign of [[Fasilides]], then again beginning with [[Yohannes IV of Ethiopia|Yohannes IV]] until the end of the empire. Axum is considered to be the holiest city in Ethiopia and is an important destination of pilgrimages.<ref name=Hodd /><ref>See Linda Kay Davidson and David Gitlitz ''Pilgrimage, from the Ganges to Graceland: an Encyclopedia'' (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2002), 17–18.</ref> Significant religious festivals are the [[Timkat]] festival (known as [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]] in western Christianity) on 19 January (20 January in leap years) and the [[Festival of Maryam Zion]] on November 24.

In 1937, a 24-metre (79-foot) tall, 1,700-year-old [[Obelisk of Axum]],broken into five parts and lying on the ground, was found and shipped by [[Italy|Italian]] soldiers to [[Rome]] to be erected. The obelisk is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of engineering from the height of the Axumite empire. Despite a 1947 [[United Nations]] agreement that the obelisk would be shipped back, Italy balked, resulting in a long-standing diplomatic dispute with the Ethiopian government, which views the obelisk as a symbol of national identity. In April 2005, Italy finally returned the obelisk pieces to Axum amidst much official and public rejoicing; Italy also covered the $4 million costs of the transfer.  UNESCO assumed responsibility for the re-installation of this stele in Axum, and by the end of July 2008 the obelisk had been reinstalled (see panographic photos in external links below). It was unveiled on 4 September 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ethiopia unveils ancient obelisk |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7597589.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0016/001631/163173e.pdf |title=The Reinstallation of the Axum Obelisk |date=10 October 2008 |work= |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=22 February 2014}}</ref>

==Axum and Islam==
The Axumite Empire has a longstanding relationship with Islam. According to [[ibn Hisham]],<ref>ibn Hisham, ''The Life of the Prophet''</ref> when [[Prophet Muhammad]] faced oppression from the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraish]] clan, he sent a small group that included his daughter [[Ruqayya]] and her husband [[Uthman ibn Affan]] to Axum. [[Sahama]], the Axumite emperor,<ref>{{cite web|last=Nimer, Ph.D.|first=Mu?ammad|title=Exegesis, Social Science and the Place of the Jews in the Qur’an|url=http://iiit.org/Research/ScholarsSummerInstitute/TableofContents/ExegesisSocialScienceandthePlaceoftheJews/tabid/246/Default.aspx|accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref> gave them refuge and protection. He refused the requests of the Quraish clan to send these refugees back to Arabia. These refugees did not return until the sixth year of the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] (628), and even then many remained in Ethiopia, eventually settling at [[Negash]] in eastern Tigray{{Cn|date=July 2014}}.

There are different traditions concerning the effect these early Muslims had on the ruler of Axum. The Muslim tradition is that the ruler of Axum was so impressed by these refugees that he became a secret convert.<ref>Ibn Ishaq, ''The Life of Muhammad'' (Oxford, 1955), 657–58.</ref> On the other hand, Arabic historians and Ethiopian tradition state that some of the Muslim refugees who lived in Ethiopia during this time converted to Orthodox Christianity. There is also a second Ethiopian tradition that, on the death of Ashama ibn Abjar, Muhammed is reported to have prayed for the king's soul, and told his followers, "Leave the Abyssinians in peace, as long as they do not take the offensive."<ref>Paul B. Henze, ''Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia'' (New York: Palgrave, 2000), pp. 42f</ref>

==Main sights==
[[File:Stelenpark in Axum 2010.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Northern Stelae Park]]
The major Aksumite monuments in the town are [[stelae]]. These obelisks are around 1,700 years old and have become a symbol of the Ethiopian people's identity.<ref name="whc.unesco.org">{{cite web |title=Mission accomplished: Aksum Obelisk successfully reinstalled |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/456 |date=1 August 2008 |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref> The largest number are in the [[Northern Stelae Park]], ranging up to the 33-metre-long (3.84 metres wide, 2.35 metres deep, weighing 520 tonnes) [[Great Stele]], believed to have fallen and broken during construction.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Phillipson |first=David W. |year=2003 |title=Aksum: An archaeological introduction and guide |journal=Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=1–68 |doi=10.1080/00672700309480357 }}</ref> The [[Obelisk of Axum]] (24.6 metres high, 2.32 metres wide, 1.36 metres deep, weighing 170 tonnes) was removed by the Italian army in 1937, and returned to Ethiopia in 2005 and reinstalled July 31, 2008.<ref name="whc.unesco.org"/> This stele was already broken into pieces before being shipped. The next tallest is the 24-metre (20.6 metres high above the front baseplate, 2.65 metres wide, 1.18 metres deep, weighing 160 tonnes) [[King Ezana's Stele]]. Three more stelae measure 18.2 metres high, 1.56 metres wide, 0.76 metres deep, weighing 56 tonnes; 15.8 metres high, 2.35 metres wide, 1 metres deep, weighing 75 tonnes; 15.3 metres high, 1.47 metres wide, 0.78 metres deep, weighing 43 tonnes.<ref>Scarre, Chris ''Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World'' 1999</ref> The stelae are believed to mark [[Grave (burial)|graves]] and would have had cast metal discs affixed to their sides, which are also carved with architectural designs. The [[Gudit Stelae]] to the west of town, unlike the northern area, are interspersed with mostly 4th century [[tomb]]s.

The other major feature of the town are the Old and New Cathedrals of [[St Mary of Zion]]. The Old St Mary of Zion Cathedral was built in 1665 by Emperor [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]] and said to have previously housed the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. The original cathedral, said to have been built by Ezana and augmented several times after was believed to have been massive with 12 naves. It was burned to the ground by Gudit, rebuilt, and then destroyed again during the Gragn wars of the 1500s. It was again rebuilt by Emperor [[Gelawdewos]] (completed by his brother and successor Emperor [[Menas of Ethiopia|Minas]]) and Emperor Fasilides replaced that structure with the present one.  Only males are permitted entry into the Old St. Mary's Cathedral (some say as a result of the destruction of the original church by Gudit). The New Cathedral of St. Mary of Zion stands next to the old one, and was built to fulfill a pledge by Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] to the Our Lady of Zion for the liberation of Ethiopia from the Fascist occupation.  Built in a neo-Byzantine style, work on the new cathedral began in 1955, and allows admittance to women. Emperor Haile Selassie interrupted the state visit of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II to travel to Axum to attend the dedication of the new Cathedral and pay personal homage, showing the importance of this church in the Ethiopian Empire. The Queen visited the Cathedral a few days later.  Between the two cathedrals is a small chapel known as The Chapel of the Tablet built at the same time as the new cathedral, and which is believed to house the Ark of the Covenant. Emperor Haile Selassie's consort, Empress [[Menen Asfaw|Menen]], paid for its construction from her private funds. Admittance to the chapel is closed to all but the guardian monk who resides there. Entrance is even forbidden to the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church, and to the Emperor of Ethiopia during the monarchy. The two cathedrals and the chapel of the Ark are the focus of pilgrimage and considered the holiest sites in Ethiopia to members of its Orthodox Church.

Other attractions in Axum include archaeological and ethnographic museums, the [[Ezana Stone]] written in [[Sabaean]], [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] and [[Ancient Greek]] in a similar manner to the [[Rosetta Stone]], [[King Bazen's Tomb]] (a [[megalith]] considered to be one of the earliest structures), the so-called [[Queen of Sheba's Bath]] (actually a [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]]), the 4th-century [[Ta'akha Maryam]] and 6th-century [[Dungur]] palaces, the monasteries of [[Pentalewon Monastery|Abba Pentalewon]] and [[Abba Liqanos]] and the [[Lioness of Gobedra]] [[rock art]].

Local legend claims the [[Queen of Sheba]] lived in the town.

'''''Pleasure Principle''''' is the debut album by the female P-Funk spin off group [[Parlet]]. The album was released in 1978 by Casablanca Records and was produced by [[P-Funk]] leader/producer [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]]. Parlet consisted of [[Mallia Franklin]], Debbie Wright, and [[Jeanette Washington]]. The album features heavy involvement from the P-Funk musical collective. The track "Cookie Jar" was originally written and recorded by [[Clarence "Fuzzy" Haskins]].

In 1981, Lau signed up for the artist training program offered by [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]], which is where his acting career began.<ref name="yes1">Yesasia.com.

In 1983, Lau's role as ''"[[Yang Guo]]"'' in the [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]] series ''[[The Return of the Condor Heroes]]'' further increased his popularity.

In September 1983, TVB was looking to increase their ratings in competition with [[Korea]] and Japan for the best variety show.  The station then created the show ''TVB All-star challenge'' (???????) featuring almost the entire line-up of the most popular actors and singers at the time.<ref name="big5ch1">Big5.china.com.

'''L-3 MPRI''', is a global provider of private military contractor services. It offers a wide range of professional services to both public and private customers, most notably the [[U.S. Department of Defense]], the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Law Enforcement organizations, foreign governments, government agencies and commercial businesses.

The firm is based in [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. L-3 MPRI's President is retired US Army General [[Bantz J. Craddock]].<ref>http://www.mpri.com/esite/index.php/content/about/craddock/</ref>

==History==
Incorporated in 1987 — Founded as MPRI by eight former senior military leaders. Former Army Chief of Staff [[Carl E. Vuono]] joined MPRI in 1993. General [[William F. Kernan]] of the U.S. Army also joined the firm after his military service.

Acquired in June 2000 — L-3 MPRI is a division of L-3 Communications Corporation. L-3 specializes in Command, Control and Communications, [[Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance]] (C3ISR),  government services, training and simulation, and aircraft modernization and maintenance, and has a broad base of electronic systems. L-3 is also a major provider of homeland defense products and services.

==Training==
MPRI began by almost exclusively employing retired U.S. military personnel.

It used retired military personnel and current [[U.S. National Guard]] or reservists, to run [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] programs at more than 200 universities. Other employees have worked in U.S. Army recruitment centers and trained U.S. soldiers. With offices in other countries, employees also have trained foreign armies at ranges in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], and [[South Africa]]. MPRI reassures their clients with services from teams of military leaders, law enforcement officers, strategic analysts, [[disaster management]] experts, and diplomatic and private sector leaders.

In 1995-96 before [[Operation Storm]], there is considerable circumstantial evidence to suggest that MPRI prepared and trained the [[Croatian Army]] for its offensive to retake the [[Krajina]] region. In April 1995, Democracy Transition Assistance Program (DTAP) training began at the "Petar Zrinski" military school in [[Zagreb]].<ref name="Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry">{{cite book|last=Singer|first=P.W.|title=Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry|publisher=Cornell University Press|date=2003-06-01|pages=119–125}}</ref> Deborah Avant discusses the controversy in her book ''The Market for Force: The Consequences of Privatizing Security''.<ref>Avant, 2005, p.103, citing stories in the London Sunday Telegraph, US News and World Report, and Economist, 1995.</ref> MPRI provided (along with a [[French Foreign Legion]] organized training camp in Šepurine near Zadar) mainly training for commissioned officers, but a 1999 study published in the journal of the [[U.S. Army War College]] concluded that the company had no significant intelligence activities or professional influence on senior Croatian military strategy and tactics.<ref name=Adams1999>{{Cite journal

Local forces in [[Croatia]] were referred to MPRI by the [[United States Department of Defense]] and used their training.  120 African leaders and more than 5,500 African troops have been trained by MPRI on security issues.<ref name="America's For-Profit Secret Army">{{cite news|last=Wayne|first=Leslie|title=America's For-Profit Secret Army|publisher=The New York Times|date=2002-10-13|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E7DF123AF930A25753C1A9649C8B63|accessdate=2007-11-05}}</ref>
 
MPRI started training the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] for $140 million, after 1995 when the [[Dayton Accords]] were established.<ref>[http://www.antiwar.com/orig/dakovic3.html How 'Operation Storm' Destabilized the Balkans], Written by JUGOISTOK Belgrade, Serbia</ref> On the back of its success in Croatia, MPRI won the approximately $50 million ‘Train and Equip’ contract for the Bosnian Federation army, which ran from July 1996.<ref>Singer, 2003, 128-129</ref>  The training contract was accompanied by an approximately $100 million arms transfer programme. The contract began with restructuring the Ministry of Defence and claimed to create a combined logistics system between the initial separate Muslim and Croat armies. While the contractors claimed they had combined the logistics system, assessments made in the 2000s disagreed: ‘the force integration of the Federation army has been superficial and limited to some cooperation at the HQ level.’  The contract also included development of training policy, assisting with unit training, establishment of a central combat training centre, including a school at Hadzici and a field combat simulation centre at Livno. While the facilities may have been constructed, whether the training and logistics systems changes lasted is uncertain, given Maxwell’s assessment.<ref>Rohan Maxwell, 'Bosnia and Herzegovina 1.1,' paper given at the 'New Armies from Old' Conference, Carlisle Barracks, PA, 2010</ref>

MPRI trained security forces used to defeat an attack on the presidential palace of [[Equatorial Guinea]]'s long-serving dictator [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema]].<ref>[http://www.parade.com/dictators/2009/more-of-the-worlds-worst-dictators.html?index=4 More of the World's Worst Dictators. Number 14.] ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]''.</ref>

==Defense contracts==
In the early 1990s, MPRI signed a 5-year contract with the U.S. State Department involving the shipment of donated medical supplies and food to former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] states.

In 1998, the government of [[Equatorial Guinea]] asked MPRI to evaluate its defense systems, particularly its need for a coast guard to protect its [[oil reserves]]. In order to take the job, MPRI needed a license from the U.S. State Department. The Clinton administration rejected the request, citing the West African nation's human rights record.  In 2000, after lobbying by MPRI, the State Department issued the license. MPRI did not reveal the terms of its contract with Equatorial Guinea.<ref name="Soldiers of Good Fortune">{{cite news|last=Yeoman|first=Barry|title=Soldiers of Good Fortune|publisher=Mother Jones|date=2003-06-01|url=http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2003/05/ma_365_01.html|accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref>

In 1999 MPRI signed an 18 month, $4.3 million contract to work with military in [[Colombia]] on the drug war. The contract expired in March 2001 and was not renewed allegedly because the [[Colombian Defense Ministry]] and its officers were upset by recommendations such as "Hit the enemy with a closed fist; do not poke at him with fingers of an open hand."  (Note: this is a maxim of [[World War II]] German General [[Heinz Guderian]].)  <ref name="Colombia: Outsourcing War">{{cite news|title=Colombia: Outsourcing War|publisher=The Center for Public Integrity|url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/report.aspx?aid=261|accessdate=2007-11-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070605200739/http://www.publicintegrity.org/report.aspx?aid=261 |archivedate = 2007-06-05}}</ref>
 
According to a [[United States Department of Defense]] census, MPRI has at least 500 employees working in Iraq on 12 different contracts including mentoring civilian workers at the [[Ministry of Defence (Iraq)|Ministry of Defense]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/04/AR2006120401311.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Census Counts 100,000 Contractors in Iraq | first=Renae | last=Merle | date=December 5, 2006 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref>

MPRI under a US Department of Defense contract conducted training and advisory services for the Afghan National Army (ANA).  Also supported in various areas logistical and advisory services in regional areas of Afghanistan.

MPRI is a contractor for the US State Department Bureau of African Affairs with training in African countries to include Uganda, with emphasis on pre-deployment training of UPDF en route to support African Union initiatives in Somalia.

==Lawsuit==
A group of [[Serbs]] who lived in [[Krajina]] until [[Operation Storm]] sued MPRI accusing them for "participation in genocide", militarily equipping the [[Croatian Armed Forces]], training the Croatian officers and developing a plan of Operation Storm. The claim was presented to the Federal Court in Chicago, and prosecutors are seeking 10.4 billion compensation.<ref>[http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/ci/story/3/%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD/753784 RTS: ???? ?? ?????? ???? ???????? ????? ????

'''Jan Gustaf Troell''' (born 23 July 1931) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] film director. Usually, Troell writes his own scripts and serves as his own [[director of photography]]. His realistic films, with a lyrical photography in which nature is prominent, have placed him in the first rank of modern Swedish film directors along with [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Bo Widerberg]].

==Life and career==
Troell was born in [[Limhamn]] outside [[Malmö]], Sweden. For several years, he worked as an elementary-school teacher but started to make [[short film]]s in the sixties. In 1965 he co-produced the film ''[[4x4 (film)|4x4]]'' and it was entered into the [[4th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name="Moscow1965">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1965 |title=4th Moscow International Film Festival (1965) |accessdate=2012-12-02 |work=MIFF}}</ref> He became director of photography for Widerberg but soon made a debut with his own first feature, ''[[Here's Your Life]]'' (''Här har du ditt liv'', 1966), about a working class boy in Sweden, set in the beginning of the 20th century. The film was based upon an autobiographical novel by [[Eyvind Johnson]]. For the film he won the [[Guldbagge Award for Best Director]] at the [[4th Guldbagge Awards]].<ref name="SFI">{{cite web |url=http://www.sfi.se/en-GB/Swedish-film-database/Item/?type=MOVIE&itemid=4749&iv=Awards |title=  Här har du ditt liv (1966) |publisher=Swedish Film Institute |date=1 March 2014}}</ref> His next film ''[[Who Saw Him Die?]]'' (''Ole dole doff'', 1968) won the [[Golden Bear]] award at the [[18th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale 1968">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1968/03_preistr_ger_1968/03_Preistraeger_1968.html |title=Berlinale 1968: Prize Winners |accessdate=2010-03-05 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>

Troell's major work in the 1970s became ''[[The Emigrants (film)|The Emigrants]]'' (''Utvandrarna'', 1971) and its sequel ''[[The New Land]]'' (''Nybyggarna'', 1972), two epic films about some peasants emigrating from the barren Swedish countryside to America in the 19th century. Once again, Troell films were based upon the novels of a Swedish working-class author, in this case [[Vilhelm Moberg]]'s famous [[The Emigrants (novels)|Emigrants suite]]. As in many of Troell's films, [[Max von Sydow]] plays one of the major roles. ''The Emigrants'' was nominated for several [[Academy Award]]s.<ref name="Oscars1972">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/44th-winners.html |title=The 44th Academy Awards (1972) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-11-27 |work=oscars.org}}</ref>

After a brief and unsuccessful sojourn in Hollywood, which resulted in the films ''[[Zandy's Bride]]'' (1974), starring [[Gene Hackman]], and [[Hurricane (1979 film)|Hurricane]] (1979), Troell made ''[[Flight of the Eagle]]'' (''Ingenjör Andrées luftfärd'', 1982). It is a film about [[Salomon August Andrée|S. A. Andrée]]'s disastrous [[S. A. Andrée's Arctic Balloon Expedition of 1897|Arctic balloon expedition of 1897]]. ''The Flight of the Eagle'' was nominated for the Academy Awards (foreign-language film). 

The release of ''[[Il Capitano: A Swedish Requiem]]'' (''Il Capitano'', 1991) became controversial since the film is based upon a true story; the brutal murder of a Swedish family just a few years earlier (see [[Juha Valjakkala]]). Yet, it concentrates on the psychological power game between the murderer and his girlfriend rather than the violence of the crime. He was awarded with the [[Silver Bear for Best Director]] at the [[42nd Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale 1992">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1992/03_preistr_ger_1992/03_Preistraeger_1992.html |title=Berlinale: 1992 Prize Winners |accessdate=2011-05-22 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> It also won the award for [[Guldbagge Award for Best Film|Best Film]] at the [[27th Guldbagge Awards]].<ref name="27thGuldbagge">{{cite web |url=http://www.sfi.se/en-GB/Swedish-film-database/Item/?type=MOVIE&itemid=16172&iv=Awards |title=Il Capitano (1991) |publisher=Swedish Film Institute |date=17 March 2014}}</ref>

Troell has also made documentaries, for instance ''Land of Dreams'' (''Sagolandet'', 1988), dealing with modern society's alienation from nature and ''A Frozen Dream'' (''En frusen dröm'', 1997) in which he once again brings up Andrée's polar expedition. 

Despite his age (he is currently 81), Troell has remained productive until the present day. His recent films include ''[[As White as in Snow]]'' (''Så vit som en snö'', 2001), based on the life of Swedish aviatrix [[Elsa Andersson]], a documentary called ''Presence'' (''Närvarande'', 2003), and his latest film ''[[Everlasting Moments]]'' (''Maria Larssons eviga ögonblick'', 2008). His next feature film is called ''[[The Last Sentence]]'' (''Dom över död man'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfi.se/en-GB/Swedish-film-database/Item/?itemid=69012&type=MOVIE&iv=Basic|title=The Last Sentence (2012)|work=[[Swedish Film Database]]|publisher=[[Swedish Film Institute]]|accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref> It's a biographical film about the Swedish publicist [[Torgny Segerstedt]] and premiered in November 2012 at the [[2012 Stockholm International Film Festival|Stockholm International Film Festival]]. At the same festival Troell was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award.

[[File:Paolo Sarpi 2.jpg|thumb|Paolo Sarpi]]
[[Image:Paolo Sarpi.jpg|thumb|Engraving of Fra Paolo Sarpi by [[George Vertue]] (1684–1756)]]

'''Paolo Sarpi''' (14 August 1552 – 15 January 1623) was a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] historian, prelate, scientist, [[canon lawyer]], and statesman active on behalf of the [[Venetian Republic]] during the period of its successful defiance of the [[Venetian Interdict| papal interdict]] (1605–1607) and its [[Uskok War| war (1615–1617) with Austria]] over the [[Uskok]] pirates. His writings, frankly polemical and highly critical of the Catholic Church and its [[Scholasticism| Scholastic]] tradition, "inspired both [[Hobbes]] and [[Gibbon]] in their own historical debunkings of priestcraft."<ref>Nadon, "Paolo Sarpi and the Venetian Interdict" in ''Enlightenment and Secularism: Essays on the Mobilization of Reason'', p. 20.</ref> Sarpi's major work, the ''History of the Council of Trent'' (1619), was published in London in 1619; other works: a ''History of Ecclesiastical Benefices'', ''History of the Interdict'' and his ''Supplement to the History of the Uskoks'', appeared posthumously. Organized around single topics, they are early examples of the genre of the historical [[monograph]].<ref>Peter Burke, editor and translator, ''The History of Benefices and Selections from the History of the Council of Trent, by Paolo Sarpi'' (New York: Washington Square Press, 1962), p. xxvii.</ref> 

As a defender of the liberties of Republican Venice and proponent of the separation of Church and state,<ref>[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9184519| Ron Naylor, "Paolo Sarpi and the first Copernican tidal theory," ''The British Journal for the History of Science, first view'', 26 February 2014.]</ref> Sarpi attained fame as a hero of republicanism and free thought and possible crypto Protestant.<ref>Sarpi "indeed was the most widely translated Italian author in England between 1620–1720," Christopher Nadon, "Paolo Sarpi and the Venetian Interdict" in ''Enlightenment and Secularism: Essays on the Mobilization of Reason'', Christopher Nadon, editor (Lexington Books, 2013), p. 20.</ref> His last words, "Esto perpetua" ("may she [i.e., the republic] live forever"), were recalled by John Adams in 1820 in a letter to Thomas Jefferson, when Adams "wished 'as devoutly as Father Paul for the preservation of our vast American empire and our free institutions', as Sarpi had wished for the preservation of Venice and its institutions,"<ref>[http://irandallthat.blogspot.com/2013/12/venice-and-liberty-of-states.html| David C. Hendrickson, Professor of International relations at Colorado College, "Venice and the Liberty of States", ''IR and all that : Classic Readings on International Relations'', December 13, 2013].</ref> 

Sarpi was also an experimental scientist, a proponent of the Copernican system, a friend and patron of [[Galileo Galilei]],<ref>[http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/galileo-observes-satellites-jupiter| Richard Cavendish, "Galileo observes the satellites of Jupiter", ''History Today'': 60: (Jan. 2009)].</ref> and a keen follower of the latest research on anatomy, astronomy, and ballistics at the [[University of Padua]]. His extensive network of correspondents included [[Francis Bacon]] and [[William Harvey]].

== Early years ==
He was born Pietro Sarpi in [[Venice]]. His father was a merchant, although not a successful one, his mother a Venetian noblewoman.<ref>Burke, ''The History of Benefices and Selections from the History of the Council of Trent, by Paolo Sarpi'', p. x.</ref> While he was still a child his father died. The brilliant and precocious boy was educated by his maternal uncle, a school teacher, and then by Giammaria Capella, monk in the Augustinian [[Servite]] order. At the age of thirteen he entered the Servite order in 1566, assuming the name of Fra (Brother) Paolo, by which, with the epithet Servita, he was always known to his contemporaries.<ref>"[http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/sarpi.html Paolo Sarpi (1552–1623)]". The Galileo Project. Retrieved on 13 November 2008.</ref>

Sarpi was assigned to a monastery in [[Mantua]] around 1567. In 1570 he sustained theses at a disputation there, and was invited to remain as court theologian to [[Guglielmo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua|Duke Guglielmo Gonzaga]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul F. Grendler|title=The University of Mantua, the Gonzaga & the Jesuits, 1584–1630|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=i0VwjnKewnUC&pg=PA27|accessdate=24 July 2012|date=2009|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-9171-7|page=27}}</ref> Sarpi remained four years at Mantua, studying [[mathematics]] and [[oriental language]]s. He then went to [[Milan]] in 1575, where he was an adviser to [[Charles Borromeo]], the saint and bishop<ref>Richard Tuck, ''Philosophy and Government 1572–1651'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993). ISBN 0521438853. p. 97.</ref> but was transferred by his superiors to Venice, as professor of philosophy at the Servite convent. In 1579, he became Provincial <ref>[http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/sarpi.html See entry, "Provincial", in the Catholic Encyclopedia.]</ref> of the Venetian Province of the Servite order,<ref>{{cite book|author=[[William James Bouwsma]]|title=Venice and the Defense of Republican Liberty: Renaissance Values in the Age of the Counter Reformation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uMLy6Ht7fxEC&pg=PA359|year=1968|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-05221-5|page=359}}</ref> while studying at the University of Padua. At the age of twenty-seven he was appointed Procurator General for the order. In this capacity he was sent to [[Rome]], where he interacted with with three successive popes, as well as the [[grand inquisitor]] and other influential people.

Sarpi returned to Venice in 1588, and passed the next 17 years in study, occasionally interrupted by the internal disputes of his community. In 1601, he was recommended by the Venetian senate for the  [[bishopric of Caorle]], but the papal [[nuncio]], who wished to obtain it for a ''protégé'' of his own, accused Sarpi of having denied the [[immortality of the soul]] and controverted the authority of [[Aristotle]].  An attempt to obtain another bishopric in the following year also failed, [[Pope Clement VIII]] having taken offense at Sarpi's habit of corresponding with learned [[Heresy|heretics]].

== Venice in conflict with the Pope ==
{{main|Venetian Interdict}}

Clement VIII died in March 1605, and the attitude of his successor [[Pope Paul V]] strained the limits of papal prerogative. Venice simultaneously adopted measures to restrict it: the right of the secular tribunals to take cognizance of the offences of ecclesiastics had been asserted in two leading cases and the scope of two ancient laws of the city: one forbidding the foundation of churches or ecclesiastical congregations without the consent of the state, the other forbidding acquisition of property by priests or religious bodies. These laws had been extended over the entire territory of the republic. In January 1606, the papal nuncio delivered a brief demanding the unconditional submission of the Venetians. The senate promised protection to all ecclesiastics who should in this emergency aid the republic by their counsel. Sarpi presented a memoir, pointing out that the threatened censures might be met in two ways – ''de facto'', by prohibiting their publication, and ''de jure'', by an appeal to a general council.  The document was well received, and Sarpi was made [[canonist]] and theological counsellor to the republic.

The following April, hopes of compromise were dispelled by Paul's [[excommunication]] of the Venetians and his attempt to lay their dominions under an interdict. Sarpi entered energetically into the controversy. It was unprecedented for an ecclesiastic of his eminence to argue the subjection of the clergy to the state.<ref>
Contemporary diaries published by Enrico Cornet (Vienna, 1859) relate the incidents of the Venetian dispute from day to day.</ref> He began by republishing the anti-papal opinions of the canonist [[Jean Gerson]] (1363–1429). In an anonymous tract published shortly afterwards (''Risposta di un Dottore in Teologia''), he laid down principles which struck radically at papal authority in secular matters.  This book was promptly included in the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'', and [[Roberto Francesco Romolo Bellarmine|Cardinal Bellarmine]] attacked Gerson's work with severity. Sarpi then replied in an ''Apologia''. The ''Considerazioni sulle censure'' and the ''Trattato dell' interdetto'', the latter partly prepared under his direction by other theologians, soon followed. Numerous other pamphlets appeared, inspired or controlled by Sarpi, who had received the further appointment of censor of everything written at Venice in defence of the republic.

The Venetian clergy largely disregarded the interdict and discharged their functions as usual, the major exception being the [[Jesuits]], who left and were simultaneously expelled officially.<ref name = Cochrane>Eric Cochrane (1988) ''Italy 1530–1630''. Longman. ISBN 0582491444. p. 262.</ref> The Catholic powers France and Spain refused to be drawn into the quarrel, but resorted to diplomacy.<ref name = Cochrane/> At length (April 1607), a compromise was arranged through the mediation of King [[Henry IV of France]], which salvaged the pope's dignity, but conceded the points at issue. The outcome proved not so much the defeat of the papal pretensions as the recognition that interdicts and excommunication had lost their force.

==Assassination attempt==
[[File:Campo Santa Fosca - Paolo Sarpi.jpg|thumb|Statue of Paolo Sarpi, Campo Santa Fosca, Venice, near the place where he was stabbed]]
The republic rewarded him with the distinction of state counsellor in jurisprudence and the liberty of access to the state archives. These honours exasperated his adversaries, particularly Pope Paul V.  In September 1607, at the instigation of the pope and his nephew Cardinal [[Scipio Borghese]], Fra Sarpi became the intended victim of an assassination attempt by an unfrocked friar and brigand by the name of Rotilio Orlandini to kill Sarpi for the sum of 8,000 crowns, assisted by Orlandini's two brothers-in-law.<ref name="ROB"/><ref>''The Cambridge Modern History, Volume 4: Fra Paolo Sarpi'' (Cambridge University Press 1906), p. 671</ref>  However, Orlandini's plot was discovered, and when the three assassins crossed from Papal into Venetian territory they were arrested and imprisoned.<ref name="ROB">Robertson, Alexander (1893) ''Fra Paolo Sarpi: the Greatest of the Venetians'', London: Sampson, Low, Marston & Co. pp. 114–117</ref>

On 5 October 1607 Sarpi was attacked by [[assassination|assassin]]s and left for dead with fifteen [[stiletto]] thrusts, but he recovered.<ref name="ROB"/>  His attackers found both refuge and a welcome reception in the papal territories (described by a contemporary as a "triumphal march"), and papal enthusiasm for the assassins only cooled after learning that Brother Sarpi was not dead after all.<ref name="ROB"/> The leader of the assassins, Poma, declared that he had attempted the murder for religious reasons. Sarpi himself, when his surgeon commented on the ragged and inartistic character of the wounds, quipped dryly, "''Agnosco stylum Curiae Romanae''" ("I recognize the style of the Roman Curia").<ref>A triple play on the word "stylus" as writing implement, pen, and dagger, "in an age of vicious play on words, one of the most notable puns of all time" (John Humphreys Whitfield and John Robert Woodhouse, ''A Short History of Italian Literature'' [Manchester University Press, 1980], p. 187).</ref> Sarpi's would-be assassins settled in Rome, and were eventually granted a pension by the viceroy of Naples, [[Pedro Téllez-Girón, 3rd Duke of Osuna]].<ref>David Wootton, ''Paolo Sarpi: Between Renaissance and Enlightenment'' (Cambridge University Press, 1983  ISBN 0-521-23146-9), p. 2.</ref>

==Later life==
The remainder of Sarpi's life was spent peacefully in his [[cloister]], though plots against him continued to be formed, and he occasionally spoke of taking refuge in England.  When not engaged in preparing state papers, he devoted himself to scientific studies, and composed several works. He served the state to the last.  The day before his death, he had dictated three replies to questions on affairs of the Venetian Republic, and his last words were "[[Esto perpetua]]," or "may she endure forever."

== ''History of the Council of Trent'' ==

In 1619 his chief literary work, ''Istoria del Concilio Tridentino'' (History of the [[Council of Trent]]), was printed at London, published under the name of Pietro Soave Polano, an anagram of Paolo Sarpi Veneto (plus o). The editor, [[Marco Antonio de Dominis]], did some work on polishing the text. He has been accused of falsifying it, but a comparison with a manuscript corrected by Sarpi himself shows that the alterations are unimportant. Translations into other languages followed: there were the English translation by [[Nathaniel Brent]] and a Latin edition in 1620 made partly by [[Adam Newton (dean)|Adam Newton]],<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Newton, Adam}}</ref> and French and German editions.<ref>Peter Brand, Lino Pertile (1999) ''The Cambridge History of Italian Literature'' (Cambridge University Press ISBN 0521666228), p. 315.</ref><ref>W. J. Patterson (1997) ''King James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom'' (Cambridge University Press ISBN 0-521-23146-9), p. 247.</ref>

Its emphasis was on the role of the [[Papal Curia]], and its slant on the Curia hostile. This was unofficial history, rather than a commission, and treated ecclesiastical history as politics.<ref>[[William J. Bouwsma]], ''Venice and the Defense of Liberty'', pp. 568–69.</ref> Sarpi in Mantua had known Camillo Olivo, secretary to Cardinal [[Ercole Gonzaga]].<ref>Wootton, ''Paolo Sarpi: Between Renaissance and Enlightenment'', p. 8.</ref> His attitude, "bitterly realistic" for [[John Hale (historian)|John Hale]], was coupled with a criticism that the Tridentine settlement was not conciliatory but designed for further conflict.<ref>[[John Hale (historian)|John Hale]] (1993) ''The Civilization of Europe in the Renaissance''. Simon and Schuster. ISBN 0684803526. p. 138.</ref> [[Denys Hay]] calls it "a kind of Anglican picture of the debates and decisions",<ref>[[Denys Hay]], ''Annalists and Historians'' (1977), p. 140.</ref> and Sarpi was much read by Protestants; [[John Milton]] called him the "great unmasker".<ref>{{cite journal|author=[[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]]|title=The great unmasker: Paolo Sarpi, 1551–1613|journal= History Today|volume=15 |year=1965|pages=430|url=http://www.historytoday.com/peter-burke/great-unmasker-paolo-sarpi-1552-1623}}</ref>

Sarpi's work attained such fame that the Vatican opened its archives to Cardinal [[Pietro Sforza Pallavicino]], whom it commissioned to write a three volume rebuttal, entitled the  ''Istoria del Concilio di Trento, scritta dal P. Sforza Pallavicino, della Comp. di Giesù ove insieme rifiutasi con auterevoli testimonianze un Istoria falsa divolgata nello stesso argomento sotto nome di Petro Soave Polano'' ("The History of the Council of Trent written by P. Sforza Pallavicino, of the Company of Jesus, in which a false history upon the same argument put forth under the name of Petro Soave Polano is refuted by means of authoritative testimony") (1656–1657).<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11426a.htm| Catholic Encyclopedia entry: "Pietro Sforza Pallavicino"].</ref> The great nineteenth century historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (''History of the Popes''), examined both Sarpi and Pallavicino's treatments of manuscript materials and judged them both as falling short of his own strict standards of objectivity, but he rated the quality of Sarpi's work very highly, nevertheless, considering him superior to Guicciardini.<ref>Burke, ''The History of Benefices and Selections from the History of the Council of Trent, by Paolo Sarpi'', p. xxix.</ref> Sarpi never acknowledged his authorship, and baffled all the efforts of [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé]] to extract the secret from him.

[[Hubert Jedin]]'s multi-volume history of the Council of Trent (1961), also Vatican authorized, likewise faults Sarpi's use of sources.<ref>The first two volumes of this, definitive history of the council, have been translated into English and published by the American Council of Learned Societies as ''A History of the Council of Trent Volume I: The Struggle for the Council'' and ''A History of the Council of Trent Volume II: The First Sessions at Trent, 1545-1547'' (2008).</ref> David Wootton believes, however, that there is evidence Sarpi may have used original documents that have not survived and he calls Sarpi's treatment of Council quite careful despite its partisan framing.<ref>Wootton, ''Paolo Sarpi: Between Renaissance and Enlightenment'', pp. 104–105.</ref>

==Other works==
In 1615, a dispute occurred between the Venetian government and the [[Inquisition]] over the prohibition of a book. In 1613 the Senate had asked Sarpi to write about the history and procedure of the Venetian Inquisition. He argued that this had been set up in 1289, but as a Venetian state institution. The pope of the time, [[Pope Nicholas IV|Nicholas IV]], had merely consented to its creation.<ref>Brian Pullan (1998) ''The Jews of Europe and the Inquisition of Venice, 1550–1670''.  I. B. Tauris. ISBN 1860643574. p. 15.</ref> This work appeared in English translation by [[Robert Gentilis]] in 1639.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Gentili, Robert}}</ref>

A [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]an tract on the fundamental maxims of Venetian policy (''Opinione come debba governarsi la repubblica di Venezia''), used by his adversaries to blacken his memory, dates from 1681.<ref>John Jeffries Martin, John Martin, Dennis Romano (2000) ''Venice Reconsidered: The History and Civilization of an Italian City-state, 1297–1797''. JHU Press. ISBN 0801873088. p. 495.</ref> He did not complete a reply which he had been ordered to prepare to the ''Squitinio delia libertà veneta'', which he perhaps found unanswerable. In folio appeared his ''History of Ecclesiastical Benefices'', in which, says [[Matteo Ricci]], "he purged the church of the defilement introduced by spurious decretals." It appeared in English translation in 1736 with a biography by [[John Lockman]].<ref name="SarpiLockman1736">{{cite book|author1=Paolo Sarpi|author2=John Lockman|title=A treatise of ecclesiastical benefices and revenues. ...|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PEMVAAAAQAAJ&pg=PR1|accessdate=24 July 2012|year=1736|publisher=printed for Olive Payne and Joseph Fox|page=i}}</ref> In 1611, he attacked misuse of the right of asylum claimed for churches, in a work that was immediately placed on the Index.

His posthumous ''History of the Interdict'' was printed at Venice the year after his death, with the disguised imprint of Lyon. Sarpi's memoirs on state affairs remained in the Venetian archives. [[Consul Smith]]'s collection of tracts in the Interdict controversy went to the [[British Museum]]. Francesco Griselini's ''Memorie e aneddote'' (1760) was based on Sarpi's unpublished writings, later destroyed by fire.

==Correspondence networks and published letters==
Sarpi was the center of a vast political and scholarly network of eminent correspondents, from which about 430 of his letters have survived.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joad Raymond|title=News Networks In Seventeenth Century Britain And Europe|url=|accessdate=27 July 2012|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-36008-1|page=36}}</ref> Early letter collections were: "Lettere Italiane di Fra Sarpi" (Geneva, 1673); Scelte lettere inedite de P. Sarpi", edited by Aurelio Bianchi-Giovini (Capolago, 1833); "Lettere raccolte di Sarpi", edited by Polidori (Florence, 1863); "Lettere inedite di Sarpi a S. Contarini", edited by Castellani (Venice, 1892).<ref>"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13477b.htm Paolo Sarpi]". New Advent.</ref>

Some hitherto unpublished letters of Sarpi were edited by [[Karl Benrath]] and published, under the title ''Paolo Sarpi. Neue Briefe'', 1608–1610 (at Leipzig in 1909).

A modern edition (1961) ''Lettere ai Gallicane'' has been published of his hundreds of letters to French correspondents. These are mainly to jurists: [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]], [[Jacques Lechassier]], [[Jacques Gillot (jurist)|Jacques Gillot]]. Another correspondent was [[William Cavendish, 2nd Earl of Devonshire]]; English translations by [[Thomas Hobbes]] of 45 letters to the Earl were published (Hobbes acted as the Earl's secretary), and it is now thought that these are jointly from Sarpi (when alive) and his close friend [[Fulgenzio Micanzio]], something concealed at the time as a matter of prudence.<ref>Filippo de Vivo, "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice” in ''News Networks in Seventeenth Century Britain and Europe'', Joad Raymond, editor (Routledge, 2006), p. 37.</ref> Micanzio was also in touch with [[Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester]].<ref>Aloysius Martinich, ''Hobbes: A Biography'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999. ISBN 0521495830), p. 38.</ref> Giusto Fontanini's ''Storia arcana della vita di Pietro Sarpi'' (1863), a bitter [[libel]], is important for the letters of Sarpi it contains.

==Views==

Sarpi read and was influenced by the skepticism of [[Michel de Montaigne]] and his disciple [[Pierre Charron]].<ref>Gianni Paganini ''The Return of Scepticism: From Hobbes and Descartes to Bayle'' (Springer, 2000 ISBN 1402013779), p. 328.</ref> As a historian and thinker in the realist tradition of [[Tacitus]], [[Machiavelli]], and [[Guicciardini]], he stressed that patriotism as national pride or honor could play a central role in social control.<ref>Richard Tuck, (1993) ''Philosophy and Government 1572–1651'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993 ISBN 0521438853), pp. 98–99.</ref> At various times during his lifetime he was suspected of a lack of orthodoxy in religion: he appeared before the Inquisition around 1575, in 1594, and in 1607.<ref>"[http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/rhatch/pages/03-Sci-Rev/SCI-REV-Home/resource-ref-read/major-minor-ind/westfall-dsb/SAM-S.htm Robert A. Hatch, "The Scientific Revolution"]. clas.ufl.edu</ref> 

Sarpi hoped for toleration of Protestant worship in Venice, and he hoped for the establishment of a Venetian free church by which the decrees of the council of Trent would have been rejected. Sarpi discusses his intimate beliefs and motives in his correspondence with [[Christoph von Dohna]], envoy to Venice for [[Christian I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg]].<ref>Published by Moritz Ritter in the ''Briefe und Acten zur Geschichte des dreissigjährigen Krieges'', vol. ii. (Munich, 1874).</ref> Sarpi told Dohna that he greatly disliked saying [[Catholic Mass|Mass]], and celebrated it as seldom as possible, but that he was compelled to do so, as he would otherwise seem to admit the validity of the papal prohibition. Sarpi's maxim was that "God does not regard externals so long as the mind and heart are right before Him."<ref>[http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/S/SAR/pietro-sarpi.html Pietro Sarpi, ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' (1902).]</ref> Another maxim Sarpi formulated to Dohna was: ''Le falsità non dico mai mai, ma la verità non a ognuno'' ("I never, never tell falsehoods, but the truth I do not tell to everyone.")

Sarpi at the end of his life wrote to [[Daniel Heinsius]] that he favored the Calvinist Contra-Remonstrants' side at the [[Synod of Dort]].<ref>[[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], ''From Counter-Revolution to Glorious Revolution'' (1992), p. 96.</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/719/77044|author=Hugh Trevor-Roper|title=The Crisis of the Seventeenth Century: Religion, the Reformation and Social Change |place=Indianapolis|publisher= Liberty Fund|year= 2001}}</ref> Yet, although Sarpi corresponded with James I of England and admired the English Book of Common Prayer, in the 18th century Catholic theologian [[Pierre François le Courayer|Le Courayer]] wrote that Sarpi was no a Protestant, terming him, "Catholique en gros et quelque fois Protestant en détail" ("Catholic overall and at times Protestant detail"). In the twentieth century William James Bouwsma found Sarpi to have been a philo-protestant “whose religious ideas were nevertheless “consistent with Catholic orthodoxy”,<ref>Jaska Kainulainen, ''Paolo Sarpi: A Servant of God and State'' (Brill, 2014), p. 127.</ref> and Eric Cochrane described him deeply religious in the typical spirit of the Counter-Reformation.<ref>Kainulainen, p. 127.</ref> Corrado Vivanti saw Sarpi was a religious reformer who aspired toward an ecumenical church,<ref>Kainulainen, ''Paolo Sarpi: A Servant of God and State'', p. 127.</ref> and historian [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]] describes Sarpi as having moved away from dogmatic Christianity.<ref>Diarmaid MacCulloch, ''Reformation: Europe's House Divided 1490–1700'' (Penguin, 2003 ISBN 0140285342), p. 409.</ref> On the other hand, in 1983 David Wootton made a startling case for Sarpi as a scientific materialist and thus as likely a "veiled" atheist who was "hostile to Christianity itself" and whose politics looked forward to a secular society unrealizable in his own time,<ref>Wootton, ''Paolo Sarpi: Between Renaissance and Enlightenment'', p. 2. See also {{cite journal|author=Gerald Curzon |url=http://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&fp=philnow&id=philnow_2014_0101_0022_0023|title=Paolo Sarpi (1552–1623)|journal=[[Philosophy Now]]|volume=101|date=March–April 2014|pages=22–23}}.</ref> a thesis that has won some acceptance.<ref>Eric Cochrane responded by calling Wootton's thesis a work of "cryptography" rather than history and accused him of either not having read or else with having suppressed contradictory evidence from the scholars cited in his comprehensive bibliography. See Eric Cochrane, review of Wootton's ''Paolo Sarpi: Between Renaissance and Enlightenment'' in ''The Journal of Modern History'': 57: 1 (March 1985): 151–53. Despite this, several scholars have accepted Wootton's theory, including A. P. Martinich, Richard Tuck, Paul A. Rahe, and Gianluca Mori. See Kainulainen, ''Paolo Sarpi: a Servant of God and State'' (Brill, 2014), p. 127.</ref> Jaska Kainulainen, on the other hand, asserts that the thesis that Sarpi was an atheist contradicts the historical record, pointing out that neither Sarpi's pronounced skepticism nor his pessimistic view of capabilities are incompatible with religious faith.<blockquote>Sarpi’s writings do not support the claim that he was an atheist In fact, from an atheistic point of view systematic skepticism can be seen as providing support of religious belief, because atheists’ position postulates certain knowledge of God’s inexistence. . . In his case the fundamental question was not the existence of God, but whether knowledge of God was obtainable by reason or by faith. His response was unequivocal: he was convinced that knowledge of divine matters was attained sola fide and he explicitly claimed that in religious matters one could not make judgments based on reason, but instead, they had to be based on affection or feeling<ref>Kainulainen, ''Paolo Sarpi: A Servant of God and State'', pp. 129-30.</ref></blockquote> Kainulainen identifies Sarpi as a [[Fideism| fideist]], [[Neostoicism|neo-Stoic]], and [[Christian mortalism| Christian mortalist]], who, although critical of the Church of Rome, admired the purity of the early church.

==Scientific scholar==
Sarpi wrote notes on [[François Viète]] which established his proficiency in [[mathematics]], and a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] treatise now lost, which is said to have anticipated the ideas of [[John Locke]]. His [[Anatomy|anatomical]] pursuits probably date from an earlier period. They illustrate his versatility and thirst for knowledge, but are otherwise not significant. His claim to have anticipated [[William Harvey]]'s discovery rests on no better authority than a memorandum, probably copied from [[Andreas Caesalpinus]] or Harvey himself, with whom, as well as with [[Francis Bacon]] and [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]], Sarpi corresponded. The only [[Physiology|physiological]] discovery which can be safely attributed to him is that of the contractility of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].

Sarpi wrote on [[projectile motion]] in the period 1578–84, in the tradition of [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]]; and then again in reporting on [[Guidobaldo del Monte]]'s ideas in 1592, possibly by then having met [[Galileo Galilei]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Jürgen Renn|title=Galileo in Context|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UR07AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA81|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00103-8|page=81}}</ref> Galileo corresponded with him. Sarpi heard of the [[telescope]] in November 1608, perhaps before Galileo. Details then came to Sarpi from [[Giacomo Badoer]] in Paris, in a letter describing the configuration of lenses.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert S. Westman|title=The Copernican Question: Prognostication, Skepticism, and Celestial Order|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iEueQqLQyiIC&pg=PA441|accessdate=25 July 2012|date=2 July 2011|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25481-7|page=441}}</ref> In 1609, the Venetian Republic had a telescope on approval for military purposes, but Sarpi had them turn it down, anticipating the better model Galileo had made and brought later that year.<ref>Michael Sharratt, ''Galileo: Decisive Innovator'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994 ISBN 0521566711), pp. 13–15.</ref>

== Further reading ==
Sarpi's life was first recounted in a laudatory memorial tribute by his secretary and successor, [[Fulgenzio Micanzio]] and much of our information about him comes from this. Several biographies dating from the nineteenth century include that by Arabella Georgina Campbell (1869), with references to manuscripts, [[Pietro Balan]]'s ''Fra Paolo Sarpi'' (Venice, 1887), and Alessandro Pascolato, ''Fra Paolo Sarpi'' (Milan, 1893). The late William James Bouwsma's  ''Venice and the Defense of Republican Liberty: Renaissance Values in the Age of the Counter-Reformation'' ([1968] Yale University Press; re-issued by the University of California Press, 1984) arose initially from Bouwsma's interest in Sarpi. Its central chapters concern Sarpi' life and works, including a lengthy analysis of the style and content of his ''History of the Council of Trent''. Bouwsma's final publication, ''The Waning of the Renaissance, 1550-1640'' (Yale University Press, 2002) also deals extensively with Sarpi.<ref>[http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/inmemoriam/williamjbouwsma.htm| ''In Memoriam: William J.

==History==

===1960s-1970s===
The two government channels, television being a government monopoly, during that period were [[Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi|ERT]] and YENED (for the military forces).<ref name="kathimerini" />

During the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74]], television was used also for propagandistic reasons, like everywhere else in the world even in democratic governments as is a powerful tool to guide the crowds wherever you want to. The programme was a mixture of news and entertainment. A notable serial which still owns the watching record was the war drama ''O Agnostos Polemos'' (The Unknown War).

After the collapse of the Greek Junta in 1974, [[Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi|ERT]] continue to dominate, appealing to a much larger audience than YENED. [[Color television]] broadcasts began in the late 1970s. Notable people were placed to improve the quality of the national channels, such as [[Dimitris Horn]], [[Manos Hatzidakis]] and the Nobel laureate poet [[Odysseas Elytis]].

===1980s===
In 1982, ERT and YENED merged, forming "[[Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi|ERT]]" (Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi), with ERT becoming "ERT1" and YENED becoming "ERT2". Broadcasts originally lasted for seven to eight hours daily starting at about 5:30PM with children shows and then the first televised news of the day. In 1987 an experimental [[teletext]] type information screen known as "Tilegrafos" (meaning televised words) showed written information on ET2 during the afternoon. By the late 1980s, television broadcasts on ET1 and ET2 (still commonly known as ERT-1 and ERT-2 until later years) had increased to 12–15 hours daily, though it was still common for one or both stations to sign off briefly in the afternoon and sign back on in the early evening hours.

Some illegal broadcasts made short-lived appearances during the 1980s showing mainly movies of adult nature but, in 1987, the City of Thessaloniki began rebroadcasting in a TV frequency parts of European satellite channels, leading to a dispute between the government and the city, as the stations' equipment was confiscated numerous times. The more serious challenge to ERT's TV monopoly, however, appeared with the establishment and operation of TV Plus in the Athens/Piraeus area, which begun broadcasting major US films to the starved-for-diversity Athens public. It is then that ERT decided to pre-empt the challenge to its TV monopoly and any further attempts to put private broadcasts on the air, by re-broadcasting itself foreign satellite channels. In October 1988, the first of these satellite channels made it to the airwaves in Athens to block the frequency used by TV Plus, and as this by-now very popular TV station kept changing its frequency, more and more satellite channels were added by ERT to block the frequencies used by TV Plus. They included: [[NBC Super Channel|Super Channel]] from Great Britain, [[TV5MONDE|TV5 Europe]] from France, [[Sat.1]] from Germany, [[Rai Due|RAIDUE]] from Italy, and Horizon (from the former Soviet Union). These stations were soon followed by [[MTV Europe]] and [[Sky]] from the United Kingdom, while the broadcasts of Super Channel was taken over by TV Plus, due to the lack of an actual agreement with ERT. Sky eventually morphed into what is now known as Eurosport, which is still rebroadcast in Greece, and [[Euronews]], [[Rai Uno|RAIUNO]] and [[Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation|Cyprus SAT]] were eventually added to the lineup. For a short time, [[NBC Super Channel]] was also rebroadcast, as were [[RTL Television|RTL Plus]] from Germany and [[3Sat]].

In 1988, ERT also established [[ET3 (Greece)|ET3]] a regional state-owned network which focused on issues of Northern Greece, to counter the Athens-centric broadcasts of the other two major state broadcasters at the time. Initially a regional network based in [[Thessaloniki]], ET3 also began broadcasting in Athens, and within a few years, in most other regions of the country.

Thessaloniki was the home of Greece's first non-state owned television station, TV100, owned by the City of Thessaloniki, and TV Plus was the first non-state television station in the Athens region. TV Plus, was owned by Invest Plus SA, a US group headed by Daniel Bourla, with the participation of the Municipality of Piraeus, and its programming was quite innovative for Greek standards at the time, as it broadcast first-run Hollywood feature films with subtitles and no commercials.  Soon, TV Plus began to offer an over-the-air subscription service, broadcasting an encoded signal 24-hours a day, which viewers could watch by obtaining a decoder (provided for free by the station) and paying a monthly subscription fee. This was especially revolutionary at the time, as a legal framework for private broadcasting, and private broadcasters, still did not exist in the country.

ERT did not take too kindly to the new television stations which began to crop up on the dial following the governments unsuccessful attempts to stop TV Plus, often changing the frequencies of its own stations around or adding repeaters, to interfere with new private broadcasts. However, in 1989, the Greek Parliament finally passed legislation legalizing private broadcasting (radio and television) and providing provisional licenses to two broadcasters, [[Mega Channel]] and Nea Tileorasi (New Television). Mega Channel began officially broadcasting in November 1989 as a national network, while Nea Tileorasi, after several months of broadcasting test bars, disappeared from the airwaves.

Other private broadcasters took advantage of loopholes in the existing legislation and the lack of an organized licensing process to begin broadcasting almost overnight. In December 1989, [[ANT1|Antenna TV]] began broadcasting nationally, named after the successful new radio station by the same name. Mega and Antenna featured similar programming styles, with locally produced comedies and dramas, numerous variety shows (following in the Italian tradition), American films, and tabloid news broadcasts. They immediately won over most of ERT's audience and advertising share, and to this day, are interchangeably the #1 and #2 stations in the audience ratings in Greece, while the ratings of ET1, ET2, and ET3 plummeted (they have recovered significantly since then but still do not challenge the major private networks).

===1990s===
By early 1990, numerous other stations also appeared on the air, including ''New Channel'' (no relation to Nea Tileorasi) with movies, music videos and talk shows, ''Channel Seven-X'' (with avant-garde programming including foreign films, intellectual programming and a simulcast of French music network [[MCM (TV channel)|MCM]]), ''Jeronimo Groovy TV'' (initially a popular music video station that broadcast in Athens, amidst serious interference from other stations), ''TeleCity'' (a right-wing political television station with news and talk shows), [[902 TV]] (owned by the [[Communist Party of Greece]]), ''Kanali 29'' (a television station with political and cultural programs and a cult following), and a plethora of other broadcasters, which filled every available VHF and UHF frequency, often broadcasting only for several weeks or months, or with very little programming of note. Many broadcasters even began to broadcast on the same frequencies as other stations, especially ERT's satellite broadcasts, many of which soon completely disappeared from the airwaves, as ERT seemed unwilling or unable to protect its frequencies. Similarly, private stations sprung up throughout the country, in every city and region and most towns.

The [[color]] [[television]] transmission system [[SECAM]] which had been used since the late 1970s finally switched over to the [[PAL]] color system widely used in the rest of Europe. [[PAL]] was the system used for years in Greece via video tape playbacks on rented movies from video stores but not by ERT. The first TV station to broadcast in [[PAL]] was TV Plus, then by the other private TV stations that followed it and eventually by ERT.

In 1993, two new major players entered the market. [[Skai TV]] began broadcasting, after a prolonged battle for open frequencies with ERT and other stations, and soon began to broadcast as a new national network following in the footsteps of the highly rated [[Skai 100.3|Skai radio]] station in Athens. Also in 1993, Kanali 29's management was handed over to Niko Mastorakis, who was once again involved in Greek media after a long stint as a movie producer and director in the United States. Kanali 29 was renamed [[Star Channel]], and featured programming rich in American films and TV series, and talk and lifestyle programmes. Star also began to broadcast nationally.

The following year, ERT decommissioned many of its terrestrial satellite broadcasts, and reassigned many of those now-vacant frequencies to Multichoice Hellas, for terrestrial pay-television services a year after TV Plus went off the air following a dispute with [[Time Warner]] that had acquired a 25% interest in the company. The name of this new pay-TV service was [[Nova Cinema (Greece)|Filmnet]]. In 1995, Multichoice followed with another station, [[Nova Sports|Supersport]], which soon earned the broadcast rights to many Greek sports.

In 1997, ERT, whose audience had never recovered from the advent of private television, and which up until then lagged behind technologically compared to the largest private networks, revamped its operations, unveiling new logos and a new programming philosophy. The stations were modernized, and ET2 was renamed "NET" (Nea Elliniki Tileorassi). ET1 focused on general-interest programming (movies, sports, various TV series), while NET focused heavily on news and talk programming. ET3 continued to focus largely on Northern Greece, with a large dose of cultural programming.

By the late 1990s, Greece began to see its first major mergers and acquisitions (some of them ill-fated) in the realm of broadcast media. Skai TV was sold, and soon became known as "Alpha-Sky" before completely phasing into its new name as [[Alpha TV]]. Kanali 5, a regional television network broadcasting out of Athens, by the former owners of Kanali 29 (and with similar programming to that station), was also revamped, transitioning to "Alter 5" (with a program aimed largely at teenagers and young adults) before fully renaming itself to [[Alter Channel|Alter]]. Its broadcast reach also gradually expanded, and the station now covers almost the entire country. Channel Seven-X, facing financial difficulties, was also sold, and was renamed ''Seven'', featuring programming heavy on sports and news/talk programs. Seven never quite achieved the success of some of the other stations, as it continued to face financial difficulties even after the sale, and never was able to broadcast outside of certain large cities in the country. New Channel, which broadcast in many major cities but did not offer much original programming, was sold to a new investor and renamed "New Tempo" and finally "Tempo TV", building up a national network of repeaters in an effort to become a major player in the television market, which it partially succeeded in, before financial troubles led to its failure in 2001. Finally, [[Macedonia TV]], a regional private network broadcasting out of Thessaloniki, was purchased by the Antenna TV group, and has served as a secondary network featuring many old programs from Antenna TV, American TV series, and a newscast focusing on Northern Greece. The station now also broadcasts nationally.

Specialty networks had also begun to form. In 1992, TVC, Greece's first 24/24h music channel, began operating in Lesvos island. The channel during the 00's reformed into the pan-European [[Music Force Europe]], today available in 3 countries. Then, in 1996, [[MAD TV (Greece)|Mad TV]] began operating out of Athens, replacing a small local channel known as ''Art 68''. Mad TV featured programming heavy on hit music videos, similar to [[MTV]] and its Greek predecessor Jeronimo Groovy TV (which continued to exist but with a small coverage area and with programming more heavily dependent on talk); both channels, in opposition to TVC, operated in a few-hour rotation. Mad TV did not build a national network of its own, but instead was rebroadcast through local stations throughout the country. [[TV 0-6]] began broadcasting in Athens, with many cartoons and children's shows, while TV Magic, after an ill-fated attempt to become a news-talk station owned by [[Socrates Kokkalis]], became a station focusing on sports and particularly of Greek sports club [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], which Kokkalis also owned. Extra Channel was founded in 2000 with a heavy talk focus, and is now known as Extra 3.

In 1999, Multichoice Hellas also formed [[NOVA Greece|Nova]], Greece's first satellite television subscription service, which initially featured most (but not all) of Greece's major networks, as well as many international networks, and other music and interactive services, which it has continued to expand since then. Nova was to be followed by a competing satellite platform, known as "Magna", by the owners of ''Seven'', which never began operations.

===2000s===
In 2000, Alpha TV founded ''Alpha Digital'', which broadcast Alpha TV, Polis TV (a local station serving Athens owned by Alpha) various thematic stations also operated by Alpha, the radio stations owned by the Alpha group, and a small variety of foreign television networks, headlined by MTV and VH1 (MTV, by that time, was no longer rebroadcast terrestrially in Greece, that ceased in 1999). Despite the popularity of MTV and VH1 and Alpha earning the rights to Greek soccer matches, the company soon went under, leaving Nova as the only company providing pay-TV services in Greece to this day. Plans for a satellite bouquet managed by OTE (the Greek telecommunications company) never went past the test phase, with OTE leasing frequencies on the [[Hotbird]] satellite, rebroadcasting several smaller Greek TV stations as well as many radio stations free-to-air.

The past few years have seen the failure of many television ventures, but the creation and investment in many new ones. Polis TV was relaunched as ''Channel 9'' in December 2005, with programming heavy on news and talk shows. More recently, the original owners of [[Skai TV]] returned to the television business, relaunching Skai on the frequencies of '''Seven''' TV. Other notable stations that have begun operating in recent years include ''Channel 10'', while TeleCity was renamed Tileasty. Other stations have upgraded and modernized, however, the Greek airwaves are still cluttered with many unlicensed television stations, often broadcasting programs of a low quality (telemarketing, low budget movies, music videos, illegal telephone hotlines, soft pornography).

To this day, the Greek government still has not issued official licenses to most television stations in Greece, which are currently broadcasting in a quasi-legal state. Tenders have been offered for national, regional and local broadcasts as well as terrestrial pay-TV services, which have either been frozen or have failed completely. Despite numerous government pledges, there has not been much movement on this issue in recent years. In the meantime, the airwaves are still cluttered, though things are significantly more organized than they were in the early 1990s. Despite the success of Nova, and the launch of [[Hellas SAT]], cable TV has been slow to follow, only existing on a local level in some communities around Greece until recently, when companies such as OnTelecoms have launched cable (IPTV) platforms.

Today, Greece has four national state-owned networks, three state-owned national digital television networks, a state-owned satellite broadcast network, and several national private television networks, in addition to approximately 150 local and regional television stations broadcasting across the country. Audience ratings are handled by AGB Hellas.

===2010s===
On June 11, 2013 the Greek Government suspended the operation of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) and automatically fired 2,600 workers, in one of numerous spending cuts that have been implemented during Greece's ongoing debt crisis. The plug was pulled at 23:10 during the news.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22861577</ref>

==Digital Terrestrial Television==
In 2005, Alpha TV briefly ran experimental broadcasts in DVB-T locally in Athens, while in [[Heraklion]], [[Crete]], a regional network, [[Kriti TV]], in conjunction with the [[University of Crete]], also started digital operation.

In January 2006, the State broadcaster [[Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi|ERT]] launched free-to-air [[Digital Terrestrial Television]] ([[DVB-T]]) with three "pilot" channels called [[Prisma+]], [[Cine+ (Greece)|Cine+]] and [[Sport+ (Greece)|Sport+]], collectively branded as [[ERT Digital]].  The first channel, Prisma+, was targeted at disabled persons, while Cine+ broadcasts movies, and Sport+ broadcasts a sports program. A fourth channel, the [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] national channel's satellite program [[RIK sat]], was also retransmitted on digital.

From September 2009 onwards, the seven major television stations in Greece broadcast in [[DVB-T]] [[MPEG-4]], via a company set up by them, [[DIGEA]].  Because of the concentration of the population in a few cities, about 75% of the Greeks are now able to view DTT, although only a small proportion of the geographical area of Greece is covered. Areas covered (as at August 2011) include Attica, Thessalonica, Larissa, Alexandropolis, the Corinthian Gulf, and Rhodes Town.

East Attica (Mati, Nea Makri, Marathonas and Grammatiko) is not covered yet because the signal in this area is shadowed by mountains.

A set-top box or a digital-ready TV is required to view digital channels.

==Cable TV==
First CABLE TV operator in Greece, is located at [[Kalamaria]] ([[Thessaloniki]]). Hellenic Cable Networks (www.hcn.gr) among cable internet services offers DVB-C and analog TV services without the need of an external STB.

==IPTV==
Since 2006 two companies offer television service via [[IPTV]], they are [[Vivodi Telecom]] and [[On Telecoms]].

They currently offer television service bundled with High-speed Internet & Telephony services. Their channel offerings include local Greek networks, international stations and pay-TV networks [[Nova Cinema (Greece)|Nova Cinema]] & [[Nova Sports]], that are made available to subscribers via an agreement with Greek DTH provider [[NOVA Greece|NOVA]].

In 2009, Greek Telecommunications giant [[OTE]] launched IPTV service called ''[[Conn-x TV]]'' which will initially be available in Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras, Larisa & Iraklion. [http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2009/02/10/ote-launches-iptv-service/]. Greek broadband provider [[Hellas On-Line]] also launched an IPTV platform called ''hol tv''. [http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2009/03/10/hellas-launches-iptv-platform/] Hol TV offers all major Greek networks as well as news, sports, music and children's channels. It is also the first provider in Greece to offer [[High-definition television|HDTV]] as well as Video on demand.

{{Criminal law}}

'''Battery''' is a criminal [[Offence (law)|offense]] involving unlawful physical contact, distinct from [[assault]] which is the act of creating apprehension of such contact.

In the [[United States]], '''criminal battery''', or simply '''battery''', is the use of force against another, resulting in harmful, offensive or sexual contact.<ref>[[Black's Law Dictionary]] Garner, p. 162</ref> It is a specific [[common law]] [[misdemeanor]], although the term is used more generally to refer to any unlawful offensive physical contact with another person, and may be a [[misdemeanor]] or a [[felony]], depending on the circumstances. Battery was defined at [[common law]] as "any unlawful touching of the person of another by the aggressor himself, or by a substance put in motion by him."<ref name=Clark>{{Citation
 | title = Elementary Law
 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=ZmoaAAAAYAAJ
 | year = 1909
 | last1 = Clark	 | first1 =  William Lawrence
 | last2 =  Association	 | first2 =  American Bar
 | accessdate = 2009-08-01
|pages=117–18	}}</ref> In most cases, battery is now governed by [[statute]]s, and its severity is determined by the law of the specific jurisdiction.

==Generally==
Specific rules regarding battery vary among different jurisdictions, but some elements remain constant across jurisdictions. Battery generally requires that:

#an offensive touch or contact is made upon the victim, instigated by the actor; and
#the actor intends or knows that their action will cause the offensive touching.

Under the [[Model Penal Code]] and in some jurisdictions, there is battery when the actor acts recklessly without specific intent of causing an offensive contact. Battery is typically classified as either simple or aggravated. Although battery typically occurs in the context of physical altercations, it may also occur under other circumstances, such as in medical cases where a doctor performs a non-consented medical procedure.

==Specific countries==
===Russia===

There is an offence which could be (loosely) described as battery in [[Russia]]. Article 116 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consultant.ru/popular/ukrf/10_24.html#p1236 |title=???????????? ?????? ????? ? ???????? - ????????? ?????? ?? (?? ??) ?? 13.06.1996 N 63-?? \ ??????????? ???? |publisher=Consultant.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref> of the [[Russian Criminal Code]] provides that battery or similar violent actions which cause pain are an offence.

===United States===

At [[common law]], simple battery is a [[misdemeanor]]. The [[prosecutor]] must prove all three elements beyond a reasonable doubt:

# an unlawful application of force
# to the person of another
# resulting in either bodily injury or an offensive touching.

The common-law elements serve as a basic template; but individual jurisdictions may alter them, and they may vary slightly from state to state.

Under modern statutory schemes, battery is often divided into grades that determine the severity of punishment. For example:

*'''Simple battery''' may include ''any'' form of non-consensual harmful or insulting contact, regardless of the injury caused.  Criminal battery requires ''intent'' to inflict an injury on another.
*'''[[Sex]]ual battery''' may be defined as non-consensual touching of the intimate parts of another. At least in Florida, "Sexual battery means oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another or the anal or vaginal penetration of another by any other object": See section 794.011.<ref>http://offender.fdle.state.fl.us/offender/QualifyingOffenses.jsp#1130</ref>
*'''Family-violence battery''' may be limited in its scope between persons within a certain degree of relationship: statutes for this offense have been enacted in response to increasing awareness of the problem of [[domestic violence]].
*'''Aggravated battery''' generally is seen as a serious offense of [[felony]] grade, involving the loss of the victim's limb or some other type of permanent disfigurement. As successor to the common-law crime of [[Mayhem (crime)|mayhem]], this is sometimes subsumed in the definition of [[aggravated assault]]. In Florida, Aggravated Battery is the ''intentional'' commission of great bodily harm. <ref>{{cite web|title=Florida Statute on Aggravated Battery|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0700-0799/0784/Sections/0784.045.html|publisher=Florida Legislation}}</ref> Conversely, if there is no ''intent'' in Florida, then it is felony battery which is a third degree felony as opposed to a second degree felony in which aggravated battery is.

====Kansas====

In the state of [[Kansas]] battery is defined as follows:<ref>http://kansasstatutes.lesterama.org/Chapter_21/Article_34/#21-3412</ref>

:Battery. 
:(a) Battery is:
:(1)   Intentionally or recklessly causing bodily harm to another person; or
:(2)   intentionally causing physical contact with another person when done in a rude, insulting or angry manner.

====Louisiana====

The law on battery in [[Louisiana]] reads:<ref>http://legis.la.gov/lss/lss.asp?doc=78437</ref>

:§33.  Battery defined
:Battery is the intentional use of force or violence upon the person of another; or the intentional administration of a poison or other noxious liquid or substance to another.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
Battery is an offence under the law of [[England and Wales]].

Battery involves unlawfully touching another person (this does not include everyday knocks and jolts to which people silently consent as the result of crowds). No physical injury is necessary.  Battery is distinguished from the offence of [[common assault]], where the victim is caused to ''apprehend'' the immediate commission of a battery.

The terms "battery" and "beat" are not normally used (if at all) in statutory provisions creating offences of aggravated assault. A former exception to this was section 43 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (aggravated assault or battery on a female or a boy under 14). The term "[[assault]]" in such provisions generally includes battery.

There is no offence called "sexual battery", but the offence of [[sexual assault#England and Wales|sexual assault]] involves the non-consensual sexual touching of another.<ref>The [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]], section 3</ref>

There is no separate offence relating to incidents of domestic violence, except in the case of death, where the offence of causing or allowing the death of a child or a vulnerable adult may have been committed ([http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=domestic+violence&Year=2004&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=975296&ActiveTextDocId=975306&filesize=6062 s. 5 Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004]).

Under English law, a battery has only been committed if the correct ''mens rea'' (fault element) can be proven. In the case of battery, the ''mens rea'' of the offence is intention or recklessness (see ''R v. Venna'' [1976] QB 421). A person acts intentionally in terms of a result when his purpose is to cause it and he may be held to act intentionally if he foresees that the result is a ''virtually certain'' consequence of his action and he nonetheless acts (see ''R v. Woollin'' [1998] 4 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 103; although this decision specifically applies to the law of murder, it is generally accepted that this definition of intent applies throughout the criminal law). A person acts recklessly in terms of a result when he is ''aware'' of the risk that the result will occur if he acts and he does so act where no reasonable person would (see ''R v. Cunningham [1957] 2 QB 396'').

=====Whether it is a statutory offence=====

In DPP v. Taylor, DPP v. Little [1992] 1 QB 645, 95 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 28, it was held that battery is a statutory offence, contrary to [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=2116678 section 39] of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]]. This decision was criticised<ref>[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1993 supplements and 1994 and 1996 editions</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first2=John Cyril |last2=Hogan |first2=Brian |title=Criminal Law |location=London |publisher=Butterworths |edition=9th |page=402 |isbn=0-406-98383-6 |year=1999 }}</ref><ref>Smith, J. C. [1991] [[Criminal Law Review|Crim LR]] 900</ref> and in Haystead v. DPP 164 JP 396, DC,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2000/181.html |title=Haystead v Chief Constable of Derbyshire [2000&#93; EWHC QB 181 (12 May 2000) |publisher=Bailii.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref> the Divisional court expressed the ''[[obiter]]'' opinion that battery remains a common law offence.

Therefore, whilst it may be a better view that battery and assault have statutory penalties, rather than being statutory offences, it is still the case that until review by a higher court, DPP v Little is the preferred authority.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith & Hogan|title=Criminal Law|year=2008|publisher=OUP|page=584}}</ref>

=====Mode of trial and sentence=====

In [[England and Wales]], it is a [[summary offence]].<ref name="ReferenceA">The [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]], section 39</ref> However, where section 40 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]] applies, it can be an additional charge on an [[indictment]]. It is usually tried summarily.{{Quantify|date=February 2009}}

However if it is tried, it is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding [[Standard scale#United Kingdom|level 5]] on the [[standard scale]], or both.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

See [http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/common_assult/ Crown Prosecution Service Sentencing Manual] for case law on sentencing (despite the title of the page, the guidance applies to battery as well as common assault). Relevant cases are:
*R v. [[Nottingham Crown Court]] ex parte Director of Public Prosections [1996] 1 [[Criminal Appeal Reports (Sentencing)|Cr App R (S)]] 283
*R v. Dunn [2003] 2 Cr App R (S) 90

====Scotland====

There is no distinct offence of battery in [[Scotland]]. The offence of [[Assault#Scotland|assault]] includes acts that could be described as battery.

====Jurisdictional differences====

In some jurisdictions, battery has recently been constructed to include directing bodily secretions (i.e., spitting) at another person without his or her permission. Some of those jurisdictions automatically elevate such a battery to the charge of aggravated battery. In some jurisdictions, the charge of criminal battery also requires evidence of a mental state (''[[mens rea]]''). The terminology used to refer to a particular offense can also vary by jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions, such as New York, refer to what, under the common law, would be battery as assault, and then use another term for the crime that would have been assault, such as menacing.

====Distinction between battery and assault====

The [[Actus reus|overt behavior]] of an [[assault]] might be Person A advancing upon Person B by chasing after him and swinging a fist toward his head. The overt behavior of battery might be A actually striking B.

Battery requires (1) a volitional act that (2) results in a harmful or offensive contact with another person and (3) is committed for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact or under circumstances that render such contact substantially certain to occur or with a reckless disregard as to whether such contact will result. Assault is an attempted battery or the act of intentionally placing a person in apprehension of a harmful or offensive contact with his or her person.

In some places, assault is the threat of violence against another while aggravated assault is the threat with the clear and present ability and willingness to carry it out. Likewise, battery is undesired touching of another, while aggravated battery is touching of another with or without a tool or weapon with attempt to harm or restrain.

The '''Union des forces progressistes''' (UFP) was a [[left-wing politics|left- wing]] political party in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] from 2002-2006. Four parties merged to form the UFP in 2002 out of desire to unite Quebec's political left:
* the [[Rassemblement pour l'alternative progressiste]] (RAP),
* the [[Parti de la Democratie Socialiste|Parti de la démocratie socialiste]] (PDS), formerly the [[New Democratic Party of Quebec]]
* the [[Communist Party of Quebec|Parti communiste du Québec]] (PCQ), and
* the Quebec-based membership of the [[International Socialists (Canada)|International Socialists]].

On 4 February 2006, UFP merged with [[Option citoyenne]] to form the new political party [[Québec solidaire]].

The aim of the UFP was to bring together [[progressivism|progressive]] forces across the broad left wing of the political spectrum, including [[social democracy|social democrats]], [[socialism|socialists]] and [[communism|communists]]. The UFP also advocated [[Alter-globalization|altermondialism]], [[feminism]], [[pacifism]] and [[green politics]].  Its platform did not specifically endorse social democracy, socialism or communism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The [[Green Party of Quebec]] pledged to try to avoid running candidates in ridings where there was a UFP candidate, although it reserved the right to run anywhere it wants to (even ridings with a UFP candidate), and did not merge with the UFP.

The UFP presented itself as an alternative to the main three parties in Quebec: the centre-left [[Parti Québécois]], the centre-right [[Quebec Liberal Party]], and the conservative [[Action démocratique du Québec]]/Equipe [[Mario Dumont]], saying that all three are but different faces of the same [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] ideology called [[neoliberalism]].

The UFP opposed [[globalization]], [[privatization]], and [[deregulation]], and called for increased funding of social services, higher taxes on the rich and business, [[proportional representation]] in the [[National Assembly of Quebec]], and an alternative economy based upon [[Cooperative|co-operatives]] and [[nonprofit organization]]s.

The UFP supported Quebec sovereignty. It considered this option not as an end in itself, but rather as a means to achieve the party's social ideal for the people of Quebec. To solve the national question, the UFP suggested the creation of a [[Constituent Assembly]], mandated to draw up and propose to the population, via referendum, a Constitution for a progressive, republican, [[secularism|secular]] and democratic Québec.

The UFP was led by a council instead of a single leader. The UFP promised to be a party of the ballot box and of the streets, meaning that it would work to increase awareness of social problems and for progressive social change even between elections, particularly with regards to the rights of workers and of the unemployed.

Considering its modest results in the 2003 elections (1.06% of the votes or 1.50% if the Green Party of Quebec's votes were included), the UFP was a marginal party.

On 5 November 2005, delegates of the UFP voted unanimously in favour of a merger with the party of the Option citoyenne movement led by [[Françoise David]]. The founding congress of the new party was held on 4 February 2006 and resulted in the formation of a new party, [[Québec solidaire]].

==UFP position on the national question==
From the Preamble of the UFP political platform, ''Building a world that reflects our ideals!'' [http://www.ufp.qc.ca/article1339.html]:

:''UFP members share the view that the answer to the national question, and by extension social emancipation, is sovereignty for the Quebec people. The UFP believes that Quebec should become a country, free from the federalist yoke, and should acquire the essential tools it needs to develop as a nation.''

'''François Viète''' (Latin: '''Franciscus Vieta'''; 1540 – 23 February 1603), [[Fiefdom|Seigneur]] de la Bigotière, was a [[French people|French]] [[mathematician]] whose work on [[new algebra]] was an important step towards modern algebra, due to its innovative use of letters as parameters in equations. He was a lawyer by trade, and served as a [[Conseil du Roi|privy councillor]] to both [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] and [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]].

== Biography ==

=== Origins ===
Viete was born at [[Fontenay-le-Comte]], [[Vendée]].  His grandfather was a merchant from [[La Rochelle]]. His father, Etienne Viète, was an attorney in Fontenay-le-Comte and a notary in [[Le Busseau]]. His mother was the aunt of [[Barnabé Brisson]], a [[magistrate]] and the first president of parliament during the ascendancy of the [[Ligue|Catholic League of France.]]

Vieta went to a [[Franciscan]] school and in 1558 studied law at [[Poitiers]], graduating as a Bachelor of Law in 1559. A year later, he began his career as an attorney in his native town. From the outset, he was entrusted with some major cases, including the settlement of rent in Poitou for the widow of [[King Francis I of France]] and looking after the interests of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].

=== Serving Parthenay ===
In 1564, Vieta entered the service of Antoinette d’Aubeterre, Lady Soubise, wife of Jean V de Parthenay-Soubise, one of the main [[Huguenot]] military leaders and accompanied him to [[Lyon]] to collect documents about his heroic defence of that city against the troops of [[Duke of Nemours|Jacques of Savoy, 2nd Duke of Nemours]] just the year before.

The same year, at Parc-Soubise, in the commune of [[Mouchamps]], [[Vendée]], Vieta became the tutor of Catherine de Parthenay, Soubise's twelve-year-old daughter. He taught her science and mathematics and wrote for her numerous treatise on astronomy, geography and trigonometry, some of which have survived. In these treatise, Vieta used decimal numbers (twenty years before [[Simon Stevin|Stevin]]'s paper) and he also noted the elliptic orbit of the planets,<ref>{{citation|title=The Cosmos of Science: Essays of Exploration|series=Pittsburgh-Konstanz series in the philosophy and history of science|editor1-first=John|editor1-last=Earman|editor2-first=John D.|editor2-last=Norton|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1998|isbn=9780822972013|contribution=What's new in Kepler's new astronomy?|first=Bernard R.|last=Goldstein|pages=3–23}}. See in particular [http://books.google.com/books?id=_HgF3wfADJIC&pg=PA21 p.&nbsp;21]: "an unpublished manuscript by Viète includes a mathematical discussion of an ellipse in a planetary model".</ref> forty years before [[Kepler]] and twenty years before [[Giordano Bruno]]'s death.

John V de Parthenay presented him to King [[Charles IX of France]]. Vieta wrote a genealogy of the [[Parthenay]] family and following the death of Jean V de Parthenay-Soubise in 1566, his biography.

In 1568, Antoinette, Lady Soubise, married her daughter Catherine to Baron Charles de Quellenec and Vieta went with Lady Soubise to La Rochelle, where he mixed with the highest Calvinist aristocracy, leaders like [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Coligny]] and [[Henri I de Bourbon, prince de Condé|Condé]] and [[Queen Jeanne d’Albret of Navarre]] and her son, Henry of Navarre, the future [[Henry IV of France]].

In 1570, he refused to represent the Soubise ladies in their infamous lawsuit against the Baron De Quellenec, where they claimed the Baron was unable (or unwilling) to provide an heir.

=== First steps in Paris ===
In 1571, he enrolled as an attorney in Paris, and continued to visit his student Catherine. He regularly lived in Fontenay-le-Comte, where he took on some municipal functions. He began publishing his ''Universalium inspectionum ad canonem mathematicum liber singularis'' and wrote new mathematical research by night or during periods of leisure. He was known to dwell on any one question for up to three days, his elbow on the desk, feeding himself without changing position (according to his friend, [[Jacques de Thou]]).<ref>Kinser, Sam. The works of Jacques-Auguste de Thou. [http://books.google.com/books?id=CKt1buiVRVIC&pg=PA191 Google Books]</ref>

In 1572, Vieta was in Paris during the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]]. That night, Baron De Quellenec was killed after having tried to save [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Admiral Coligny]] the previous night. The same year, Vieta met Françoise de Rohan, Lady of Garnache, and became her adviser against [[Jacques of Savoy, 2nd Duke of Nemours|Jacques, Duke of Nemours]].

In 1573, he became a councillor of the [[Parliament of Brittany]], at [[Rennes]], and two years later, he obtained the agreement of Antoinette d'Aubeterre for the marriage of Catherine of Parthenay to Duke René de Rohan, Françoise's brother.

In 1576, [[Henri, duc de Rohan]] took him under his special protection, recommending him in 1580 as "[[maître des requêtes]]". In 1579, Vieta printed his ''canonem mathematicum'' (Metayer publisher). A year later, he was appointed maître des requêtes to the parliament of Paris, committed to serving the king. That same year, his success in the trial between the Duke of Nemours and Françoise de Rohan, to the benefit of the latter, earned him the resentment of the tenacious Catholic League.

=== Exile in Fontenay ===
Between 1583 and 1585, the League persuaded Henry III to release Vieta, Vieta having been accused of sympathy with the Protestant cause. [[Henry IV of France|Henry of Navarre]], at Rohan's instigation, addressed two letters to King [[Henry III of France]] on March 3 and April 26, 1585, in an attempt to obtain Vieta's restoration to his former office; he failed.

Vieta retired to Fontenay and Beauvoir-sur-Mer, with François de Rohan. He spent four years devoted to mathematics, writing his "Analytical Art" or [[New Algebra]].

=== Code-breaker to two kings ===
In 1589, Henry III took refuge in Blois. He commanded the royal officials to be at Tours before 15 April 1589. Vieta was one of the first who came back to Tours. He deciphered the secret letters of the Catholic League and other enemies of the king. Later, he had arguments with the classical scholar [[Joseph Juste Scaliger]]. Vieta triumphed against him in 1590.

After the death of Henry III, Vieta became a Privy Councillor to Henry of Navarre, now Henry IV. He was appreciated by the king, who admired his mathematical talents. Vieta was given the position of councillor of the ''parlement'' at [[Tours]]. In 1590, Vieta discovered the key to a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[cipher]], consisting of more than 500 characters, and this meant that all dispatches in that language which fell into the hands of the French could be easily read.

Henry IV published a letter from Commander Moreo to the king of Spain. The contents of this letter, read by Vieta, revealed that the head of the League in France, the Duke of Mayenne, planned to become king in place of Henry IV. This publication led to the settlement of the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. The king of Spain accused Vieta of having used magical powers.
In 1593, Vieta published his arguments against Scaliger. Beginning in 1594, he was appointed exclusively deciphering the enemy's secret codes.

=== Gregorian calendar ===
In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII published his bull ''[[Inter gravissimas]]'' and ordered the Catholic kings to comply with the change from the Julian calendar, based on the calculations of the Calabrian doctor [[Aloysius Lilius]] or Giglio. His work was resumed, after his death, by the scientific adviser to the Pope, [[Christopher Clavius]].

Vieta accused Clavius, in a series of pamphlets (1600), of introducing corrections and intermediate days in an arbitrary manner, and misunderstanding the meaning of the works of his predecessor, particularly in the calculation of the lunar cycle. Vieta gave a new timetable, which Clavius cleverly refuted,<ref>Clavius, Christophorus. 0perum mathematicorum tomus quintus continens Romani Christophorus Clavius, published by Anton Hierat, Johann Volmar, place Royale Paris, in 1612</ref> after Vieta's death, in his ''Explicatio'' (1603).

It is said that Vieta was wrong. Without doubt, he believed himself to be a kind of "King of Times" as the historian of mathematics, Dhombres, claimed.<ref>Otte, Michael; Panza, Marco. Analysis and synthesis in mathematics. [http://books.google.com/books?id=eydlDs-AX54C&pg=PA147&dq=Dhombres+viete&as_brr=3&hl=fr Google Books]</ref> It is true that Vieta held Clavius in low esteem, as evidenced by De Thou:

{{bquote|He said that Clavius was very clever to explain the principles of mathematics, that he heard with great clarity what the authors had invented, and wrote various treatises compiling what had been written before him without quoting its references. So, his works were in a better order which was scattered and confused in early writings...}}

=== The Adriaan van Roomen affair ===
In 1594, Scaliger resumed his attacks from the University of Leyden. Vieta replied definitively the following year. In March that same year, [[Adriaan van Roomen]] sought the resolution, by any of Europe's top mathematicians, to a polynomial equation of degree 45. King Henri IV received a snub from the Dutch ambassador, who claimed that there was no mathematician in France. He said it was simply because some Dutch mathematician, Adriaan van Roomen, had not asked any Frenchman to solve his problem.

Vieta came, saw the problem, and, after leaning on a window for a few minutes, solved it. It was the equation between [[Sine|sin]](x) and sin(x/45). He resolved this at once, and said he was able to give at the same time (actually the next day) the solution to the other 22 problems to the ambassador. "Ut legit, ut solvit," he later said. Further, he sent a new problem back to Van Roomen, for resolution by [[Euclidean tools]] (rule and compass) of the lost answer to the problem first set by [[Apollonius of Perga]]. Van Roomen could not overcome that problem without resorting to a trick (see detail below).

===Final years===
In 1598, Vieta was granted special leave. Henry IV, however, charged him to end the revolt of the Notaries, whom the King had ordered to pay back their fees. Sick and exhausted by work, he left the King's service in December 1602 and received 20,000 [[écu]], which were found at his bedside after his death.

A few weeks before his death, he wrote a final thesis on issues of cryptography, whose memory made obsolete all encryption methods of the time.
He died on 23 February 1603, as De Thou wrote,<ref>[http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Viete_De_Thou.html De thou (from University of Saint Andrews)]</ref> leaving two daughters, Jeanne, born from Barbe Cottereau, and Suzanne, born from Julienne Leclerc. Jeanne, the eldest, died in 1628, having married Jean Gabriau, a councillor of the parliament of Brittany. Suzanne died in January 1618 in Paris. 
The cause of Vieta's death is unknown. [[Alexander Anderson (mathematician)|Alexander Anderson]], student of Vieta and publisher of his scientific writings, speaks of a "praeceps et immaturum autoris fatum."<ref>Ball, Walter William Rouse. A short account of the history of mathematics.

== Work and thought ==

=== A new algebra ===
{{Main|New algebra}}
At the end of 16th century, mathematics was placed under the dual aegis of the Greeks, from whom they borrowed the tools of geometry, and the Arabs, who provided procedures for the resolution. At the time of Vieta, algebra therefore oscillated between arithmetic, which gave the appearance of a list of rules, and geometry which seemed more rigorous. Meanwhile, Italian mathematicians Luca Pacioli, Scipione del Ferro, Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia, Ludovico Ferrari, and especially Raphael Bombelli (1560) all developed techniques for solving equations of the third degree, which heralded a new era.

On the other hand, the German school of the Coss, the Welsh mathematician [[Robert Recorde]] (1550) and the Dutchman [[Simon Stevin]] (1581) brought an early algebraic notation, the use of decimals and exponents. However, complex numbers remained at best a philosophical way of thinking and [[Descartes]], almost a century after their invention, used them as imaginary numbers. Only positive solutions were considered and using geometrical proof was common.

The task of the mathematicians was in fact twofold. It was necessary to produce algebra in a more geometrical way, i.e., to give it a rigorous foundation; and on the other hand, it was necessary to give geometry a more algebraic sense, allowing the analytical calculation in the plane. Vieta and Descartes solved this dual task in a double revolution. Firstly, Vieta gave algebra a foundation as strong as in geometry. He then ended the algebra of procedures (al-Jabr and Muqabala), creating the first symbolic algebra. In doing so, he did not hesitate to say that with this new algebra, all problems could be solved (''nullum non problema solvere'').<ref name="Bos">H. J. M.

In his dedication of the ''Isagoge'' to Catherine de Parthenay, Vieta wrote, "These things which are new are wont in the beginning to be set forth rudely and formlessly and must then be polished and perfected in succeeding centuries. Behold, the art which I present is new, but in truth so old, so spoiled and defiled by the ''barbarians,'' that I considered it necessary, in order to introduce an entirely new form into it, to think out and publish a new vocabulary, having gotten rid of all its pseudo-technical terms…"<ref>{{Citation |last=Hadden |first=Richard W. |title=On the Shoulders of Merchants: Exchange and the Mathematical Conception of Nature in Early Modern Europe |location=New York |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1994 |isbn=0-585-04483-X }}.</ref>

Vieta did not know "multiplied" notation (given by [[William Oughtred]] in 1631) or the symbol of equality, =, an absence which is more striking because [[Robert Recorde]] had used the present symbol for this purpose since 1557 and [[Guilielmus Xylander]] had used parallel vertical lines since 1575.

Vieta had neither much time, nor students able to brilliantly illustrate his method. He took years in publishing his work, (he was very meticulous) and most importantly, he made a very specific choice to separate the unknown variables, using consonants for parameters and vowels for unknowns. In this notation he perhaps followed some older contemporaries, such as [[Petrus Ramus]], who designated the points in geometrical figures by vowels, making use of consonants, R, S, T, etc., only when these were exhausted. This choice proved disastrous for readability and Descartes, in preferring the first letters to designate the parameters, the latter for the unknowns, showed a greater knowledge of the human heart.

Vieta also remained a prisoner of his time in several respects: First, he was heir of Ramus and did not address the lengths as numbers. His writing kept track of homogeneity, which did not simplify their reading. He failed to recognize the complex numbers of Bombelli and needed to double-check his algebraic answers through geometrical construction. Although he was fully aware that his new algebra was sufficient to give a solution, this concession tainted his reputation.

However, Vieta created many innovations: the binomial formula, which would be taken by Pascal and Newton, and the link between the roots and coefficients of a polynomial, called Vieta's formula.

Vieta was well skilled in most modern artifices, aiming at the simplification of equations by the substitution of new quantities having a certain connection with the primitive unknown quantities. Another of his works, ''Recensio canonica effectionum geometricarum'', bears a modern stamp, being what was later called an [[algebraic geometry]]—a collection of precepts how to construct algebraic expressions with the use of ruler and compass only. While these writings were generally intelligible, and therefore of the greatest didactic importance, the principle of homogeneity, first enunciated by Vieta, was so far in advance of his times that most readers seem to have passed it over. That principle had been made use of by the Greek authors of the classic age; but of later mathematicians only [[Hero of Alexandria|Hero]], [[Diophantus]], etc., ventured to regard lines and surfaces as mere numbers that could be joined to give a new number, their sum.

The study of such sums, found in the works of Diophantus, may have prompted Vieta to lay down the principle that quantities occurring in an equation ought to be homogeneous, all of them lines, or surfaces, or solids, or supersolids—an equation between mere numbers being inadmissible. During the centuries that have elapsed between Vieta's day and the present, several changes of opinion have taken place on this subject. Modern mathematicians like to make homogeneous such equations as are not so from the beginning, in order to get values of a symmetrical shape. Vieta himself did not see that far; nevertheless, he indirectly suggested the thought. He also conceived methods for the general resolution of equations of the second, third and fourth degrees different from those of [[Scipione dal Ferro]] and [[Lodovico Ferrari]], with which he had not been acquainted. He devised an approximate numerical solution of equations of the second and third degrees, wherein [[Leonardo of Pisa]] must have preceded him, but by a method which was completely lost.

Above all, Vieta was the first mathematician who introduced notations for the problem (and not just for the unknowns).<ref name="Bos"/>  As a result, his algebra was no longer limited to the statement of rules, but relied on an efficient computer algebra, in which the operations act on the letters and the results can be obtained at the end of the calculations by a simple replacement. This approach, which is the heart of contemporary algebraic method, was a fundamental step in the development of mathematics.<ref>Helena M. Pycior  : Symbols, Impossible Numbers, and Geometric Entanglements: British Algebra... [http://books.google.com/books?lr=lang_en&client=safari&hl=fr&as_brr=3&id=3AnAcnc-yvIC Google books]</ref> With this, Vieta marked the end of medieval algebra (from Al-Khwarizmi to Stevin) and opened the modern period.

=== The logic of ''species'' ===
Being wealthy, Vieta began to publish at his own expense, for a few friends and scholars in almost every country of Europe, the systematic presentation of his mathematic theory, which he called "[[new algebra|species logistic]]" (from ''species:'' symbol) or art of calculation on symbols (1591).<ref>Peter Murphy, Peter Murphy (LL. B.)  : Evidence, proof, and facts: a book of sources, [http://books.google.com/books?id=srFqqNvV5k0C Google Books]</ref>

He described in three stages how to proceed for solving a problem:

* As a first step, he summarized the problem in the form of an equation. Vieta called this stage the '''Zetetic'''. It denotes the known quantities by consonants (B, D, etc.) and the unknown quantities by the vowels (A, E, etc.)
* In a second step, he made an analysis. He called this stage the Poristic. Here mathematicians must discuss the equation and solve it. It gives the characteristic of the problem, '''porisma''', from which we can move to the next step.
* In the last step, the '''exegetical analysis''', he returned to the initial problem which presents a solution through a geometrical or numerical construction based on porisma.

Among the problems addressed by Vieta with this method is the complete resolution of the quadratic equations of the form <math>X^2 + X b = c</math> and third-degree equations of the form <math>X^3 + aX = b</math> (Vieta reduced it to quadratic equations). He knew the connection between the positive [[root of a function|roots]] of an equation (which, in his day, were alone thought of as roots) and the coefficients of the different powers of the unknown quantity (see [[Viète's formulas]] and their application on [[quadratic equation]]s). He discovered the formula for deriving the [[De Moivre's formula#Formulas for cosine and sine individually|sine of a multiple angle]], knowing that of the simple angle with due regard to the periodicity of sines. This formula must have been known to Vieta in 1593.

=== Adriaan van Roomen's problem ===
This famous controversy is told by Tallemant des Réaux in these terms (46 stories):

"In the times of Henri the fourth, a Dutchman called Adrianus Romanus, a learned mathematician, but not so good as he believed, published a treatise in which he proposed a question to all the mathematicians of Europe, but did not ask any Frenchman. Shortly after, a state ambassador came to the King at Fontainebleau. The King took pleasure in showing him all the sights, and he said people there were excellent in every profession in his kingdom. 'But, Sire,' said the ambassador, 'you have no mathematician, according to Adrianus Romanus, who didn't mention any in his catalog.' 'Yes, we have,' said the King. 'I have an excellent man. Go and seek Monsieur Viette,' he ordered. Vieta, who was at Fontainebleau, came at once. The ambassador sent for the book from Adrianus Romanus and showed the proposal to Vieta, who had arrived in the gallery, and before the King came out, he had already written two solutions with a pencil. By the evening he had sent many other solutions to the ambassador."

This suggests that the Adrien van Roomen problem is an equation of 45°, which Vieta recognized immediately as a chord of an arc of 8° (<math>\frac{2\pi}{45}</math> radians). It was then easy to determine the following 22 positive alternatives, the only valid ones at the time.

When, in 1595, Vieta published his response to the problem set by Adriaan van Roomen, he proposed finding the resolution of the old [[problem of Apollonius]], namely to find a circle tangent to three given circles. Van Roomen proposed a solution using an [[hyperbola]], with which Vieta did not agree, as he was hoping for a solution using [[Euclidean tools]]).

Vieta published his own solution in 1600, (Apollonius Gallus). In this paper, Vieta made use of the center of similitude of two circles. His friend De Thou said that Adriaan van Roomen immediately left the University of Würzburg, saddled his horse and went to Fontenay-le-Comte, where Vieta lived. According to De Thou, he stayed a month with him, and learned the methods of the [[new algebra]]. The two men became friends and Vieta paid all van Roomen's expenses before his return to Würzburg.

This resolution had an almost immediate impact in Europe and Vieta earned the admiration of many mathematicians over the centuries. Vieta did not deal with cases (circles together, these tangents, etc.), but recognized that the number of solutions depends on the relative position of the three circles and outlined the ten resulting situations. Descartes completed (in 1643) the theorem of the three circles of Apollonius, leading to a quadratic equation in 87 terms, each of which is a product of six factors (which, with this method, makes the actual construction humanly impossible).<ref>Henk J.M.

=== Works ===
* Between 1564 and 1568, Vieta prepared for his student, Catherine de Parthenay, some textbooks of astronomy and trigonometry and a treatise that was never published: ''Harmonicon coelestis.''

* From 1571, he published at his own expense and with great printing difficulties:
:''Francisci Vietœi universalium inspectionum ad canonem mathematicum liber singularis; a book of trigonometry, in abbreviated Canonen mathematicum'', where there are many formulas on the sine and cosine. It is unusual in using decimal numbers. These trigonometric tables exceeded those of [[Regiomontanus]] (Triangulate Omnimodis, 1533) and [[Georg Joachim Rheticus|Rheticus]] (1543, annexed to De revolutionibus ... of Copernicus).

* In 1589: ''Deschiffrement escription of a letter by the Commander Moreo at Roy Espaigne of his master''. Tours, Mettayer, 1590, p.&nbsp;20

* Two versions of the ''Isagoge'':
** ''Francisci Vietae-in artem analyticem isagoge''. Tours, Mettayer, 1591, 9 fol-Francisci Vietae Fontenaeensis in artem analyticem isagoge. Ejusdem ad logisticem speciosam Notae priors. Paris, Baudry, 1631, in 12, 233 p.
** ''In Artem Analyticien Isagoge'' ([[New algebra|Introduction to the art of analysis]]), considered as the founding text of the analysis (in contrast to the summary).

* ''Francisci Vietae Zeteticorum libri quinque''. Tours, Mettayer, folio 24, which are the five books of Zetetic. This is a collection of problems from Diophantus, and solved using the analytical art.

* ''Effectionum geometricarum canonica recensio''. Sd, fol 7. Undated.

* In 1593, ''Vietae Supplementum geometriae''. Tours Francisci, 21 fol.

The same year:

* ''Francisci Vietae Variorum de rebus responsorum mathematics liber VIII.'' Tours, Mettayer, 1593, 49 fol about the challenges of Scaliger. The following year, he will give the same against Scaliger: ''Munimen adversus nova cyclometrica.'' Paris, Mettayer, in 4, 8 fol.

* The ''Eighth Book of the varied responses,'' in which he talks about the problems of the trisection of the angle (which he acknowledges that it is bound to an equation of third degree) of squaring the circle, building the regular heptagon, etc.

The same year, based on geometrical considerations and through trigonometric calculations perfectly mastered, he discovered the first [[infinite product]] in history of mathematics by giving an expression of [[Pi|?]], now known as [[Viète's formula]]:

:<math>\pi= 2\times\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\times
\frac{2}{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}}\times
\frac{2}{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}}}\times\frac{2}{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}}}}\times\cdots</math>

He provides 10 decimal places of [[Pi|?]] by applying the [[Archimedes]] method to a polygon with 6&nbsp;×&nbsp;2<sup>16</sup> = 393&nbsp;216 sides.

In 1595: ''Ad mathematics problema quod omnibus totius orbis construendum proposuit Adrianus Romanus, Vietae responsum Francisci''. Paris, Mettayer, in 4, 16 fol; text about the Adriaan van Roomen problem.

In 1600, ''numbers potestatum ad exegesim resolutioner.'' Paris, Le Clerc, 36 fol; work that provided the means for extracting roots and solutions of equations of degree at most 6.

''Francisci Vietae Apollonius Gallus.'' Paris, Le Clerc, in 4, 13 fol., where he referred to himself as the French Apollonius.

In 1602, ''Francisci Vietae Fontenaeensis libellorum supplicum Regia magistri in relatio Kalendarii Gregorian vere ad ecclesiasticos doctores exhibits Pontifici Maximi Clementi VIII.'' Anno Christi I600 jubilaeo. Paris, Mettayer, in 4, fol 40

''Francisci and Vietae adversus Christophorum Clavium expostulatio.'' Paris, Mettayer, in 4, 8 p exposing his theses against Clavius.

=== His convictions ===
Vieta was accused of Protestantism by the Catholic League, but he was not a Huguenot (his father was, according to Dhombres)<ref name="Dhombres">Dhombres, Jean. François Viète et la Réforme. Available at [http://www.cc-parthenay.fr/parthenay/creparth/GUICHARDJp/protestant/protestant%20accueil.html cc-parthenay.fr] {{fr-icon}}</ref> Indifferent in religious matters, he did not adopt the Calvinist faith of Parthenay, nor that of his other protectors, the Rohan family. His call to the parliament of Rennes proved the opposite. At the reception as a member of the court of Brittany, on 6 April 1574, he read in public a statement of Catholic faith.<ref name="Dhombres"/>

Nevertheless, Vieta defended and protected Protestants his whole life, and suffered, in turn, the wrath of the League. It seems that for him, the stability of the state must be preserved and that under this requirement, the King's religion did not  matter. At that time, such people were called "Politicals."

Furthermore, at his death, he did not want to confess his sins. A friend had to convince him that his own daughter would not find a husband, were he to refuse the sacraments of the Catholic Church. Whether Vieta was an atheist or not is a matter of debate.<ref name="Dhombres"/>

=== Posterity ===
During the ascendancy of the Catholic League, Vieta's secretary was [[Nathaniel Tarporley]], perhaps one of the more interesting and enigmatic [[mathematician]]s of 16th-century England. When he returned to London, Tarporley became one of the trusted friends of [[Thomas Harriot]].

Apart from Catherine de Parthenay, Vieta's other notable students were: French mathematician Jacques Aleaume, from Orleans, [[Marino Ghetaldi]] of Ragusa, [[Jean de Beaugrand]] and the Scottish mathematician [[Alexander Anderson (mathematician)|Alexander Anderson]]. They illustrated his theories by publishing his works and continuing his methods. At his death, his heirs gave his manuscripts to Peter Aleaume.<ref>De Thou, Jacques-Auguste available at [http://www.archive.org/details/histoireuniverse14thou L'histoire universelle (fr)] and at [http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Viete_De_Thou.html Universal History (en)]</ref>  We give here the most important posthumous editions:

* In 1612: ''Supplementum Apollonii Galli'' of Marino Ghetaldi.
* From 1615 to 1619: ''Animadversionis in Franciscum vietam, Clemente a Cyriaco nuper'' by Alexander Anderson
* ''Francisci Vietae Fontenaeensis ab aequationum recognitione et emendatione Tractatus duo Alexandrum'' per Andersonum. Paris, Laquehay, 1615, in 4, 135 p. The death of Alexander Anderson unfortunately halted the publication.
*In 1630, an ''Introduction to Art of new analytic algebra'', translated into French and commentary by mathematician JL Sieur de Vaulezard. Paris, Jacquin.
*The five books of François Viette's Zetetic, put into French, and commented increased by mathematician JL Sieur de Vaulezard. Paris, Jacquin, p.&nbsp;219.

The same year, there appeared an ''Isagoge'' by Antoine Vasset (a pseudonym of Claude Hardy), and the following year, a translation into Latin of Beaugrand, which Descartes would have received.

In 1648, the corpus of mathematical works printed by [[Frans van Schooten]], professor at Leiden University (Elzevirs presses). He was assisted by Jacques Golius and Mersenne.

The English mathematicians [[Thomas Harriot]] and [[Isaac Newton]], and the Dutch physicist [[Willebrord Snellius]], the French mathematicians [[Pierre de Fermat]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] all used Vieta's ratings. Later, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] sought to analyze what Vieta had done for equations but his fame was soon eclipsed by [[René Descartes]], who, despite the efforts of scholars like [[D'Alembert]], obtained the full paternity of analytical geometry.

About 1770, the Italian mathematician Targioni Tozzetti, found in Florence an ''Harmonicum.'' Vieta had written in it: ''Describat Planeta Ellipsim ad motum anomaliœ ad Terram.'' (That shows he adopted Copernic's system and understood before [[Kepler]] the elliptic form of the orbits of planets) <ref>Harvard abstracts about ''Harmonicum Celestae'' : [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1975JHA.....6..185S Adsabs.harvard.edu]</ref>

In 1841, the French mathematician, [[Michel Chasles]] was one of the first to reevaluate his role in the development of modern algebra.

In 1847, a letter from [[François Arago]], perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences (Paris) announced his intention to write a biography of Franciscus Vieta.

Between 1880 and 1890, the polytechnician Fréderic Ritter, based in Fontenay-le-Comte, was the first translator of the works of François Viète and his first contemporary biographer with [[Benjamin Fillon]].

===Descartes' opinion of Vieta===
Thirty-four years after the death of Vieta, the philosopher [[René Descartes]] published his ''method'' and a book of geometry that changed the landscape of algebra and built on Vieta's work, applying it to the geometry by removing its requirements of homogeneity. Descartes, accused by Jean Baptiste Chauveau, a former classmate of La Flèche, explained  in a letter to Mersenne (1639 February) that he never read those works.<ref>Letter from Descartes to Mersenne. (PDF)  [http://pagesperso-orange.fr/denis.collin/au-rp-mersenne-2-02-39.pdf Pagesperso-orange.fr], February 20, 1639 {{fr-icon}}</ref>

"I have no knowledge of this surveyor and I wonder what he said, that we studied Vieta's work together in Paris, because it is a book which I cannot remember having seen the cover, while I was in France."

Elsewhere, Descartes said that Vieta's notations were confusing and used unnecessary geometric justifications. In some letters, he showed he understands the program of the ''Artem Analyticem Isagoge''; in others, he shamelessly caricatured Vieta's proposals. One of his biographers, Charles Adam,<ref>[http://www.archive.org/details/uvresdedescartes12desc Archive.org], Charles Adam, ''Vie et Oeuvre de Descartes'' Paris, L Cerf, 1910, p 215.</ref> noted this contradiction:

"These words are surprising, by the way, for he (Descartes) had just said a few lines earlier that he had tried to put in his geometry only what he believed "was known neither by Vieta nor by anyone else". So he was informed of what Vieta knew; and he must have read his works previously."

Current research has not shown the extent of the direct influence of the works of Vieta on Descartes.  This influence could have been formed through  the works of Adriaan van Roomen or Jacques Aleaume at the Hague, or through the book by Jean de Beaugrand.<ref>
[http://books.google.com/books?id=UPGVFEDVc0wC&printsec=frontcover&cad=0#PRA1-PA259,M1 Chikara Sasaki. Descartes' mathematical thought p.259]</ref>

In his letters to Mersenne, Descartes consciously minimized the originality and depth of the work of his predecessors. "I began," he says, "where Vieta finished". His views emerged in the 17th century and mathematicians won a clear algebraic language without the requirements of homogeneity. Many contemporary studies have restored the work of Parthenay's mathematician, showing he had the double merit of introducing the first elements of literal calculation and build a first axiomatic for algebra.

Although Vieta was not the first to propose notation of unknown quantities by letters ([[Jordanus Nemorarius]] had done it in the past), we can reasonably estimate that it would be simplistic to summarize his innovations for that discovery and place him at the junction of algebraic transformations made during the late sixteenth – early 17th century.

A '''police officer''' (also known as a '''policeman/woman''', '''police agent''', '''patrolman''' and '''constable''' [[Police Officer Ranks|in some forces]], particularly in the United Kingdom<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police-information.co.uk/policepay.htm#constables |title=Police ranks and pay in England and Wales |publisher=Police-information.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library/documents/police.htm |title=Police rank structure and other information in Scotland |publisher=Scotland.gov.uk |date=1994-12-31 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations) is a [[Warrant (law)|warranted]] employee of a [[police|police force]]. In the United States, "officer" is the formal name of the lowest police rank. In many other countries, "officer" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank, and the lowest rank is often "constable". In many other countries there is no such title as "police officer", as the use of the rank "officer" is legally reserved for military personnel only and thus not applicable. Police officers are generally charged with the apprehension of [[criminal]]s and the prevention and detection of [[crime]], protection of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an [[Police oath|oath]], and have the power to [[arrest]] people and [[police custody|detain them]] for a limited time, along with other duties and powers.

Some police officers may also be trained in special duties, such as [[counter-terrorism]], [[surveillance]], [[child protection]], [[Very Important Person|VIP]] [[Protective security units|protection]], [[Civil law (common law)|civil law enforcement]], and investigation techniques into major crime including [[fraud]], [[rape]], [[murder]] and [[drug trafficking]].

==Duties and functions==
[[File:Irish police on lunchbreak.jpg|thumb|A group of Garda officers in the [[Republic of Ireland]].]]
[[Image:West Midlands Police - Force Traffic Biker.jpg|thumb|A British police officer on a police motorbike]]

Responsibilities of a police officer are varied, and may differ greatly from within one political context to another. Typical duties relate to keeping the peace, law enforcement, protection of people and property, making us feel safe and protected  and the investigation of crimes. Officers are expected to respond to a variety of situations that may arise while they are on duty. Rules and guidelines dictate how an officer should behave within the community, and in many contexts restrictions are placed on what the uniformed officer wears. In some countries, [[rule making|rules and procedures]] dictate that a police officer is obliged to intervene in a criminal incident, even if they are off-duty. Police officers in nearly all countries retain their lawful powers while off duty.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://education-portal.com/articles/Police_Officer_Educational_Requirements_for_Police_Officers.html |title=Educational Requirements for Police Officers |work=education-portal.com |year=2011 |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}</ref>

===In the community===
In the majority of [[Western world|Western]] legal systems, the major role of the police is to maintain order, keeping the peace through surveillance of the public, and the subsequent reporting and apprehension of suspected violators of the law. They also function to [[Deterrence (psychology)|discourage]] crimes through high-visibility policing, and most police forces have an investigative capability. Police have the legal authority to arrest and detain, usually granted by magistrates. Police officers also respond to emergency calls, along with routine [[community policing]].

Police are often used as an [[emergency service]] and may provide a public safety function at large gatherings, as well as in emergencies, [[Emergency preparedness|disasters]], [[search and rescue]] situations, and [[Car accident|road traffic collisions]]. To provide a prompt response in emergencies, the police often coordinate their operations with [[firefighting|fire]] and [[emergency medical service]]s. In some countries, individuals serve jointly as police officers as well as firefighters (creating the role of [[fire police]]. In many countries, there is a common [[emergency service number]] that allows the police, firefighters, or medical services to be summoned to an emergency. Some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] have outlined command procedures, for the use in major emergencies or disorder. The [[Gold Silver Bronze command structure]] is a system set up to improve communications between ground based officers and the control room, typically, Bronze Commander would be a senior officer on the ground, coordinating the efforts in the center of the emergency, Silver Commanders would be positioned in an 'Incident Control Room' erected to improve better communications at the scene, and a Gold Commander who would be in the Control Room.

Police are also responsible for reprimanding minor offenders by issuing [[summons|citations]] which typically may result in the imposition of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], particularly for violations of [[traffic]] law. Traffic enforcement is often and effectively accomplished by police officers on [[motorcycle]]s—called ''motor officers,'' these officers refer to the motorcycles they ride on duty as simply ''motors.'' Police are also trained to assist persons in distress, such as motorists whose car has broken down and people experiencing a medical emergency. Police are typically trained in basic [[first aid]] such as [[CPR]].

In addition, some [[park ranger]]s are commissioned as law enforcement officers and carry out a law-enforcement role within [[national park]]s and other back-country wilderness and recreational areas, whereas [[Military police]] perform law enforcement functions within the military.

==Entry and promotion qualifications==
In most countries, candidates for the police force must have completed some formal education. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Increasing numbers of people are joining the police force who possess [[tertiary education]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} and in response to this many police forces have developed a "fast-track" scheme whereby those with [[university degree]]s spend two to three years as a [[Constable]] before receiving promotion to higher ranks, such as [[Sergeant]]s or [[Inspector]]s. (Officers who work within investigative divisions or plainclothes are not necessarily of a higher rank but merely have different duties.){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Police officers are also recruited from those with experience in the military or security services. In the United States [[U.S. state|state]] laws may [[Codification (law)|codify]] state-wide qualification standards regarding age, education, criminal record, and training but in other places requirements are set by local police agencies. Each local Police agency has different requirements.
[[File:Pol mun agenti.jpg|thumb|Officers of the [[Municipal police (Italy)|Polizia Municipale]] from [[Piacenza]], [[Italy]]]]
Promotion is not automatic and usually requires the candidate to pass some kind of examination, interview board or other selection procedure. Although promotion normally includes an increase in [[salary]], it also brings with it an increase in responsibility and for most, an increase in administrative paperwork. There is no stigma attached to this, as experienced line patrol officers are highly regarded.

Dependent upon each agency, but generally after completing two years of service, officers may also apply for specialist positions, such as [[detective]], [[police dog]] handler, [[mounted police]] officer, [[motorcycle officer]], [[water police]] officer, or [[firearms officer]] (in countries where police are not routinely armed).

In some countries such as in [[Singapore]], police ranks may also be supplemented through [[conscription]], similar to [[national service]] in the military. Qualifications may thus be relaxed or enhanced depending on the target mix of conscripts. In [[Singapore]], for example, conscripts face tougher physical requirements in areas such as eyesight, but are less stringent with minimum academic qualification requirements. Some police officers join as volunteers, who again may do so via differing qualification requirements.

==Police pay==
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
In some societies, police officers are paid relatively well compared to other occupations; their pay depends on what rank they are within their police force and how many years they've served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police-information.co.uk/policepay.htm |title=Police Pay |publisher=Police-information.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06}}</ref>

===Line of duty deaths===
[[File:PoliceofficermemorialHoustonTX.JPG|thumb|Memorial to a fallen police officer at the [[Texas Department of Public Safety]] Houston Webster Office in [[Houston]]<ref>"[http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/director_staff/public_information/pr102908.pdf Houston Dacoma Driver License office to close for expansion]."

Line of duty deaths are deaths which occur while an officer is conducting his or her appointed duties. Despite the increased risk of being a victim of a homicide, automobile accidents are the most common cause of officer deaths. Officers are more likely to be involved in traffic accidents because of their large amount of time spent conducting vehicle patrols, or directing traffic, as well as their work outside their vehicles alongside or on the roadway, or in dangerous pursuits. Officers killed by suspects make up a smaller proportion of deaths. In the U.S. in 2005, 156 line of duty deaths were recorded of which 44% were from assaults on officers, 35% vehicle related (only 3% during vehicular pursuits) and the rest from other causes: heart attacks during arrests/foot pursuits, falling from heights during foot chases, diseases contracted either from suspects' body fluids or, more rarely, from [[window period]] emergency [[blood transfusions]] received after motor vehicle accidents, shootings, stabbings, accidental gun discharges or falls that result in blood loss.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.odmp.org/search/year?year=2005 |title=Honoring Officers Killed in the Year 2005 |publisher=Odmp.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22}} See also [http://www.odmp.org/search/year?year=2011 2011 figures]</ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/online-rants-rightwing-extremism-fuel-fears-for-us-cops-225012920.html]

Police officers who die in the line of duty, especially those who die from the actions of suspects or in accidents or heart attacks, are often given elaborate funerals, attended by large numbers of fellow officers. Their families may also be entitled to special pensions. Fallen officers are often remembered in public memorials, such as the [[National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial]] in the U.S., the [[National Police Memorial]] in the U.K. and the Scottish Police Memorial, at the [[Scottish Police College]].

In the [[United Kingdom]], in the 10 years from April 2000 there were 143 line of duty deaths: 54 in road accidents travelling to or from duty, 46 in road accidents on duty, 23 from natural causes on duty, 15 from criminal acts, and 5 in other accidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policememorial.org.uk/Rolls_of_Honour/Statistics/Statistics_2000-2009.htm |title=UK Police Line of Duty Fatalities by Cause of Death, April 2000 to March 2010 |publisher=Policememorial.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> In Great Britain, police do not normally carry firearms.  Officers in Northern Ireland are routinely armed.

The [[Singapore Police Force]] registered [[List of Singapore police officers killed in the line of duty|just over 100 deaths]] in a century up to the year 2000. There have been 28 [[List of New Zealand police officers killed in the line of duty|New Zealand police officers killed]] by criminal act since 1890.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10531709|title=Policeman 28th killed in line of duty |date=11 September 2008|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=2009-01-15}}</ref>

===Work stress===

====Indicators====
[[File:Leggings (PSF).png|150px|thumbnail|right|Standard Police uniforms in a majority of U.S. States]]
The actual presence of stress in police work is well documented and evidenced by certain statistics. Researchers typically use suicide, divorce and alcoholism rates as three key indexes of stress in a group of people.<ref name="tearsofacop1">{{cite web|url=http://www.tearsofacop.com/police/articles/constant.html |title=Not So Obvious Police Stress |publisher=Tearsofacop.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> These factors paint a compelling picture of police officers demonstrating signs of significant stress, for example:

* A study in the United States, by National Surveillance of Police Suicide Study (NSOPS), showed 141 suicides in 2008 and 143 in 2009. This yields a suicide rate of 17/100,000, a figure that holds up under scrutiny and is consistent with CDC/NOMS data.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=O'Hara |first1=A. F. |last2=Violanti |first2=J. M.|title=Police suicide- A web surveillance of national data|journal=Journal Of Emergency Mental Health|date=Winter 2009|volume=11|issue=1}}</ref> The overall suicide rate in the United States was 11.3 suicide deaths per 100,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|title=Suicide in the U.S.: Statistics and Prevention|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/suicide-in-the-us-statistics-and-prevention/index.shtml|publisher=NIMH|accessdate=26 June 2011}}</ref> There is some speculation or controversy that this official rate may understate the actual rate as it is often other police officers that report facts that lead to a cause of death determination, and death benefits, institutional image, and other factors may be incentives to misreport incident facts. It is speculated that some suicides are reported by fellow officers as accidents or as deaths in the line of duty perpetrated by unknown assailants. Also, many jurisdictions simply don't keep suicide statistics. Even though the information is incomplete, the available statistics suggest that police officers are more likely to commit suicide than the general population. However there is still controversy in the interpretation of these statistics. When comparisons are made within age, gender, and racial cohorts, the differences are much less dramatic.<ref>Aamodt MG, Stalnaker NA. Police officer suicide: frequency and officer profiles. In Sheehan D, Warren J, eds. Suicide and Law Enforcement. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office;2002:383-98</ref><ref>Sheehan D, Warren J, eds. Suicide and Law Enforcement. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 2002</ref> Although suicides may be notably more prevalent among police, it is not clear whether police suicides are the result of work stress or the consequence of other variables, such as the influence of a subculture of violence<ref>W C Terry, Police Stress – The Empirical Evidence, Journal of Police Science and Administration Volume:9 Issue:1 Dated:(March 1981) Pages:61–75.</ref>
* Police officers are much more likely to experience interpersonal relationship problems. Relationship problems are most dramatically demonstrated by the divorce rate among police officers, which is usually reported as being the second highest of all occupations. However in a 2009 study, the divorce rates of law enforcement personnel were compared with the rates for other occupations, where data was analyzed from the 2000 U.S. Census. The results of the analysis indicate that the divorce rate for law enforcement personnel is lower than that of the general population, even after controlling for demographic and other job-related variables.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McCoy |first1=S. P. |last2= Aamodt |first2=M. G.|title=A comparison of law enforcement divorce rates with those of other occupations|journal=Journal of Police & Criminal Psychology|date=Spring 2010}}</ref> The propensity to domestic violence is also thought to be higher for police officers than the general population, though the statistics are very fuzzy and controversial. Police officers also seem to have relationship problems at work, typically with superiors or with political oversight, though the evidence is largely anecdotal and controversial.
* Alcoholism is considered another aberrant statistic for police officers. Although the statistics are fuzzy, clinically treated alcohol addiction rates are usually calculated to be about twice as high for police officers than for the general population in the United States. In contrast, statistics documenting alcohol abuse are less precise. Rates for arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol, or DUI or DWI, are somewhat higher for police officers than for other drivers, but the statistics are not widely trusted outside of the insurance industry since it is other police officers that make DUI arrests. Some departments and even some individual officers tend to hold police officers to a higher behavioral and ethical standard while others will recognize a 'blue line' behind which those within the 'brotherhood' are not held to the same standards as the rest of society. Despite the controversies in the interpretation of the statistics, it is generally considered evident that police officers are more susceptible to alcohol abuse than other occupations. The same conclusions are usually made regarding the police abuse of other substances, though the statistics are even less accurate, and even though the higher rates of substance abuse may be due in part to the more ready access to drugs and the more permissive atmosphere 'behind the blue line' rather than to [[occupational stress]]es.

Hans Selye, the foremost researcher in stress in the world{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}, said that police work is "the most stressful occupation in America even surpassing the formidable stresses of air traffic control."<ref name="tearsofacop1"/>

Other researchers, though, claim that police officers are more psychologically healthy than the general population. Police officers are increasingly more educated, more likely to engage in a regular program of exercise and to consume less alcohol and tobacco, and increasingly family-oriented. Healthy behavior patterns typically observed at entry training usually continue throughout the career of an officer. Even though the presence of occupation related stress seems to be well documented, it is highly controversial. Many within the law enforcement industry claim the propagation of incorrect suicide, divorce, and substance abuse statistics comes from people or organizations with political or social agendas, and that the presence of these beliefs within the industry makes it hard for health workers to help police officers in need of treatment to deal with the fear of negative consequences from police work which is necessary to enable police officers to develop a healthy expectancy of success in treatment.<ref>[http://www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/employee-development/482217-1.html ]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref>

*In August 2014, the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] revealed that 8 out of every 10 law enforcement officers are overweight. This sparked some Police Departments to improve their officers overall fitness. Garland Assistant Chief Jeff Bryan stated that "I think it's important for all of us to keep the weight down and stay in shape-especially this job. The stress that we incur at this job... this is a great way to relieve stress and to keep the blood pressure down."<ref name=CBS-overweight>{{cite news|title=FBI: 80 Percent Of Police Officers Are Overweight|url=http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2014/08/14/fbi-80-percent-of-police-officers-are-overweight/|accessdate=16 August 2014|publisher=CBS|date=August 14, 2014}}</ref> Indonesian policemen are required to participate in an exercise program because. In 2009, Mexican police also "set up a nutrition education program." In 2011, Russia's interior ministry warned its police officers, "lose weight or lose your job."

Even though the presence of occupational stresses appear to be well documented, though not without controversy, the causes of workplace stress are comparatively unclear or even a matter of conjecture.

Although individual policemen and institutional public relations typically cite the risks of being killed in the line of duty as the predominant source of stress for individual policemen, there is significant controversy regarding the causes of personal workplace stress due to the fact that the actual risk of being killed is so small relative to other occupations.

It is charged that the myth of the high risks of occupational mortality connected with police work is often propagated by the law enforcement community as part of its institutional advancement and a central element in its public relations. Actual homicides of police are comparatively rare, but the reports of such incidents are typically reported in the press along with quotes by police officials or police officer family members stressing the notion that police officers 'put their lives on the line for the public' or 'risk their lives everyday', making it look like individual policemen routinely place themselves in mortal danger for low pay and little recognition, and that the view of police work as 'combat' is the source of police occupational stress indications.

Another explanation often advanced is the idea that police officers will undergo some traumatic experience in their police work that they never recover from, leading to suicide, divorce, etc. However, since the effects of such traumatic stresses is readily recognized, there are usually proactive programs in place to help individual police officers deal with the psychological effects of a traumatic event. Unfortunately, there is some evidence that such programs are actually ineffective, especially group therapies, may re-traumatize the participant, weaken coping mechanisms, and contribute to the development of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).<ref>Rose S, Bisson J, Wessely S. Psychological debriefing for preventing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Cochrane Review). In The Cochrane Library, Issue 3. Oxford: Update Software, 2001.</ref><ref>Kaplan Z, Iancu I, Bo E.

Observations where police officers and other emergency workers, such as firemen, experience the same traumatic event, it is more likely that the police officer will have difficulty dealing with the long term emotional effects of the traumatic event. On this observation, some of the academic literature suggests that along these lines the causes of occupational stress is more complex for police officers. Stress in police work is often present in other occupations, but not in an ongoing capacity. One line of thinking is that the individual stresses of police work produce a condition of chronic stress. Police officers encounter stressors in call after call which sap their emotional strength. Debilitation from this daily stress accumulates making officers more vulnerable to traumatic incidents and normal pressures of life. The weakening process is often too slow to see; neither a person nor his friends are aware of the damage being done. The effects of chronic stresses is two-fold:

* First, prolonged stress causes people to regress. Their psychological growth reverses, and they become more immature. They rapidly become more childish and primitive, much like a person being sick for several days becoming more irritable and childish in its demands on other people.
* Second, chronic stress numbs people's sensitivity. They can't stand to continually see human misery. They must stop feeling or they won't survive. The mind has this defense mechanism so people can continue working in horrible situations. If they kept their normal sensitivity, they would fall apart. As they become insensitive to their own suffering, they become insensitive to the suffering of others. When treated with indignity, they lose not only a sense of their own dignity but also the dignity of others. The pain of others stops bothering them, and they are no longer bothered when they hurt others.

The daily work of a police officer involves certain paradoxes and conflicts which may be difficult to deal with, the predominant examples are<ref name="tearsofacop1"/>

* Interaction with the public, whether socially or officially, such as in a traffic stop, involves a risk of physical harm. Being on guard for an attack and treating every interpersonal situation with affirmative commands makes the police officer appear brutal and detached, limits his actual effectiveness with the public and engenders chronic stress.
[[File:Wayne County Sheriff Deputy with Reising submachine gun.JPG|thumb|[[Deputy Sheriff]] with submachine gun]]
* A police department is a paramilitary organization. Policies, regulations, and procedures cover every facet of police work. Everything is expected to be done by the book with substantial repercussions, including civil and criminal liability, for varying from the expectations of operating procedures. Often the facts of a situation require a course of action that does not follow procedures. If he follows procedures exactly, he knows he won't fully help the public, and the public will think he is shirking his responsibility. If the officer follows his own judgment, he is taking a risk. The community and department expect officers to use judgment, but when they do, there is a danger they will be disciplined; another unnatural no-win situation engendering chronic stress.
* Police officers tend to become socially isolated. The reasons given for this isolation are lack of department support, a perceived sense of alienation from the residents of the community where they patrol, the degree of urbanism ("Big City"), and "anti-police" judicial verdicts. When a group of people are isolated they become disoriented and confused. Ironically an isolated class are usually the ones losing real world wisdom and tend to judge from a very limited perspective, leading to more stress.<ref>[http://www.robertankony.com/publications/the-impact-of-community-alienation-on-police-officers Robert C. Ankony, "Community Alienation and Its Impact on Police," ''The Police Chief'', Oct. 1999, 150-53. ]</ref>

A more anecdotal view looks at specific sources of stress in police work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heavybadge.com/efstress.htm |title=Effects of Stress on police officers |publisher=Heavybadge.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> The sources of stress most often actually cited are:

*The fear of killing someone in the line of duty.
*Feeling at least partially responsible for getting your partner or somebody else killed in the line of duty.
*Lack of support by the department or superiors.
*The scheduling of work and irregular work demands resulting in a disruption of family time or family events or activities.

Other more academic studies have produced similar lists, but may include items that the more anecdotal surveys do not reveal, such as 'exposure to neglected, battered, or dead children.'<ref>{{cite web |first1=C. D. |last1=Spielberger |first2=L.G. |last2=Westberry |first3=K.

Again, the actual fear of occupational death or physical harm is not high on the list of stress sources.

There have been numerous academic studies on the specific sources of police stress, and most conclude organizational culture and workload as the key issues in officer stress.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://occmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/53/4/256 |title=Stress in police officers: a study of the origins, prevalence and severity of stress-related symptoms within a county police force |last1= Collins |first1=P.

==Abuse of power ==

===Systematic cases===
In dictatorial, corrupt, or weak states, police officers may carry out many criminal acts for the ruling regime with impunity. [[Institutional racism]] has been found in modern police forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cf.ac.uk/tlru/Lawrence.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Lawrence Inquiry.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>{{Citation broken|date=December 2013}}

===Individual cases===
Individual officers, or sometimes whole units, can be [[Police corruption|corrupt]] or carry out various other forms of [[Police misconduct|misconduct]]; this occasionally happens in many forces, but is particularly problematic where police pay is very low unless supplemented by [[bribe]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38075 |title=IPS: DRUGS-MEXICO: Police Caught Between Low Wages, Threats and Bribes |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> Police sometimes act with unwarranted [[Police brutality|brutality]] when they overreact to confrontational situations,<ref>{{cite news |last=Edwards |first=Richard |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/5172206/Ian-Tomlinson-G20-protests-death-police-office-faces-manslaughter-charge.html |title=Ian Tomlinson G20 protests death: police office faces manslaughter charge |work=The Telegraph |date=2009-04-17 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> to extract a confession from a person they may or may not genuinely suspect of being guilty,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12517014.100-you-did-it-didnt-you-the-police-often-argue-that-thetough-interviewing-of-suspects-is-the-best-way-to-extract-the-truth-butsuch-strategies-are-exactly-the-sort-to-provoke-false-confessions-.html |title=The police often argue that the tough 'interviewing' of suspects is the best way to extract the truth.

The '''Ancient and Mystical Order Rosæ Crucis''', also called the ''[[Rosicrucian Order]] (AMORC)'', is a worldwide philosophical and humanistic [[fraternal organization]] devoted to "the study of the elusive mysteries of life and the universe."<ref>[http://www.amorc.org/ Official AMORC International Web Site Directory]</ref> The organization is non-sectarian and it is open to both men and women of legal adult age (18 years old in most countries) regardless of their various religious persuasions.

The current open cycle of AMORC was activated by Harvey Spencer Lewis in 1915.<ref>Christian Rebisse, ''Rosicrucian History and Mysteries'' (San Jose: Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 2005), pp 172–177. On 172 AMORC's Charter (Apr 1915) is shown, and on 177 is illustrated the "American Pronunziamento Number One" (Feb 1915).</ref> Lewis received authority to do so from the Supreme Council of the Rosicrucian Order after being tried, tested and finally initiated into the Order in 1909, Toulouse, France.

AMORC is said to be the modern day manifestation of the ancient [[Rosy Cross|Rose-Croix]] Order which has its origin in the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian mystery schools.<ref>[[Hermetica#Authorship and audience]]</ref>

AMORC's teachings draw upon ideas of the major [[philosopher]]s, particularly [[Pythagoras]], [[Thales]], [[Solon]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Democritus]]. The teachings are divided into [http://www.amorc.org.uk/study/system Degrees] which are further grouped into broad categories under titles such as ''[http://www.amorc.org.uk/study/postulant Postulant]'', ''[http://www.amorc.org.uk/study/neophyte Neophyte]'' and ''[http://www.amorc.org.uk/study/initiate Initiate]'' sections. These degrees cover various fields related to physical, mental, psychic and spiritual existence such as [[physics]], [[metaphysics]], biology, [[psychology]], [[parapsychology]], [[comparative religion]], traditional healing techniques, [[health]], [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[extrasensory perception]], material and spiritual [[alchemy]], [[meditation]], sacred architecture, symbolism, and that mystical state of consciousness relating to the experience of unity with the Divine.<ref>According to AMORC's publication ''Mastery of Life''</ref>

== Name ==
The name AMORC is an abbreviation for the [[Latin]] title ''Antiquus Mysticusque Ordo Rosæ Crucis'' ("Ancient and Mystic Order of the Rosy Cross") [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]], an author, [[occult]]ist and mystic who founded AMORC in the United States of America, wrote that "from the very start, and with the issuance of the first public manifesto, the correct name of the international Rosicrucian organization was used, namely, the ''Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis''. This is a slightly abbreviated form of the original Latin name, ''Antiquus Arcanus Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis'', and the initials AMORC were immediately used as well as the true and original symbol of the Rosicrucian Order — the golden cross with but ''one red rose'' in the center."<ref>Lewis, H. Spencer ''Rosicrucian Questions and Answers with Complete History of the Rosicrucian Order'', pp. 180–181, Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1929, ISBN 0-912057-37-8</ref>

==Organization and structure==
AMORC is a worldwide organization, established in the [[United States of America]] as a [[nonprofit]] [[501(c)(3)]] public benefit [[corporation]], with the specific and primary purpose of advancing the knowledge of its history, principles, and teachings for charitable, educational, and scientific purposes. It is financed mainly through fees paid by its members. Income is used by the organization to pay expenses, develop new programs, expand services, and carry out educational work.

The organizational headquarters for different jurisdictions of the AMORC are designated as "Grand Lodges." The English-speaking Grand Lodge for the Americas is headquartered in [[Rosicrucian Park]] in San Jose, California. All Grand Lodges are governed by The Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC. The Supreme Grand Lodge meets annually, often in [[Lachute]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] (however, in August 2009 the Supreme Board met in [[Toulouse]], [[France]], in honor of the 100th Anniversary of H. Spencer Lewis's initiation there), and is responsible for the worldwide coordination of AMORC, the establishment of new administrations, and the appointment of jurisdictions to Grand Lodges, usually based on language. This body consists of the [[Imperator]], Grand Masters, and related executive officers.

On a local level, members of AMORC often form smaller affiliated groups organized as Lodges, Chapters, Pronaoi, or Atrium Groups. These various titles differ according to the number of members of each body in regular attendance. Participation in these groups is optional, and participants retain compulsory membership with their respective Grand Lodge. Many of these groups charge additional dues to participants to cover expenses such as rent and mailings. Most affiliated bodies of the AMORC offer Open Meetings or Lectures to which the general public is invited and welcome.

Each AMORC Grand Lodge has its own headquarters and facilities. In North America, the largest Chapter in the world is located at 1342 Naglee Ave. ; the headquarters of the English Grand Lodge for the Americas owns the Rosicrucian Park in [[San Jose, California]], founded in 1927, which includes the [[Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum]], the fifth planetarium built in the USA (and the first to have a US-built star projector, built by Dr. [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]]), the Rosicrucian Peace Garden, Rosicrucian Research Library, Grand Temple, Administration Building, Fountain Plaza and Gardens.

Discussion groups, an informal type of gathering for both members and the public, were formally introduced in 2009 in North America. They are authorized by AMORC but are not affiliated bodies.

==History==
[[Image:Francis Bacon.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Francis Bacon]], an Imperator of the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian Order]] (as claimed by AMORC)]]

In 1909 [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]] visited France in search of Rosicrucians, was duly initiated in Toulouse, France, and given the mandate to establish an order in North America. After further qualification and preparation the first official Manifesto was issued in the United States in 1915, announcing the establishment of Rosicrucian activity in America. May Banks-Stacy, the co-founder of AMORC, was said to be one of the last successors to the original colony of Rosicrucians that settled in America during the late 17th century, and an initiate of the Rosicrucians of the East.<ref>Christian Rebisse, pp.161–163.</ref> Lewis became a "secret partner" of [[Big Business]] in America.<ref>H. Spencer Lewis ''Rosicrucian Principles for Home and Business'', p. 15, Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1953 ASIN: B000O3PY9K; 1st ed. 1929</ref> According to railroad magnate [[Arthur Stillwell]], no other man has exerted a greater influence as a secret partner in American [[free enterprise]] than Lewis. [[Walt Disney]] was once a member of AMORC as was [[Star Trek]] creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] and [[Jack Palance]]'s daughter [[Holly Palance]].<ref>Erik Davis ''The Visionary State'', p. 112, Chronicle Books, 2006 ISBN 978-0-8118-4835-0</ref>

AMORC headquarters were located in [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], and then [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] before moving to [[San Jose, California]], in 1927. Harvey Spencer Lewis died in 1939 and, in accordance with wishes stipulated in his will, was succeeded in the Office of Imperator by his son [[Ralph Maxwell Lewis]] who had previously served as Supreme Secretary. [[Gary L. Stewart]] who previously served as Grand Master of the English-Speaking jurisdiction and then Vice President of the Board of Directors was appointed to the Office of Imperator upon Lewis' death in 1987 in compliance with Lewis' wishes. [[Christian Bernard]] who had been the Grand Master of France and then succeeded Stewart to the position of Vice President of the Board was elected to the Office of Imperator in 1990 by the Board of Directors.

During [[World War II]] AMORC underwent a dramatic period of growth. After the war ended AMORC was able to lend support to its European sister organizations. Eventually many of these then came under the administration of AMORC's leadership in San Jose. 2009, the centennial year of H. Spencer Lewis's initiation in [[Toulouse]], saw growth in membership in the English Grand Lodge for the Americas and very active participation in on-line activities including [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], online Discussion groups, a social networking site, podcasts and Rosicrucian TV on [[YouTube]]. [[Rosicrucian Park]] in San Jose received many improvements as well, including the completion of accessibility upgrades to the museum, planetarium and grounds and the installation of sustainable native plant gardens.

AMORC uses ''traditional''  history, consisting of tales and legends represented as having been passed down for centuries by word of mouth as well as the conventional ''chronological''  history, which consists of verifiable fact. AMORC traces its origin to ''[[mystery school]]s'' established in Egypt during the joint reign of Pharaoh Thutmose III and Hatshepsut, about 1500 BCE.<ref>Armstrong, Steven, "Hidden Harmonies: Rediscovering the Egyptian Foundations of the Rosicrucian Path," ''Rosicrucian Digest'' Volume 85 Number 1 2007, 47–50 at http://www.rosicrucian.org/publications/digest/digest1_2007/articles_pdf/hidden_harmonies.pdf</ref> They united the priesthoods of Egypt into a single order under the leadership of Hatshepsut's Vizier, Hapuseneb.<ref>James H. Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, Vol 2, The Eighteenth Dynasty (1906; repr., New York: Russell and Russell, 1962), 160–162</ref> Each Temple had its associated ''Per Ankh'' (House of Life) where the Mysteries were handed down.<ref>Garth Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993), 57.</ref> In uniting the priesthoods, the ''Per Ankhu'' were also united. These schools were formed to probe into "the mysteries of life" — in other words, natural phenomena, and initiatic spirituality.<ref>See Jeremy Naydler, Shamanic Wisdom of the Pyramid Texts (Rochester VT: Inner Traditions, 2005).</ref> AMORC also claims that among their most esteemed pupils were Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] (Amenhotep IV) and his wife Nefertiti.

Over centuries these Mystery Schools spread into Greece and thence into Rome. During the Middle Ages they were concealed under various names. AMORC claims that Rosicrucianism is mentioned as far back as 1115 [[Common Era|CE]] in a book of the collection of Brother Omnis Moriar in Germany. However, no other record of such a brother and book has appeared. The alleged name probably derives from the opening words of Horace in Ode 3.30 in which he writes: “Non Omnis Moriar” (“I shall not completely die”).

[[Image:Boehme Portrait 1730.jpeg|upright|thumb|left|[[Jakob Böhme]], a Rosicrucian (as claimed by AMORC)]]
Rosicrucianism rose to considerable prominence in Europe during the 17th century following the publication and wide circulation of a small pamphlet, the ''[[Fama Fraternitatis]]''. AMORC scholars have suggested that Rosicrucians first came to America in the area of present day [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]] in The [[Vizcaíno Expedition]] of 1602–1603.<ref>Richard A, Schultz, "The Essene Lineage in California: Carmelites and Rosicrucians at Carmel in 1602." Rosicrucian Digest 85:2 2007, 12–20. Available at http://www.rosicrucian.org/publications/digest/digest2_2007/online%20digest/articles/02_carmel_schultz.pdf</ref> AMORC maintains that the next Rosicrucian expedition came in the chartered vessel ''Sarah Maria'' during the early months of 1694 under the leadership of Grand Master [[Johannes Kelpius]] and they established a colony in what is now [[Fairmount Park]], Philadelphia.<ref>Julius Friedrich Sachse ''The German Pietists of Provincial Pennsylvania'', Self-Publishing, 1895 ASIN: B000GTCOVI</ref> They finally settled on the banks of the [[Wissahickon, Philadelphia|Wissahickon]]. "In that retired valley beside the flowing brook the secret rites and mysteries of the true Rosicrucian Philosophy flourished unmolested for years, until the state of affairs brought about by the American Revolution, together with pernicious Sunday legislation which also discriminated against the keepers of the scriptural Sabbath day, gradually caused the incoming generation to assimilate with the secular congregations."<ref>Sachse pp. 7–8</ref>  This is disputed by another organization, the [[Fraternitas Rosae Crucis|Fraternity of the Rosy Cross]] at one time headed by Dr. [[R. Swinburne Clymer]]. [[Johannes Kelpius]] of the Jacob Boehme Lodge in Germany led the German [[Pietists]] to America and these Rosicrucian immigrants and their descendants established a commune in 1732 at [[Ephrata, Pennsylvania]] known as the Ephrata Society under the leadership of [[Johann Conrad Beissel]] and [[Peter Miller (religious leader)|Peter Miller]] (who at the behest of Congress translated the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] into seven languages); the buildings still exist today as part of a historical park known as [[Ephrata Cloisters]].<ref>H. Spencer Lewis ''Rosicrucian Manual'', p. 16, Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1982 ISBN 0-912057-00-9; 1st ed. 1918</ref> It is also a fact that the two rival organizations historically disputed their claims to Rosicrucian genuineness.<ref>Clymer's side of the argument is found in R. Swinburne Clymer  ''The Rosicrucian Fraternity in America'', v. 1 & v. 2, The Rosicrucian Foundation, 1935 ASIN: B000KY2K8G. H. Spencer Lewis discusses the disputes in H. Spencer Lewis, ''Rosicrucian Questions and Answers With Complete History of the Rosicrucian Order'' (San Jose: Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1929), 151–159; 204–206. Recent scholarship on the dispute may be found in Christopher McIntosh, ''The Rosicrucians'' (3rd Rev. Ed.) (Boston: Weiser Books, 1997), 119–132 and Christian Rebisse, ''Rosicrucian History and Mysteries'' (San Jose: English Grand Lodge, 2005), 223 n. 31.</ref>

===Leadership and new groups===
From 1915 to 1990 the leadership of AMORC was entrusted to the Office of an [[Imperator]] who was solely responsible for all doctrine and ritual of the Order as well as a corporate president who sat at the head of the board of directors, which was responsible for determining all corporate matters related to the organization. When AMORC reorganized in April, 1990, the dual function of the Office was merged into one position, that of President of the worldwide AMORC organization. However, internally, the President was still referred to by the traditional title of [[Imperator]]. In addition to the Imperator, each [[Grand Lodge]] has a Grand Master.

In 1990 there was a dispute over the leadership of the AMORC, which was then under the leadership of Imperator [[Gary L. Stewart]], prompted by allegations made by a few members of the Board of Directors of embezzlement on the part of Stewart. In April, 1990, a [[lawsuit]] was filed by the Board and, as a result of the allegations, Stewart was kept from returning to AMORC's properties by virtue of a Temporary Restraining Order until trial. The newly expanded Board of Directors voted that the Vice President of the Board of Directors, [[Christian Bernard]], should assume Stewart's offices. An installation ritual was held at the [[Fairmont San Francisco|Fairmont Hotel]] in [[San Francisco]], California. During the next three years there was little activity in the lawsuit and the case never went to trial. However, prompted by the Insurance Company of North America's Motion for Intervention on 3 June 1993 alleging insurance fraud against the new AMORC Board of Directors, AMORC sought to settle out of court and on 10 August 1993 dismissed their case against Stewart with prejudice. The dismissal was the final severing of the relationship between Stewart and AMORC.

The governance of AMORC is overseen by the Supreme Grand Lodge (the Imperator, Grand Masters and Administrators), with local (geographic and/or language based) Grand Lodges throughout the world.

After his removal from AMORC in 1990, former Imperator Stewart founded the Confraternity of the Rose Cross and uses the original version of H. Spencer Lewis' [[Rosicrucian Monographs|monographs]] with addendums added by Stewart as well as additional monographs written by Stewart (as opposed to the monographs currently used by AMORC, which were initially rewritten in large parts under Imperator Bernard's supervision and are now regularly revised and updated according to AMORC custom dating from the time of H. Spencer Lewis's first published materials in 1916<ref>Multiple versions of the published materials from the earliest printed materials in the ''American Rosae Crucis'' (1916, seq) and ''Cromaat'' (1918) publications to the formal monographs in many later editions over the years may be found in the collection of the Rosicrucian Research Library and the Publications Department at [[Rosicrucian Park]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].</ref>). Stewart also founded the Order Militia Crucifera Evangelica and assisted with the formation of the British [[Martinist Order]]. Other organizations using the name Rosicrucian formed after Stewart's removal from AMORC include the Ghanaian Order of the Rose Cross led by Benjamin Quaye and the Norwegian Order of the Rose Cross led by Robert Aarberg of which both orders are closely allied with Stewart's Confraternity of the Rose Cross; and the short-lived Ancient Rosae Crucis which was led by Ashley McFadden.

==Public activities==

Many of the activities of the Rosicrucian Order AMORC are open to the public, as well as members. These include:

* '''Online Classes''': In the fall of 2006, the English Grand Lodge for the Americas began offering free online classes in many subjects. Most of these Rose+Croix University Online Classes are open to both AMORC members and the public. These are conducted today on Facebook.
* '''Open Classes''': These are held in many locations, including in North America and the [[Caribbean]], and are listed on the AMORC English Grand Lodge for the Americas site in the external links below. Other such public activities can be found on the international sites.
* '''Meditation for Peace''': In 2004, [[Imperator]] [[Christian Bernard]] proclaimed the annual Rosicrucian Meditation for Peace Ceremony at the Rosicrucian World Peace Conference (see below). This is held at the Grand Lodge and in affiliated bodies throughout the world on the fourth Sunday of June each year. North American and Caribbean locations are listed on the AMORC English Grand Lodge for the Americas site.
* '''Autumn Equinox Memorial Ceremony''': The annual Memorial Ceremony is held at the Grand Lodge in San Jose and in affiliated bodies throughout the world at the [[Autumn Equinox]] each year. North American and Caribbean locations are listed on the AMORC English Grand Lodge for the Americas site.
* '''Council of Solace Ritual''': The [[Imperator]] and Supreme Board of AMORC recently opened the Council of Solace Ritual, welcoming both members and the public to participate. In North America and the Caribbean, this meditation ceremony is held at the Grand Lodge headquarters in San Jose, and in most Grand Lodges worldwide.

AMORC often organizes various conferences around the world, increasingly having many sessions open to the public, and several councils of experts on various topics. In August 2001 the world convention took place in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]]. The main theme of the convention was world peace and harmony. The convention was of significant importance to Rosicrucian history because Imperator Bernard presented the "Positio Fraternitatis Rosæ Crucis" to inform the public about AMORC's position on the current world situation.

In July 2004 The Rosicrucian World Peace Conference was held in San Jose. Over 2000 Rosicrucians from 70 countries gathered with Imperator [[Christian Bernard]], and North American Grand Master Julie Scott. The Imperator dedicated the [[Rosicrucian Park]]'s newest institution, the Rosicrucian Peace Garden, designed according to examples from Egypt's 18th Dynasty by Grand Master Emeritus of the English Grand Lodge for Australia, New Zealand and Asia, Peter Bindon.

The World Convention for 2007 was held in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] with the theme "Love Will Build the Bridge." All of the events, except for the ritualistic convocations, were open to the Public.

[[Curitiba]], [[Brazil]], the headquarters of the Portuguese Grand Lodge of AMORC, hosted the August 2011 World Convention: The Sacred and the Primordial Tradition.

The International Research Council is a group of AMORC members who have expertise in several areas, including [[physics]], [[biology]], [[philosophy]] and music. According to the AMORC, the members of the International Research Council dedicate themselves to the advancement of their profession for the benefit of humanity.

The Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum will launch a substantial new exhibit on Spiritual and Physical [[Alchemy]] on the [[Spring Equinox]] 2012. It has already become very popular on Facebook prior to opening.

The Rosicrucian Order hosted an academic conference for Scholars and Practitioners of Esotericism at Rosicrucian Park, 22–25 July 2010. The theme for the papers and presentations given by members of many different esoteric groups was the influence of esoteric Orders on the modern world. Several of the papers were to be published in the June 2011 Rose Croix Journal.

The Council of Solace is a group of Rosicrucians who meditate and direct spiritual force for health and harmony daily on behalf of others. They offer free, 24-hour [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] aid to those in need, regardless of membership. Members and the public may by invitation take part in the Council of Solace meditation ritual held in various locations.

The AMORC publishes several publications including a public magazine called the [[Rosicrucian Digest]], an online academic periodical called the ''Rose-Croix Journal'' and a Peace [[e-zine]], as well as books which focus on topics such as [[metaphysics]], [[mysticism]], and [[Egyptology]].

===Rosicrucian Digest===
The Rosicrucian Digest was first published in 1915 under the name ''American Rosae Crucis'', and then ''The Triangle'', ''The Mystic Triangle'' and finally ''The Rosicrucian Digest''. It has been adapted to serve the needs of each period. Beginning with the December 2006 issue (Vol 84:2) the Digest began a series of multimedia thematic issues available online and in print twice a year. The first such issue (December 2006) dealt with [[Atlantis]], while the 2007 volumes covered [[Ancient Egypt]] and The [[Essenes]]. 2008 issues followed with The [[Orphic Mysteries]] and the [[Delphi]], while 2009 issues covered The [[Pythagoreans]] and the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]].

In the [[United Kingdom]] the public magazine is named ''Rosicrucian Beacon'' and is published quarterly by the "English speaking jurisdiction for Europe, Africa and the Middle East of the Rosicrucian Order AMORC." In Australasia the magazine is titled ''The Rosicrucian''. Other AMORC jurisdictions have similar publications.

===Rose+Croix Journal===
AMORC's ''Rose+Croix Journal'' is "an international, interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary, peer-reviewed online journal that focuses on topics that relate to the sciences, history, the arts, mysticism, and spirituality, especially interdisciplinary topics and transdisciplinary inquiries that traverse and lie beyond the limits of different fields of study. These topics may relate to any of the arts and sciences and/or to other emerging fields of human endeavor" (from the ''Rose+Croix Journal's'' About page). The Journal's Website also has a Resources section with the five [[Rosicrucian Manifestos]], ''Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians,'' ''Rosicrucian Documents,'' online editions of the ''Rosicrucian Digest,'' etc. Submissions are solicited from members and the public.

===Peace Consciousness===
In 2007, the English Grand Lodge for the Americas launched a new [[e-zine]], ''Peace Consciousness.org''. It is self-described as providing "both a forum for exchanging ideas related to peace, and for suggesting means at all levels to use in resolving differences between individuals, groups, nations, or even species. We will learn not only where we have common ground, but also learn to celebrate our differences, because those differences provide richness, diversity, and a continual flow of new ideas for us to consider." (from the About page). Submissions of articles and art are solicited from members and the public.

===Multimedia and web presence===
According to AMORC tradition, H. Spencer Lewis received the mandate from the Rosicrucians of [[Toulouse]] when he was initiated in 1909 to make the tradition available and comprehensible to modern women and men.<ref>Christian Rebisse, 161–180.</ref> In accord with this, [[H. Spencer Lewis]], and after him [[Ralph M. Lewis]], used all of the technologies available to them to accomplish their work. An example was the radio station H. Spencer Lewis had broadcasting from his office at the [[Rosicrucian Park]], and before that, at the previous headquarters in Tampa, and [[San Francisco]]. The broadcasting from San Jose began on 15 February 1928 and was delivered by two 30-metre radio towers inside the park. The radio towers have since been removed, though for some time AMORC continued to broadcast through the historic San Jose KEEN radio station. Today, the Order communicates using newer media:

* Websites for all of the international jurisdictions of AMORC now provide instant access to information and resources for members and the public.<ref>[http://www.amorc.org AMORC website]</ref>
* The English Grand Lodge for the Americas began a series of public [[podcasts]] in 2006 and launched Rosicrucian TV on [[YouTube]] in 2009. Topics range include [[mysticism]], [[Egyptology]], [[peace]], [[esotericism]] and other subjects.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* English Grand Lodge for the Americas members enjoy a private community [[social networking]] forum based in the [[Ning (website)]] system.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* [[Facebook]] has rapidly become a major forum for North American AMORC, with over 57,000 likes for its main Facebook page as of October 2013. There are also fan pages for Rosicrucian Park, the [[Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum]], Rose+Croix University Online Classes (including discussions of each issue of the new Rosicrucian Digests), the new Alchemy Exhibit at the Museum, and the Hidden in Plain Sight Conference.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/Rosicrucian.Order.AMORC|Rosicrucian Order AMORC]</ref>
* [[Twitter]] followers receive frequent updates from the Order, the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum and the Rosicrucian Research Library.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The public presence of the Rosicrucians in Western Europe was made known through the publication of three manifestos. AMORC introduced a fourth manifesto, the ''Positio Fraternitatis Rosæ Crucis''<ref name=PFRC>[http://www.rosicrucian.org/publications/positio.pdf Text of ''Positio Fraternitatis Rosæ Crucis'']</ref> at an AMORC convention in Sweden in August 2001. The Positio offers AMORC's observations on problems in the modern world, along with proposed solutions. The Positio closes with an invocation that expresses what it calls "Rosicrucian Utopia":<ref name=PFRC/>
<blockquote>God of all beings, God of all life, In the humanity we are dreaming of:

*Politicians are profoundly humanistic and strive to serve the common good;
*Economists manage state finances with discernment and in the interest of all;
*Scientists are spiritualistic and seek their inspiration in the Book of Nature;
*Artists are inspired and express the beauty and purity of the Divine Plan in their works;
*Physicians are motivated by love for their fellow-beings and treat both the soul and the body;
*Misery and poverty have vanished, for everyone has what one needs to live happily;
*Work is not regarded as a chore; it is looked at as a source of growth and well-being;
*Nature is considered to be the most beautiful temple of all, and animals are considered to be our brothers and sisters on the path of evolution;
*A World Government composed of the leaders of all nations, working in the interest of all humanity, has come into existence.
*Spirituality is an ideal and a way of life, which springs forth from a Universal Religion, founded more upon the knowledge of divine laws than upon the belief in God;
*Human relations are founded upon love, friendship, and community, so that the whole world lives in peace and harmony.</blockquote>

'''CRAM''', or '''Card Random Access Memory''', model 353-1, was a [[data storage device]] invented by [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], which first appeared on their model [[NCR-315]] [[mainframe computer]] in 1962. It was also available for NCR's third generation [[NCR Century 100|NCR Century]] series as the NCR/653-100. 

A CRAM cartridge contained 256 3x14 inch cards with a [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] magnetic recording surface. Each "deck" of cards could contain up to 5.5 MB of alphanumeric characters. The cards were ingeniously suspended from eight d-section rods, which were selectively rotated to release a specific card, each card having a unique pattern of notches at one end. The selected card was dropped and wrapped around a rotating drum to be read or written. Each cartridge could store 5.5&nbsp;MB.  

Later versions of the CRAM, the 353-2 and 353-3, used decks of 512 cards, thus doubling the storage capacity of each unit.  

Each card contains seven tracks containing 1550 [[slab (NCR)|slab]]s (12 bits each). Normally the track was initialized with a four slab header containing the cartridge number (two slabs), the card number and the track number. 
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:NCR-CRAM_rods-small.jpg|thumb|Eight Control Rods and two Relase Rods]]  -->

Cards were dropped by changing the card rods to a binary configuration and release the two outside "release" rods.  Air was blown over the top of the cards to keep them separated, and to increase the dropping speed. Once on the rotating "drum" a series of positive and negative air pressure chambers pulled the card across a magnetic read-write head. After one or more passes over the head, where data is written to or read from the card, a release gate allow the card to be "thrown" along a raceway over the card deck, and onto a "loader" mechanism.  The loader used a group of electro-magnetic solenoids to slam the card back onto the control rods.  The unit was a monster with two large electric motors that drove four large vacuum/blowers.  It was possible to have up to five cards in motion at any point in time; one dropping, one on the drum, two in the return transport, and one being loaded back onto the deck.

If the card didn't succeed in dropping there was a "magic wand" similar to a pencil available to solve the problem. 
 
One feature of this device was the potential for a "double drop", where two cards would drop at once, due to a break in a notch on one card, or, more commonly, a card being held by one rod being dislodged by the adjacent card dropping, usually cards 000 (the deck directory card) and 001 which resulted in the necessity of recreating the directory. This would result in a high pitched noise with which operators were very familiar and could hear even outside the computer room, and damage to the cards.

Another interesting feature was that, should an operator accidentally drop all the cards from a cartridge, they could be replaced without worrying about order. The order of the cards was not important because of the notch encoding system.

CRAM was very successful in the 1960s, offering a fast and secure storage alternative to [[magnetic tape]], but was superseded by the development of superior [[disk drive]] technology.

'''Robert Recorde''' (ca. 1512–1558) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] physician and mathematician. He invented the [[equals sign|"equals" sign (=)]] and also introduced the pre-existing [[plus and minus signs|"plus" sign (+)]] to English speakers in 1557.<ref name=ODNB>{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=Johnston|title=Recorde, Robert (c.1512–1558)|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23241|accessdate=26 January 2012|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/23241}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref>

==Biography==
A member of a respectable family of [[Tenby]], [[Wales]], born in 1512,<ref name=ODNB/> Recorde entered the [[University of Oxford]] about 1525, and was elected a fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] there in 1531. Having adopted medicine as a profession, he went to the [[University of Cambridge]] to take the degree of M.D. in 1545. He afterwards returned to Oxford, where he publicly taught mathematics, as he had done prior to going to Cambridge. It appears that he afterwards went to London, and acted as physician to King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and to [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]], to whom some of his books are dedicated. He was also controller of the [[Royal Mint]] and served as "Comptroller of Mines and Monies" in Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|last=Newman|first=James R.|year=1956|title=The World of Mathematics}}</ref> After being sued for defamation by a political enemy, he was arrested for debt and died in the [[King's Bench Prison]], [[Southwark]], by the middle of June in 1558.

[[Image:Recorde - The Whetstone of Witte - equals.jpg|thumb|200px|Recorde's introduction of "="]]

Recorde published several works upon mathematical subjects, chiefly in the form of dialogue between master and scholar, such as the following:
*''[[The Ground of Arts|The Grounde of Artes]], teachings the Worke and Practise, of Arithmeticke, both in whole numbers and fractions'' (1543),<ref name=ODNB/> the first English book on [[algebra]].
*''The Pathway to Knowledge, containing the First Principles of Geometry ... bothe for the use of Instrumentes Geometricall and Astronomicall, and also for Projection of Plattes'' (London, 1551)
*''The Castle of Knowledge, containing the Explication of the Sphere both Celestiall and Materiall, etc.'' (London, 1556) A book explaining [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic astronomy]] while mentioning the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican heliocentric model]] in passing. 
*''[[The Whetstone of Witte]], whiche is the seconde parte of Arithmeteke: containing the extraction of rootes; the cossike practise, with the rule of equation; and the workes of Surde Nombers'' (London, 1557). This was the book in which the [[equals sign]] was introduced. With the publication of this book Recorde is credited with introducing [[algebra]] into England.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jourdain|first=Philip E. B.|year=1913|title=The Nature of Mathematics}}</ref>
*a medical work, ''The Urinal of Physick'' (1548), frequently reprinted.<ref>[http://books.google.ca/books/about/The_urinal_of_physick.html?id=Sax491XagIgC&redir_esc=y ''The Urinal of Physick], by Robert Recorde, 1548; at [[Google Books]]</ref>

Sherburne states that Recorde also published ''Cosmographiae isagoge'', and that he wrote a book ''De Arte faciendi Horologium'' and another ''De Usu Globorum et de Statu temporum''. Recorde's chief contributions to the progress of algebra were in the way of systematising its notation.

==Crankshaft angle==
Straight-three engines generally employ a crank angle of 120°. 120° cranks are rotationally balanced; however, since the cylinder fires "one after the other" 1-2-3 (or 1-3-2) the firing pulses have a tendency to induce an end-to end rocking motion. The use of a [[balance shaft]] helps this.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inline 3-cylinder engines|url=http://www.autozine.org/technical_school/engine/smooth1.htm#Inline%203-cylinder%20engines|work=Mark Wan - AutoZine Technical School|publisher=AutoZine.org|accessdate=3 January 2010}}</ref>

An inline three cylinder engine with 180° [[crankshaft]] can be found in early examples of the [[Laverda Jota]] motorcycle made by Italian manufacturer [[Laverda]]. In these engines, the outer pistons rise and fall together like a 360° [[straight-two engine]]. The inner cylinder is offset 180° from the outer cylinders. In these engines, cylinder number one fires, then 180° later cylinder number two fires, and then 180° later cylinder number three fires. There is no power stroke on the final 180° of rotation. This unusual crank angle came to be due to lack of proper tooling at the factory, which also made [[Straight-twin engine|vertical twin]] engines which also utilizes a 180° crankshaft.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} After 1982, this engine had the regular 120° crank angle.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Inline three-cylinder engines are not limited to propelling [[motor vehicle]]s.  The may also be used in general industrial applications.  An example is the [[Fairbanks-Morse]] 32E14 slow-speed diesel engine which is shown coupled to a water pump.

===Agricultural use===
Inline three engines are very common in diesel engined [[tractor]]s, as well as other agricultural machinery. Nearly all manufacturers of diesel tractors have had models with three-cylinder engines. Perhaps the best known example of any kind of three-cylinder diesel engine is the [[Perkins Engines|Perkins]] AD3.152 that was used in [[Massey Ferguson]] 35 tractors, as well as in [[Fordson]] Dexta and several other tractors. This engine was also used for marine and stationary applications.

'''Wilhelm Xylander''' (born '''Wilhelm Holtzman''', graecized to Xylander) (26 December 1532 – 10 February 1576) was a [[Germany|German]] classical scholar and humanist.

Born at [[Augsburg]], he studied at [[university of Tübingen|Tübingen]], and in 1558, when very short of money (caused, according to some, by his intemperate habits), he was appointed to succeed [[Jacob Micyllus|Jakob Micyllus]] in the professorship of [[Greek language|Greek]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]]; he exchanged it for a chair of [[logic]] (''publicus organi Aristotelici interpres'') in 1562.

In Heidelberg church and university politics, Xylander was a close partisan of [[Thomas Erastus]].{{Citation needed|reason=Claim not in EB1911|date=August 2014}}

Xylander was the author of a number of important works, including [[Latin]] translations of [[Dio Cassius]] (1558), [[Plutarch]] (1560–1570) and [[Strabo]] (1571). He also edited (1568) the geographical [[lexicon]] of [[Stephanus of Byzantium]]; the travels of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (completed after his death by [[Friedrich Sylburg]], 1583); the ''[[Meditations]]'' of [[Marcus Aurelius]] (1558, the ''[[editio princeps]]'' based on a Heidelberg manuscript now lost; a second edition in 1568 with the addition of [[Antoninus Liberalis]], [[Phlegon of Tralles]], an unknown [[Apollonius (disambiguation)|Apollonius]], and [[Antigonus of Carystus]]—all [[Paradoxography|paradoxographers]]); and the chronicle of [[George Cedrenus]] (1566). He translated the first six books of [[Euclid]] into [[German language|German]] with notes, the ''Arithmetica'' of [[Diophantus]], and the ''De quattuor mathematicis scientiis'' of [[Michael Psellus]] into Latin.

'''Antoninus Liberalis''' ({{lang-el|????????? ?????????}}) was an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[grammar]]ian who probably flourished between AD 100 and 300.

His only surviving work is the ''Metamorphoses'' (????????????? ????????, ''Metamorphoseon Synagoge'', literally "Collection of Transformations"), a collection of forty-one very briefly summarised tales about mythical metamorphoses effected by offended deities, unique in that they are couched in prose, not verse. The literary genre of myths of transformations of men and women, heroes and nymphs, into stars (see ''[[Catasterismi]]''), plants and animals, or springs,  rocks and mountains, were widespread and popular in the classical world. This work has more polished parallels in the better-known ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' of [[Ovid]] and in the ''[[The Golden Ass|Metamorphoses]]'' of [[Lucius Apuleius]]. Like them, its sources, where they can be traced, are [[Hellenistic]] works, such as [[Nicander]]'s ''Heteroeumena'' and  ''Ornithogonia'' ascribed to [[Boios]].<ref>Timothy Renner, "A Papyrus Dictionary of Metamorphoses,", ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' (1978:278); many of Antoninus Liberalis' transformations are also into birds.</ref>

The work survives in a single manuscript, of the later 9th century, now in the [[Palatine Library]] in [[Heidelberg]]; it contains several works. [[John Stojkovi?]] brought it to the Dominican convent at [[Basel]] about 1437; in 1553, [[Hieronymus Froeben]] gave it to [[Otto Henry, Elector Palatine]] who gave it to the Library. In 1623, with the rest of the Palatine Library, it was taken to Rome; in 1798, to Paris, as part of Napoleonic plunder under the terms of the [[Treaty of Tolentino]]; in 1816, it was restored to Heidelberg.<ref>Heidelberg al. gr. 398.</ref> 

[[Guilielmus Xylander]] printed the text in 1598; since some leaves have since disappeared, his edition is also a necessary authority for the text.   

Many of the transformations in this compilation are found nowhere else, and some may simply be inventions of Antoninus. The manner of the narrative is a laconic and conversational prose: "this completely inartistic text," as Sarah Myers called it,<ref>Myers, University of Michigan, reviewing Celoria's translation in ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'', 1994 ([http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/1994/94.01.03.html on-line text]).</ref> offers the briefest summaries of lost metamorphoses by more ambitious writers, such as [[Nicander]] and [[Boios|Boeus]]. [[Francis Celoria]], the translator, regards the text as perfectly acceptable ''[[koine]]'' Greek, though with numerous ''[[hapax legomena]]''; it is "grimly simple" and mostly devoid of [[particle (grammar)|grammatical particle]]s which would convey humor or a narratorial persona.<ref>Celoria, ''The Metamorphoses of Antoninus Liberalis'', 2.</ref>

His chief work was the ''Olympiads'', an historical compendium in sixteen books, from the 1st down to the 229th [[Olympiad]] (776 BC to [[137|AD 137]]), of which several chapters are preserved in [[Eusebius]]' ''Chronicle'', [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] and [[George Syncellus]].

Two short works by him are extant:
*''On Marvels'', a [[Paradoxography|paradoxographical]] work containing stories about [[ghost]]s, [[prophecy|prophecies]] by heads, monstrous births (Siamese twins), hemaphrodites and giant skeletons.
*''On Long-lived Persons'', a list of Italians who had passed the age of 100, taken from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[census]]es.

Other works ascribed to Phlegon in the [[Suda]] are a description of [[Sicily]], a work on the Roman festivals in three books, and a topography of [[Rome]]:

::"Phlegon of Tralles, freedman of Augustus Caesar, but some say of Hadrian: historian. He wrote Olympiads in 16 books. Up to the 229th Olympiad they contain what was done everywhere. And these in 8 books: ''Description of Sicily''; ''On long-lived and marvelous persons'', ''On the feasts of the Romans'' 3 books, ''On the places in Rome and by what names they are called'', ''Epitome of Olympic victors'' in 2 books, and other things.

::"Of this Phlegon, as [[Philostorgius]] says, to relate fully in detail what befell with the Jews, while Phlegon and Dio mentioned [these events] briefly and made them an appendix to their own narrative. Since this man does not exhibit at all prudently those who would lead to piety and other virtues, as those others do not either. Josephus, on the contrary, is like one who fears and takes care not to offend the [sc.pagan] Greeks."{{Clarify|date=May 2013}}

'''Trat''' ({{lang-th|????}}, {{IPA-th|trà?t|pron}}) is a [[Provinces of Thailand|province]] (''changwat'') of [[Thailand]]. It is located in the east of Thailand, and has borders with [[Chanthaburi Province]] to the northwest, [[Cambodia]] to the east, and the [[Gulf of Thailand]] to the south.

Trat is most famous for [[gemstone]] mining and trading.

==History==
The history of Trat can be traced back to early 17th century during the reign of King [[Prasat Thong]] of the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]]. Formerly known as ''Mueang Thung Yai'', Trat has played an important role in the development of country’s stability and economy due to its strategic location. The town of Trat later become a community of Chinese Merchants.

After the fall of Ayutthaya to the Burmese in 1767, Trat served as a checkpoint and buffer city and was responsible for providing provisions to King [[Taksin]] the Great before he moved his forces from [[Chanthaburi town|Chanthaburi]] to [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]]. King Taksin then succeeded in driving out the [[Demographics of Burma|Burmese]] invaders and liberated the Kingdom from foreign rule.

[[Image:OccupationOfTrat1904.jpg|thumb|left|Occupation of Trat by French troops in 1904.]]
In the Rattanakosin era, during the [[Paknam crisis]] in 1893, French troops landed and occupied the western part of Chantaburi province. In 1904, Siam was forced to surrender Trat to [[French Indochina]] in order to regain Chantaburi. Three years later, however, finding that Trat with its almost entirely Thai population was hard to rule, the French returned Trat to Thailand on March 23, 1907, in exchange for larger areas along the [[Mekong]] river, which included [[Battambang Province|Battambang]], [[Siam Nakhon Province|Siam Nakhon]] and [[Banteay Meanchey|Sisophon]], which all have a [[Northern Khmer people|Khmer]] majority population.

During the [[French-Thai War]] of 1940-41, the Navy of the [[Vichy France]] government in Indo-China sailed from [[Saigon]] and attempted to seize Trat. The unprepared Thai warships were caught by surprise. Despite fighting valiantly, by the end of the 17 January battle at [[Ko Chang]], three Thai ships had been left sinking - the HTMS Chonburi, HTMS Songkhla and HTMS Thonburi. French casualties were light with no ships lost. The Japanese government negotiated a truce, which ended the conflict without further fighting.

==Geography==

The [[Cardamom Mountains|Cardamom mountain range]] forms the boundary to Cambodia in the east of the province, where Trat has borders with three Cambodian provinces: [[Battambang Province|Battambang]], [[Pursat Province|Pursat]] and [[Koh Kong Province|Koh Kong]].

The third biggest [[island]] of Thailand is the province's Ko Chang, [after [[Phuket]] and [[Ko Samui]]]. The island, together with more than 40 surrounding smaller islands, forms the Mu Ko Chang Marine [[List of national parks of Thailand|National Park]].

Other islands of the province include: [[Ko Kham]], [[Ko Mak]], [[Ko Phi]].

*'''''Wat Buppharam (???????????) or Wat Plai Khlong (???????????)''''' It is the province’s oldest temple built around the reign of King Prasat Thong (1648 A.D.). Lately, a temple museum was established and the temple’s landscape has been well tidied, so it has become a local religious centre.  
*'''''Wat Yotha Nimit (?????????????)''''', also known as Wat Bot (????????), is the only royal temple in Trat. The temple was once used as a place to hold the oath of allegiance ceremony. There is an old ordination hall of Ayutthayan art serving as a Wihan called Wihan Yotha Nimit for storing many antiques. 
*'''''City Pillar Shrine (???????????????????)''''' It is different from other city pillar shrines because of its form as a Chinese pavilion. Every year on the sixth night of the waxing moon period of the sixth lunar month, there is a celebration called, Phli Mueang Day (??????????????) or known among the Chinese as '''''Xia Gong Sae Yit (???????????????)''''' which means the birthday of the City Pillar God. 
*'''''Wat Phai Lom (??????????)''''' It used to be a resident of Trat’s Father of Education–Than Chaokhun Phra Wimonmethachan Worayannurak. The temple also houses a Buddhist garden for public meditation and Chedi museum of three much revered monks of Trat. 
*'''''Residang Kampot (??????????????????? ??????)''''' a former residence now used as the Office of Probation, Department of Corrections, still in its original architectural style. 
*'''''Laem Sok (???????)''''' was used as the residence of Kromluang Chomphonkhetudomsak, the father of Thai Royal Navel Army. Fishermen villages are found near the area. 
*'''''Wat Khiri Wihan (????????????)''''' The temple features fine architecture with a blend of modern art. Principal buildings inside the temple’s precincts include a large Phra Ubosot or ordination hall, Phra Chedi, reception pavilion for HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, monk’s residence, preaching hall, and Chinese pavilion enshrining Phra Phuttha Udom Sombun, Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, and Phra Sangkatchai.
*'''''Laem Klat (????????)''''': A white sandy beach sticking out into the sea with not too deep water ideal for swimming. 
*'''''Wat Saphan Hin (???????????)''''' Although it is unknown when the temple was built, it is assumed to be more than a hundred years old. There is an old Buddhist ordination hall in the water, approximately 1&nbsp;km. from the temple.
*'''''Hat Sai Ngam (??????????)''''' an approximately 200-metre long white sandy beach running parallel to a grove of pine trees.	
*'''''Hat Sai Ngoen (???????????)''''' a not-so-wide beach with a pine forest more ideal for relaxing or fishing than swimming. 
*'''''Hat Muk Kaeo and Hat Sai Kaeo (?????????? ??????????????)''''' have a peaceful atmosphere for recreation. Hat Muk Kaeo is a white sandy beach, which lies along from Hat Sai Ngoen to Hat Sai Kaeo, with the shade of pine and coconut trees all along the beach. 
*'''''Ratchakarun Thai Red Cross Association’s Khao Lan Center (??????????????? ??????????? ???????)''''' Her Majesty the Queen ordered to establish to help Cambodian refugees. However, the center was closed in 1986 since all the refugees returned to their homeland.

'''''Dance of Death''''' is the thirteenth studio album by British [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden]], released first in Japan on 2 September and then 8 September 2003 in the rest of the world excluding North America (where it was released a day later). The album was recorded on magnetic (analogue) tape.<ref name="dotr"/>

Their second studio release since the return of vocalist [[Bruce Dickinson]] and guitarist [[Adrian Smith]] in 1999, the album features the band's first ever fully acoustic track, "Journeyman", as well as their only song co-written by drummer [[Nicko McBrain]], "New Frontier". As with its predecessor, 2000's ''[[Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)|Brave New World]]'', the record was produced by [[Kevin Shirley]], who has worked with Iron Maiden on all subsequent releases.

==Background==
The band first confirmed that they would be working on a follow-up to 2000's ''Brave New World'' with producer [[Kevin Shirley]] on 27 November 2002, announced alongside a small set of European tour dates for the following year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-announce-european-dates/ |title=Iron Maiden announce 2003 European dates |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=28 November 2002 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref> On 6 January 2003, Shirley confirmed via his website that the band would begin recording that month,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/producer-iron-maiden-to-begin-recording-this-month/ |title=Iron Maiden To Begin Recording This Month |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=6 January 2003 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref> followed by the announcement that the basic tracks had been completed on 5 February<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-complete-basic-tracks-for-new-cd/ |title=Iron Maiden Complete Basic Tracks for New CD |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=5 February 2003 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref> and that the release was to be mixed in April.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-to-begin-mixing-in-april/ |title=Iron Maiden to Begin Mixing in April |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=21 February 2003 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref> On 31 May, the band announced that the album, recorded at [[Sarm West Studios]], would be entitled ''Dance of Death'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-new-album-details-unveiled/ |title=Iron Maiden: New Album Details Unveiled |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=1 June 2003 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref> after which the release date was issued on 17 June.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-to-tour-europe-in-the-fall/ |title=Iron Maiden Announce European Tour and Release Date |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=29 June 2003 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref>

The band undertook the [[Dance of Death World Tour]] in support of the album, which included many theatrical elements inspired by the record's songs. During "Dance of Death", Bruce Dickinson would wear theatrical masks and a cape while moving around the stage; at the end he would dress as the [[Grim Reaper]] for the final chorus.<ref name="Wall380"/> During "Paschendale", Dickinson would wear a traditional British Infantryman trench coat and helmet (although he revealed in the ''Death on the Road'' documentary that it was actually Hungarian),<ref name="dotr">{{cite video |date=6 February 2006 |title=[[Death on the Road]] |chapter=Documentary |medium=DVD |publisher=[[EMI]]}}</ref> as worn during World War I, and the set would be decorated with barbed wire.<ref name="Wall380">{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=380 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}</ref> The tour led to a live album and DVD, entitled ''[[Death on the Road]]'', released in 2005 and 2006.

The [[computer generated imagery|computer-generated]] cover art was provided by David Patchett,<ref name= "patchett">{{cite book | last1 = Iron Maiden  |authorlink1=Iron Maiden| title = [[From Fear to Eternity (album)|From Fear to Eternity]] Booklet | chapter = Album List: ''Dance of Death'' | publisher = [[EMI]]| date = 6 June 2011}}</ref> who allegedly asked for his name to be removed from the album's credits after the band decided to use an unfinished version,<ref>{{cite web |last=Porter |first=Tom |title=Iron Maiden: a gruesome history of graphic artwork |url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/iron-maiden-a-gruesome-history-of-graphic-artwork-248809/61 |publisher=[[MusicRadar]] |accessdate=2 March 2013 |date=22 July 2010}}</ref> which was received negatively.<ref name= "SputnikMusic"/>

==Songs==
[[File:Nicko McBrain 30nov2006.jpg|thumb|195px|left|Drummer [[Nicko McBrain]] made his song writing debut on ''Dance of Death''.]]
''Dance of Death'' is the only Iron Maiden album to date in which drummer [[Nicko McBrain]] has a songwriting credit, having co-written "New Frontier."<ref name="Wall374"/> As a born-again Christian, the track expresses his concerns with human cloning, stating, "I personally believe that God created man and it's only God's right to create a human being because only He can give you a soul. When man attempts to make man then it's a monster in a test tube."<ref name="Wall374"/> This also makes it the only Iron Maiden album to date in which every member of the band receives a song-writing credit.

"Montségur" was based on the fall of the [[Catharism|Cathar]] stronghold [[Montségur|of the same name]], which fell during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in 1244.<ref name="Wall373">{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=373 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}</ref> Dickinson, who wrote the song's lyrics, states, "There is so much great stuff and so many great stories throughout history that you can make parallels with the modern day – particularly when history repeats itself as often as it does – that it makes for some very colourful subject matter."<ref name="Wall373"/>

"Paschendale" is about the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] which took place during the [[World War I|First World War]]. It was written by [[Adrian Smith]], who usually contributes to the band's shorter, more "commercial" songs, but decided to write what he describes as "a traditional Maiden epic."<ref name="Wall375">{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=375 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}</ref> It features strong [[progressive rock]] elements, including its length, detailed structure, and multiple tempo changes throughout the song. Dickinson comments, "the beauty of 'Paschendale' isn't in the epic-ness of the song – although you have to admit it is a powerful and stirring body of music – but the detail."<ref name="Wall375"/> In live performances, Dickinson introduces the song with a passage from [[Wilfred Owen]]'s "[[Anthem for Doomed Youth]]".<ref name="Wall380"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Iain|title=From Achilles to Alexander: The Classical World and the World of Metal|journal=Heavy Metal Music in Britain|date=March 2009|page=118|editor1-first=Gerd|editor1-last=Bayer|location=London|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]}}</ref>
[[File:Iron Maiden Newcastle, July 23rd 2011.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Iron Maiden performing "Dance of Death" in 2011.]]
According to guitarist [[Janick Gers]], the album's title track was inspired by the final scene of [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'', at the end of which "these figures on the horizon start doing a little jig, which is the dance of death."<ref name="Wall373">{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=373 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}</ref> Gers wrote most of the music and explained the concept to [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]], who wrote the lyrics and most of the melodies.<ref name="Wall374">{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=374 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}</ref>

"Face in the Sand" is based on the media coverage surrounding the [[Iraq War]], taking place as the album was being recorded.<ref name="Wall376"/> Dickinson explains, "I remember thinking about the desert sands as an image and how it moves and shifts with time. Specifically what I was thinking was that whatever empires you tend to build – whether they are British, American, Iraqi or whatever, they'll all crumble and fade away into something else. So, to my mind at least, the best thing you can hope for, if you were to leave anything behind, is just an imprint in the sand."<ref name="Wall376"/> The song is notable for being the first and only Iron Maiden track in which McBrain uses a [[Double bass drumming#Double bass drum|double bass pedal]].<ref name="Wall375">{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=375 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}</ref>

The final track, "Journeyman", is Iron Maiden's first and only fully [[acoustic music|acoustic]] song. According to Dickinson on the ''Death on the Road'' live album, it is about "the whole process of writing and being a musician,"<ref>{{cite video |date=6 February 2006 |title=[[Death on the Road]] |chapter=Journeyman |medium=DVD |publisher=[[EMI]]}}</ref> although [[Mick Wall]] describes it as "a wistful tale of ''[[carpe diem]]''."<ref name="Wall376">{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=376 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}</ref> The song was originally recorded with electric instruments, however, as Dickinson states, "after all the battering that we've given the listener over the last hour of music it just seemed right to play out with something totally unexpected and left field."<ref name="Wall376"/> The original version appears on the ''[[No More Lies (EP)|No More Lies]]'' EP.

The '''Mayor of Chicago''' is the [[Chief executive officer|chief executive]] of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], the third-largest city in the United States. He or she is charged with directing city departments and agencies, and with the advice and consent of the [[Chicago City Council]], appoints department and agency leaders.

==Appointment powers==
The mayor appoints the Commissioner of the [[Chicago Fire Department]] and Superintendent of the [[Chicago Police Department]]. He or she is also appoints the heads of city departments, the largest of which are the Water Management Department (formed by the consolidation of the former Water Department and Sewer Department under Richard M. Daley) and the Streets & Sanitation Department. He or she also appoints members to the boards of several special-purpose governmental bodies including the [[Chicago Park District]], [[Chicago Public Library]], [[Chicago Housing Authority]], [[Chicago Transit Authority]], and the [[Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority]]. Under [[Richard M. Daley]], the [[Illinois General Assembly|Illinois legislature]] granted the mayor power to appoint the governing board and chief executive officer of the [[Chicago Public Schools]] and subordinated the district to the mayor; the district had long been an independent unit of government.

The Chicago City Clerk and City Treasurer are elected separately, as are the 50 aldermen who form the City Council. The mayor is empowered, however, to fill vacancies in any of these 52 elected offices by appointment. In turn, the City Council elects one of its own to fill a mayoral vacancy.

==Election==
The Mayor of Chicago is elected by popular vote every four years, on the last Tuesday in February. A run-off election, in the event that no candidate garners more than fifty percent of the vote, is held on the first Tuesday in April. The election is held on a non-partisan basis. Chicago is the largest city in the United States not to [[term limit|limit the term]] of service for its mayor.

==History==
{{main|Political history of Chicago}}
The first mayor was [[William Butler Ogden]]. Two sets of father and son have been elected Mayor of Chicago: [[Carter Harrison, Sr.]] and [[Carter Harrison, Jr.]] as well as [[Richard J. Daley]] and [[Richard M. Daley]]. Carter Harrison, Jr. was the first mayor to have been born within city limits. The first, and only woman to hold the office was [[Jane Byrne]]. The first black mayor was [[Harold Washington]]. As an interim mayor, [[David Duvall Orr]] had the shortest mayoral term. Richard M. Daley was originally elected in 1989 and re-elected for the sixth time in 2007. In September 2010, Daley announced that he would not seek reelection for a seventh term as mayor. On December 26, 2010, Daley became Chicago's longest-serving mayor, surpassing his father's record.<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ilKvZ_-QeQYYesyxYOrMxElWJQcA?docId=a29f3a05d0b5405e8e446c86c6e89c3f "Daley now Chicago mayor 1 day longer than father"] [[Associated Press]] December 26, 2010</ref> [[Rahm Emanuel]] is the current mayor, having won the 2011 election with 55% of the vote to 25% for his closest opponent, [[Gery Chico]]. Emanuel was sworn in on May 16, 2011.

By charter, Chicago has a "weak-mayor" system, in which most of the power is vested in the city council. In practice, however, the mayor of Chicago has long been one of the most powerful municipal chief executives in the nation.  Unlike mayors in most other weak-mayor systems, he has the power to draw up the budget.  Before the mayor's office became officially nonpartisan, he was the de facto leader of the city's Democratic Party, and had great influence over the ward organizations.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/532.html</ref>

==List of mayors==
The mayoral term in Chicago was one year from 1837 through 1863, when it was increased to two years. In 1907, it was lengthened to four years, the present duration. Until 1861, municipal elections were held in March. In that year, legislation moved them to April. In 1869, however, election day was changed to November, and terms expiring in April of that year were lengthened. In 1875, election day was moved back to April by the city's vote to operate under the [[Cities and Villages Act of 1872]].

<sup>1</sup> Since 1999, mayoral elections have officially been nonpartisan.  A 1995 Illinois law stipulated that "candidates for mayor . . . no longer would run under party labels in Chicago."  However, both Richard M. Daley and Rahm Emanuel are known to be Democrats.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gov.

'''Manchester Victoria railway station''' in [[Manchester]], England is the city's second largest mainline railway station and one of eight [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink tram]] stations within the city zone. It lies to the north of the city centre on Hunts Bank, close to [[Manchester Cathedral]].

The station largely serves destinations north and east of Manchester, with some trains to [[Liverpool]], mostly on the original [[Manchester and Liverpool Railway|Liverpool to Manchester line]]. Victoria is the second busiest station in the [[Manchester station group]] after [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Piccadilly]]. Most trains calling at Victoria are operated by [[Northern Rail]], except during engineering works, when some trains are diverted from [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Manchester Piccadilly]]. In 2009, Victoria was voted the worst railway station in the United Kingdom, in particular due to its leaky roof.<ref>{{cite news |title= Is Victoria UK's worst station? |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8364000/8364598.stm |work= BBC News |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=2014-01-19}}</ref> 

The line to [[Bury]] was converted to light-rail operation in the early 1990s when the Metrolink tram system was created, the trams switching to on-street running once they emerge from Victoria Station, and continuing southwards through the city centre either to Piccadilly Station, Altrincham or East Didsbury. In February 2013 rail routes on the [[Manchester to Rochdale via Oldham Line|Victoria to Rochdale via Oldham line]] were converted to light rail and services extended to Rochdale. It is one of the largest stations in the North of England to be managed by Northern Rail. As part of the [[Northern Hub]] plan, Manchester Victoria will become the rail hub for trans-Pennine services when the [[Ordsall Chord]] is completed in 2018, when passenger numbers are expected to rise to 12 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=Manchester Victoria Station redevelopment |url= http://www.networkrail.co.uk/Manchester_Victoria_station_redevelopment.aspx |publisher= Network Rail |accessdate=2013-04-06}}</ref>

A two-year £44 million modernisation programme including a new [[ETFE]] roof began in April 2013.<ref>{{cite news |title=Manchester Victoria station's restoration works start |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-22069010 |work=BBC News |date=9 April 2013 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}</ref> The upgrade works entailed electrification of lines through the station, a new Metrolink station with an additional platform, restoration of listed features, upgraded retail units and a state of the art roof.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Engineering work at Manchester Victoria stops trains |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-24954232 |work=BBC News |date=15 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Manchester Victoria Metrolink station closes for upgrade |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-26295791 |work=BBC News |date=2014-05-02 |accessdate=2014-05-02}}</ref> Installation of the new £17 million roof commenced on 4 May 2014 with the fifteenth and final roof beam being lifted on 13 October 2014. Installation of the ETFE sheeting is expected to be fully complete by the end of 2014 and all upgrade work on the station is expected to be complete by spring 2015.

In 1838 [[Samuel Brooks]], vice-chairman of the [[Manchester and Leeds Railway]] (M&LR) bought land at Hunt's Bank close to the cathedral and presented it to the company for a station to replace the inconveniently located [[Manchester Oldham Road railway station]] opened by the company on 3 July 1839. The station was initially a long, low single-storey building designed by [[George Stephenson]] and completed by [[John Brogden (industrialist)|John Brogden]]<ref>{{cite book  | first = J.D. | last = Marshall | title = The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, volume 1 | publisher = [[David and Charles]] | year = 1970 | page = 56  | isbn = 0-7153-4352-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book  | first = Jeffrey | last = Wells | title = The Eleven Towns Railway | publisher = [[Railway and Canal Historical Society]] | year = 2000 | page = 74  }}</ref> on 1 January 1844. It was named Victoria by permission of [[Queen Victoria|Her Majesty]]. The long single platform handled M&LR trains to Leeds and elsewhere at its eastern end. The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] extended its line from Ordsall, near the original Manchester Liverpool Road railway station, and its trains operated from Victoria's western end from 4 May 1844.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ferneyhough|1980|p=105}}</ref>

By the mid-1840s six railway companies operated from the station connecting Manchester to London, [[Glasgow]], [[Liverpool]], [[Leeds]] and [[Sheffield]]. Victoria Station came to dominate the Long Millgate area and was one of the biggest passenger stations in Britain.

[[File:Manchester Victoria station 19-10-2009 12-20-16.JPG|thumb|right|Overlooking the station concourse in 2012 before re-development in 2014.]]
Victoria was enlarged by William Dawes, who is responsible for most of the remaining facade, in 1909.  The enlarged building was erected on land consecrated as a burial ground <!-- Walker's Croft -->on 1&nbsp;January 1815 by the Bishop of Chester; this land was acquired by the Manchester and Leeds Railway in 1844.<ref>{{Harvnb|Axon|1886|p=147}}</ref>  It was enlarged to 17 platforms. Wealthy commuters travelled from [[Blackpool]] and [[Southport]] rather faster than is possible today (e.g. 45 minutes from Southport in 1910, 67 today; and 65 minutes from Blackpool in 1910, 77 today) in specially-constructed club cars hauled by express steam locomotives. These non-stop services were abandoned in the early 1960s.

The [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] building has a {{convert|160|yd|m|0}} facade, which carries an iron and glass canopy bearing the names of the original destinations served, and a tile [[mural]] depicting the routes of the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]], which operated most of the trains from the station between 1847 and 1923, when it became one of the main constituents of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]]. Canopies covered the waiting area for taxi cabs until they were damaged in the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] [[1996 Manchester City Centre bombing|1996 bombing]]. They have been restored. The cast-iron train sheds behind the façade are {{convert|700|yd|m|-1}} long. Initially the station was approached by a wooden footbridge over the [[River Irk]], which has subsequently disappeared beneath culverting alongside the cathedral.

From 1884, Victoria Station was adjacent to [[Manchester Exchange railway station|Manchester Exchange Station]], operated by the rival [[London and North Western Railway]], and, from 1929, a single passenger platform which linked the stations was the longest passenger platform in Europe at {{convert|2194|ft|m|0}}. Exchange Station closed in 1969 and its services were transferred to Victoria. Its site opposite the cathedral is now a car park. Platforms 1–3 at Victoria were also closed.

In the early 1970s, as part of the [[Picc-Vic tunnel]] project, there were proposals to build an underground station, Victoria Low Level.<ref name="piccvic-leaflet">{{Cite document |date=October 1971 |title=SELNEC Picc-Vic Line |publisher=SELNEC PTE |ref=harv }} publicity brochure</ref> The project was cancelled, and subsequent rail improvements concentrated on surface projects and the introduction of [[Manchester Metrolink|light rail]]. The station received Grade II [[listed building]] status in 1988 for its period features and neo-Baroque Edwardian facade, ticketing hall, Victorian dome, tiled map of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and a memorial for servicemen who did return after World War I.<ref>{{NHLE |num= 1254725|desc= Victoria Station including concourse to rear with restaurant and booking hall |accessdate=5 April 2013 |separator= , |postscript=}}</ref>

The [[Manchester Arena]] was joined to the station between 1992 and 1996 by means of a raft above the through rail platforms. It is accessed via stairs on Hunts Bank and from the station concourse. During construction of the arena, the station was reduced in size from 14 platforms to 6. Most through tracks were removed, along with former platforms 12—17 and their overall roof and platform buildings.

== National Rail services ==
[[File:Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway map at Victoria Station.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Tiled Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway map at Victoria Station.]]

Manchester Victoria is served by two [[train operating companies]], primarily [[Northern Rail]], but also by [[First Transpennine Express]] for its Liverpool to Newcastle service. It is also occasionally used by  [[CrossCountry]] services during engineering works.

Northern Rail operates [[British Rail Class 142|Class 142]] Pacers and [[British Rail Class 150|150]] or [[British Rail Class 156|156]] Sprinter DMUs on most train services around Manchester, while the [[Caldervale Line|Leeds Calder Valley]] services are usually operated by British Rail Class 150, Class 155 or [[British Rail Class 158|158]] Sprinter DMUs. The Leeds via Dewsbury services mainly use 3-car [[British Rail Class 144|Class 144]] Monday - Friday, although at weekends this service sees other classes on the route such as a pair of [[British Rail Class 153|Class 153]] DMUs or Class 150 or 155. 

Night services between [[Manchester Airport railway station|Manchester Airport]] and [[York railway station|York]] run via Manchester Victoria, but do not call there. They then run via [[Ashton-under-Lyne railway station|Ashton-under-Lyne]] to rejoin the usual route at [[Stalybridge railway station|Stalybridge]], or continue through [[Rochdale railway station|Rochdale]] and [[Hebden Bridge railway station|Hebden Bridge]] before reaching [[Huddersfield railway station|Huddersfield]].

Manchester Victoria is served by Manchester's [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] [[light rail]] system, at the northern edge of the City Centre zone, on the Bury Line. Metrolink services run through Victoria to [[Altrincham Metrolink station|Altrincham]], [[Bury Interchange|Bury]], [[East Didsbury Metrolink station|East Didsbury]], [[Oldham Mumps Metrolink station|Oldham]], [[Rochdale Town Centre Metrolink station|Rochdale]], [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Piccadilly]] & [[Ashton-under-Lyne Metrolink station|Ashton-Under-Lyne]] . Trams enter Victoria station from Shudehill Interchange by crossing Corporation Street and Long Millgate and passing through a specially constructed arch in the station wall. From there they curve right and stop at the Metrolink platforms.

The Metrolink station is at the southern end of the station near the exits, occupying the site of the former Bury electric train platforms. The Metrolink station was built with three platforms, A, B and C; Platform A, close to the point where the trams enter the station, was used for Bury-bound trams, but is closed to the public because of leaks in the station roof. Platforms B and C are on an island platform further along the tracks.

The Metrolink system was opened in 1992, the result of a project to link Piccadilly and Victoria Stations with a rail line running across the city.<ref name="brochure1">{{Cite document|author=Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive |title=[[:File:Manchester LRT 1984 proposals map.jpg|Light Rapid Transit in Greater Manchester]] |publisher=GMPTE |year=1984 |ref=harv }} - publicity brochure{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref>  Earlier proposals involving an [[Picc-Vic tunnel|underground railway]] were abandoned but [[Greater Manchester County Council|Greater Manchester Council]] secured funding for a light rail system. The system is based on conversion of selected [[British Rail]] lines to light rail operation, linked by on-street tram tracks. The Bury line to Victoria opened as a Metrolink line in 1992, replacing [[British Rail Class 504|heavy rail]] services with [[T-68|Metrolink trams]]. 

The Metrolink line from Victoria to Oldham opened on 13 June 2012, replacing the long-established heavy rail line. Trams on this route run from East Didsbury, Chorlton through the city centre before continuing to Oldham and beyond. The Oldham extension runs via a temporary station,'Oldham Mumps', close to the site of Oldham Mumps Railway Station, which was demolished in 2010/11 after the Oldham Loop heavy rail line closed before its conversion to the Metrolink line. The Mumps section has been abandoned and the line has now been diverted to pass through the streets of central Oldham, via several new stations, including one in Oldham town centre. Services were extended from Oldham Mumps to Shaw along the Oldham loop line on 16 December 2012, to Rochdale railway station on 28 February 2013 and to East Didsbury on 23 May 2013. 

From 11 February 2013, services from Bury to Piccadilly were extended to [[Droylsden Metrolink station|Droylsden]], and to [[Ashton-under-Lyne Metrolink station|Ashton-under-Lyne]] on 9 October 2013.

The Metrolink platforms at Victoria closed temporarily on 21 February 2014 for a period of nine months, to allow them to be rebuilt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolink.co.uk/pages/news.aspx?newsID=75|work=Metrolink web site|date=6 February 2014|accessdate=7 February 2014|title=Time to give Victoria a makeover fit for a queen}}</ref>

However, in October 2014, it was announced that Metrolink services stopping at Victoria station would not resume until early 2015, after single line running is reverted to all lines in February of that year<ref>http://www.networkrail.co.uk/news/2014/oct/Manchester-Victoria-stations-Metrolink-stop-to-be-completed-in-early-2015/</ref>.

=== Service pattern ===
*10 trams per hour to Bury (5 tph off peak)
*5 trams per hour to Altrincham via Market Street (peak hours only)
*5 trams per hour to Ashton-under-Lyne
*5 trams per hour to Rochdale Town Centre
*5 trams per hour to East Didsbury

The '''Duchy of Athens''' was one of the [[Crusader State]]s set up in [[Greece]] after the conquest of the [[Byzantine Empire]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]], encompassing the regions of [[Attica]] and [[Boeotia]], and surviving until its conquest by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 15th century.

==History==

===Establishment of the Duchy===
The first duke of [[Athens]] (as well as of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], at first) was [[Otto de la Roche]], a minor [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] [[knight]] of the [[Fourth Crusade]]. Although he was known as the "Duke of Athens" from the foundation of the duchy in 1205, the title did not become official until 1260. Instead, Otto proclaimed himself "Lord of Athens" (in [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Dominus Athenarum'', in [[French language|French]] ''Sire d'Athenes''). The local Greeks called the dukes "Megas Kyris" ({{lang-el|????? ?????}}, "Great Lord"), from which the shortened form "Megaskyr", often used even by the Franks to refer to the Duke of Athens, is derived.

Athens was originally a [[vassal]] state of the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]], but after [[Thessalonica]] was captured in 1224 by [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas|Theodore]], the [[Despotate of Epirus|Despot of Epirus]], the [[Principality of Achaea]] claimed suzerainty over Athens, a claim disputed by the de la Roche in the [[War of the Euboeote Succession]]. Like the rest of Latin Greece, however, the Duchy recognized the suzerainty of [[Charles I of Sicily]] after the [[Treaties of Viterbo]] in 1267.

The Duchy occupied the [[Attica|Attic]] peninsula as well as [[Boeotia]] and extended partially into [[Thessaly]], sharing an undefined border with Thessalonica and then Epirus. It did not hold the islands of the [[Aegean Sea]], which were [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] territories, but exercised influence over the Latin [[Triarchy of Negroponte]]. The buildings of the [[Athenian Acropolis|Acropolis]] in Athens served as the palace for the dukes.

===Aragonese Conquest===
[[File:Aragon Arms.svg|thumb|left|100px|Coat of arms of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]].]]

The Duchy was held by the family of la Roche until 1308, when it passed to [[Walter V of Brienne]]. Walter hired the [[Catalan Company]] from [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], a group of mercenaries founded by [[Roger de Flor]], to fight against the Byzantine [[successor state]]s of Epirus and [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], but when he tried to dismiss and cheat them of their pay in 1311, they slew him and the bulk of the Frankish nobility at the [[Battle of Halmyros]] and took over the Duchy. Walter's son [[Walter VI of Brienne]] retained only the lordship of [[Argos and Nauplia]], where his claims to the Duchy were still recognized.

In 1312, the Catalans recognized the suzerainty of King [[Frederick III of Sicily]], who appointed his son [[Manfred, Duke of Athens|Manfred]] as Duke. The ducal title remained in the hands of the [[Crown of Aragon]] until 1388, but actual authority was exercised by a series of vicars-general. In 1318/19 the Catalans conquered [[Siderokastron]] and the south of [[Thessaly]] as well, and created the [[Duchy of Neopatras]], united to Athens. Part of Thessaly was conquered from the [[Catalans]] by the [[Medieval Serbia|Serbs]] in the 1340s.

Under the Aragonese, the feudal system continued to exist, not anymore under the ''[[Assizes of Romania]]'', but under the ''[[Customs of Barcelona]]'', and the official common language was now [[Catalan language|Catalan]] instead of French. Each city and district—on the example of Sicily—had its own local governor (''veguer'', ''castlà'', ''capità''), whose term of office was fixed at three years and who was nominated by the Duke, the vicar-general or the local representatives. The principal towns and villages were represented by the ''síndic'', which had their own councils and officers. Judges and notaries were elected for life or even as inherited offices.

===Decline and fall===
[[File:Bonfils, Félix (1831-1885) - Athens - Propylaia 1868-1875.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Frankish Tower (Acropolis of Athens)|Frankish tower]], dating to either the Burgundian or Florentine period, stood on the [[Acropolis of Athens]] among the ruins of the [[Parthenon]], then a church dedicated to Saint Mary, until it was dismantled in 1874.]]

In 1379 the [[Navarrese Company]], in the service of the [[Latin Empire|Latin emperor]] [[James of Baux]], conquered [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and part of [[Neopatria]]. Meanwhile, the Aragonese kept another part of Neopatras and Attica.

After 1381 the Duchy was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Sicily|Kings of Sicily]] until 1388 when the [[Acciaioli]] family of [[Florence]] captured Athens. Neopatras was occupied in 1390.

From 1395 to 1402 the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] briefly controlled the Duchy. In 1444 Athens became a tributary of [[Constantine XI|Constantine Palaeologus]], the despot of [[Morea]] and heir to the Byzantine throne. In 1456, after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] (1453) to the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Turahano?lu Ömer Bey]] conquered the remnants of the Duchy. Despite the Ottoman conquest, the title of "Duke of Athens and Neopatras" continued in use by the kings of Aragon, and through them by the [[Kings of Spain]], up to the present day.

==The Latin church in the Duchy of Athens==
Athens was the seat of an archdiocese within the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] when it was conquered by the Franks. The bishopric, however, was not of importance, being the twenty-eighth in precedence in the Byzantine Empire.<ref>Setton, 91.</ref> Nonetheless, it had produced the prominent clergyman [[Michael Choniates]]. It was a metropolitan see (province or eparchy) with eleven suffragans at the time of conquest: Euripus, Daulia, Coronea, Andros, Oreos, Scyrus, Karystos, Porthmus, Aulon, Syra and Seriphus, and Ceos and Thermiae (or Cythnus). The structure of the Greek church was not significantly changed by the Latins, and [[Pope Innocent III]] confirmed the first [[Latin Archbishop of Athens]], [[Berard, Archbishop of Athens|Berard]], in all his Greek predecessors' rights and jurisdictions. The customs of the [[Archdiocese of Paris|church of Paris]] were imported to Athens, but few western European clergymen wished to be removed to such a distant see as Athens. [[Antonio Ballester]], however, an educated Catalan, had a successful career in Greece as archbishop.

The [[Parthenon]], which had been the Orthodox church of the ''[[Theotokos]] Atheniotissa'', became the Catholic Church of Saint Mary of Athens. The Greek Orthodox church survived as an underground institution without official sanction by the governing (Latin) authorities. The Greek clergy had not typically been literate in the twelfth century and their education certainly worsened under Latin domination, when their church was illegal.<ref>Setton, 92.</ref>

The archdiocese of Thebes also lay within the Athenian duchy. Unlike Athens, it had no suffragans.<ref>Setton, 93.</ref> However, it produced several significant figures as archbishops, such as [[Simon Atumano]]. It had a greater political role than Athens because it was situated in the later capital of the duchy at Thebes. Under the Catalans, the Athenian diocese had expanded its jurisdiction to thirteen suffragans, but only the diocese of Megara, Daulia, Salona, and Boudonitza lay with the duchy itself. The archiepiscopal offices of Athens and Thebes were held by Frenchmen and Italians until the late fourteenth century, when Catalan or Aragonese people began to fill them.

==Dukes of Athens==

===De la Roche family===
Of Burgundian origin, the dukes of the petty lordly family from [[Rigney|La Roche]] renewed the ancient city of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] as a courtly European capital of chivalry. The state they built around it was, throughout their tenure, the strongest and most peaceful of the Latin creations in Greece.

*[[Otto de la Roche|Otto]] (1205&ndash;1225)
*[[Guy I de la Roche|Guy I]] (1225&ndash;1263)
*[[John I de la Roche|John I]] (1263&ndash;1280)
*[[William I de la Roche|William I]] (1280&ndash;1287)
*[[Guy II de la Roche|Guy II]] (1287&ndash;1308)

===Briennist claimants===
The Athenian parliament elected the [[count of Brienne]] to succeed Guy, but his tenure was brief and he was killed in battle by the Catalans. His wife briefly had control of the city, too. The heirs of Brienne continued to claim the duchy, but were recognised only in [[Argos and Nauplia]]. 
*[[Walter V of Brienne]] (1308&ndash;1311)
*[[Joanna of Châtillon]] (1311&ndash;1354)
*[[Walter VI of Brienne]] (1311&ndash;1356)
*[[Isabella of Brienne]] (1356&ndash;1360)
*[[Sohier of Enghien]] (1356&ndash;1367)
*[[Walter IV of Enghien]] (1367&ndash;1381)
*[[Louis of Enghien]] (1381&ndash;1394)

===Aragonese domination===
The annexation of the duchy to first the [[Catalan Company]] and subsequently [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] came after a disputed succession following the death of the last Burgundian duke. The Catalans recognised the [[King of Sicily]] as sovereign over Athens and this left the duchy often as an [[appanage]] in the hands of younger sons and under [[Vicar general|vicars general]].

*[[Roger Deslaur]] (1311&ndash;1312)
*[[Manfred of Athens|Manfred]] (1312&ndash;1317)
**[[Berenguer Estanyol]] (1312&ndash;1317)
*[[William II of Athens|William II]] (1317&ndash;1338)
**[[Alphonse Frederic of Sicily|Alfonso Frederick]] (1317&ndash;1338)
*[[John, Duke of Randazzo|John II]] (1338&ndash;1348)
*[[Frederick I of Athens|Frederick I]] (1348&ndash;1355)
*[[Frederick III the Simple|Frederick II]] (1355&ndash;1377)
*[[Maria, Queen of Sicily|Maria]] (1377&ndash;1388)
**with [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter IV]] from 1381

===Vicars===
These were the vicars general of Aragon who served between 1381 and 1388. 
*[[Mateu de Montcada]]
*[[Roger de Llúria, Vicar General of Athens|Roger de Llúria]]
*[[Mateu de Peralta]]
*[[Louis Fadrique]]
*[[Dalmau IV, Viscount of Rocabertí|Dalmau IV of Rocabertí]]
*[[Bernat de Cordella]]

===Acciaioli family===
The Florentine Acciaioli (or Acciajuoli) governed the duchy from their removal of the Catalans, with the assistance of the [[Navarrese Company|Navarrese]]. While Nerio willed the city and duchy to Venice, it returned to the Florentines until the Turkish conquest.

*[[Nerio I Acciaioli|Nerio I]] (1388&ndash;1394)
*[[Antonio I Acciaioli|Antonio I]] (1394&ndash;1395)
*''[[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] control'' (1395&ndash;1402), under ''[[podestà]]s'':
** [[Albano Contarini]] (1395&ndash;1397)
** Lorenzo Venier (1397&ndash;1399)
** Ermoaldo Contarini (1399&ndash;1400)
** Nicolo Vitturi (1400&ndash;1402)
*Antonio I (1402&ndash;1435), again
*[[Nerio II Acciaioli|Nerio II]] (1435&ndash;1439)
*[[Antonio II Acciaioli|Antonio II]] (1439&ndash;1441)
*Nerio II (1441&ndash;1451), again
*[[Chiara Zorzi|Claire]] (1451&ndash;1454)
**with [[Bartolomeo Contarini (nobleman)|Bartolomeo Contarini]] (1451&ndash;1454)
*[[Francesco I Acciaioli|Francesco I]] (1451&ndash;1454)
*[[Francesco II Acciaioli|Francesco II]] (1455&ndash;1458)

===Humanitarian work===
Leoni stated in the October 27, 2006 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine that she became a goodwill ambassador for [[UNICEF]] partially because [[Helenka Pantaleoni]], her paternal grandmother, was the president of the [[U.S. Fund for UNICEF]] for 25 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tea-leoni-5-things-newly-206898|title=Tea Leoni: 5 Things About the Newly Single Actress|author=Sophie Schillaci|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=June 29, 2011|accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref>

'''Taksony''' ({{IPA-hu|?t?k?o?}}; before or around 931&nbsp;– early 970s) was the [[Grand Prince of the Hungarians]] after their catastrophic defeat in the 955 [[Battle of Lechfeld]]. In his youth he had participated in [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|plundering raids]] in Western Europe, but during his reign the Hungarians only targeted the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'' recounts that significant [[Böszörmény|Muslim]] and [[Pechenegs|Pecheneg]] groups settled in Hungary under Taksony.

==Early life==
Taksony was the son of [[Zoltán of Hungary|Zoltán]] (the third grand prince of the Hungarians), according to the ''Gesta Hungarorum'' (written around 1200).{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|pp=22, 24}} The same source adds that Taksony's mother was an unnamed daughter of [[Menumorut]], a local ruler defeated by the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|conquering Hungarians]]{{sfn|Kordé|1994|p=659}} shortly before 907.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005|p=26}} Its unknown author also says that Taksony was born "in the year of Our Lord's incarnation 931".<ref>''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 55), p. 121.</ref>{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=24}} The ''Gesta Hungarorum'' reports that Zoltán abdicated in favor of Taksony in 947,{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=19}} three years before his own death.{{sfn|Tóth|1994|p=741}}

However, modern historians have challenged existing information on Taksony's early life. A nearly-contemporaneous source{{spaced ndash}}[[Liudprand of Cremona]]'s ''Retribution''{{sfn|Györffy|2002|pp=212, 220}}{{spaced ndash}}narrates that Taksony led a plundering raid against Italy in 947, which suggests that he was born considerably earlier than 931.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=24}} His father's reign was preserved only in the ''Gesta Hungarorum''; its [[Anonymus (chronicler)|anonymous author]] lists Zoltán among the grand princes, and all later Hungarian monarchs were descended from him.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=21}} The [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] wrote around 950 that [[Fajsz]], Taksony's cousin, was grand prince of the Hungarians at that time.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|pp=22-23}}

{{Quote|In that time Taxis, king of the Hungarians came to Italy with a large army. [[Berengar II of Italy|Berengar]] gave him ten measures of coins not from his own money, but from an exaction on the churches and paupers.|[[Liudprand of Cremona]]: ''Retribution''<ref>''Liudprand of Cremona: Retribution'' (ch. 5.33), p. 194.</ref>}}

==Reign==

A later source, [[Johannes Aventinus]],{{sfn|Kordé|1994|p=659}} writes that Taksony fought in the Battle of Lechfeld on August 10, 955. There, future [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] routed an 8,000-strong Hungarian army.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=81}} If this report is reliable, Taksony was one of the few Hungarian leaders to survive the battlefield.{{sfn|Kordé|1994|p=659}} Modern historians, including Zoltán Kordé{{sfn|Kordé|1994|p=659}} and Gyula Kristó,{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=24}} suggest that Fajsz abdicated in favor of Taksony around that time. After that battle the Hungarians' plundering raids in Western Europe stopped, and they were forced to retreat from the lands between the [[Enns (river)|Enns]] and [[Traisen (river)|Traisen]] rivers.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=82}} However, the Hungarians continued their incursions into the [[Byzantine Empire]] until the 970s.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=15}}{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=82}}

According to the ''Gesta Hungarorum'', "a great host of Muslims" arrived in Hungary "from the [[Volga Bulgaria|land of Bular]]"<ref name='Anonymus_127'>''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 57), p. 127.</ref>{{sfn|Györffy|2002|pp=180, 291}} under Taksony.{{sfn|Berend|2006|p=65}} The contemporaneous [[Abraham ben Jacob]] also recorded the presence of Muslim merchants from Hungary in Prague in 965.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=25}}{{sfn|Berend|2006|pp=65-66}} Anonymous also writes of the arrival of Pechenegs during Taksony's reign; he granted them "a land to dwell in the region of Kemej as far as the [[Tisza]]".<ref name='Anonymus_127'/>{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=126}} The only sign of a Hungarian connection with Western Europe under Taksony is a report by Liudprand of Cremona.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=25}} He writes about Zacheus, whom Pope [[John XII]] consecrated bishop and "sent to the Hungarians in order to preach that they should attack"<ref>''Liudprand of Cremona: King Otto'' (ch. 6.), p. 224.</ref> the Germans in 963.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=25}}{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szakács|2007|p=329}} However, there is no evidence that Zacheus ever arrived in Hungary.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=25}} Taksony arranged the marriage of his elder son [[Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|Géza]] to [[Sarolt]], daughter of [[Gyula II|Gyula of Transylvania]],{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=25}} before his death during the early 970s.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=25}}

==Family==
Taksony's marriage to a woman "from the land of the [[Cumans]]"<ref name="Anonymus_127"/> was arranged by his father, according to the ''Gesta Hungarorum''.{{sfn|Kordé|1994|p=659}}{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=24}} Although this reference to the Cumans is anachronistic, Gyula Kristó and other historians argue that the ''Gesta'' seems to have preserved the memory of the Oriental{{spaced ndash}}[[Khazars|Khazar]], [[Pechenegs|Pecheneg]] or [[Volga Bulgaria]]n{{spaced ndash}}origin of Taksony's wife.{{sfn|Kordé|1994|p=659}}{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=24}} The names of two of their sons ([[Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|Géza]] and [[Michael of Hungary|Michael]]) have been preserved.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=Appendix 1}} The following family tree presents Taksony's ancestry and his offspring.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=Appendices 1-2}}

'''Zoltán''' ({{IPA-hu|?zolta?n}}; {{circa}} 880 or 903&nbsp;– {{circa}} 950), also '''Zolta''',{{sfn|Madgearu|2005|p=26}}{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=254}} is mentioned in the ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'' as the third [[Grand Prince of the Hungarians]] who succeeded his father [[Árpád]] around 907. Although modern historians tend to deny this report on his reign, because other chronicles do not list him among the Hungarian rulers, there is consensus that even if Zoltán never ascended the throne, all monarchs ruling in Hungary from the [[House of Árpád]] after around 955 were descended from him.

==Life==

===Zoltán in the ''Gesta Hungarorum''===

Modern historians' main source of Zoltán's life is the ''Gesta Hungarorum'', a late 12th-century chronicle whose writer is now known as [[Anonymus (chronicler)|Anonymous]].{{sfn|Tóth|1994|p=741}} According to this source, Zoltán was the only son of Árpád, Grand Prince of the Hungarians.{{sfn|Tóth|1994|p=741}} In contrast, the nearly contemporary [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] writes that "Zaltas"<ref>''Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio'' (ch. 40), p. 179.</ref> was Árpád's fourth son.{{sfn|Tóth|1994|p=741}} Zoltán's name seemingly derived from the [[Arabian language|Arabian]] [[sultan]] title with [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] mediation, but modern scholars have not unanimously accepted this etymology.{{sfn|Tóth|1994|p=741}}

According to Anonymous, Zoltán was born after 903, during his father's second campaign against [[Menumorut]].{{sfn|Madgearu|2005|p=26}} The latter was one of the many local rulers who are solely mentioned in the ''Gesta Hungarorum'' among the opponents of the Hungarians during [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|their conquest of the Carpathian Basin]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=11}} In the ''Gesta Hungarorum'''s narration, Menumarot was forced to surrender and to give his daughter in marriage to Zoltán{{sfn|Madgearu|2005|p=26}}{{sfn|S?l?gean|2005|p=146}} in 904 or 905.{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p=254}} When Menumorut died, Zoltán inherited his father-in-law's duchy east of the river [[Tisza]], which Anonymous claims was inhabited by "the peoples that are called [[Khazar|Kozár]]".<ref>''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 11), p. 33.</ref>{{sfn|S?l?gean|2005|p=140}} Anonymous also states that Zoltán, still a minor, succeeded his father who died around 907.{{sfn|Tóth|1994|p=741}} Zoltán, in turn, later abdicated in favour of his son [[Taksony of Hungary|Taksony]] and died "in the third year of his son's reign".<ref>''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 57), p. 127.</ref>{{sfn|Tóth|1994|p=741}}

{{Quote|''And his son Zolta succeeded'' [Árpád]'', who was similar to his father in character but dissimilar in appearance. Prince Zolta was a little lisping and pale, with soft, blonde hair, of middling stature; a warlike duke, brave in spirit, merciful to his subjects, sweet of speech, but covetous of power, whom all the leading men and warriors of Hungary loved marvelously. Some time later, when Zolta was thirteen, all the leading men of the realm by their common counsel and of their equal wish appointed rectors of the kingdom beneath the prince to mend through the guidance of customary law the conflicts and lawsuits of litigants. ''|[[Bele Regis Notarius|Anonymous]]: ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]''<ref>''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 53), p. 115.</ref>}}

===Modern historians' views===

Nowadays historians refuse most details of Zoltán's life presented by Anonymous. For instance, the Hungarian historian Gyula Kristó says that Zoltán was born around 880 instead of around 903.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=21}} His Romanian colleague Alexandru Madgearu likewise writes that either Zoltán was born many years earlier than 903 or his marriage must have happened years after 904.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005|p=26}} 

Zoltán's father-in-law's identity is also debated. [[Medievalist]] Pál Engel says that Menumorut is one of the "imaginary figures"{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=11}} invented by Anonymous in order to describe the conquering Hungarians' heroic wars against them. Historian Charles R. Bowlus writes that he was a Moravian ruler whose daughter's marriage with Zoltán symbolized the end of "[[Great Moravia]]".{{sfn|Madgearu|2005|p=26}} Medievalist Tudor S?l?gean also says that Menumorut was a real person, the ruler of a one-time duchy inhabited by [[Romanians]], Slavs and many other peoples at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries.{{sfn|S?l?gean|2005|p=140}}

Anonymous's statement that Zoltán succeeded his father as grand prince, or even the idea that Zoltán ever ruled the federation of the Hungarian tribes have also been challenged. For instance, historian Sándor L. Tóth writes that Zoltán, being the youngest among Árpád's four sons, could hardly precede his elder brothers in the line of succession.{{sfn|Tóth|1994|p=741}} Kristó also says that other Hungarian chroniclers do not make mention of Zoltán's rule, implying that Anonymous only inserted Zoltán into the incompletely preserved list of the grand princes because he knew that all Hungarian monarchs from the House of Árpád descended from him.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=21}}

The '''white-beaked dolphin''' (''Lagenorhynchus albirostris'') is a [[marine mammal]] belonging to the family [[Delphinidae]] ([[dolphin]]s) in the suborder Odontoceti (toothed whales).

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described by the [[United Kingdom|British]] taxonomist [[John Edward Gray]] in 1846. Due to its relative abundance in [[Europe]]an waters, it was among the first of the genus ''Lagenorhynchus'' (''lagenos'', [[Latin]] for "bottle" or "flask"; ''rhynchos'', "beak" or "snout") to be known to science. Its specific name, ''albirostris'', translates to "white beak", a reference to the color of the species' beak, a diagnostic (albeit variable) trait useful in identification.<ref name=Reeves>{{cite book|title= National Audubon Society Guide to Marine Mammals of the World |author= Reeves, Randall, Brent Stewart, Phillip Clapham and James Powell|publisher=Knopf|year=2002|pages=395–397|isbn=0-375-41141-0}}</ref>

==Description==
[[File:Weißschnauzendelfinskelett.jpg|thumb|left|Skeleton]]
The white-beaked dolphin is a robust species of dolphin with a short beak. Adults can reach {{Convert|2.3|to|3.1|m|abbr=on}} long and weigh {{Convert|180|to|354|kg|abbr=on}}. Calves are {{Convert|1.1|to|1.2|m|abbr=on}} long at birth and probably weigh about {{Convert|40|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Shirihai>{{cite book|title=Whales, Dolphins and Other Marine Mammals of the World|author=Shirihai, H. and Jarrett, B.|publisher=Princeton Field Guides|year=2006|pages=199–200|isbn=9780691127569}}</ref> The dolphin is characterized by its short thick creamy-white beak and very falcate (curved) dorsal fin.

==Distribution==
The white-beaked dolphin is [[endemism|endemic]] to the North [[Atlantic Ocean]] and is found in a band stretching across the ocean from [[Cape Cod]], the mouth of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and southern [[Greenland]] in the west, around [[Iceland]] in the centre, and across in the west from northern [[France]] to [[Svalbard]]; however, it is not as well adapted to Arctic conditions as the [[Beluga (whale)|beluga]] or [[narwhal]]. The dolphin may easily be misidentified as the [[Atlantic white-sided dolphin]], although the white-beaked is commonly found further north. The white-beaked dolphin is also typically larger, and does not have yellow streaks on its side.

==Behavior==
[[File:DolphinBreathing.jpg|left|thumb|A white-beaked dolphin off Iceland]]
The population, breeding pattern, and life expectancy of the dolphin are all unknown, although most sources estimate several hundred thousand individuals, more densely populated in the eastern North Atlantic than the west.

White-beaked dolphins are acrobatic and [[Presociality|social animals]]. They will frequently ride on the [[bow wave]] of high-speed boats and jump clear of the sea's surface. The white-beaked dolphin is a social feeder and has frequently been observed feeding with [[killer whale|killer]], [[Fin whale|fin]], and [[humpback whale]]s, as well as other dolphin species.

==Conservation==

The North and Baltic Sea populations of the white-beaked dolphin are listed on Appendix II<ref name="Appendices">"[http://www.cms.int/documents/appendix/Appendices_COP9_E.pdf Appendix II]" of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). As amended by the Conference of the Parties in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008.

In addition, the white-beaked dolphin is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas ([[ASCOBANS]]).<ref>[http://www.ascobans.org/ Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas]</ref>

'''''The Tube''''' was a United Kingdom pop/rock music television programme, which ran for five series, from 5 November 1982 until 1987.  It was produced in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] for [[Channel 4]] by [[Tyne Tees Television]], which had previously produced the similar music show ''[[Alright Now (TV series)|Alright Now]]'' and the music-oriented youth show ''[[Check it Out (UK TV series)|Check it Out]]'' for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]; production of the latter ended in favour of ''The Tube''.

''The Tube'' was presented live by hosts including [[Jools Holland]], [[Paula Yates]], [[Leslie Ash]], [[Muriel Gray]], Gary James, Michel Cremona, Nick Laird-Clowes and Mike Everitt. The brand name was relaunched by Channel 4 as an online radio station in November 2006. The show was directed by [[Gavin Taylor (British director)|Gavin Taylor]]; Geoff Wonfor directed some of the insert videos along with other staff programme director of Tyne Tees Television Martin Cairns. Many other specials were made, including one for the eve of the millennium.

==Showcase for contemporary bands==
''The Tube'' was a showcase for many emerging 1980s bands. Artists who played on ''The Tube'' included:

''The Tube'' was an important outlet for the performers, and provided a turning point in the careers of many of them.{{fact|date=December 2013}} For [[The Proclaimers]], performing "Letter from America" on ''The Tube'' was instrumental in helping the Scottish duo to their first top ten UK hit; it was also responsible for introducing [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] to their record label.{{fact|date=December 2013}}

In addition to being the launchpad for new and upcoming performers, ''The Tube'' became known for its high profile music performance 'scoops' from established world class bands such as [[U2]] live at Red Rocks, [[Robert Plant]], [[Bo Diddley]] and [[ZZ Top]]. The show was also fortunate to persuade [[Ringo Starr]] to give one of the first post-Beatles interviews in an extended article on his work with [[Marc Bolan]] and [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], filmed at his then (and previously [[John Lennon]]'s) house, [[Tittenhurst Park]].

[[The Jam]] performed on the first edition of the show in 1982, it was their last live TV appearance together before they split up at the end of the year.

==Format==
The cornerstone of the shows was the live performances from three or four bands each week. In an era where most music TV shows featured non-stop miming, the fully live sets by the guest artists were innovative (but the sound mix was often very poor, with a curious quality that made it sound like everything had been '[[Phaser (effect)|phased]]'). The programme would start with a 45 minute magazine section consisting of interviews, fashion items and comedy appearances by a wide range of alternative artistes such as [[Mark Miwurdz]], [[Frank Sidebottom]], [[Vic Reeves]] (before his association with [[Bob Mortimer]] ), [[Foffo Spearjig]] and even [[French & Saunders]]. During this section Yates would become known for conducting rather flirtatious interviews: in 1985, for example, she prompted [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] to remove his trousers.

The main presenters were supported, for the first two series, by five newcomers who were picked following a nationally advertised competition: these were [[Muriel Gray]], Gary James, Nick Laird-Clowes, Michel Cremona and Mike Everitt. The supporting presenters took turns to co-present. The show usually featured four or five band appearances per week, with one main extended session to close. The format of the show was extended following Series 1 with a number of special events - most notably the 'Midsummer Night's Tube', a 5 hour version broadcast live from the Tyne Tees studios, the pub across the road from the studios and [[The Hoppings]] annual fair in Newcastle. This ground breaking broadcast was, at the time, the longest continuous live music show in television history and received much critical and technical acclaim.

Studio 5 was also used to produce a spin off show called ''TX45''. This show ran for two series hosted by Chris Cowey and produced by Jeff Brown and featured local bands like, The [[Kane Gang]], Secret Sam, She and President.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.myspace.com/tonywright |title=President &#124; Free Music, Tour Dates, Photos, Videos |publisher=Myspace.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref> The programme's theme music, the instrumental "TX45", was by [[Sophie and Peter Johnston]], based on the song of theirs, "Some Sunny Day".  A video clip of them performing it is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.aol.com/video-detail/sophie-and-peter-johnston-some-sunny-day/2149001084 |title=AOL On Homepage |publisher=Video.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref>

Many stars drank in the neighbouring pub ''The Egypt Cottage'', using it as a [[green room]]. Jools Holland said "A legendary amount of things happened in the Egypt Cottage, and the Rose and  Crown when it was on the other side of the road. Everyone – the likes of Miles Davis, Paul McCartney – who came up for ''The Tube'' will have sat in that pub."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/6029347/Jools-Holland-and-landowner-clash-over-future-of-pub-that-hosted-The-Tube-stars.html |title=Jools Holland and landowner clash over future of pub that hosted The Tube stars |work=The Telegraph |author= Urmee Khan |date= 15 Aug 2009 |location=London}}</ref>

==Demise==
In January 1987, during the fifth series, Jools Holland used the phrase "be there or be ungroovy [[fuck]]ers" during a live trailer for the show.<ref name ="FTCarpenter">[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7952af18-7929-11dc-aaf2-0000779fd2ac.html 'Quite a lot has happened'] Louise Carpenter,  The FT , October 13, 2007 . Accessed October 2014</ref> The incident caused a national scandal, as the trailer was transmitted at a peak children's viewing time and the show was taken off air for three weeks as a result.<ref name ="FTCarpenter"/> Holland was reprimanded by Channel 4, as this was not the first time he had accidentally sworn on the live show.{{fact|date=December 2013}} The show's producer, [[Malcolm Gerrie]], and Tyne Tees' Director of Programmes, [[Andrea Wonfor]], announced their resignations in March.{{fact|date=December 2013}} They cited as reasons for doing so a mixture of internal bickering, political pressure and "stifling bureaucracy and heavy-handed moralism".{{fact|date=December 2013}} A further series was never commissioned. In truth, the viewing figures for the series had dropped significantly, and the original format had been watered down.{{fact|date=December 2013}} Some people{{who|date=December 2013}} close to the show had said that Holland's swearing was seen as a convenient way of ending the show.{{fact|date=December 2013}} The presenters' live interviews and filmed magazine items were nervously watched by the show's producers and editors as well as Channel 4 executives, especially when certain pop stars and celebrities not known for their shy and retiring nature were being featured. It was this that gave the show the curious feeling of 'anything might happen' that actually made it the success it was.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3564155.ece |newspaper=[[The Times]] |title=TV and Radio |accessdate=2014-06-28}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

For Holland, Yates and Gray it was the launch pad for successful careers in television.

In 2000, ''The Tube'' was brought back for a one-off live special on [[Sky1]] entitled "The Apocalypse Tube". Hosted by [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Chris Moyles]] and [[Donna Air]], the show came live again from Studio 5 at Tyne Tees and the bar of the Egypt Cottage next door.

In 2005 [[Tyne Tees Television]] moved from its City Road complex on [[Newcastle Quayside]]. In July 2006 Studio 5 of the TTTV City Road site was leased by an evangelical [[money church]], and the whole complex was demolished in 2010. The famous Tube neon sign was bought at auction by [[Tyne and Wear Museums]] for a future display at the [[Discovery Museum]] in Newcastle's Blandford Square.

==Radio revival==
In November 2006, the brand was revived as a radio show, also entitled ''[[The Tube (radio series)|The Tube]]'', by [[UKOne Productions]] for [[Channel 4 Radio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/music/microsites/0-9/4radio/thetube/index.html |title=Music |publisher=Channel 4 |date= |accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref>  Presenters [[Konnie Huq]], [[Alex James (musician)|Alex James]] and [[Tony Wilson]] hosted the main show (''The Tube'') and filler show (''Mind The Gap'').

==Available on the Internet==
In July 2008 [[ITN]] (rights holder for ''The Tube'') signed a deal with [[MUZU TV]] to make ''The Tube'' available online.<ref name="Irish Times">{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2008/0717/1216073187662.html|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|title=Finance|accessdate=2014-06-28}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref name="Irish Independent">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/world/muzu-tv-adds-to-online-content-1459420.html |title=In brief: Muzu TV adds to online content |publisher=Independent.ie |date=2008-08-20 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref>

'''Franz Josef Gall''' ({{IPA-de|gal|lang}}; 9 March 1758{{spaced ndash}}22 August 1828) was a [[neuroanatomist]], [[physiology|physiologist]], and pioneer in the study of the localization of mental functions in the [[brain]].

Claimed as the founder of [[phrenology]],<ref>Graham, Patrick. (2001) Phrenology [videorecording (DVD)] : revealing the mysteries of the mind . Richmond Hill, Ont. : American Home Treasures. ISBN 0-7792-5135-0</ref> Gall was an early  and important researcher in his fields. His contributions to the field of neuropsychology were controversial at the time and now widely referred to as pseudoscience. However, Gall's study of phrenology helped establish psychology as a science, contributed to the emergence of the naturalistic approach to the study of man, and played an important part in the development of evolutionist theories, anthropology, and sociology.<ref>Livianos et al 2007</ref>

== Early life ==

Gall was born in the village of [[Tiefenbronn]] to a wealthy [[Roman Catholic]] wool merchant. The Galls, originally a noble family from Lombardy,<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Franz_Joseph_Gall.aspx</ref> had been the leading family in the area for over a century. His father was the mayor of Tiefenbronn and he was one of 12 children, only 7 of whom lived to adulthood.<ref>Gall 1835</ref>

Gall's scientific inquiry began in his youth. As a boy, he was fascinated by the differences between himself, his siblings, and his classmates. He developed an early interest in the brain after making a connection between one classmate's odd shaped skull and advanced language abilities.<ref>Eling 1994</ref> He enjoyed collecting and categorizing plants and animals. He also realized the importance of observation as a scientific technique at a young age.<ref>Tomlinson 2005</ref>

== Education and early career ==

As the second eldest son, he was intended for the priesthood but chose instead to study medicine at the [[University of Strasbourg]]. In his advanced studies, he again made observations about his classmates. He noticed that many of the particularly bright students had prominent eyeballs and concluded that this could not be purely coincidental <ref>Gall 1835</ref>

He later completed his degree in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. While in medical school, he studied under  [[Johann Hermann]] and [[Maximilian Stoll]] who impressed upon him the important of natural observation.<ref>Van Whye 2002</ref> He took his first job at Lunatic Asylum making observations about the insane.<ref>Gall 1835</ref> He then opened up his own successful private practice and became so popular he even gave well attended lectures to the public.<ref>Tomlinson 2005</ref> He was offered the position as head Austrian Court physician but decided to remain in private practice and research.<ref>Davies 1955</ref>

== Contributions to phrenology ==
[[File:Franz Joseph Gall examining the head of a pretty young girl, Wellcome V0011119.jpg|thumb|right|''Franz Joseph Gall examining the head of a pretty young girl'']]
Based on his early observations about the skull sizes and facial features of his classmates, Gall developed the theory of Organology and the method of [[Cranioscopy]] that would later be known as [[Phrenology]]. Gall's version of Organology states that the mind is a collection of independent entities housed within the brain. Cranioscopy is a method to determine the personality and development of mental and moral faculties on the basis of the external shape of the skull. During his lifetime, Gall collected and observed over 120 skulls in order to test his hypotheses.

Gall believed that the bumps and uneven geography of the human skull were caused by pressure exerted from the brain underneath. He divided the brain into sections that corresponded to certain behaviors and traits that he called fundamental faculties. This is referred to as [[functional specialization (brain)|localization of function]]. Gall believed there were 27 fundamental faculties, among them were: recollection of people, mechanical ability, talent for poetry, love of property, and even a murder instinct. Based on the surface of a person's skull, Gall could make assumptions about that person's fundamental faculties and therefore their character.

Gall disagreed with [[Philippe Pinel]] and [[Peter Camper]] that the larger brain the larger one's intellectual power. However, after numerous dissections and observations he was able to assert that a mature skull under 14 inches in circumference was not able to function normally.<ref>Tomlinson 2005</ref>

== Relationship with Johann Spurzheim ==

In 1800, [[Johann Spurzheim]] attended one of Gall's public lectures and was hired as an assistant to help with public medical demonstrations. In 1804, he became Gall's full-time research partner.<ref>Tomlinson 2005</ref> They worked together for years to develop theories about brain localization and function. In 1813, Spurzheim separated from Gall in order to make a name for himself in Britain. Gall would later accuse Spurzheim of plagiarism and perverting his work.<ref>Tomlinson 2005</ref> It was Spurzheim who would give the name [[Phrenology]] to Gall's theories.

== Other achievements ==

Other than his contributions to Phrenology, Gall is lesser known for his other achievements. While developing his theories on localization of function, Gall significantly advanced the science of dissection. Instead of slicing randomly, as had been the practice in previous years, Gall's method involved slow exploration of the entire brain structure and the separation of individual fibers.<ref>Colbert 1997</ref> This shift in methodology was extremely influential in future discoveries of the brain.

Gall also researched and theorized about language, communication, and the brain. He argued that [[mime|pantomime]], or the science of gesture, was a universal language for all animals and humans. He believed every living thing was born with the ability to understood gestures on some level.<ref>Tomlinson 2005</ref>

In 1823, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

He published a book titled "On the Functions of the Brain and of Each of Its parts: With Observations on the Possibility of Determining the Instincts, Propensities, and Talents, Or the Moral and Intellectual Dispositions of Men and Animals, by the Configuration of the Brain and Head" detailing his vast research on brain function and localization. It was translated to English in 1835 by Lewis Winslow.<ref>Gall 1835</ref>

== Reception and controversy ==

Gall's concepts on brain localization were revolutionary, and caused religious leaders and some scientists to take exception. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] considered his theory as contrary to [[religion]]. Established science also condemned these ideas for lack of [[scientific proof]] of his theory. Still others attempted to discredit Gall because they believed he had not given rightful credit to the theories and scientists who influenced him. [[Étienne-Jean Georget]] accused Gall of stealing [[Charles Bonnet]]'s basic idea of brain localization that he had written about over 60 years earlier.<ref>Tomlinson 2005</ref>

His ideas were also not acceptable to the court of Josef II (the brother of Marie Antoinette).  The Austrian government accused Gall of being a materialist and banned his ideas because of their threat to public morality.<ref>Tomlinson 2005</ref> Due to this opposition, Gall left his lecturer position in Austria. He sought a teaching position in Germany and eventually settled in Paris. Revolutionary France was most likely the most hospitable place for Gall's theories. However, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], the ruling [[emperor]], and the scientific establishment led by the [[Institute of France]], pronounced his science as invalid. Despite all this, Gall was able to secure a comfortable existence on the basis of his speciality. He became a celebrity of sorts as he was accepted into Parisian intellectual salons.

Gall's phrenological theories and practices were best accepted in England, where the ruling class used it to justify the "inferiority" of its colonial subjects. It also became very popular in the USA from 1820 to 1850.

== Legacy ==

In spite of many problems associated with his work, Gall made significant contributions to neurological science. He died in Paris, on 22 August 1828. Although married he had no direct descendent. However, direct descendants of his brothers lived in Germany until 1949. A&nbsp;collection of his skulls can be seen at the Rollett Museum in Baden bei Wien, Austria, where several of his relatives now live.<ref>[http://www.bmi.gv.at/cms/BMI_OeffentlicheSicherheit/2006/09_10/files/Seinerzeit.pdf Strange teachings about heads] (Bundesministerium fur Inneres).</ref>

Today, phrenology is thought of as a huge misstep by the scientific community. The idea that a person's personality could be determined by the shape of their skull has been repeatedly disproven. But at the time, Gall's arguments were persuasive and intriguing. Even though phrenology is now known to be incorrect, Gall did set the groundwork for modern neuroscience by spreading the idea of functional localization within the brain.

The misuse of Gall's ideas and work to justify discrimination were deliberately furthered by his associates, including [[Johann Spurzheim]]. Later, others tried to improve on his theories with systems such as [[characterology]].

Gall's theories had an influence both on the Italian criminologist [[Cesare Lombroso]] and on his French rival, [[Alexandre Lacassagne]]. He also influenced the French anatomist, [[Paul Broca]]

'''Árpád''' ({{IPA-hu|?a?rpa?d}}; {{circa}} 845&nbsp;– {{circa}} 907) was the head of the confederation of the [[Hungarian tribes]] at the turn of the 9th and 10th&nbsp;centuries. He may have been either the [[sacred king|sacred ruler]] or ''[[kende]]'' of the [[Hungarians]], or their military leader or ''[[Gyula (title)|gyula]]'', although most details of his life are debated by historians, because different sources contain contradictory information. Despite this, many [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]]s refer to him as the "founder of our country", and Árpád's preeminent role in the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin]] has been emphasized by some later chronicles.

The [[Árpád dynasty|dynasty descending from Árpád]] ruled the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] until 1301.

==Biography==

===Early life===
{{Further|Álmos}}

Árpád was the son of [[Álmos]] who is mentioned as the first head of the confederation of the [[Hungarian tribes]] by all Hungarian chronicles.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=19}}{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|pp=11–12, 17, Appendix 1}} His mother's name and family are unknown.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|pp=17, Appendix 1}} According to historian Gyula Kristó, Árpád was born around 845.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=17}} His name derived from the Hungarian word for [[barley]] ''(árpa)''.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=17}}

The [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] (r.&nbsp;913–959) states that the Hungarians "had never at any time had any other prince" before Árpád, which is in sharp contrast to the Hungarian chronicles' report of the position of Árpád's father.<ref name='Constantine_Porphyrogenitus_173'>''Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio'' (ch. 38), p. 173.</ref>{{sfn|Kristó|1996|pp=160–161}} In Porphyrogenitus's narration, the [[Khazar Khaganate|Khazar]] [[khagan]] initiated the centralization of the command of the Hungarian tribes in order to strengthen his own suzerainty over them.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=33}}{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=160-161}} The khagan initially wanted to appoint a chieftain named [[Levedi]] to lead the Hungarians.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|pp=33, 40}} However, Levedi did not accept this offer and suggested that either Álmos or Árpád should be promoted instead of him.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=33}} The khagan approached the Hungarians with this new proposal.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=160}} They preferred Árpád to his father, because he was "greatly admired for wisdom and counsel and valour, and capable of this rule".<ref name='Constantine_Porphyrogenitus_173'/>{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=33}} Thereafter, Árpád was made "prince according to the custom&nbsp;... of the Chazars, by lifting him upon a shield."<ref name='Constantine_Porphyrogenitus_173'/>{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=160}} Constantine Porphyrogenitus refers to Árpád as "great prince of Hungary" ({{lang-el|????? ???????? ?????}}).<ref>''Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio'' (ch. 40), pp. 178–179.</ref>{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=201}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=20}}

The reliability of the Byzantine emperor's report of Árpád's election is debated by modern historians: for instance, Victor Spinei states that it is "rather vague and scarcely credible", but András Róna-Tas writes that its core is reliable.{{sfn|Spinei|2003| p=33}}{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=330}} The latter historian adds that Árpád's election was promoted by Álmos who forced Levedi ''kende'' to renounce. Accordingly, in Róna-Tas's view, Árpád succeeded Levedi as sacred ruler or ''kende'', which enabled his father to preserve his own position of the actual leader of the Hungarians or ''gyula''.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=330}}

===Towards the Hungarian Conquest===
{{Further|Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Kurszán|Liüntika}}

The earliest reliable source of Árpád's life is an early 10th-century document, the ''[[George Hamartolos#Chronicle|Continuation of the Chronicle by George the Monk]]''.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=17}}{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|pp=54–55}}{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=183}} It narrates that the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]] (r.&nbsp;886–912) sent his envoy Nicetas Sclerus to the Hungarians in 894 or 895 "to give presents" and incite them against the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]].{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=183}} Sclerus met with their two leaders, Árpád and [[Kurszán]], at the [[Lower Danube]].{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=183}}{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=52}} Sclerus's mission succeeded: a Hungarian army soon crossed the Danube on Byzantine ships against Bulgaria.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=52}}{{sfn|Kristó|1996|pp=183–184}} An interpolation in Porphyrogenitus's text suggests that the invading Hungarians were under the command of Árpád's son, [[Liüntika]].{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=52}}

The positions held by Árpád and Kurszán at the time of their negotiations with Sclerus are debated by historians. Spinei wrote that Árpád was the ''gyula'', and Kurszán was the ''kende''.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=52}} In contrast, Kristó said that Kurszán was the ''gyula'' and Árpád represented his father, Álmos ''kende''.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=183}} {{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=186}}

[[File:Árpád fejedelem 2 - Székelybere.jpg|190px|thumb|left|alt=Árpád's statue in Székelybere (Bereni, Romania)|Árpád's statue in [[Székelybere]] (Bereni, [[Romania]])]]

{{Quote|''At that time, the [[Byzantine–Bulgarian wars#Simeon I's Imperial ambitions|Bulgarians had disregarded the peace treaty]] and were raiding through the [[Thracia]]n countryside. Justice pursued them for breaking their oath to Christ our God, the emperor of all, and they quickly met up with their punishment. While our forces were engaged against the Saracens, divine Providence led the'' [Hungarians]'', in place of the Romans, to campaign against the Bulgarians. Our Majesty's fleet of ships supported them and ferried them across the Danube.'' [Providence] ''sent them out against the army of the Bulgarians that had so wickedly taken up arms against Christians and, as though they were public executioners, they decisively defeated them in three engagements, so that the Christian Romans might not willingly stain themselves with the blood of the Christian Bulgarians.''|[[Leo the Wise]]: ''[[Tactica of Emperor Leo VI the Wise|Tactics]]''<ref>''The Taktika of Leo VI'' (18.40), p. 453.</ref>}}

The Hungarian army defeated the Bulgarians, but the latter hired the [[Pechenegs]] against them.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=52}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=178}} The Bulgarians and Pechenegs simultaneously invaded the Hungarians' territories in the western regions of the [[Pontic steppes]] in 895 or 896.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=11–12}} The destruction of their dwelling places by the Pechenegs forced the Hungarians to leave for a new homeland across the [[Carpathian Mountains]] towards the [[Pannonian Plain]].{{sfn|Molnár|2001|p=13}}

The ''[[Illuminated Chronicle]]'' says that Árpád's father Álmos "could not enter [[Pannonia]], for he was killed in Erdelw" or [[Transylvania]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=19}}{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=344}}<ref>''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 28), p. 98.</ref> Engel, Kristó and Molnár, who accept the reliability of this report, wrote that Álmos's death was a ritual murder, similar to the sacrifice of the Khazar khagans in case of a disaster affecting their people.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=19}}{{sfn|Molnár|2001|p=13}}{{sfn|Kristó|1996|pp=191–192}} In contrast with them, Róna-Tas states that even if the report on Álmos's murder "reflects true event, the only possible explanation would be that Árpád or someone in his entourage" killed the aged prince.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=344}} Spinei rejects the ''Illuminated Chronicle'''s report on Álmos's murder in Transylvania, because the last mention of Álmos in the contrasting narration of the ''Gesta Hungarorum'' is connected to a siege of [[Ungvár]] (Uzhhorod, [[Ukraine]]) by the Hungarians.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=72}} The latter chronicle says that Álmos appointed Árpád "as leader and master" of the Hungarians on this occasion.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=15}}<ref>''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 13), p. 37.</ref>

===Reign===
[[File:Aquincum-Óbuda-01.jpg|190px|thumb|right|alt="The city of King Attila" (Aquincum, Budapest)|Ruins of [[Aquincum]]{{spaced ndash}}"city of [[Attila the Hun|King Attila]]" in the ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]''<ref>''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'', note 1 on p. 8.</ref>]]

Árpád's name "is completely unknown" to all sources written in [[East Francia]], which was one of the main powers of the Carpathian Basin at the turn of the 9th and 10th&nbsp;centuries.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=201}} These sources, including the ''[[Annales Alamannici]]'' and the ''Annales Eisnidlenses'', only mention an other Hungarian leader, Kurszán.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=201}} According to Kristó and other historians, these sources suggest that Kurszán must have been the ''gyula'' commanding the Hungarian forces, while Árpád succeeded his murdered father as the sacred ''kende''.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=201}}{{sfn|Molnár|2001|p=201}} Proposing a contrasting theory, the Romanian historian Curta wrote that Kurszán was the ''kende'' and Árpád ''gyula'' only succeeded him when Kurszán was murdered by [[Bavaria]]ns in 902 or 904.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=201}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=189}}

In contrast to nearly contemporaneous sources, Hungarian chronicles written centuries after the events{{mdash}}for instance, the ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'' and the ''[[Illuminated Chronicle]]''{{mdash}}emphasize Árpád's pre-eminent role in the conquest of the Carpathian Basin.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=19}}{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=18}} The ''Gesta Hungarorum'' also highlights Árpád's military skills and his generosity.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=19}} This chronicle also emphasizes that Tétény, one of the heads of the seven Hungarian tribes, acquired "the land of Transylvania for himself and his posterity" only after Árpád had authorized him to conquer it.<ref>''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 24), p. 59.</ref>{{sfn|Madgearu|2005|pp=91–92}}

{{Quote|''Having crossed the Danube, they encamped beside the Danube as far as Budafelhévíz. Hearing this, all the Romans living throughout the land of Pannonia, saved their lives by flight. Next day, Prince Árpád and all his leading men with all the warriors of Hungary entered the [[Aquincum|city of King Attila]] and they saw all the royal palaces, some ruined to the foundations, others not, and they admired beyond measure the stone buildings and were happier than can be told that they had deserved to take without fighting the city of [[Attila the Hun|King Attila]], of whose line Prince Árpád descended. They feasted every day with great joy in the palace of King Attila, sitting alongside one another, and all the melodies and sweet sounds of zithers and pipes along with all the songs of minstrels were presented to them&nbsp;... Prince Árpád gave great lands and properties to the guests staying with them, and, when they heard this, many guests thronged to him and gladly stayed with him.''|[[Bele Regis Notarius|Anonymous]]: ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]''<ref>''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 46), pp. 100–101.</ref>}}

The ''Gesta Hungarorum'' says that Árpád took "an oath of the leading men and warriors of Hungary," and "had his son, [[Zoltán of Hungary|Prince Zoltán]] elevated" to prince in his life.<ref name="Anonymus p. 115">''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 52), p. 115.</ref>{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=21}} However, the reliability of this report and the list of the [[Grand Prince of the Hungarians|grand princes]] in the ''Gesta Hungarorum'' is dubious.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=20}} For instance, it ignores [[Fajsz]], who ruled when Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus was completing his ''De Administrando Imperio'' around 950.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=19–20}}

===Death===
[[File:Nagymegyer176.JPG|190px|thumb|right|alt=Árpád's statue in Nagymegyer (Ve?ký Meder, Slovakia)|Árpád's statue in [[Nagymegyer]] (Ve?ký Meder, [[Slovakia]])]]

The date of Árpád's death is debated.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=20}} The ''Gesta Hungarorum'' states that he died in 907.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=19}}{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=20}} However, Kristó wrote that he actually died in 900 or later because the ''Gesta'' says 903 is the starting date of the Hungarian "land-taking" instead of its actual date around 895.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=20}} If the ''Gesta'''s report on his funeral is reliable, Árpád was buried "at the head of a small river that flows through a stone culvert to the city of King Attila" where a village, Fehéregyháza, developed near [[Buda]] a century later.<ref name="Anonymus p. 115"/>{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=20}}

==Legacy==
The Hungarians arrived in their new homeland within the Carpathians under Árpád.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=21}} Árpád is the principal actor in the ''Gesta Hungarorum'', which attributes "almost all memorable events" of the "Hungarian land-taking" to him.{{sfn|Madgearu|2005|p=25}} Furthermore, until the extinction of the male line of his dynasty in 1301, Hungary was ruled by "a single line of princes", all descending from Árpád.{{sfn|Molnár|2001|p=13}} Árpád is still famed among the Hungarians as ''honalapító'' or the "founder of our country".{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=21}}

The '''New Zealand state highway network''' is the major national [[highway]] network in [[New Zealand]]. Nearly 100 roads in the [[North Island|North]] and [[South Island]]s are state highways. All state highways are administered by the [[NZ Transport Agency]].

The highways were originally designated using a two-tier system, national (SH 1 to 8) and provincial, with national highways having a higher standard and funding priorities. Now all are state highways, and the network consists of SH 1 running the length of both islands, SH 2 to 5 and 10 to 58 in the North Island, and SH 6 to 8 and 60 to 99 in the South Island, numbered approximately north to south. State highways are marked by red shield-shaped signs with white numbering (shields for the former provincial highways were blue). Road maps usually number state highways in this fashion.

Only two percent of the network is composed of dual-carriageway [[motorways]] with grade-separated access, but they carry ten percent of all New Zealand traffic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/network/operating/faqs.html#motorway |title=Frequently asked questions: How many kilometres of motorway are there in New Zealand? |publisher= NZ Transport Agency |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=25 July 2014 }}</ref> The majority of the state highway network is made up of single-carriageway roads with one lane each way and at-grade access.

==History ==
[[Image:NZ-highway-junction.jpg|thumb|right|A typical New Zealand state highway junction sign: State Highways 1 and 85 meet in [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]], Otago.]]

In the early days all roads were managed by local road boards. The idea of a national network of highways did not emerge until the early twentieth century, when a series of pieces of legislation was passed to allow for the designation of main highways (in 1922) and state highways (in 1936). This saw the National Roads Board, an arm of the Ministry of Works, responsible for the state highway network.

From 1989 to 2008, state highways were the responsibility of [[Transit New Zealand]], a Crown entity. In 1996 the funding of the network was removed from the operational functions with the creation of Transfund New Zealand, which then merged with the Land Transport Safety Authority to create [[Land Transport New Zealand]]. That was done to ensure that funding of state highways was considered on a similar basis to funding for local roads and regional council subsidised public transport. In August 2008, Transit and Land Transport NZ merged to become the NZ Transport Agency.

Every five years the NZ Transport Agency will embark on a state highway review to consider whether the existing network should be expanded or reduced, according to traffic flows, changes in industry, tourism and development. Highways around [[Tauranga]] and in the [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]]/[[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]] region have undergone major changes in recent years.

==Distance markers==
[[Image:NZ-WaikouaitiBridge.jpg|thumb|right|State Highway 1 crosses the [[Waikouaiti River]] in [[Otago]], 667.0 kilometres from [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]].]]

State highways are marked with posts at irregular intervals giving the distance in kilometres from the start of the highway. Until recently, all bridges on the network had at each end a small plaque showing the distance from the start of the highway, usually in the form of a number in kilometres, an oblique stroke, and a further number in kilometres, accurate to the nearest 10 metres. A plaque marked 237/14.12, for example, indicated that the bridge was 14.12&nbsp;km past a set distance post, that post being 237&nbsp;km from the start of the highway. In about 2004 these plaques were replaced by a new system, which gives each bridge a single number showing the distance from the start of the highway in hundreds of metres. Under the new system the bridge above would be numbered 2511, as it is 251.1&nbsp;km from the start of the highway. Motorway on- and off-ramps are numbered using the same system.

In this way, travellers can accurately assess their location, and road authorities can identify each bridge uniquely.

Sometimes, houses with [[Rural Address Property IDentification|RAPID]] numbering can also be used to determine the position. For example, house number 1530 is 15.3&nbsp;km from the start of the highway.

== Volumes ==
From 2006 information, the busiest stretch of SH 1 was just south of the Auckland Central Motorway Junction, on/near the [[Newmarket Viaduct]], with over 200,000 vehicles (either way) each day. The least busy parts of the network (excluding off-ramps and on-ramps) are on SH 43 north-east of [[Whangamomona]], with fewer than 120 vehicles (counting both directions) in a day.<ref>{{cite web | title =State Highway Traffic Data Booklet 2002-2006 | publisher = [[Transit NZ]] | date = May 2007 | url = http://www.transit.govt.nz/content_files/shtv/SHTV-2002-2006.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =22 October 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080411172718/http://www.transit.govt.nz/content_files/shtv/SHTV-2002-2006.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-11}}</ref> Some of the less trafficked highways still include unsealed sections.

==Safety==
In early 2008, Transit New Zealand unveiled [[KiwiRAP]] (the New Zealand Road Assessment Programme) in cooperation with other government agencies and the [[New Zealand Automobile Association]]. The system, based on similar programs overseas, categorises New Zealand state highways according to the safety of discrete 'links' (sections of the network, with a total of 10,856&nbsp;km of highways separated into 172 links ranging in length from 2.4&nbsp;km to 318&nbsp;km). These are graded according to their 'individual risk' and their 'collective risk' based on historical crash data and traffic volumes.<ref name="KIWIRAP">{{cite news |title=Country's deadliest roads identified |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/238985/Countrys-deadliest-roads-identified |agency=NZPA |newspaper=The Dominion Post |date=27 January 2008 |accessdate=25 July 2014}}</ref>

The individual risk is based on the likelihood of a single driver experiencing an accident while travelling the link in question. As of 2008, the three least safe sections of the network based on individual risk were State Highway 62 from [[Spring Creek, New Zealand|Spring Creek]] to [[Renwick, New Zealand|Renwick]] (Marlborough), State Highway 37 to [[Waitomo Caves]] and State Highway 94 from [[Te Anau]] to [[Milford Sound]].<ref name="KIWIRAP"/>

The collective risk is based on the total number of crashes that occurred on the link, which pushes safer but very highly travelled sections of the network to the top of the statistical category. As of 2008, the three least safe sections of the network based on collective risk were all on State Highway 2, on the sections from [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]] to [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]], [[Mount Maunganui]] to [[Paengaroa]] and [[Bay View, New Zealand|Bay View]] to Napier.<ref name="KIWIRAP"/>

Both categories of assessment are to be used as an advisory tool for both drivers to inform them of dangerous road sections as well as to allow traffic controlling authorities to prioritise maintenance and safety improvements.

==Specific sections==
[[Image:NZ-SH1 map.png|thumb|right|State Highway 1]]

===State Highway 1===
{{ main|New Zealand State Highway 1}}

State Highway 1 can be considered as a single highway running the length of both main islands, broken in the middle by the ferry connection at [[Cook Strait]]. It connects five of the seven largest urban areas and includes the country's busiest stretch of road.

===Touring routes===
Many sections of state highway provided are marketed as [[tourist highway]]s, sometimes jointly with local roading providers. Transit maintains [[traffic sign]]s on and near state highways to help promote these routes.<ref>{{cite web | title =Touring Route Signing Policy | publisher = [[Transit NZ]] | date = 1999-10-19 | url = http://www.transit.govt.nz/content_files/technical/Amendment39_PDFFile.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-07-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928062033/http://www.transit.govt.nz/content_files/technical/Amendment39_PDFFile.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}</ref> These include:
* [[Twin Coast Discovery Highway]] - ring route around the [[Auckland Region|Auckland]] and [[Northland Region|Northland]] regions
* [[Pacific Coast Highway (New Zealand)|Pacific Coast Highway]] - route going around the north-east coast of the North Island, joining Auckland and [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]]
* [[Thermal Explorer Highway]] - route going from Auckland to Napier through the [[geothermal (geology)|geothermally]] active centre of the North Island
* [[Surf Highway]] - alternative name for SH45 from [[New Plymouth, New Zealand|New Plymouth]] to [[Hawera, New Zealand|Hawera]]. Named due to the number of surf breaks along the [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]] coastline.
* [[Classic New Zealand Wine Trail]] - route through New Zealand's wine-making region, from Napier to [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]], via [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]], [[Woodville, New Zealand|Woodville]], [[Masterton]], [[Martinborough]], [[Wellington]], and [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]]. Requires a [[ferry]] crossing across [[Cook Strait]] between Wellington and Picton.
* [[Alpine Pacific Triangle]] - a triangular loop including sections of SH 1, 7 and Route 70 ([[Image:Regional Route 70.png|20px]]) linking the popular destinations of [[Hanmer Springs]], [[Kaikoura]] and [[Waipara]]
* [[Inland Scenic Route]] [[Image:Regional Route 72 NZ.png|20px]] - formerly SH 72, this road goes from [[Amberley, New Zealand|Amberley]] (or [[Woodend, New Zealand|Woodend]]) to [[Winchester, New Zealand|Winchester]] (near [[Timaru]]). This road goes between the Canterbury Plains and the [[Southern Alps]].
* [[Great Alpine Highway]] - Highway 73 going from [[Christchurch]] in Canterbury over the Southern Alps via [[Arthurs Pass]] to Kumara Junction on the West Coast. Will start in the near future.
* [[Southern Scenic Route]] - route going along the southern coast of the South Island from [[Dunedin]] via [[the Catlins]], [[Invercargill]] and [[Riverton, New Zealand|Riverton]] to [[Te Anau]]

'''''Reinventing the Steel''''' is the ninth and final studio album by American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Pantera]], released on March 14, 2000 through [[EastWest Records]].

==Album information==
In Australia a two-disc Tour Edition of the album was released. The first disc consists of the album proper, while the second is an unofficial hits compilation. This is now a collector's item. An edited version of the song "Death Rattle" was used on an episode of ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' titled "[[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 2)#Pre-Hibernation Week / Life of Crime|Pre-Hibernation Week]]". This track was also featured on ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants: Original Theme Highlights]]'', released August 14, 2001.

===Lyrics and style===
''Reinventing the Steel'' contains lyrics mostly about the band itself, as on "We'll Grind that Axe for a Long Time" (where the band members tell about how they have kept it "true" throughout the years, while many of their peers "sucked up for the fame") and "I'll Cast a Shadow" (about Pantera's influence on the genre). There are also songs about their fans, like "Goddamn Electric" and "You've Got to Belong To It". "Goddamn Electric" mentions [[Black Sabbath]], and [[Slayer]], two of the band's main influences. The band members dedicated ''Reinventing the Steel'' to their fans, whom they viewed as their brothers and sisters.

===Cover art===
The cover art is a snapshot taken from the video of "[[Revolution Is My Name]]", the first single of the album.

===Other notes===
Unlike other Pantera releases, two b-sides were recorded during the Reinventing the Steel sessions, those being "Avoid The Light" and "Immortally Insane", found on the [[Dracula 2000]] and [[Heavy Metal 2000]] soundtracks, respectively.

The '''Ornithorhynchidae''' are one of the two extant families in the order [[Monotreme|Monotremata]], and contains the [[platypus]] and its extinct relatives. The other family is the Tachyglossidae, or [[echidna]]s.  Within Ornithorhynchidae are two [[genus|genera]], ''[[Obdurodon]]'' and ''[[Ornithorhynchus]]'':

*Family Ornithorhynchidae
**Genus †''[[Obdurodon]]'' — an ancient branch of the platypus family
***†''[[Obdurodon dicksoni]]'' 
***†''[[Obdurodon insignis]]'' 
***†''[[Obdurodon sudamericanum|Obdurodon/Monotrematum sudamericanum]]'' 
***†''[[Obdurodon tharalkooschild]]'' 
**Genus ''[[Platypus|Ornithorhynchus]]''
***''[[Ornithorhynchus anatinus]]'' (the modern [[platypus]])
Another two genera, ''[[Steropodon]]'' and ''[[Teinolophos]]'', may also belong to Ornithorhynchidae. However, they are both very ancient, and scientific literature seems to indicate they are closely related to, but not a part of, the Ornithorhynchids.

The extinct ''Ornithorhynchus maximus'' was once included in ''Ornithorhynchus'', but has now been concluded to be from the echidna family as ''[[Zaglossus robustus]]''.{{cn|date=September 2012}}

'''Buck Naked and the Bare Bottom Boys''' were an [[United States|American]] [[rockabilly]] band from [[San Francisco]], [[California]].

==History==
Buck Naked and the Bare Bottom Boys came out of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in the mid-1980s(originally from [[Omaha, Nebraska]]). Lead singer Phillip Bury (better known under his ''[[stage name]]'' "Buck Naked") performed on stage wearing only cowboy boots, a cowboy hat, a guitar, and a strategically placed [[toilet plunger]]. Filling out the band were Buck's brother, Stephen Bury (taking the stage name "Hector Naked") and David Wees (known on stage as "Stinky LePew"). Despite its name, the rest of the band were more or less fully clothed on stage.

The band became friends with [[Primus (band)|Primus]]. Sharing many aesthetic similarities, the latter would make numerous tributes to Bury, either in their videos: "[[Mr. Krinkle]]" features a painting, "[[Wynona's Big Brown Beaver]]" features a bass drum head, and in the album credits to 1993's ''[[Pork Soda]]''. 

The band's career came to an abrupt end in 1992 when Bury was shot and killed while walking his dog in [[Golden Gate Park|Golden Gate Park's Panhandle]] by a cab driver named Michael Kagan, who had for many years fed [[pigeon]]s there. According to witnesses at the trial, Kagan had been known to threaten dogs who chased the pigeons, and, on occasion, their owners. Kagan appealed the case to the [[California Supreme Court]], but his conviction for [[manslaughter]] was upheld. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison, the maximum term allowed.

In [[media industry]] [[jargon]], '''development hell''' (or '''development limbo''') is a state during which a film or other project remains in [[development (film)|development]] without progressing to [[film production|production]]. A [[film]], [[video game]], [[television program]], [[screenplay]], [[computer program]],<ref>{{cite journal |title=Interactive development: The new hell |last=Marx |first=Andy |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location=New York |date=February 28, 1994 |volume=354 |issue=4 |page=1 }}</ref> concept, or idea stranded in development hell takes an especially long time to start production, or never does. Projects in development hell are not officially cancelled, but work on them slows or stops.

==Overview==
Film industry companies often buy the [[film rights]] to many popular novels, video games, and comic books, but it may take years for such properties to be successfully brought to the cinema, and often with considerable changes to the plot, characters, and general tone to have the film [[Dumbing down|dumbed down]] for a mainstream audience. The original creators of the source material usually have very little to no involvement in the films [[creative control]], creating a divide among fans.<ref>{{cite news |title=How My Novel Was Almost 'Developed' Into Oblivion |first=Warren |last=Adler |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=October 3, 1999 |page=AR11 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50E11F93D5A0C708CDDA90994D1494D81 }}</ref> This pre-production process can last for months or years. More often than not, a project trapped in this state for a prolonged period of time will be abandoned by all interested parties or canceled outright. As Hollywood starts ten times as many projects as are those released, many scripts will end up in this limbo state.<ref>"Cover Story: Writers Paid for Movies Never Made," Spillman, Susan. USA Today. McLean, Va.: January 16, 1991. pg. D1</ref> This happens most often with projects that have multiple interpretations and affect several points of view.<ref>"Dept. of development hell," Kerrie Mitchell. Premiere. (American edition). New York: February 2005.Vol.18, Iss. 5; pg. 40</ref><ref>"Books Into Movies: Part 2," Warren, Patricia Nell. Lambda Book Report. Washington: April 2000.Vol.8, Iss. 9; pg. 9. (Best selling novel [[The Front Runner]] has spent over 25 years in development hell)</ref>

==Causes==
In the case of a film or television screenplay, the [[screenwriter]] may have successfully sold a screenplay to [[Film producer|producer]]s or [[film studio|studio]] executives, but then new executives assigned to the project may raise objections to prior decisions, mandating rewrites and recasting. As [[film director|director]]s and [[actor]]s join the project, further rewrites and recasting may be done, to accommodate the needs of the new talents involved in the project. Should the project fail to meet their needs, they might leave the project or simply refuse to complete it, resulting in further rewrites and recasting. At any point, a project may be forced to begin again from scratch.

It may also be the case that the screenwriters have an issue with the final rights agreement after signing an option, requiring research on the [[chain of title]]. The project may be stuck until the situation is resolved and project participants are happy with the full terms, or the project is abandoned.

When a film is in development but never receives the necessary production funds, another studio may execute a [[turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround deal]] and produce the film to make it successful. An example of this is when [[Columbia Pictures]] developed, but then stopped production of ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. [[Universal Pictures]] then picked up the film and made it a success.  If a studio completely abandons a film project, the costs are written off as part of the studio's overhead.<ref>McDonald, Paul & Wasko, Janet (2008) ''Hollywood Film Industry''. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing. p. 54</ref> Sometimes studios or producers will deliberately halt production in order to stop competition on a different project, or to ensure that people invested will be available for other projects that the studio prefers.

During a potential writer's strike in 2001, major studios wanted to spend less time and energy bidding on longer-term developments, such as film rights to books. Instead they focused more on buying projects that would immediately receive a [[green-light]] such as big budget action thrillers, and high concept comedies written by established and credible writers.  Studio executives put all uncertain scripts and pitches on the shelves during this time to avoid taking a chance on a long-term development, and only wanted projects that were ready to go into production.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Some studios and producers still bought film rights to books, but only ones that had successful sales. Examples of this are [[Dino De Laurentiis]]' $9 million acquisition of Thomas Harris' ''[[Hannibal (novel)|Hannibal]]'' and [[Miramax]] purchasing [[Mario Puzo]]'s ''[[Omertà (novel)|Omertà]]'' for $2–$3 million.<ref>Lyons, Charles (2001) Development Hell freezing over? ''Variety'' 382(1). 1-71</ref>

==Related concepts==
In [[Software release life cycle|software development]], unreleased products that have been in long-term development are considered a type of [[vaporware]]. In film and television screenplay, unreleased products that have been in long-term development are considered as "vaporfilm".  The [[anime]] [[OVA]] adaptation of ''[[Alien Nine]]'' has been cited by fans and critics as an example of "vaporfilm" because it was put on hiatus in 2002 after four episodes.

*'''''[[Superman Lives]]''''' is the name given to a project begun by producer [[Jon Peters]] in 1993 as '''Superman Reborn'''.

[[Jonathan Lemkin]] was hired to write the initial script, but Peters brought on a series of additional screenwriters to overhaul the script, including [[Gregory Poirier]] in 1995 and [[Kevin Smith]] in 1996.  Director [[Tim Burton]] became attached to the film, with [[Nick Cage]] cast as the Man of Steel, and several more screenwriters were brought on board for several more rewrites.  Burton backed out in late 1998 citing differences with producer Peters and the studios, additional writers and directors were attached to the project at various times over the next few years.  Peters project went through several more permutations before evolving into ''[[Superman Returns]]'', released in 2006, 13 years after initial development began.<ref name=corporate>{{cite book | author = David Hughes | title = The Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made | year = 2001 | publisher = [[Independent Publishers Group]] | pages = 172–186 | isbn = 1-55652-449-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kevin Smith's ''Superman Lives'' cast|work=Superman Homepage|date=1999-03-02|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/news/1999-news/1999-news-movie.php?topic=1999-news-movie/0302|accessdate=2008-02-04}}</ref>

===Video games===
*'''''[[MOTHER 3]]'''''<br>{{main|Development of Mother 3}}<br>A sequel to the 1996 cult classic ''[[EarthBound]]'', this game is often considered one of the more notable examples of development hell. The game was initially intended to be released on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] like its predecessor,<ref>http://www.1101.com/nintendo/nin13/nin13_2.htm</ref> before shifting focus to the [[N64DD|Nintendo 64 Disk Drive]], where it was planned to be in full 3D, with real-world time and other abilities, such as drawing on the faces of characters. Following the failure of the Disk Drive, the game was shifted to the standard [[Nintendo 64]],<ref>http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&cId=3154276</ref> before the development team's inexperience with 3D-oriented video game creation and a large series of delays led to the game being quietly cancelled in 2002. Eventually, assets from the cancelled project were later collected and converted to a 2D format, and the project restarted development on the [[Game Boy Advance]]. The newly formatted game was announced in the initial trailer for ''MOTHER 1+2'', a Japan-only GBA [[multicart]] containing downsized ports of ''[[Mother (video game)|MOTHER]]'' and ''MOTHER 2'' (''EarthBound''). Eventually, nine years after its conception, ''MOTHER 3'' was released on the Game Boy advance in 2006. However, the game officially remains Japan-exclusive, motivating ''EarthBound'''s [[Cult following|"religiously dedicated"]] [[EarthBound fandom|fandom]] to [[Mother 3 fan translation|translate]] the game themselves and distribute ROM patches for it online.
*'''''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]'''''<br> A sequel to the mega-popular ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' from 1995, the original game was announced on [[History of E3#1998|E3 1998]] to be released in January 1999, but was pushed back to 2001. The game was re-written and redeveloped, and a teaser trailer was shown in 2007. The game was then officially announced in 2010, and released in 2011. The game had negative reviews.<ref>[http://duke.a-13.net/ The Duke Nukem Forever List<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

{{Refimprove|date= March 2008}}

'''Total Operations Processing System''', or '''TOPS''', is a computer system for managing the [[locomotive]]s and [[rolling stock]] ([[railroad car]]s) owned by a rail system.  It was originally developed by the [[United States|American]] [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific Railroad]] and was widely sold; it is best known in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] for its use by [[British Rail]] and its successors.

== Early development ==
The [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] was ahead of the pack in its embracing of technology. In the early 1960s it developed a computer system called “Total Operations Processing System”, or TOPS. The purpose was to take all the paperwork associated with a locomotive or [[railroad]] car - its maintenance history, its allocation to division and depot and duty, its status, its location, and much more - and keep it in computer form, constantly updated by terminals at every maintenance facility.<ref name=s-b>{{Simmons-Biddle}}, Pp515-516.</ref> On paper, this information was difficult to keep track of, difficult to keep up to date, and difficult to query, requiring many telephone calls. Computerizing this information enabled a railroad to keep better track of its assets, and to utilize them better.<ref name=s-b/>

In order to offset the development costs of the system, Southern Pacific sold it to other railroads. A number of American railroads took to the system, as did many others around the world.

== Adoption by British Rail ==
In the mid to late 1960s [[British Rail]] was searching around for ways to increase efficiency, and came across the TOPS system in a 1968 presentation by an IBM US Transportation Industry Representative who shortly after formed IBM World Trade Corp's Transportation Industry Centre in Brussels (E. Wrathall). They purchased the system (along with source code, as was typical for such a large mainframe-based system in those days) and implemented it, assisted by Southern Pacific IT experts. At the time, the British Government operated a "Buy British" policy for the nationalised industries, and the purchase of an [[IBM System/360]] mainframe to operate TOPS had to be approved by the Cabinet of Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]].

The adoption of the TOPS system made for some changes in the way the railway system in Britain worked. Hitherto, locomotives were numbered in three different series. [[Steam locomotives of British Railways|Steam locomotives]] carried unadorned numbers up to five digits long. [[Diesel locomotive]]s carried one to four-digit numbers prefixed with a letter 'D', and electric locomotives with a letter 'E'. Thus, up to three locomotives could carry the same number. TOPS could not handle this, and it also required similar locomotives to be numbered in a consecutive series in terms of classification, in order that they might be treated together as a group.

=== TOPS Numbering Under British Rail ===
{{Details3|[[British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification#1973 numbering and classification - TOPS|British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification]] and [[British carriage and wagon numbering and classification]]}}
[[Image:British Rail Class 31-4 dataplate.jpg|thumb|''Brush Type 2'' locomotives became [[British Rail Class 31|Class 31]] under TOPS. This is the data panel from a Class 31/4; the 31/4 subclass being used for locomotives with [[Electric Train Heating]].]]

Sequentiality was all that was required, but with the requirement to renumber, it was decided to adopt a logical system for classification, and the five- or six-digit TOPS number was divided into two parts. No class of locomotive or [[multiple unit]] numbered over 1000 examples, so the last three digits were used for the individual number between 001 and 999 in that class. The first two or three digits were used to denote the class of locomotive or multiple unit. The numbers were often written in two space separated groups, such as "47 401" to highlight that division, but the TOPS system actually stored and displayed them without the space: "47401". Sub-classifications were indicated in the TOPS system with a slash and a subclass number, e.g. "47/4". It was convention—though not enforced within the TOPS system—that subclass numbers were boundaries in the locomotive numbering system, such that class "47/4" started with number "47 401". If there were more than 99 numbers in a subclass, the number series extended to the next value of the third digit; thus, since there were more than 200 locomotives in class "47/4", subclasses "47/5" and "47/6" did not exist, and the next valid subclass by convention was "47/7" starting with "47 701".  However, in some cases, the sequences do not match, e.g. [[British Rail Class 158|158/'''0''']] numbers start at 158 '''7'''01.

Locomotives are assigned classes 01–98: diesel locomotives 01–70, DC [[electric locomotive]]s 71–79, AC electric locomotives 80–96, departmental locos (those not in revenue-earning use) 97, and steam locomotives 98. One oddity was the inclusion of British Rail's shipping fleet in the system as Class 99. [[Diesel multiple unit]]s (DMUs) with mechanical or hydraulic transmission are classified 100–199, with electric transmission 200–299. [[Electric multiple unit]]s (EMUs) are given the subsequent classes; 300–399 are overhead AC units (including AC/DC dual-voltage units), while Southern Region DC [[third rail]] EMUs are 400–499, other DC EMUs 500–599.

Most classes in the 600–999 range are not currently in use, but selected numbers in the 900 series have been used for departmental multiple units, mostly converted from former passenger units. There are also a number of units currently under construction or being planned that will utilise the 700 and 800 series, which include:

* [[British Rail Class 700|Class 700]] (for the [[Thameslink Programme]], planned to enter service as early as 2016)
* [[British Rail Class 800|Class 800]] and [[British Rail Class 801|Class 801]] (for the [[Intercity Express Programme]], planned for service in 2017)

[[Coach (rail)|Coaching stock]] and individual multiple unit cars are allocated five-digit numbers; since the early 1980s it has been forbidden for them to have the same numbers as locomotives, but before then duplication was possible because they carried a prefix letter, which was considered part of the number.

== Recent history ==
TOPS has grown very out of date in recent decades. It is a [[text terminal|text-terminal]], mainframe-driven system which is not very user-friendly, cryptic, hard to use and prone to operator error because of its cryptic displays and command set. In addition, it is written in its own programming language, TOPSTRAN (not strictly speaking a separate language but a set of IBM Assembler macros), and it is increasingly hard to find and train developers to maintain it. The division of British Rail and privatisation has also hurt TOPS, because it was never really designed for that; some Train Operating Companies do not keep information as up to date as they should.

Attempts have been made to 'skin' the system with a more user-friendly interface, called TOPS 2000; in addition, there are other parallel systems now, such as [[TRUST]] and Genius, but none has yet supplanted the TOPS system.

== Sample output ==
This is a typical report that a TOPS clerk could generate. The train in question is a 25 wagon freight train travelling from Over & Wharton, near [[Winsford]], to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] West Junction.<ref>[http://www.sddt.co.uk/newsletters/NewsLetter%208%20Oct%202001.htm South Devon Railway newsletter 8]</ref>

'''Magdalena Nile del Río''' (26 December 1906 &ndash; 22 August 2003) was an Argentine professional singer and movie actress, better known as '''Imperio Argentina'''; she became a citizen of [[Spain]] in 1999.

Del Río performed in Argentina's theaters, where she had a long and successful career. At that time, her stage name was ''Pettit Imperio''. But her most successful moments came after she moved to Spain. It was there that she changed her name to ''Imperio Argentina'', as a way to honor her "other country".

'''Jorge Rafael Videla''' ({{IPA-es|?xorxe rafa?el ?i?ðela}}; 2 August 1925 – 17 May 2013) was a senior commander in the [[Argentine Army]] and dictator of [[Argentina]] from 1976 to 1981.

He came to power in [[1976 Argentine coup|''a coup d'état'']] that deposed [[Isabel Martínez de Perón]]. Two years after the return of a [[representative democracy|representative]] democratic government in 1983, he was prosecuted in the [[Juicio a las Juntas|Trial of the Juntas]] for [[Dirty War|large-scale human rights abuses]] and [[crimes against humanity]] that took place under his rule, including kidnappings or [[forced disappearance]], widespread torture and [[extrajudicial murder]] of activists, political opponents (either real, suspected or alleged) as well as their families, at secret concentration camps.

Videla was also convicted of the theft of many babies born during the captivity of their mothers at the illegal detention centres and passing them on for illegal adoption by associates of the regime.

==Early life and family==
Jorge Rafael Videla was born on 2 August 1925 in the city of [[Mercedes, Buenos Aires Province|Mercedes]]. He was the third of five sons born to Colonel Rafael Eugenio Videla Bengolea (1888–1952) and María Olga Redondo Ojea (1897–1987) and was christened in honor of his two older twin brothers, who had died of [[measles]] in 1923. Videla's family was a prominent one in [[San Luis Province]], and many of his ancestors had held high public offices. His grandfather Jacinto had been governor of San Luis between 1891 and 1893, and his great-great-grandfather [[Blas Videla]] had fought in the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] and had later been a leader of the [[Unitarian Party]] in San Luis.<ref name="ReferenceA">Seoane-Muleiro: ''El Dictador''. Ed. Sudamericana (2001).</ref>

On April 7, 1948, Jorge Videla married Alicia Raquel Hartridge (born on September 28, 1927) daughter of Samuel Alejandro Hartridge Parkes (1890-1967), an [[English Argentine]] professor of physics and Argentine ambassador to [[Turkey]], and María Isabel Lacoste Álvarez (1894-1939).<ref>Ronald Hilton, [http://books.google.com/books?id=vIuaAAAAIAAJ&lpg=PA103&ots=hCJsIhH77E&dq=%22samuel%20woodsworth%20hartridge%22&pg=PA103#v=onepage&q=%22hartridge%22&f=false Who’s is Who in Latin America: Part V, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay], Stanford University Press 1950, p. 103</ref> They had seven children: María Cristina (1949), Jorge Horacio (1950), Alejandro Eugenio (1951–1971), María Isabel (1958), Pedro Ignacio (1966), Fernando Gabriel (1961) and Rafael Patricio (1953). Two of these, Rafael Patricio and Fernando Gabriel, joined the [[Argentine Army]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Army career==
Videla joined the [[National Military College]] (''Colegio Militar de la Nación'') on {{Nowrap|3 March}} 1942 and graduated on {{Nowrap|21 December}} 1944 with the rank of [[second lieutenant]]. After steady promotion as a junior officer in the infantry, he attended the War College between 1952 and 1954 and graduated as a qualified [[staff officer]]. Videla served at the Ministry of Defence from 1958 to 1960 and thereafter he directed the Military Academy until 1962. In 1971, he was promoted to [[brigadier general]] and appointed by [[Alejandro Agustin Lanusse]] as Director of the National Military College.  In late 1973 the head of the Army, Leandro Anaya, appointed Videla as the Chief of Staff of the Army. During July and {{Nowrap|August 1975}}, Videla was the Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (''Estado Mayor Conjunto'') of the [[Argentine Armed Forces]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fuerzas-armadas.mil.ar/historia/autoridades.asp|title=Estado Mayor Conjunto}}</ref> In {{Nowrap|August 1975}}, the President, [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel Perón]], appointed Videla to the Army's senior position, the [[List of senior officers of the Argentine Army|General Commander of the Army]].

==Coup d'état==
{{main|National Reorganization Process}}
[[File:Jorge Rafael Videla Oath.PNG|thumb|left|Lieutenant General Jorge Rafael Videla swearing the Oath as he becomes the President of Argentina.]]
Upon the death of President [[Juan Perón]], his widow and Vice President Isabel became President. Videla headed a military coup which deposed her on {{Nowrap|24 March}} 1976, during increasing violence, social unrest and economic problems. A military [[military dictatorship|junta]] was formed, made up of him, representing the [[Argentine Army|Army]]; Admiral [[Emilio Massera]] representing the [[Argentine Navy|Navy]]; and Brigadier General [[Orlando Ramón Agosti]] representing the [[Argentine Air Force|Air Force]].<ref>Unlike most other countries, in the Armed Forces of Argentina, the Army rank of Lieutenant General (''Teniente General''), the Navy rank of Admiral (''Almirante'') and the Air Force rank of Brigadier General are equal and approximate to [[three-star rank|three-star]] or [[four-star rank]]s.  See [[Military ranks of Argentina]].</ref> Two days after the coup, Videla formally assumed the post of [[President of Argentina]].

The military junta is remembered for the [[forced disappearances]] of large numbers of students.<ref>See [[Night of the Pencils]], wikipedia</ref>
The military junta took power during a period of terrorist attacks from the [[Marxism|Marxist]] groups [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|ERP]], the [[Montoneros]], FAL, FAR and FAP, who had gone underground after [[Juan Perón]]'s death in {{Nowrap|July 1974}},  and violent [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] kidnappings, tortures and assassinations from the ''[[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]]'', led by [[José López Rega]], Perón's Minister of Social Welfare, and other [[death squad]]s. The ''Baltimore Sun'' reported at the beginning of 1976 that, 
<blockquote>"In the jungle-covered mountains of Tucuman, long known as 'Argentina's garden', Argentines are fighting Argentines in a Vietnam-style civil war. So far, the outcome is in doubt. But there is no doubt about the seriousness of the combat, which involves 2,000 or so leftist guerrillas and perhaps as many as 10,000 soldiers."<ref>"'Viet war' growing in Argentina," James Nelson Goodsell, ''The Baltimore Sun,'' 18 January 1976</ref></blockquote> In late 1974 the ERP set up a rural front in Tucumán province and the Argentine Army deployed its 5th Mountain Brigade in counterinsurgency operations in the province. In early 1976 the mountain brigade was reinforced in the form of the 4th Airborne Infantry Brigade that had until then been withheld guarding strategic points in the city of Córdoba against ERP guerrillas and militants.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vdJGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6XsMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3887,3282259&dq= "5 Policemen Dead In Argentina Violence"] ''Times-Union'' (21 August 1975).</ref>

The members of the junta took advantage of the guerrilla threat to authorize the coup and naming the period in government as the "[[National Reorganization Process]]". In all, 293 servicemen and policemen were killed in left-wing terrorist incidents in 1975 and 1976.<ref>{{cite book|title=State Terrorism in Latin America: Chile, Argentina, and International Human Rights|last=Wright|first=Thomas C.|year=2007 |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|page=102|isbn=978-0-7425-3721-7}}</ref> Videla narrowly escaped three assassination attempts by the Montoneros and ERP between February 1976 and April 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k5AjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=daEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1133,699462&dq=|title=Argentine president escapes third assassination attempt| work=The Montreal Gazette|publisher=News.google.com|date=19 February 1977|accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref>

Justice Minister Ricardo Gil Lavedra, who formed part of the 1985 tribunal judging the military crimes committed during the Dirty War, later declared, "I sincerely believe that the majority of the victims of the illegal repression were guerrilla militants".<ref>''Amar al enemigo,'' Javier Vigo Leguizamón, p. 68, Ediciones Pasco, 2001</ref> Some 10,000 of the disappeared were guerrillas of the [[Montoneros]] (MPM), and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP).<ref name="elmundo.es">[http://www.elmundo.es/papel/hemeroteca/1995/05/04/mundo/40472.html El ex líder de los Montoneros entona un «mea culpa» parcial de su pasado], ''El Mundo'', 4 May 1995; search for "firmenich" on date 4/5/1995 at http://quiosco.elmundo.orbyt.es/Hemeroteca/Buscador.aspx {{es icon}}</ref><ref name="Cedema.org">{{Cite book|url=http://www.cedema.org/ver.php?id=2713 |title=A 32 años de la caída en combate de Mario Roberto Santucho y la Dirección Histórica del PRT-ERP |publisher=Cedema.org}}</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=E1YZy_x-hQoC&pg=PA626&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Determinants Of Gross Human Rights Violations By State And State-Sponsored Actors In Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, And Argentina (1960–1990)'', Wolfgang S.

According to human right groups, thousands of Argentines — perhaps as many as 15,000 or even 30,000<ref name="The Vanished Gallery">{{cite web|url=http://www.yendor.com/vanished/how-many.html|title=The Victims: Abducted, Tortured, Vanished |publisher=The Vanished Gallery}}</ref> — "disappeared" while in the custody of the police or the military.<ref name="The Vanished Gallery"/> 10,000 to 12,000<ref>''Detenidos-Aparecidos: Presas y Presos Políticos Desde Trelew a la Dictadura,'' Santiago Garaño, Werner Pertot, p. 26, Editorial Biblos, 2007</ref> of the "disappeared," PEN (Poder Ejecutivo Nacional) detainees held in clandestine detention camps throughout the dictatorship, were eventually released under diplomatic pressure.<ref>''Political Injustice: Authoritarianism and the Rule of Law in Brazil, Chile, and Argentina,'' Anthony W.

In the book ''[[Disposición Final]]'' by Argentine journalist Ceferino Reato, Videla confirms for the first time that between 1976 and 1983, 8.000 Argentinians have been murdered by his regime. The bodies were hidden or destroyed to prevent protests at home and abroad.<ref>{{nl icon}} [http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2668/Buitenland/article/detail/3240764/2012/04/14/Oud-dictator-Videla-onder-mijn-bewind-duizenden-mensen-vermoord.dhtml "Oud-dictator Videla: onder mijn bewind duizenden mensen vermoord,"] Volkskrant (14/4/2012)</ref> Videla also maintained that female guerrilla detainees  allowed themselves to become pregnant in the belief they wouldn't be tortured or executed, but they were.

On {{Nowrap|5 July}} 2010, Videla took full responsibility for his army's actions during his rule. "I accept the responsibility as the highest military authority during the internal war. My subordinates followed my orders," he told an Argentine court.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/>

==Conflict with Chile==
{{main|Beagle conflict}}
[[File:Jorge Rafael Videla.png|thumb|left|Lieutenant General Jorge Rafael Videla at a military parade in Buenos Aires, 1978.]]
During Videla's regime, Argentina rejected the binding [http://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXI/53-264.pdf Report and decision of the Court of Arbitration] over the [[Beagle conflict]] at the southern tip of South America and started [[Operation Soberanía]] in order to invade the islands. In 1978, however, [[Pope John Paul II]] opened a [[Papal mediation in the Beagle conflict|mediation process]]. His representative, [[Antonio Samoré]], successfully prevented full-scale war.

The conflict was not completely resolved until after Videla's time as president. Once the democratic rule was restored in 1983, the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]] (''Tratado de Paz y Amistad''), which acknowledged Chilean sovereignty over the islands, was signed and ratified by popular [[referendum]].

==Economic policy==
Videla largely left economic policies in the hands of Minister [[José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz]], who adopted a [[free trade]] and [[deregulation|deregulatory]] economic policy. During his tenure, the [[foreign debt]] increased fourfold, and disparities between the upper and lower classes became much more pronounced.<ref name=Lewis>Lewis, Paul.''The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism''. University of North Carolina Press, 1990.</ref> The period ended in a [[Historical exchange rates of Argentine currency|tenfold devaluation]] and one of the worst financial crises in Argentine history.<ref>''Argentina: From Insolvency to Growth'', [[World Bank]] Press, 1993.</ref>

==Public relations==
One of Videla's greatest challenges was his image abroad. He attributed criticism over human rights to an anti-Argentine campaign.<ref>{{es icon}} {{cite news|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-131336-2009-09-07.html|title=Una sesión de homenaje|publisher=Página/12|date=7 September 2009|accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref>
On 19 May 1976, Videla attended a luncheon with a group of Argentine intellectuals, including [[Ernesto Sábato]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], Horacio Esteban Ratti (president of the Argentine Writers Society) and Father [[Leonardo Castellani]]. The latter expressed to Videla his concern regarding the disappearance of another writer, [[Haroldo Conti]].

On 30 April 1977, [[Azucena Villaflor]], along with 13 other women, started demonstrations on the [[Plaza de Mayo]], in front of the [[Casa Rosada]] presidential palace, demanding to be told the whereabouts of their disappeared children. They became known as the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] (''Madres de Plaza de Mayo'').

[[image:Los argentinos somos derechos y humanos.jpg|thumb|Bumper sticker commissioned by the junta in 1979. The text is a pun on ''derechos humanos'', "[[human rights]]".]]
During a human rights investigation in {{Nowrap|September 1979}}, the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] denounced Videla's government, citing many disappearances and instances of abuse. In response, the junta hired the [[Burson-Marsteller#Argentina|Burson-Marsteller]] ad agency to formulate a pithy comeback: ''Los argentinos somos derechos y humanos'' (Literally, "We Argentines are honest and humane") The slogan was printed on 250,000 bumper stickers and distributed to motorists throughout Buenos Aires [[astroturfing|to create the appearance of a spontaneous support of pro-junta sentiment]], at a cost of approximately $16,117.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/03/23/elpais/p-01501.htm], ''Clarin'', 23 March 2006</ref>

Videla used the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] for political purposes. He cited the enthusiasm of the Argentine fans for their victorious football team as evidence of his personal and the junta's popularity.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/jonathanstevenson/2010/05/the_story_of_the_1978_world_cu.html The Story Of The 1978 World cup - BBC Article] Author: Jonathan Stevenson (BBC Sports Presenter).

In 1980 [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel]], leader of the Peace and Justice Service (''[[Servicio Paz y Justicia]]'', SERPAJ) organization, was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for reporting many of Argentina's human rights violations to the world at large.

==Later years==
Videla relinquished power to [[Roberto Eduardo Viola|Roberto Viola]] on {{Nowrap|29 March}} 1981; the military regime continued until it collapsed after losing the [[Falklands war]] in 1982. Democracy was restored in 1983.

The new government began prosecution of top-ranking officers for crimes committed during the dictatorship in what was called the [[Trial of the Juntas]] of 1985. Videla was convicted of numerous [[homicide]]s, [[kidnap]]ping, torture, and many other crimes. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] and was discharged from the military in 1985.

Videla was imprisoned for five years. In 1990, President [[Carlos Menem]] [[pardon]]ed Videla and many other imprisoned former members of the military regime. Menem also pardoned the leftist guerrilla commanders accused of terrorism. In a televised address to the nation, President Menem said,  "I have signed the decrees so we may begin to rebuild the country in peace, in liberty and in justice ... We come from long and cruel confrontations. There was a wound to heal."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/09/world/pardon-of-argentine-officers-angers-critics-of-the-military.html "Pardon of Argentine Officers Angers Critics of the Military"], ''The New York Times'', 9 October 1989</ref>

Videla briefly returned to prison in 1998 when a judge found him guilty of the kidnapping of babies during the [[Dirty War]], including the child of the ''desaparecida'' [[Silvia Quintela]], and the disappearances of the commanders of the  [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP), Mario Roberto Santucho and Benito Urteaga.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=103728 |title=Videla durmió en su domicilio luego de 38 días de detención |newspaper=La Nacion |publisher=Lanacion.com.ar|date=17 July 1998|accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref>  Videla spent 38 days in the old part of the [[Caseros Prison]].

In an August 2001 radio interview from exile in Spain, [[Mario Firmenich]], the commander of the [[Montoneros]] guerrilla movement, said that, "In a country that experienced a civil war, everybody has blood in their hands."<ref>[http://www.larepublica.com.uy/mundo/51817-firmenich-dijo-que-no-mato-a-nadie-inutilmente "Firmenich dijo que no mató "a nadie inútilmente"], ''La Republica'', 7 August 2001</ref>

Following the election of President [[Néstor Kirchner]] in 2003, there was a renewed widespread effort in [[Argentina]] to show the illegality of Videla's rule. The government no longer recognized Videla as having been a legal president of the country, and his portrait was removed from the military school. In 2003, Congress repealed the [[Ley de Punto Final]], which had ended prosecutions for crimes under the dictatorship. In 2005, the Argentine Supreme Court ruled that the law had been unconstitutional. The government re-opened prosecution of crimes against humanity.

According to Argentina's Center for the Legal Study of Terrorism and its Victims, guerrilla groups also were implicated in the violence, killing or wounding some 13,000 Argentines before the coup d'état that established the military dictatorship. These were considered common rather than state crimes, and had exceeded the statute of limitation by the 21st century.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203513204576047680350412562.html?mod=googlewsj "Argentina's Forgotten Terror Victims".

On 5 July 2012, Videla was convicted and sentenced to 50 years' imprisonment for his participation in a scheme to steal babies from parents detained by the military regime. According to the court decision, Videla was an accomplice "in the crimes of theft, retention and hiding of minors, as well as replacing their identities."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/05/world/americas/argentina-baby-theft-trial/index.html?hpt=hp_t1|title=Former dictators found guilty in Argentine baby-stealing trial|newspaper=CNN|accessdate=5 July 2012|date=5 July 2012}}</ref> The children were given to military families for illegal adoption, and their identities were hidden.

Human rights organizations throughout the political compass denounced Videla, saying that he died without admitting what he was aware of the disappeared persons and kidnapped children. None of the tried ex-officers has provided details about the fate of those missing.

'''William Morgan''' (1774&ndash;1826?) was a resident of [[Batavia (city), New York|Batavia]], [[New York]], whose disappearance and presumed murder in 1826 ignited a powerful movement against the [[Freemasons]], a fraternal society that had become influential in the [[United States]]. After Morgan announced his intention to publish a book exposing [[Freemasonry]]'s secrets, he was arrested.  He disappeared soon after, and was most likely kidnapped and killed by Masons.

The allegations surrounding Morgan's disappearance and presumed death sparked a public outcry and inspired [[Thurlow Weed]] and others to harness the discontent by founding the new [[Anti-Masonic Party]] in opposition to President [[Andrew Jackson]]'s [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. It ran a presidential candidate in 1832 but was nearly defunct by 1835.<ref name=HC>[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]], ''Mysteries of the Freemasons: America'', video documentary, 1 August 2006, written by Noah Nicholas and Molly Bedell</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Morgan was born in [[Culpeper, Virginia]], in 1774. His birthdate is sometimes listed as August 7, but no source for this is given. He was apprenticed as a bricklayer<ref>''The Proceedings of the United States Antimasonic Convention, Held at Philadelphia, September 11, 1830. Embracing the Journal of Proceedings, the reports, the Debates, and the Address to the People'', Published by I. P. Trimble, Philadelphia ''et al.'' 1830. 164 pp.</ref> or stone cutter.

==Military service==
Morgan claimed to have served with distinction as a [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] during the [[War of 1812]], though there is no evidence that he did so. Several men named William Morgan appear in the Virginia militia rolls, but none held the rank of captain.

==Marriage and family==
In October 1819, when he was in his mid 40s, Morgan married 19-year-old<ref>Compton, Todd (1997), ''In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith'', Salt Lake City: Signature Books, p.44, 52.</ref> [[Lucinda Pendleton]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], Virginia.

When his business was destroyed in a fire, Morgan was reduced to poverty.

He returned with his family to the United States, settling first at [[Rochester, New York]], and later in [[Batavia, New York|Batavia]], where he worked in stone quarries.  Nineteenth-century local histories described Morgan as a heavy drinker and a gambler.<ref name="til">[http://www.vtfreemasons.org/tillotson/chapter7.htm  Tillotson, Leo F.; ''Ancient Craft Masonry in Vermont''], Vermont Freemasons, Online version</ref>

He said that a local newspaper publisher, David Cade Miller, had given him a sizable advance for the work. Miller is said to have received the entered apprentice degree (the first degree of Freemasonry), but had been stopped from advancement by the objection of one or more of the Batavia lodge members.<ref name="til" />  Morgan had entered into a $500,000 penal [[Bond (finance)|bond]] with three men: Miller, John Davids (Morgan's landlord) and Russel Dyer.<ref name="stb" />

== Disappearance ==
Some members of the Batavia lodge published an advertisement denouncing Morgan.  Unknown individuals were reported to have tried to set fire to Miller's newspaper office.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} A group of individuals, some allegedly Freemasons, gathered at Morgan's house claiming that he owed them money. On September 11, 1826, Morgan was arrested for a loan which a creditor claimed he had not repaid, and for supposedly stealing a shirt and a tie, a charge that was probably fabricated; according to the law, he could be held in [[debtors' prison]] until the debt was paid, making it more difficult to publish his book. He was jailed in [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]]. Learning of this, Miller went to the jail to pay the debt and secure Morgan's release. The two men went to a waiting carriage, which arrived the next day at [[Fort Niagara]].<ref name="til" />

There are conflicting accounts about what followed. The most common version is that Morgan was taken in a boat to the middle of the [[Niagara River]] and drowned, as he was never seen again.<ref>[http://www.truevine.net/~forchrist@truevine.net/Morgan.htm "Captain William M. Morgan of Batavia New York"], Christian Martyrs</ref> In 1848 Henry L.

In October 1827, a badly decomposed body washed up on the shores of [[Lake Ontario]]. Many presumed it to be Morgan, and the remains were buried under that identification. But the clothing was positively identified as that of Timothy Monroe, a missing Canadian, by his widow.<ref name=forsberg>Clyde R.

== Aftermath: the Anti-Masonic movement ==
Soon after Morgan disappeared, Miller published Morgan's book, which became a bestseller because of the notoriety of the events. Miller did not say that Morgan had been murdered but that he had been "carried away". Accounts circulated of Morgan's having assumed a new identity and settled in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], in Canada, or the [[Cayman Islands]], where he was said to have been hanged as a pirate. [[Governor of New York|New York governor]] [[DeWitt Clinton]], also a Mason, offered a $1,000 reward for information about Morgan's whereabouts, but it was never claimed.<ref name="query.nytimes.com" />

The circumstances of Morgan's disappearance and the minimal punishment received by his kidnappers caused public outrage.  He became a symbol of the rights of free speech and free press.  Protests against Freemasons took place in New York and the neighboring states.  Masonic officials disavowed the actions of the kidnappers, but all Masons came under a cloud.  [[Thurlow Weed]], a New York politician, formed an Anti-Masonic movement, gathering discontented opponents of President [[Andrew Jackson]], a Mason, into the [[Anti-Masonic Party]]. It ran a candidate for the presidency in 1828 and gained the support of such notable politicians as [[William H. Seward]].

In the 1828 campaign other Jackson rivals, including [[John Quincy Adams]], joined in denouncing the Masons. In 1832, the Anti-Masonic Party fielded [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]] as its presidential candidate, but he received only seven electoral votes. By 1835, the party had become moribund everywhere but [[Pennsylvania]], as other issues, such as [[slavery]], became the focus of national attention.  In 1847 Adams published a widely distributed book titled ''Letters on the Masonic Institution'' that criticized the Masons' secret society.<ref>John Quincy Adams, [http://books.google.com/books?id=pf6gu_ayrYkC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Letters on the Masonic Institution''], Press of T.R.

In 1830 Morgan's widow, Lucinda Pendleton Morgan, married George W. Harris of Batavia, a silversmith who was 20 years older.  After they moved to the Midwest, they became [[Mormons]].  By 1837, some historians believe that Lucinda Pendleton Morgan Harris had become one of the [[List of Joseph Smith's wives|plural wives of Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].<ref>Compton, Todd (1997), ''In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith,'' Salt Lake City: Signature Books</ref>  She continued to live with her older husband, George Harris. After Smith was murdered in 1844, she was "[[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealed]]" to him for eternity in a rite of the church.<ref name="phil" />

Members of Freemasonry criticized the Mormons for their alleged adoption of [[Masonic ritual]]s and regalia.  In 1841 the Mormons announced their [[Baptism for the dead|vicarious baptism]] of William Morgan after his death, as one of the first under their new rite to posthumously offer people entrance into the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]].<ref name="phil" />

By 1850 the Harrises had separated.  When George Harris died in 1860, he had been excommunicated from the Mormons after ceasing to practice with them.  That year Lucinda Morgan Harris was reported to have joined the [[Catholic Sisters of Charity]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where she worked at the Leah Asylum.  She had been widowed three times.<ref name="phil" />

In June 1881 a grave was discovered in a quarry two miles south of the Indian reservation in [[Pembroke, New York]]. In it was a metal box containing a crumpled paper; its few legible words were interpreted to suggest that the remains might have been Morgan's.<ref name="query.nytimes.com" />

== Monument to Morgan ==
[[File:WIlliam Morgan Pillar Apr 11.JPG|thumb|200px|William Morgan Pillar, April 2011]]
On September 13, 1882, the [[National Christian Association]], a group opposed to [[Secret society|secret societies]], commissioned and erected a statue in ''memoriam'' to Morgan in the [[Batavia Cemetery]]. The ceremony was witnessed by 1,000 people, including representatives from local Masonic lodges.<ref name="nytmon">"An Old Tragedy Revived; Erection Of A Memorial To Morgan, Who Divulged The Secrets Of Masonry", ''The New York Times'', 14 September 1882, p. 1.</ref><ref>[http://www.buffalonian.com/hnews/1882morgansmonument.html "Morgan's Monument: The Unveiling Ceremonies Witnessed by a Large Crowd Who Listen to Able and Interesting Addresses Substance of the Speeches Proceedings at the Convention A Letter from Thurlow Weed"], ''The Daily News'', Batavia (NY), 14 September 1882.  Retrieved 2011-07-07.</ref>

The monument reads:
<blockquote>Sacred to the memory of Wm. Morgan, a native of Virginia, a Capt. in the War of 1812, a respectable citizen of Batavia, and a [[martyr]] to the freedom of writing, printing and speaking the truth. He was abducted from near this spot in the year 1826, by Freemasons and murdered for revealing the secrets of their order. The court records of [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]] and the files of the ''Batavia Advocate,'' kept in the Recorders office contain the history of the events that caused the erection of this monument.</blockquote>

==Representation in other media==
The pharmacist [[John Uri Lloyd]] based part of the background story of his popular scientific allegorical novel ''[[Etidorhpa]]''<ref>''aphrodite'' backwards</ref> (1895), on the kidnapping of William Morgan and the start of the Anti-Masonry movement. In the novel, the speaker is kidnapped by members of a secret society, because he and a publication are suspected to threaten the society's secrecy. Identifying as "I-Am-The-Man" and "The-Man-Who-Did-It," he is taken to a cave in Kentucky.  He is led on a long, subterranean journey by a cavern dweller, an inner journey of the spirit as well as a physical one. Although the secret society is not named, the narrator is made to take an oath by raising his hand and repeating after a man who acts as his guide, "To all this I most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, with a firm and steadfast resolution to keep and perform my oath, without the least equivocation, mental reservation, or self-evasion whatever," reminiscent of initiatory oaths of multiple degrees in Masonry. And a man the narrator encounters around the end of the novel says "The future is operative and speculative," reminiscent of "operative" and "speculative" Freemasonry and the "speculative science and the operative art" in Freemasonry.

In his novel ''The Craft: Freemasons, Secret Agents, and William Morgan'' (2010), the author Thomas Talbot presents a fictional version of the William Morgan kidnapping. He portrays him as a British spy, includes rogue British Masons, and has presidential agents thwart an assassination plot.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Magic in ''Harry Potter''}}
In the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series created by [[J. K. Rowling]], '''magic''' is depicted as a supernatural force that can be used to override the usual [[Physical law|laws of nature]]. Many fictional [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)|magical creatures]] exist in the series, while ordinary creatures sometimes exhibit new magical properties in the novels' world. [[Magical objects in Harry Potter|Objects]], too, can be enhanced or imbued with magical property. The small percentage of humans who are able to perform magic are referred to as witches and wizards, in contrast to the non-magical [[muggle]]s.

In humans, magic or the lack thereof is an inborn attribute. It is inherited, carried on "dominant resilient genes".<ref>{{cite news
  | title = FAQ jkrowling.com
  | url = http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=19
  | accessdate = 19 July 2007  }}</ref> Magic is the norm in the children of magical couples and less common in those of muggles. Exceptions exist: those unable to do magic who are born to magical parents are known as [[Blood purity (Harry Potter)#Squibs|squibs]], whereas a witch or wizard born to muggle parents is known as a [[Blood purity (Harry Potter)#Muggle-born|muggle-born]], or by the [[pejorative]] "mudblood". While muggle-borns are quite common, squibs are extremely rare.

==Using magic==
For a person's ability to perform magic to be of use, much training is needed. When "wild", typically with young and untrained children, magic will still manifest itself subconsciously in moments of strong apprehension, fear or anger.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rumours_view.cfm?id=41 |title=J.K Rowling Official Site |accessdate=27 February 2008 }}</ref> Magic can manifest itself on occasions of sadness as well. For example, [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] once made his hair grow back after a bad haircut; set a boa constrictor on his cousin [[Dursley family#Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] at the London Zoo; and, in anger, made [[Dursley family#Marjorie Dursley|Aunt Marge]] inflate to an enormous size.
While this reaction is usually uncontrollable, [[Tom Marvolo Riddle]], later known as [[Lord Voldemort]], was able to "make things move without touching them...make animals do what he wanted without training them...make bad things happen to people who annoy [him]...or 'make them hurt if I [he] want[s] to'" when he was a young child, apparently intentionally.<ref name="{{HP6}}ch13">{{HP6}}, chapter 13</ref> In addition, [[Lily Potter]] was able to guide and control the blooming of a flower by wanting to.
Almost all magic is done with the use of a supporting tool or focus, typically a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Wand|wand]]. On the subject of magic without the use of a wand, Rowling says:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.quick-quote-quill.org/articles/2001/0301-comicrelief-staff.htm |title=2001: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K Rowling interviews on the web |accessdate=27 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080221224610/http://www.quick-quote-quill.org/articles/2001/0301-comicrelief-staff.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 21 February 2008}}</ref>
{{cquote|You can do unfocused and uncontrolled magic without a wand (for instance when Harry blows up Aunt Marge) but to do really good spells, yes, you need a wand.}} [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]], who played [[Arthur Weasley]] in the films, commented in the special ''50 Greatest Harry Potter Moments'', "If only I had a wand, and I could KILL people!"<ref>{{Citation needed|reason=Previously linked source--a Youtube video--is no longer available.|date=October 2013}}</ref>
A wizard or witch is only at their best when using their own wand. Throughout the series, it is evident that when using another's wand, one's spells are not as strong as they normally would be.{{HP1}} Ownership of a wand can transfer from one person to another if the original owner of the wand is forcibly disarmed (either magically or manually, as evident from Draco Malfoy's magical disarming of Dumbledore in ''Half-Blood Prince'' and Harry's manual disarming of Draco in ''Deathly Hallows''). Moreover, if a person has the allegiance of more than one wand, and one of them is forcibly taken away, the other wands that respond to this person will also change their allegiance (Harry's taking Draco's hawthorn wand in [[Malfoy Manor]] in ''Deathly Hallows'', leads to the Elder Wand also accepting Harry as its master: "Does the wand in your hand know that its last master was disarmed? Because if it does ... I am the true master of the Elder Wand."){{HP7}}

Within the books, technical details of magic are obscure. Of Harry's lessons, only those involving [[magical beasts (Harry Potter)|magical creatures]], [[Magic in Harry Potter#Potions|potions]] or divination are given in any detail.

[[Severus Snape]] once told [[Harry Potter]] that "Time and space matter in magic" during Harry's first Occlumency lesson in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' and [[Albus Dumbledore]] told Harry after finding the magically concealed boat to reach the locket [[Horcrux]] that "Magic always leaves traces, sometimes very distinctive traces."{{HP6}}

===The limits of magic===
Before publishing the first ''Harry Potter'' novel, Rowling spent five years establishing the limitations of magic - determining what it could and could not do. "The most important thing to decide when you're creating a fantasy world," she said in 2000, "is what the characters CAN'T do." For instance, while it is possible to conjure things out of thin air, it is far more tricky to create something that fits an exact specification rather than a general one; moreover, any objects so conjured tend not to last.<ref name="accio-quote.org">{{Cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/themes/therules.htm |title= JKR quotes about "the rules" of Harry Potter's Wizarding World: |accessdate=27 February 2008 }}</ref>

Harry's status as an orphan from the first book quickly establishes that resurrection of the dead is impossible.<ref name="Renner, Hannah">{{Cite book|title= Magic and the Rules Therof: |accessdate=31 July 1997 }}</ref> While corpses can be transformed into obedient [[#Inferius|Inferi]] on a living wizard's command, they are little more than [[zombies]] with no soul or will of their own. It is also possible through the rare [[#Priori Incantatem|Priori Incantatem]] effect to converse with ghost-like "shadows" of magically murdered people. The [[Deathly Hallows (objects)#Resurrection Stone|Resurrection Stone]] also allows one to talk to the dead, but those brought back by the Stone are not corporeal, nor do they wish to be disturbed from their peaceful rest. Throughout the series, this limit is continually mentioned, and wizards try to transcend it at their own folly.

Likewise, it is not possible to make oneself immortal unless one makes use of an object of great power to sustain life, such as the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] created by [[Nicolas Flamel#In popular culture|Nicolas Flamel]], or use the extremely complex and evil magic of [[horcrux]]es as Voldermort does. If one were to possess the three [[Deathly Hallows (objects)|Deathly Hallows]], it is fabled that they would possess the tools to become the "master of death". However, it is hinted that to be a true "master of death" is to be willing to accept that death is inevitable. Becoming a ghost is also an option for wizards and witches; however, it is said that it is "a pale imitation of life". Whether or not ghosts are sentient is not told. However, Snape states that a ghost is merely "the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth".

True love is almost impossible to create magically, though [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Amortentia|Amortentia]], a love potion, can create a powerful sense of infatuation.

====Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration====
The '''Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration''' is a magical theory mentioned by Hermione and later repeated by Ron in the final book. She explains that food is one of these: witches or wizards can cook and prepare food using magic, but not create it. Out of the five exceptions, only food is mentioned explicitly in the series&nbsp;— although speculation amongst fans has proposed many other possibilities.

Rowling herself has stated once in interview that ''money'' is something wizards cannot simply materialise out of thin air,<ref name="accio-quote.org"/> or the economic system of the Wizarding World would then be gravely flawed and disrupted. While the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] does permit [[alchemy]], this is portrayed as an extremely rare, even unique, object, whose owner does not exploit its powers.

There are numerous examples in the series of food ''appearing'' to have been conjured from nothing, such as the sudden materialisation of ingredients in the pots of Molly Weasley's kitchen and when Professor McGonagall creates a self-refilling plate of sandwiches for Harry and Ron in ''[[Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets|The Chamber of Secrets]]''. In all cases, these events can be reasonably explained as food either being multiplied&nbsp;— which is allowable under Gamp's Law, according to Hermione&nbsp;— or transported from elsewhere. One example of this is Banqueting in Hogwarts&nbsp;— the food is prepared by elves in the kitchens and laid onto four replica tables, directly below the actual house tables in the Great Hall. The food is then magically transported to the tables.

===Magic and emotion===
A witch or wizard's emotional state can affect their inherent abilities. In ''Half-Blood Prince'', [[Nymphadora Tonks]] temporarily lost her power as a [[Metamorphmagus]] after suffering sadness over her grief for the death of [[Sirius Black]], and for her love for [[Remus Lupin]], who wanted to distance himself from her due to his being a [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Werewolves|werewolf]]. The form of her [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] changed to reflect her depression. As related to Harry by Dumbledore, [[The House of Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]] only demonstrated any magical ability when removed from her father's oppression, but then seemed to lose it again when her husband abandoned her. Many other examples of emotion-influenced magic appear throughout the series, with [[Ariana Dumbledore]], and Harry's attack upon [[Aunt Marge]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', being prime examples. Several magical spells involve the use of emotion when casting them. The Patronus charm, for example, requires the caster to concentrate on a happy memory. Force of will under extenuating circumstances also helps in casting spells, and affects the force with which they are cast. An example of this is when Harry is able to conjure a corporeal Patronus when Sirius Black is in danger of being administered the Dementor's Kiss. {{HP3}}

====Magic and death====
Death is studied in detail in a room (called the Death Chamber) of the [[Department of Mysteries]] containing an enigmatic veil. [[Sirius Black]] falls through this veil after he is hit with a curse from [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. Magical techniques have been used to extend life. The Philosopher's Stone can be used to prepare a potion that postpones death for the rest of eternity, so long as the potion is drunk on a regular basis. Voldemort has availed himself of other methods, being one of the few wizards ever to use Horcruxes in his long sought attempt to "conquer death", and is believed to be the only one to use multiple Horcruxes. In addition, the drinking of Unicorn blood will keep a person alive even if death is imminent, but at the terrible price of being cursed forever. Being magical can contribute to one's [[longevity]], as there are several characters in the series who are quite long-lived (such as [[Griselda Marchbanks]], who was an invigilator during Albus Dumbledore's O.W.L examinations).

It is revealed by [[Nearly Headless Nick]] in the fifth book that all witches and wizards have the choice of becoming [[Ghosts (Harry Potter)|ghosts]] when they pass away. The alternative is "passing on". Nick says that he became a ghost because he was foolish, "afraid of death". All Hogwarts headmasters appear in a [[Magical portrait (Harry Potter)|portrait]] when they die, allowing consultation by future generations.

In ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', Dumbledore says that there is no spell that can truly bring the dead back to life, however several cases of dead people becoming half-alive are known. In the ''Goblet of Fire'', because of a connection between Harry and Voldemort's wands (Priori Incantatem), images of Voldemort's recent victims appear and help Harry escape. According to Harry, they seemed too solid to be ghosts.

In ''Deathly Hallows'', a magical item known as the Resurrection Stone is said to have the power to raise the dead. According to the legend of the Deathly Hallows, however, the people do not feel as if they belong in the human world and prefer to stay in their resting place. They are merely apparitions: imitations and shadows of who they used to be.

====Magic and love====

In Harry Potter, love is treated as a branch of magic, although it does not seem to be something that is easily controlled, rising unbidden from the emotion itself. Lily's sacrifice on Harry's behalf, for example, comes around at the end of the series to work to Harry's advantage in unforeseen ways.{{HP7}} Love is an important theme in the books, and it is implied that it is Voldemort's inability to understand the concept that leads to his eventual downfall. Since he does not understand the selfless love contained in Lily's sacrifice, he is unable to predict the consequences of Harry's own sacrifice at the end of Deathly Hallows. Thus he is unprepared for the fact that Harry's friends are protected from his spells.{{HP7}} Voldemort also unwittingly ensures that Harry is tied to life while Voldemort lives, by taking some of his blood in the hope that he will be able to gain some of the protection that lingers in Harry as a result of Lily's sacrifice.{{HP4}}

It is implied that the [[Psychopathy|inability to love]] is what makes Voldemort as evil as he is. Severus Snape, who voluntarily joined the Death Eaters on leaving Hogwarts, turns spy for the Order of the Phoenix when he realises that the woman he loves is being threatened by Voldemort.{{HP7}} Similarly, Narcissa Malfoy's love for her son Draco eventually leads her to betray Voldemort, directly leading to Harry's survival{{HP7}} – another oversight on Voldemort's part. With these examples, the book strongly hints that anybody with the ability to love cannot go as far down the path of evil as Voldemort has done, and it is his complete lack of compassion that makes him capable of what he does.

Selflessness is a concept strongly tied to love in the books. Sacrifice of one's life for the people one loves is seen in Harry's case as well as Lily's. Also, when confronting [[Peter Pettigrew|Pettigrew]] about his betrayal of the Potters, Sirius tells him "You should have died for them! As we would have done for you!"{{HP3}}

[[Magic (paranormal)#Varieties of magical practice|Spells]] are the every-purpose tools of a wizard or witch; short bursts of magic used to accomplish single specialised tasks such as opening locks or creating fire. Typically casting requires an [[incantation]], most often in a modified form of [[Latin]] (see [[Dog Latin]]), and gesturing with a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Wand|wand]]. However, these seem to be ''aids'' to the will only; wands are in most cases required, but there are indications that sufficiently advanced witches and wizards can perform spells without them. Spells can also be cast non-verbally, but with a wand. This technique is taught in the sixth year of study at Hogwarts and requires the caster to concentrate on the incantation. Some spells (e.g. ''[[Levicorpus]]'') are apparently designed to be used non-verbally. While most magic shown in the books requires the caster to use their voice, some do not (and this may depend on the witch or wizard). Dumbledore has been known to do impressive feats of magic without speaking, such as [[conjuring]] enough squashy purple sleeping bags to accommodate the entire student population{{HP3}} or during his duel with Voldemort towards the end of ''Order of the Phoenix''.

It is evidently also possible to use a wand without holding it. Harry himself performs ''[[Canonical spells in the world of Harry Potter#Lumos|Lumos]]'' to light his wand when it is lying on the ground somewhere near him{{HP5}}. Additionally, [[Animagus|Animagi]] and [[Metamorphmagus|Metamorphmagi]] do not need wands to undergo their transformations.

Spells are divided into rough categories, such as "[[Magic in Harry Potter#Charms|charm]]s", "[[curse]]s", "hexes", or "[[jinx]]es". Although offensive and potentially dangerous curses exist in number, three are considered usable only for great evil, which earns them the special classification of "[[#Unforgivable Curses|Unforgivable Curses]]".

==Magical abilities==
The following is a list of special abilities that a wizard or witch in the Harry Potter universe may have.

===Animagi transformation===
An Animagus ([[portmanteau]] of animal and [[magus]]) is a witch or wizard who can turn into a particular animal or magical creature at will. This ability is not innate: it must be acquired by magical means. All Animagi must register at a central authority; it is illegal to obtain this ability without registering, although out of the five Animagi described as such in the books ([[Minerva McGonagall]], [[Rita Skeeter]], [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], [[James Potter (character)#Reeta Skeeter Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] and [[Death Eater#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]]), only McGonagall is mentioned as a registered Animagus.

Animagi transformation is one of the few forms of magic that can be performed deliberately wandlessly. This is exemplified when both Sirius and Peter are left wandless for over 10 years, both retaining the ability with supposedly no ill effects. When Animagi transform, the animal appears to be a normal animal. However, in [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]], it is noted that Ron's pet rat Scabbers (later revealed as Peter Pettigrew's Animagus form) has lived over twelve years when only expected to live three. Also, an Animagus in animal form retains the ability to think like a human, which is the principal difference from being an animagus and being transfigured into an animal. Characteristics of an Animagus' human form can manifest themselves in the animal transformation: general appeararance of both Pettigrew and Sirius Black, markings around McGonagall's eyes that resemble her glasses, Pettigrew missing a toe from one paw to match the finger he cut off etc.
Each Animagus has a specific animal form, and cannot transform into any other animal. The animal cannot be chosen: it is uniquely suited to that individual's personality, like the [[Patronus Charm]], and in most cases the Animagus will change into the same animal used in the person's Patronus charm. (McGonagall's Patronus is a cat, like her Animagus form; James Potter's was a stag, which was also his Animagus form.) Similarly, when an Animagus transforms it is always into the same animal (i.e. same markings, same colours, etc.). When an Animagus registers, they must record all the defining physical traits of their animal form so that the Ministry can identify them.

Explicit emphasis is made in the books on the differences between Animagi and [[Werewolf (Harry Potter)|werewolves]]. Animagi have full control over their transformations and retain their minds, whereas werewolves' transformations are involuntary and include severe changes in personality. After the person has transformed into a werewolf, he no longer remembers who he is; he would kill his best friend if he got anywhere near him. A werewolf only responds to the call of his own kind. The only way that a werewolf can retain his sanity, intelligence and memory while transformed is using the Wolfsbane Potion.

Rowling also makes it clear in ''[[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]]'' that an animagus is not the same as a wizard simply transfiguring themselves into an animal. The former ability, as mentioned above, allows the witch or wizard to maintain their own mind and human powers of reasoning and memory. The latter, however, would cause the person to gain the brain of the animal they have transfigured into. This would lead to the obvious problem that they would forget that they were a wizard and be trapped, unknowingly, in this form for the rest of that creature's lifespan unless transformed back by another wizard.

===Metamorphmagi===
A '''Metamorphmagus''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[metamorph]]'' and ''[[magus]]'') is a witch or wizard born with the innate ability to change some or all of their appearance at will. The talent cannot be acquired; a witch or wizard who has it must be born with it.

[[Nymphadora Tonks]] and her son, [[Teddy Lupin]] are currently the only known Metamorphmagi in the series; it is a very rare ability, possibly hereditary. Tonks is known to change her hair colour and style according to her mood. She even appears as an old woman on occasion. She can also change her nose appearance, as she does when eating with the Weasley family to entertain Ginny and Hermione. Her son, Teddy Lupin, also inherited this trait, as his hair is mentioned repeatedly changing colour.

The extent of these appearance-altering abilities and the limits thereof are not entirely clear. According to Rowling, a Metamorphmagus can alter his or her appearance completely, for instance, from black to white, young to old, handsome to plain and so on.<ref>{{cite news|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110926035344/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rumours_view.cfm?id=41 |archivedate=2011 |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rumours_view.cfm?id=41|title=J.K. Rowling's Official Site, rumour section}}</ref> In one example, Tonks changes her facial appearance by reshaping her nose into "a beaklike protuberance like Snape's", to "something resembling a button mushroom", and "one like a pig snout" which reminded Harry of his cousin Dudley.<ref>Rowling, J.K.: "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", page 85. Scholastic, 2003</ref> The emotional state of a Metamorphmagus can affect their abilities.

===Parseltongue===
'''Parseltongue''', the language of snakes, has associations in the common mind with Dark Magic (although Dumbledore stated that it is not necessarily an evil quality). Those possessing the ability to speak it ("'''Parselmouths'''") occur very rarely. People apparently acquire the skill through learning or via a method of [[xenoglossia]], such as through genetic inheritance (or by use of Dark or dangerous Magic). Harry is a Parselmouth: ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' explains this as due to Voldemort's passing on some of his abilities to Harry the night he tried to kill him. ''Deathly Hallows'' reveals that a part of Voldemort's soul within Harry grants him this ability, which is later destroyed leaving Harry stripped of the ability.<ref name="J.K. Rowling Web Chat Transcript">{{cite news |url=http://www.mugglenet.com/jkr/interviews/dh-webchat.shtml |title=J.K. Rowling Web Chat Transcript}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>

Other known Parselmouths include [[Salazar Slytherin]] and his descendants, including the [[The House of Gaunt|Gaunts]] and Voldemort. Dumbledore can also understand Parseltongue; however, he learnt it and did not naturally possess the ability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mugglenet.com/jkr/interviews/dh-webchat.shtml |title= Transcript of JK Rowling web chat&nbsp;— Harry Potter Beyond|accessdate=27 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080221000609/http://hpbeyond.net/hpb/books/transcript-of-jk-rowling-web-chat/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 21 February 2008}}</ref> In ''Half-Blood Prince'' he repeats Morfin Gaunt's words "the big house over the way", which were spoken in Parseltongue.

Ron uses Parseltongue in the final book to reopen the [[Chamber of Secrets]], but he is only imitating the sound of a phrase Harry used earlier in the book.

Rowling borrowed the term from "an old word for someone who has a problem with the mouth, like a [[Cleft lip and palate|hare lip]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2003/0626-alberthall-fry.htm |title= J.K Rowling at the Royal Albert Hall 26 June 2003|accessdate=27 February 2008 }}</ref>

Professor [[Francis Nolan]], Professor of Phonetics at University of Cambridge, designed the version of Parseltongue used in the films as an [[ergative-absolutive]] language featuring [[geminate]] consonants and [[VSO word order|VSO word-order]]. It has a high frequency of [[fricative]] and [[pharyngeal consonants]] to acoustically approximate the physiology of a snake.

===Flight===
Flight without the aid of a broomstick or other object is a rare ability - displayed in the books only by Voldemort and by Snape.

Enchanted objects may have the ability to fly. Sirius had a flying motorbike that he lent to Hagrid to bring Harry to the Dursleys, and [[Arthur Weasley]] enchanted a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Mr Weasley's car|Ford Anglia]] to fly.{{HP2}}

===Seers===
A '''Seer''' is a witch or wizard with the [[clairvoyant]] ability to predict future events. The predictions given through this ability can sometimes be [[self-fulfilling prophecies]], and Dumbledore states in ''Order of the Phoenix'' that not all of them come true, depending on the choices made by those mentioned. This would seem to indicate that a Seer predicts possible or likely events, at least in some cases. Sybill Trelawney is noted to never remember that she has made a prophecy when it is a true one. She speaks in a hoarse voice and only if a wizard is present will anyone know about it.

In the [[Hall of Prophecy]] at the [[Department of Mysteries]], thousands upon thousands of glass spheres are imbued with records of prophecies made by Seers. Only a person mentioned in a prophecy can safely retrieve it; anyone else who tries to do so will be driven insane.

According to McGonagall, true Seers are extremely rare. [[Sybill Trelawney]] is the only Seer portrayed in the books, although it is mentioned that Sybill's great-great-grandmother, Cassandra Trelawney, was a renowned Seer in her day. Trelawney is considered an "old fraud" by her students, and is sacked by [[Dolores Umbridge]] in the fifth book for it. However, she has twice made true prophecies.

===Legilimency and Occlumency===
'''Legilimency''' is the magical skill of extracting feelings and memories from another person's mind&nbsp;— a form of magical "[[telepathy]]" (although Snape, an able practitioner of the art, dismisses the colloquial term, "mind-reading", as a drastic oversimplification). It also allows one to convey visions or memories to another person, whether real or imaginary. A witch or wizard possessing this skill is called a '''Legilimens,''' and can, for example, detect lies and deceit in another person, witness memories in another person's past, or "plant" false visions in another's mind.

The counter-skill to Legilimency is '''Occlumency''' (and its user, known as an '''Occlumens'''), by which one can compartmentalise one's emotions, or prevent a Legilimens from discovering thoughts or memories which contradict one's spoken words or actions. An advanced form of Occlumency is planting false temporary memories inside an Occlumens' own head while blocking all other true memories, so if a Legilimens, even a highly skilled one, were to attempt to read the mind he or she would find false memories only and believe everything was right. This is how [[Severus Snape|Snape]] was able to lie to Voldemort for years.

Voldemort, Snape, and Dumbledore are all known to be skilled in Legilimency and Occlumency. Throughout the books, Snape is repeatedly said to be highly skilled in Occlumency.<ref>Prince, Alan (2011). ''The True Story of Severus Snape: An Essay About Harry Potter's Most Disputed Character'', p. 52.</ref> Voldemort is said to be the master of Legilimency by Snape, as he, in almost all cases, immediately knows during conversations if someone lies to him.

The skills are first mentioned in ''Order of the Phoenix'', (though Harry gets the impression before that Snape can read minds) wherein Snape is instructed by Dumbledore to give Harry lessons in Occlumency. Whether as a result of negligence in Snape's instruction, or poor aptitude on Harry's part, Harry never made any progress in the skill, and as a result he was lured by Voldemort through a carefully calculated vision he falsely believed to be real. Only once has Harry managed to overcome Snape with the use of Occlumency, in ''Order of the Phoenix''.<ref name="{{HP5}}ch26">{{HP5}}, chapter 26</ref> It seems that not everyone is able to master Occlumency. Also, although it appears to be an advanced form of magic, a young wizard can learn to be an Occlumens (Draco Malfoy was able to block Snape's attempt to use Legilimency on him in his 6th year, after being taught Occlumency by Bellatrix Lestrange). Near the end of ''Order of the Phoenix'', Harry learns from Dumbledore that his love for Sirius is what caused Voldemort to release his possession of Harry. Revolting from the love in Harry, Voldemort feared the further use of Legilimency on Harry, drawing away from their connection. This allows Harry to freely see/feel Voldemort's thoughts/emotions in the next two books. In ''Deathly Hallows'', Harry finally does master Occlumency - shutting his mind to Voldemort - when Dobby dies. He realises that his grief - or what Dumbledore calls it, love - is what can block out the Dark Lord.

[[Death Eater#Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], [[Draco Malfoy]], [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]] and [[Death Eater#Barty Crouch, Jr|Barty Crouch, Jr]] also have skill in Occlumency, since Bellatrix was clearly said to have taught Draco to shield his thoughts from Snape.{{HP6}} It was never clearly said that Narcissa was an Occlumens, but since she successfully managed to prevent Voldemort (the master of Legilimency) from detecting her lie about Harry's death, she is very likely to be one.{{HP7}}

Legilimency and Occlumency are not part of the normal curriculum at Hogwarts, and most students would graduate without learning them. They seem to be considered a more advanced form of magic.

===Apparition and Disapparition===
<!--CHECK THE BOOKS; THE NOUN FORMS OF "APPARATE" AND "DISAPPARATE" ARE "APPARITION" AND "DISAPPARITION", NOT "APPARATION" AND "DISAPPARATION".  THIS WAS AN AESTHETIC DECISION MADE BY J.K. ROWLING, AS SHE HAS SAID BEFORE WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE TWO FORMS.  THEY APPEAR AS "APPARATION" AND "DISAPPARATION" EARLIER ON, BUT THESE FORMS ARE MADE OBSOLETE BY "APPARITION" AND "DISAPPARITION", WHICH APPEAR IN OoTP, HBP, AND DH, THE THREE MOST RECENT BOOKS&nbsp;— Editorial note, Ron splinched himself twice in DH, not HBP, amending now -->
'''Apparition''' is a magical form of [[teleportation]], through which a witch or wizard can disappear ("'''Disapparate'''") from one location and reappear ("'''Apparate'''") in another. It is sometimes accompanied by a distinctive cracking or popping sound, though this is associated with ineptitude rather than success; the most skilled wizards can Apparate "so suddenly and silently" that they seem to have "popped out of the ground" (Dumbledore). The act is also accompanied by a very unpleasant squeezing sensation, as though being sent through a tight rubber tube, according to Harry.{{HP6}}

The Ministry of Magic licenses Apparition. A witch or wizard must be 17 years old or older and have a licence to Apparate as a means of transportation in much the same way real-world governments require individuals to have a [[driver's license|licence to drive a motor vehicle]]. Students at Hogwarts may attend Ministry-administered Apparition lessons during their sixth year, and may take their examination once they turn seventeen. It is shown that although it is possible to Apparate without a licence, it is not usually done (unless in lessons) and is illegal. In ''Deathly Hallows'', Harry does not possess a licence, but since his Trace has been lifted, the Ministry is likely unaware that he does it.

Learning to Apparate is difficult, and students run the risk of ''splinching''&nbsp;— being physically split between the origin and destination&nbsp;— which requires the assistance of the Ministry's [[Accidental Magic Reversal Squad]] to undo properly, although essence of dittany can also mend certain wounds. Splinching is quite common during lessons, and can be uncomfortable (and at times rather gruesome) depending on the body parts splinched, but is ultimately harmless if properly reversed. It is implied that though Ron can Apparate, he isn't terribly skilled at it, seeing as he splinches himself at least three times (once losing half an eyebrow, two fingernails and part of his arm.); Harry and Hermione both pick up the skill quickly in comparison. As explained in the ''Half-Blood Prince'', there is no word spell to Apparate or Disapparate, but the caster has to concentrate on the location on which he has to apparate, needs to be fully focused on the spell, and also has to "feel" it through the whole body.

It is considered rude to Apparate directly into a private area, such as a home. Dumbledore states in Half-Blood Prince that it would be "quite as rude as kicking down the front door". For this reason, and for reasons of security, many homes also have Anti-Apparition spells protecting them from uninvited intrusions. The accepted way to travel to a home is to Apparate to a nearby location and continue to the final destination on foot. Apparition is considered unreliable over long distances, and even experienced users of the technique sometimes prefer other means of transport, such as [[Broomsticks in Harry Potter|broomstick]]s. Indeed, even the prodigiously skilled [[Lord Voldemort]] elects to fly back to England after visiting the far-flung [[Nurmengard]].

For reasons of security, the grounds and buildings of Hogwarts are protected by ancient Anti-Apparition and Anti-Disapparition spells, which prevent humans from Apparition in the school grounds. This does not extend to [[Magical Creatures in Harry Potter|magical creatures]] such as house-elves and phoenixes, who can still use their own form of Apparition. There is also a spell that prevents individuals from Disapparating, which Dumbledore places on the Death Eaters captured at the Ministry in ''Order of the Phoenix''; a sister spell, which allows one to Apparate into a location but prevents them from Disapparating out of it, is cast by the Death Eaters in Hogsmeade in concordance with the Caterwauling Charm. So far, Dumbledore is the only person who can both Apparate and Disapparate from the school grounds, since he is the headmaster.

As noted above, certain magical creatures that can Apparate and Disapparate are governed by a different set of laws than apply to witches and wizards. [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|Dobby]], [[Kreacher]] and the rest of the house-elf population can Apparate within the Hogwarts grounds, as is demonstrated on multiple occasions, most notably when Dobby visits Harry in the hospital wing, and when Dobby and Kreacher are summoned by Harry and assigned to tail Draco Malfoy (and subsequently return to give reports on his activities). Kreacher is also able to Disapparate from the enchanted cave back to Number 12, Grimmauld Place; Dobby is able to Apparate into the cellar at Malfoy Manor despite protective charms, and rescues [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Dumbledore's Army#Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]] and [[Mr Ollivander]] via Side-Along Apparition. The phoenix [[Fawkes]] Disapparates from the headmaster's office at Hogwarts along with Dumbledore when the latter manages to evade arrest at the hands of Ministry officials in ''Order of the Phoenix''; though it is cited in "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" that phoenixes and diricawls can Apparate, it is unclear in this situation whether Fawkes's involvement was absolutely necessary to get Dumbledore out of the office.

A witch or wizard can use ''Side-Along Apparition'' to take others with them during Apparition. Dumbledore successfully transports Harry this way several times, and notably, Harry's first non-lesson attempt at the skill is the Side-Along Apparition with the weakened Dumbledore when they return from the seaside cave. Despite this one example of skill coming through in a pinch, the ability to successfully lead a Side-Along Apparition may require more advanced skill or at least more concentration, as Hermione does cause serious damage to Ron's arm when she Side-Along Apparates with both boys in a moment of great stress. The consequences of attempting to Apparate or even Side-Along Apparate without a wand are unclear but considered in Deathly Hallows. After their narrow and bungled escape from the Ministry, Ron wonders what will happen to Reg and Mary Cattermole, since the latter's wand was confiscated from her upon signing in at the Ministry due to her questionable Blood Status. This unanswered question may be an insinuation that muggles cannot participate even in Side-Along Apparition.

In the ''Order of the Phoenix'' film, Death Eaters and Order members Apparate and Disapparate in clouds of smoke. Death Eaters appear and disappear in black smoke, Order members in white. In the film, both sides also appear to be able to "half-apparate" in which their bodies were made out of smoke, giving them the ability to fly. This is not canon to the books and probably just used for more cinematic, atmospheric purposes. Interestingly, both times Fred and George apparated and disapparated, they did it with a ''pop'' as in the books.

In the books, the words "Apparate" and "Disapparate", like many other [[neologism]]s used by Rowling, are [[Capitalization|capitalised]], whereas established English words such as "jinx" and "hex" are not. The words themselves are most likely derived from the French ''apparaître'' and ''disparaître'', meaning 'to appear' and 'to disappear'. Another possible derivation is from the English word "apparition", meaning "a supernatural appearance of a person or thing; anything that appears, especially something remarkable or startling; an act of appearing", which comes from the Latin ''"apparitio"'', meaning attendance. "Disapparate" probably comes from the same word but with the prefix: "dis-" expressing negation or reversal.

===Other teleportation===
Some other forms of instantaneous travel occur, such as a house elf's ability to teleport or Fawkes's ability to appear and disappear in a burst of flame. (In [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]], it is stated that all phoenixes have this ability.) In the novels, Harry refers to this as "Apparition" but this may be because of his inexperience and not the fact. This theory is further reinforced as neither Fawkes nor house-elves are restricted by anti-Apparition magic. Fawkes also vanishes silently and in a burst of flame, whereas a wizard Apparating is accompanied by a very loud "crack" (or a quiet "pop") with no visible effect.

Some magical devices like the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Floo Powder|Floo Network]], [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Portkeys|Portkeys]] and [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Vanishing Cabinet|Vanishing Cabinets]] are also forms of magical teleportation.

===Veela charm===
An ability attributed to [[Veela]] and those of Veela heritage, such as [[Fleur Delacour]]. It is used to charm males, much like the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s in ''[[The Odyssey]]''.

Harry seems more resistant to this than Ron and most others, though the first time he was exposed to it his reaction was similar to Ron's. Men who are exposed to it over time become more resistant to it, although the Veela charm takes full effect if the Veela surprises the man, as noted by Ron in ''The Half-Blood Prince''.

As shown in ''Goblet of Fire'', Veela hair can be used as cores to create magical wands. According to famed wandmaker Mr. Ollivander, these wands are a little "temperamental".

===Magical resistance===
This refers to a certain degree of immunity against hexes and spells found in powerful creatures such as [[trolls]], [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Dragons|dragons]], and [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Giants|giants]]. Hagrid is resistant to certain spells, like the [[Spells in Harry Potter#Stupefy (Stunning Spell, Stupefying Charm)|Stunning Spell]], due to his giant blood. This type of resistance is not insurmountable; if enough Stunning Spells, for example, are fired at a creature with magical resistance at once, the creature may still be rendered unconscious. Also, wizards and witches can resist certain spells with the power of their own sheer will, such as Harry did in ''Goblet of Fire'', when [[Barty Crouch Jr.]] disguised as Alastor Moody tried to control Harry with the Imperius curse and Harry resisted.

==Subjects at Hogwarts==
At Hogwarts, students must study a core group of subjects for the first two years, after which they must choose between several electives. During their final two years, students are permitted to take more specialized subjects such as Alchemy.

Transfiguration, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Potions, Astronomy, History of Magic, and Herbology are compulsory subjects for the first five years, as well as flying lessons. At the end of their second year, students are required to add at least two optional subjects to their syllabus for the start of the third year. The five choices are Arithmancy, Muggle Studies, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes and Care of Magical Creatures. Very specialised subjects such as [[Alchemy]] are sometimes offered in the final two years, if there is sufficient demand. There is a total of twelve named [[Hogwarts staff|Professors]] at Hogwarts, each specializing in one of these subjects.

===Transfiguration===
'''Transfiguration''' is essentially the art of changing the properties of an object.<ref name="TransCharms">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1998/1298-herald-simpson.html 1998: Accio Quote!, the Largest Archive of J.K. Rowling quotes on the web<!-- Bot generated title -->], quick-quote.quill.org</ref> Transfiguration is a theory-based subject, including topics such as "Switching Spells" (altering only a part of some object, such as when Hagrid gave Dudley a pig tail); Vanishing Spells (causing an object to completely disappear);{{OP |ch=13}} and Conjuring Spells (creating objects out of thin air).{{OP|ch=13}} It is possible to change inanimate objects into animate ones and vice versa – Minerva McGonagall, the class's teacher, transfigures her desk into a [[domestic pig|pig]] and back in ''Philosopher's Stone''.{{PStone |ch=8}}

===Defence Against the Dark Arts===
<!--DO NOT change this to "DEFENSE" with an S. As per [[MOS:HPP#ENGLISH]], we use British spelling in Harry Potter-related articles. Thank you.-->
'''Defence Against the Dark Arts''', commonly shortened to '''D.A.D.A.''',<ref>{{HPref|book=6|chapter=12}}</ref> is the class that teaches students defensive techniques to defend against the [[Dark Arts (Harry Potter)|Dark Arts]], and to be protected from Dark creatures.
The subject has an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members – throughout the series no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has retained the post for more than one school year. Harry is exceptionally skilled in this subject.  During the period the story takes place, the class is taught by [[Quirinus Quirrell]] ([[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|book one]]), [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] ([[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|book two]]), [[Remus Lupin]] ([[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|book three]]), [[Bartemius Crouch Jr]] impersonating [[Alastor Moody|Alastor "Mad-eye" Moody]] ([[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|book four]]), [[Dolores Umbridge]] ([[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix|book five]]), [[Severus Snape]] ([[Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince|book six]]), and [[Amycus Carrow]] ([[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|book seven]]). Hagrid suggests in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' that ''"They're startin' ter think the job's jinxed. No one's lasted long for a while now."'' In ''Half-Blood Prince'', Dumbledore suggests that Voldemort cursed the position because his application for it was rejected.{{HBP|ch=20}} The existence of the jinx was eventually confirmed by Rowling. The position had also been coveted by Snape, but he was denied the position as well. Snape was finally appointed D.A.D.A. professor in ''Half-Blood Prince''. Rowling announced in an interview that once Voldemort had died, the jinx he placed on the office was lifted and a permanent professor had been teaching the subject between the end of ''Deathly Hallows'' and the [[epilogue]], set nineteen years afterwards. Furthermore, she imagines that Harry Potter occasionally comes to the class to give lectures on the subject.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jen |last=Brown |title=Stop your sobbing!

===Charms===
'''Charms''' is the class that teaches how to develop incantations for the uses of bewitchment. Rowling has described Charms as a type of magic spell concerned with giving an object ''new'' and unexpected properties.<ref name="TransCharms"/> Charms classes are described as notoriously noisy and chaotic, as the lessons are largely practical.{{OP|ch=18}} Many of the [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] sequences in the books are set in Charms classes, which are on the second floor of Hogwarts. The class is taught by [[Filius Flitwick]]

===Potions===
'''Potions''' is described as the art of creating mixtures with magical effects. It requires the correct mixing and stirring of ingredients at the right times and temperatures. As to the question of whether a muggle could brew a potion, given the correct magical ingredients, Rowling has said, "Potions seems, on the face of it, to be the most muggle-friendly subject. But there does come a point in which you need to do more than stir."<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2006/0801-radiocityreading1.html 2006: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K.

===Astronomy===
'''Astronomy''' classes take place in the Astronomy Tower, the tallest tower in Hogwarts, and are taught by Professor Aurora Sinistra. Lessons involve observations of the night skies with [[telescope]]s. No astronomy lessons are shown in the books, but they are frequently referenced. Rowling describes one of Harry's Astronomy exams in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. Also, bits of the Astronomy Tower are seen throughout the [[film series]], such as HP2 and HP3, and featured in [[The Half-Blood Prince]], as the place where Dumbledore died, and seen in [[The Deathly Hallows]]. Known student homework activities include learning the names of stars, constellations and planets, and their location, movements, and environments.

===History of Magic===
'''History of Magic''' is the study of magical history. [[Cuthbert Binns]]' lessons are depicted as some of the most boring at Hogwarts. They are only lectures, given without pause, about significant events in wizarding history. Topics have included goblin rebellions, giant wars, and the origins of wizarding secrecy. This is the only class at Hogwarts that is taught by a ghost, as the professor never noticed he had died and simply continued teaching as if nothing had changed.

===Herbology===
'''Herbology''' is the study of magical plants and how to take care of, utilise and combat them. There are at least three greenhouses described in the books, holding a variety of magical plants. Herbology is also the only subject Neville excels in. The epilogue to ''Deathly Hallows'' explains that he later replaces Professor Sprout as the Herbology teacher.

===Arithmancy===
'''Arithmancy''' is a branch of magic concerned with the magical properties of numbers. As neither Harry nor Ron take this class; almost nothing is known about it. It is, however, a favourite subject of Hermione. Arithmancy is reportedly difficult, as it requires memorising or working with many charts. In ''Order of the Phoenix'', it is mentioned that the study of Arithmancy is required to become a Curse-Breaker for [[Gringotts]]. The subject is taught by Professor Septima Vector.

===Study of Ancient Runes===
'''Study of Ancient Runes''', more commonly known as '''Ancient Runes''', is a generally theoretical subject that studies the ancient runic scripts. Because only [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] studies it, little else is known about this subject, taught by Professor Bathsheda Babbling.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Vander Ark |url=http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/sources/jkr.com/jkr-com-trans-jottings1.html |title=HP-lexicon.org |publisher=HP-lexicon.org |accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> In ''Deathly Hallows'' Dumbledore bequeaths his copy of ''[[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]]'', which is written in ancient runes, to [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]].

===Divination===<!-- This section is linked from [[Sybill Trelawney]] -->
'''[[Divination]]''' is the art of predicting the future. Various methods are described, including [[Tasseography|tea leaves]], [[Divination|fire omens]], [[crystal ball]]s, [[palmistry]], [[cartomancy]] (including the reading of conventional [[playing cards]] and the [[tarot]]), [[astrology]], and [[dream interpretation]]s. Divination is described by Professor McGonagall as "one of the most imprecise branches of magic".{{PA|ch=6}} Supporters of the subject claim that it is an inexact science that requires innate gifts such as the "Inner Eye". Those opposed claim that the subject is irrelevant and fraudulent. Harry is first taught Divination by Professor Trelawney, and then later by Firenze after Trelawney is sacked by [[Dolores Umbridge]] in Harry's fifth year. In the sixth (and presumably seventh) year, Firenze and Professor Trelawney share Divination classes, divided by grade level.

===Care of Magical Creatures===
'''Care of Magical Creatures''' is the class which instructs students on how to care for [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)|magical beasts]]. Classes are held outside the castle. In Harry's first two years, the class is taken by Professor Silvanus Kettleburn who then retires "in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs". Dumbledore then recruits the gamekeeper [[Rubeus Hagrid]] to accept a teaching position along with his gamekeeping duties. Although Hagrid is obviously very experienced and knowledgeable, he doesn't "have a normal person's view of what's dangerous", an example being that the Care of Magical Creatures students were required to get a literally ferocious textbook called the "Monster Book of Monsters", and so consistently misjudges the risk that the animals he uses in his lessons pose to his students{{PA |ch=6}}{{GF |ch=13}}, which sometimes results in chaos. When Hagrid is absent, his lessons are taken over by Professor Grubbly-Plank, a witch and an acquaintance of Dumbledore's.

===Muggle Studies===
'''Muggle Studies''' is a class taught by [[Charity Burbage]] which involves the study of the [[muggle]] (non-magical) culture "from a wizarding point of view." The only need for witches and wizards to learn about muggle [[culture|ways]] and [[technology|means]], is to ensure they can blend in with muggles while needing to do so (for example, at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup). As the class is only mentioned as being taken by [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and for just one year, little is known about its curriculum.
In the opening chapter of the final book, Voldemort murders Professor [[Charity Burbage]] because she portrays muggles in a positive light and is opposed to limiting wizardry to only people of pure-blood origins. For the rest of the academic year covered by ''Deathly Hallows'', the Death Eater [[Alecto Carrow]] teaches Muggle Studies. However, her lessons (which are made compulsory) mainly describe muggles and muggle-borns as subhuman and worthy of persecution.

===Alchemy===
'''Alchemy''' classes are not mentioned in the ''Harry Potter'' series; however, Rowling has used Alchemy as an example of a 'specialised' subject offered when there is sufficient demand. Alchemy is a philosophical tradition searching for the [[philosopher's stone]], which is said to have the power to turn base metals into gold and to contain the [[elixir of life]], which makes or keeps the drinker young and immortal. As mentioned in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', Nicholas Flamel created a Philosopher's Stone, but it was destroyed at the end of Harry's first year.

===Flying===
'''Flying''' is the class that teaches the use of [[Broomsticks in Harry Potter|broomsticks]] made for the use of flying and is taught only to Hogwarts first years by [[Rolanda Hooch]]. The subject is the only one that requires physicality. The only flying lesson depicted in the Harry Potter series is in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]''.

===Apparition===
'''Apparition''' is the magical form of [[teleportation]] in the [[Harry Potter]] series. Apparition is an optional class for those in the sixth and seventh years. The lessons are taught by [[Wilkie Twycross]], a Ministry of Magic Apparition Instructor, in Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts. In the wizarding world, performing Apparition requires a license and may only be legally performed by people over seventeen years of age. The described reason for the restriction is that Apparition is dangerous if done improperly: insufficient concentration may lead to body parts being left behind in an unfortunate side-effect known as '''splinching'''; Twycross explains this as happening when a witch or wizard is insufficiently determined. Magical enchantments on Hogwarts castle and grounds prevent Apparition and Disapparition inside the castle; however it is explained in ''Half-Blood Prince'' that these protections are temporarily relaxed within the Great Hall for short periods to permit students to practice. Students are warned, though, that they will not be able to Apparate outside of the Great Hall and that it would be unwise to try.

==Spell-like effects==

===Unbreakable Vow===
The '''Unbreakable Vow''' is a voluntary agreement made between two witches or wizards. It must be performed with a witness ("Bonder") on hand, holding their wand on the agreeing persons' linked hands to bind them with magic as a tongue of flame. The Vow is not literally "unbreakable" as the person taking it is still able to go back on his or her word, but doing so will cause instant death. The Unbreakable Vow was first introduced in ''Half-Blood Prince'', in which Snape made a promise to Narcissa Malfoy to protect Draco, with Bellatrix as the "Bonder", as her son attempted to fulfil the Dark Lord's task, and for Snape to fulfil the task if something should prevent Draco from doing it. Another example in ''Half-Blood Prince'' occurs when Ron tells Harry how Fred and George tried to make him undertake an Unbreakable Vow, but because of their father's intervention, they did not succeed.

===Priori Incantatem===
'''Priori Incantatem''', or the '''Reverse Spell Effect''', is used to detect the spells cast by a wand. The spells cast by the wand will emerge in smoky or ghost-like replicas in reverse order, with the latest spell emerging first. It is first encountered in ''Goblet of Fire'' when the house elf Winky is found holding Harry's wand. This spell is used to reveal that it was indeed Harry's wand that cast the Dark Mark. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince]]'', it is revealed that the teenage Voldemort murdered his father and grandparents using his uncle Morfin's wand, knowing that, when examined, the wand would incriminate Morfin as the murderer. In ''Deathly Hallows'', Harry feared that a ''[[Priori Incantatem]]'' spell would be used on Hermione's wand after the [[Death Eaters]] had a hold of it. This would reveal that she had accidentally broken his holly-and-phoenix-feather wand (with her wand) when a curse misfired and they both narrowly escaped Voldemort earlier. As a result, the protection of the shared cores was lost and, worse still, this would now be made known to Voldemort. During the final duel between Harry and Voldemort, the latter mentions that he knows that the holly and phoenix wand is destroyed, implying that the Priori Incantatem had indeed been performed on Hermione's wand, as they had feared.

Forcing two wands that share the source of their cores to do battle can also cause a more potent form of Priori Incantatem. The tips of the two wands will connect, forming a thick golden "thread" of energy, and the two wands' masters fight a battle of wills. The loser's [[Magical objects in Harry Potter|wand]] will regurgitate shadows of spells that it has cast in reverse order. This phenomenon occurred during the duel between Harry and Voldemort at the end of ''Goblet of Fire''. Their simultaneous spells (Harry and Voldemort cast "Expelliarmus" and "Avada Kedavra" respectively) triggered the threads, and as Voldemort lost the battle of wills, his wand regurgitated, in reverse order, shades of the spells he had cast with it&nbsp;– screams of pain from torturing various victims, echoes of the people his wand had murdered: [[Cedric Diggory]]; [[Frank Bryce]]; [[Bertha Jorkins]]; as well as Harry's parents. Harry was previously informed by [[Mr. Ollivander]] that the holly wand that "chose" Harry was the "brother" of the yew wand that gave him the lightning-shaped scar on his forehead, although the significance of this was not discussed then. Dumbledore later revealed to Harry that his and Voldemort's wands both contained a tail feather given by Dumbledore's pet [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Fawkes|Fawkes]].

==Dark Arts==
The '''Dark Arts''' are those [[Spells in Harry Potter|magical spells]] and practices that are usually used for [[Maleficium (sorcery)|malicious purposes]]. Practitioners of Dark Arts are referred to as Dark witches or wizards. The most prominent of these is Voldemort, known to them as the Dark Lord. His followers, known as [[Death Eater]]s, practice the Dark Arts while doing his bidding.

The type of spells characteristic of Dark Arts are known as curses,<ref>[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=24 J.K. Rowling's Official Site]</ref> which usually cause harm to the target. All, to a certain degree, are in some circumstances justifiable. The motivation of the caster affects a curse's result. This is most notable in the case of ''Cruciatus'': when cast by Harry, angered by the death of his godfather at Bellatrix's hands and desiring to punish her, it causes a short moment of pain. As Bellatrix herself comments, righteous anger does not allow the spell to work for long. When cast by figures such as Voldemort, who desire to inflict pain for its own sake, it causes intense agony that can last as long as the Dark witch or wizard desires. Use of Dark Magic can corrupt the soul and body; Voldemort has used such magic in his quest to prolong his life and obtain great power. Dark Arts also caused Voldemort to look deformed and inhuman, a side effect of splitting his soul into Horcruxes.

According to Snape, the Dark Arts "are many, varied, ever-changing and eternal... unfixed, mutating, indestructible".<ref name="{{HP6}}ch9">{{HP6}}, chapter 9</ref> They also appear to be the most common form of magic used by criminals, while dangerous spells used by others in the books are frequently labelled ''Dark''. In magical dueling, for example, there are any number of spells that may be used to attack, immobilise, or disarm an opponent without causing pain or lasting harm; however, spells such as the Cruciatus Curse or [[Spells in Harry Potter#Sectumsempra|Sectumsempra]], judged to be Dark by reliable authorities, wound or seriously distress a victim in some way.

In the Wizarding world, use of the Dark Arts is strongly stigmatised and even illegal; however, these spells are prevalent enough that even before the rise of Voldemort, many schools, (including Hogwarts), taught [[Subjects at Hogwarts#Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] as a standard subject. Techniques include anti-curses and simple spells to disable or disarm attackers or fight off certain creatures. Some schools, such as [[Durmstrang]], teach Dark Magic. A Dark Arts class was also taught at Hogwarts while it was under Death Eater control.

===Unforgivable Curses===
The '''Unforgivable Curses''' are some of the most powerful known Dark Arts spells. They were first classified as unforgivable in 1717. Used by the books' villains, such as Voldemort and the [[Death Eater]]s and in some cases the Ministry of Magic, their use inspires horror and great fear amongst others. The curses are so named because their use is&nbsp;— except by Ministry authorisation&nbsp;— forbidden and unforgivable in the Wizarding world when used on another human or probably any sentient being. The use of any of these spells on another human being is punishable by a life sentence in [[Azkaban]]. The only exception is if a person is proved to have done them under the influence of the [[Imperius Curse]]. These curses are thus very rarely used openly. However, in ''Deathly Hallows'', the Unforgivable Curses are used liberally by good characters, ranging from [[Professor McGonagall]] with the [[Imperius Curse]], to Harry effectively using the [[Cruciatus Curse]]. He also uses the Imperius curse on a goblin and a suspicious Death Eater during their disguised attack upon Gringotts Bank. However, at the time the Unforgivable curses had been made legal. Since the spells are very powerful, their use requires a strong desire to cause the effects, a directed will, and great skill.

It is noted that to perform the Unforgivable Curses, the caster must "mean it". This means that they need to want the effects a fair amount for the effects to last. In ''Order of the Phoenix'', Harry attempted to use the Cruciatus Curse on Bellatrix, but he was drawing only from righteous anger and did not truly 'mean it'. Bellatrix explained that a caster must truly want their victim to suffer, and thus Harry's spell caused her to feel pain for only a moment. Nonetheless, the sheer force of the curse is enough to blast Bellatrix off of her feet.

The use of the Unforgivable Curses was authorised against Voldemort and his followers by [[Ministry of Magic#Barty Crouch, Sr|Bartemius Crouch Sr]], during the First Wizarding War. Shortly after his resurrection, Voldemort names two Death Eaters "killed by [[Ministry of Magic#Auror Office|Auror]]s".

The Unforgivable Curses:
*''[[List of spells in Harry Potter#Avada Kedavra (Killing Curse)|Avada Kedavra]]'', the Killing Curse. The curse is used for Murder. This is also one of the most powerful curses. The spell cannot be directly blocked and casted away, but it can be avoided (either by moving out of the way, or by conjuring a solid object to obstruct the curse). The spell causes immediate, painless death, and cannot be reversed. The curse, when summoned, is shown as a bright green jet of light.  Harry Potter is the only person to ever survive this curse.
*''[[List of spells in Harry Potter#Crucio (Cruciatus Curse)|Crucio]]'', the Cruciatus Curse. The curse is used for [[torture|torturing]] a person. The strength of the curse is determined by the person who cast it. If the person casts the curse wanting to cause pain for the sake of it, it induces unbearable agony in the victim. The curse is so powerful that it can even torture a person to the point that they are exhausted to death, or in a more sadistic case, it causes permanent amnesia and insanity (the case of Neville's parents, who were tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange). The curse, when summoned, is shown in a bright-faded blue light. When [[Hogwarts]] was under [[Death Eater]] control, the Dark Arts teacher forced the students in his class to use the Cruciatus Curse on students who had been assigned detention.
*''[[List of spells in Harry Potter#Imperio (Imperius Curse)|Imperio]]'', the Imperius Curse. The curse used for [[mind control]], and can force the victim to do things (s)he would be unwilling to do or even incapable of under normal circumstances. The strength (and also the duration) of the curse is determined by the determination of the person who cast it, as well as by the level of resistance of the victim. The curse, when summoned, is shown in a bright haze.

=== Dark Mark ===
The '''Dark Mark''' is the symbol of Voldemort and the Death Eaters that appears in the sky when conjured. It looks like a skull with a snake coming out of the mouth in place of the tongue. As a spell it is cast by a [[Death Eater]] whenever he or she has murdered someone. The spell used by Death Eaters to conjure the Mark is [[Morsmordre]]. It first appears in ''Goblet of Fire'' and is described as a "colossal skull, composed of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue". Once in the sky it was "blazing in a haze of greenish smoke".
Dark Marks are also branded on the left forearm of the closest followers of Voldemort. The mark serves as a connection between Voldemort and each who bears it; he can summon them by touching his mark, causing it and those of his followers to burn and change colour. Death Eaters can summon Voldemort in the same fashion.
Following Voldemort's ultimate defeat, the Dark Marks on his Death Eaters fade into a scar "similar" to Harry's.<ref name="J.K. Rowling Web Chat Transcript"/>
In the books, the Dark Mark is described as green; however, in the films, it was only green at the Quidditch World Cup. In all other film appearances it has been grey.

===Inferius===
:''Distinguish from [[Infernus (disambiguation)|Infernus]].''
An '''Inferius''' (plural: '''Inferi''') is a [[Dead body|corpse]] controlled through a Dark wizard's spells. An Inferius is not alive, but a dead body that has been bewitched into acting like a puppet for the [[witch]] or wizard; this manifests itself as a white mist in the controlled corpse's eyes. They cannot think for themselves: they are created to perform a specific duty assigned by the Dark wizard who commands them, and as seen in the Inferi guarding Voldemort's Horcrux in a seaside cave, remain idle until their task can be performed. This task is then thoughtlessly carried out, whether or not it will produce any result. Inferi are difficult to harm by magic; however, they can be repelled by fire or any other forms of heat or light, as the Inferi in Voldemort's cave had never been exposed to either of these elements. When defeated, they return to their idle state.

Inferi are considered dangerous and frightening enough by the magical world that impersonating an Inferius (as [[Mundungus Fletcher]] does in ''Half-Blood Prince'') is an offence worthy of imprisonment in [[Azkaban]].

The Ministry of Magic fears that Voldemort is killing enough people to make an army of Inferi: as they are dead, they are very difficult to stop. When Voldemort was hiding one of his [[Horcruxes]] in the past, he filled a lake in a cave with many Inferi, which were to attack and drown anyone but Voldemort who came into the cavern and took the locket. When Harry and Dumbledore took the locket, the Inferi attacked Harry; Dumbledore repelled them with a rope of fire. It is also revealed that the Inferi almost killed Kreacher after he drank from the basin to help Voldemort hide his Horcruxes, but because elves must disapparate (a form of teleporting) whenever they are summoned by their master, he escaped when Regulus Black summoned him, unaware of Kreacher being drowned by Inferi. It was, instead, Kreacher's master Regulus Black who drank and was drowned by the Inferi so that Kreacher could escape a second time.

In Latin, the word ''inferus'' (plural: ''inferi'') means "below", often referring in the plural to "the gods below" (see ''[[di inferi]])'' or the spirits of the dead.<ref name="lexicon">{{cite book| last=Lewis | first=Charlton T. | last2=Short | first2=Charles | title=A Latin Dictionary | publisher=Clarendon Press | year=1879 | place=Oxford | chapter=q.v., inferus, as positive noun I.B, as comparative adjective II.A | chapterurl=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dinferus }}</ref> ''Inferius'' is a neuter singular form of ''inferior'', a [[comparative adjective]] meaning "lower".<ref name="lexicon"/><ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=inferius&la=la Morphology of inferius by The Perseus Project]</ref>

===Horcrux===
{{Main|Horcrux}}
A '''horcrux''' is an object created using dark magic to attain effective immortality. The concept is first introduced in the sixth novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', although horcruxes are present in earlier novels without being described or expanded upon.

A horcrux is created when a soul-shard split from a murderer's soul is infused into an object, which is then hidden or in some other manner kept safe. (When a person commits murder, his soul becomes traumatized and splits into more than one piece. A horcrux is nothing more than the fused object/soul-shard created when the portion of the murderer's soul that was split off is infused into some material object.) The point of creating a horcrux is to prevent the passage of a soul to the afterlife (death) by anchoring a portion of the soul in the material world.

Ordinarily, when one's body is killed, the soul departs for the next world. If, however, the body of a horcrux owner is killed, that portion of his soul which had remained in his body will not pass on to the next world, but will rather exist in a non-corporeal form capable of being resurrected by another wizard, as in ''[[The Half-Blood Prince]] ''and the ''[[The Deathly Hallows]]''. If all of someone's horcruxes are destroyed, then his soul's only anchor in the material world would be his body, the destruction of which would then cause his final death.

==Portraits==
In the ''Harry Potter'' series the subjects of '''magical portraits''' (even those of characters that are dead) can move, interact with living observers, speak and demonstrate apparent emotion and personality. Some can even move to other portraits to visit each other, or to relay messages, or (if more than one painting of the subject exists) can move between separate locations by way of their portraits. Many such portraits are found on the walls of Hogwarts. It is unknown how [[Magic (Harry Potter)|magical]] portraits come into being: whether they are produced by a painter or brought into existence by other means. [[Magical portrait (Harry Potter)#Photographs|Magical photographs]] with similar properties can be created by developing normal film in a magic potion.

At least three portraits, those of [[The Fat Lady]] and [[Ariana Dumbledore]], and the Hogwarts Kitchen Portrait, can perform at least one action with a direct effect on the world outside the frame of the painting. The Fat Lady's portrait is the door that covers the entrance to the [[Hogwarts#Gryffindor|Gryffindor]] common room, and she can swing the portrait open when given the correct password or close to prevent entry. Ariana's is able to swing open revealing the secret passage from the [[Hog's Head|Hog's Head Inn]] to Hogwarts that was created by [[Neville Longbottom]] using the [[Room of Requirement]]. The Hogwarts Kitchen portrait, a painting of a large bowl filled with fruit, will swing open after the pear gets tickled and giggles, to reveal a hidden door that leads into the kitchens where the Hogwarts house-elves work.

Portraits can also move between paintings, going wherever they like in the same building. However, outside the building, portraits can only move to other paintings of themselves, for example, [[#Portraits in the Headmaster's office|Phineas Nigellus Black]] who has a painting in The Headmaster's Office and at 12 Grimmauld Place. In ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' Harry asks Phineas Nigellus to bring him Dumbledore's painting from Hogwarts through to the 12 Grimmauld Place copy; this is when Black explains that paintings can only move out of Hogwarts into other portraits of themselves.

In ''Deathly Hallows'' Snape takes instruction and advice from Dumbledore's portrait; suggesting that portraits retain memories and personality, or can be enchanted to retain memories. Dumbledore also cries in his portrait when he finds that Harry was successful in defeating Voldemort, again suggesting that portraits keep the memories of those they are painted after.

Authorial statements regarding portraits have been vague. Rowling made a comment in an interview that a portrait is something like a faint imprint of the person in question, imitating the basic attitude and thought patterns of the person. It is therefore completely different from a [[Ghosts (Harry Potter)|ghost]], which, as explained by [[Hogwarts staff#Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]], are the souls of wizards who are afraid to leave the world. Portraits exist completely separately from the person's soul, being just an impression of the person passed on.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80|title=JK Rowling at the Edinburgh Book Festival|date=15 August 2004|publisher=J.

Rowling may have found inspiration in short stories by the French novelist Théophile Gautier (1811–1872). In La Cafetière (The Coffee Pot, 1831) and in Omphale (1834) people in portraits and tapestries come alive, step out from the wall into the room, drink coffee, dance, talk with and kiss the story-teller.<ref>Théophile Gautier and others, ''Tales of the Fantastic'', transl. Patricia Roseberry, Broadwater House, 2002 ISBN 1-903121-02-7</ref>

===Portraits in the Headmaster's office===
The portraits in the Headmaster's office depict all the former Heads of Hogwarts, with the exception of Dolores Umbridge. The portraits act to advise the Headmaster and are "honour-bound to give service to the present headmaster" (according to Armando Dippet). They include:

* '''Phineas Nigellus Black''': Linked to [[Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place]] in London. According to his great-great-grandson [[Sirius Black]], Phineas was the least popular headmaster Hogwarts ever had. In ''Deathly Hallows'', Hermione removes the portrait from 12 Grimmauld Place and takes it with the trio in their quest for [[Horcrux]]es. Phineas is upset by the lack of respect with which the trio treats him, but he provides them with information about events at Hogwarts. Phineas also provides the trio with information on how Dumbledore destroyed a Horcrux and the history of [[Godric Gryffindor's sword]], including that it is goblin made and able to destroy Horcruxes. It is revealed through Snape's memories that Phineas has been helping Snape and Dumbledore find the trio. In the film adaptation of ''Order of the Phoenix'', he is portrayed by [[John Atterbury]].
* '''Armando Dippet''': Preceded Dumbledore, while [[Tom Riddle]] was a student and the latter opened the [[Chamber of Secrets]]. Professor Dippet is also mentioned as favouring Tom Riddle and as being unaware of his true evil nature. Dippet was portrayed by [[Alfred Burke]] in ''Chamber of Secrets''.
* '''Dilys Derwent''': Linked to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] in London.
* '''Professor Everard''': Linked to the Ministry of Magic, particularly to the Department of Mysteries, in London. In ''Order of the Phoenix'', he was portrayed by [[Sam Beazley]].
* '''Dexter Fortescue'''
* '''[[Albus Dumbledore]]'''
* '''[[Severus Snape]]''': Wasn't present when Harry returned to the office after Voldemort's death, but Rowling strongly implies that Harry urged, and was successful in his endeavour, that it be placed up soon thereafter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/snape.html|title=hp-lexicon.org}}</ref>

===The Fat Lady===
The portrait of '''the Fat Lady''' is the door to [[Gryffindor]] Tower, which is hidden behind her painting. She will open it (sometimes grudgingly) when the correct password is uttered. She is often upset after being awoken, and is often seen drunk with her best friend, Violet. The Fat Lady has no other known name, and it is unknown whether she is supposed to represent a real person. In ''Philosopher's Stone'', she leaves her portrait in the middle of the night, locking Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville out of Gryffindor Tower, forcing them to run across the school. Luckily for them, when they return, she has returned to her portrait, allowing them to escape into Gryffindor Tower. In ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', Sirius Black slashes the Fat Lady's portrait when she won't let him in without a password and it is some time before she dares to guard Gryffindor Tower again. After her portrait was restored, she requested protection in case someone tried to attack her portrait again. Thus, two security trolls were hired. In ''Half Blood Prince'', she gets so annoyed with Harry's late return that she pretends the password has changed and tries to call him back when he heads off to talk to Dumbledore. When Harry later confirms Dumbledore's death, she lets out a sob and for the only time in the series, she opens without the password for Harry in her grief.

In the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|first film]] the Fat Lady is played by [[Elizabeth Spriggs]], and by [[Dawn French]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|third film]].

*Sir Cadogan&nbsp;— a portrait described by Ron in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' as "mental". When the Fat Lady left (after her painting was slashed), he guarded the Gryffindor common room, it being admitted that he was the only one brave (or possibly crazy) enough to do so after the attack. He developed a reputation for making new and difficult passwords for the students to enter the Gryffindor common room and was eventually fired after letting Sirius Black into the common room.
*Violet, a friend of the Fat Lady.
*Walburga Black at 12 Grimmauld Place.
*Ariana Dumbledore at the Hog's Head.
*The portrait of a mermaid in the Prefects' bathroom.
*The Hogwarts Kitchens Portrait, which depicts a large bowl of fruit. The hidden door leading to the kitchens becomes visible after tickling the pear on the portrait.
*Elfrida Cragg (Ministry of Magic).
*Medieval Healer in St Mungo's stairwell.
*A magical portrait in the muggle Prime Minister's office depicts a ''"froglike little man wearing a long silver wig"'', and is used by the Ministry to communicate with the Prime Minister of the day.
*[[Anne Boleyn]] in the Grand Staircase (''Philosopher's Stone'' film only).
*Moving kittens painted on wall-mounted china plates in Dolores Umbridge's office at Hogwarts and within the Ministry.
*The portrait of the Friars with a 500-year-old vat of wine, which is consumed by the Fat Lady and Violet during Christmas of 1996.
*The Portrait of Dilys Derwent at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.
*Barnabus the Barmy attempting to teach trolls how to ballet dance outside the Room of Requirement. The "portrait" of Barnabus the Barmy is actually a tapestry, as mentioned in the Harry Potter books.

===Photographs===
Wizarding photographs of people have similar properties to magical painted portraits: the figures within move about or even sometimes leave the frame. As with the paintings, the images of people in the photographs do not appear to age. Photographs from ordinary muggle cameras can be made to seem alive. [[Colin Creevey]] mentions in ''Chamber of Secrets'' that a boy in his dormitory said that if he develops the film 'in the right potion', the pictures will move.<ref name="{{HP2}}ch6">{{HP2}}, chapter 6</ref> However, figures in Wizarding pictures do not reflect the emotions or actions of their counterparts in the real world, and cannot speak. Moving photos also appear in wizard newspapers and other print media, as well as on [[Harry Potter universe#Magical sweets|Chocolate Frog]] cards. This is exemplified in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' when pictures of Sirius are printed in ''[[Harry Potter universe#The Daily Prophet|The Daily Prophet]]'' newspaper.<ref name="{{HP3}}ch3">{{HP3}}, chapter 3</ref> The magazine ''[[Harry Potter universe#Other magazines|Witch Weekly]]'' also contains pictures of smiling and winking witches. The images of people in photographs display little sentience. The subjects of some photographs can leave the frame, but no indication has been given that they are able to visit or communicate with other photographs or with people in the world, as happens with their painted counterparts. However, it appears that they do have some knowledge of current events, as seen by Harry when he goes to Mr Weasley's office on ''Order of the Phoenix''. The family photograph on Arthur's desk shows everyone except Percy "who appeared to have walked out of it",<ref name="{{HP5}}ch7">{{HP5}}, chapter 7</ref> Percy having fallen out with his family over the summer.
It is also mentioned that in a photo (taken by [[Colin Creevey]]) of [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] and Harry, Harry's picture had walked out and was resisting all of Lockhart's efforts to pull him back in.

[[Image:Patuxent preserve outside.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Patuxent Wildlife Research Center]].]]

The '''Patuxent River''' is a [[tributary]] of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in the state of [[Maryland]].  There are three main river drainages for central Maryland:  the [[Potomac River]] to the west passing through [[Washington D.C.]], the [[Patapsco River]] to the northeast passing through Baltimore, and the Patuxent River between the two.  The {{convert|937|sqmi|km2|0|adj=on}} Patuxent [[drainage basin|watershed]] had a rapidly growing population of 590,769 in 2000. It is the largest and longest river entirely within Maryland, and its [[drainage basin|watershed]] is the largest completely within the state.

==Geography==
The river source, {{convert|115|mi|km|0}} from the Chesapeake, is in the hills of the Maryland [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] near the intersection of four counties – [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard]], [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick]], [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]] and [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll]], and only {{convert|0.6|mi}} from Parr's Spring, the source of the south fork of the [[Patapsco River]].  Flowing in a generally southeastward direction, the Patuxent crosses the urbanized corridor between [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], and opens up into a navigable tidal [[estuary]] near the colonial seaport of [[Queen Anne, Prince George's County, Maryland|Queen Anne]] in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], just southeast of [[Bowie, Maryland|Bowie]], finding the Chesapeake Bay {{convert|52|mi|km|0}} later.  The fifty-two mile-long tidal [[estuary]] is never wider than {{convert|2.3|mi|km|1}}.

It marks the boundary between [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]], [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]], [[Charles County, Maryland|Charles]] and [[Saint Mary's County, Maryland|St. Mary's]] counties on the west and [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard]], [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel]], and [[Calvert County, Maryland|Calvert]] counties on the east.  The Chesapeake estuary's deepest point, {{convert|130|ft|m|0}} below sea level, is in the lower Patuxent.

{{anchor|Western Branch}}The '''Little Patuxent River''', the '''Middle Patuxent River''', and the '''Western Branch''' are the three largest tributaries.   The Middle Patuxent flows into the Little Patuxent just upstream from the historic [[Savage Mill]] in [[Savage, Maryland|Savage]].  The Little Patuxent then joins the Patuxent just southwest of [[Crofton, Maryland|Crofton]]. The Middle Patuxent flows {{convert|24|mi}} through the middle of Howard County, while the Little Patuxent flows {{convert|38|mi}} through northeast and southeast Howard County and western Anne Arundel County.<ref name=NHD>U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. [http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/ The National Map], accessed April 1, 2011</ref>  Western Branch originates under the name Folly Branch in the Wingate Drive area of the northern part of [[Glenn Dale, Maryland|Glenn Dale]], assuming the name "Western Branch" in [[Woodmore, Maryland|Woodmore]], continuing southward through Prince George's County, joined by [[Collington Branch]] before it joins the Patuxent near [[Upper Marlboro, Maryland|Upper Marlboro]].

==History==
Indians have lived along the Patuxent River since at least 6500 BC.<ref name=furgurson>[http://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2011/04/amazing-artifacts-unearthed-at-pig.html "Amazing artifacts unearthed at Pig Point"], E.B.

==Economy and commerce==
[[Tobacco]] farming dominated the Patuxent's economy for the two centuries following settlement, with about sixty percent of Maryland's tobacco coming from the Patuxent valley by the late 18th century.

Destruction of the plantations by the British and of the soil by centuries of tobacco farming brought the mid and lower Patuxent valley into a period of decline that would last until the 1930s, when there were fewer residents in the Patuxent's Calvert County than there were in the 1840s, and only a few hundred more than in the first Calvert County [[census]] in 1790.

The Patuxent was plied by regular [[steamship]] service, mostly from the Weems Line, from the 1820s to the 1920s, replacing the [[schooner]]s and sailing [[Packet (sea transport)|packets]] that had for the previous centuries served the river's many landings and docks along the {{convert|52|mi|km|0|sing=on}} tidal reach.

The [[Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission]] constructed two dams on the main branch in the mid-20th century. [[Brighton Dam]] was constructed {{convert|96|mi|km|0}} from the Chesapeake in 1943, impounding the waters of [[Triadelphia Reservoir]]; in 1952 the [[T. Howard Duckett Dam]] was constructed {{convert|14|mi|km|0}} further downstream, near Laurel, thus creating [[Rocky Gorge Reservoir]].<ref>Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. Laurel, MD (2007).

With public recreational land on one or both shores of 74 of the river's 115 miles including the reservoir land, the impact that recreation in natural settings now has on the river's economy is obvious.   The [[NAS Patuxent River|Patuxent Naval Air Station]] at the mouth of the river has continued to grow over past decades, providing along with tourism another main economic engine in the lower river valley which includes the popular boating center of [[Solomons, Maryland|Solomons]].

==Environmental concerns==
The Middle and Little Patuxent watersheds include nearly all of [[Columbia, Maryland]], including its downtown urban [[Lake Kittamaqundi]] and Wilde Lake.  Columbia is a large planned community in Howard County that opened in 1967. Columbia's major downtown roadway is called Little Patuxent Parkway, and [[Maryland Route 175]] in East Columbia was known as the Patuxent Parkway until May 2006, when it was renamed for Columbia's founder, the late [[James Rouse]], and his wife, Patty.  It was the largely unchecked [[erosion]] from this late 1960s and 1970s building spree that contributed the bulk of the Patuxent River's highest and most damaging [[sediment]], [[siltation]], and [[water pollution|pollution]] levels to date downstream.  This in turn led to a nearly complete destruction of a once thriving [[seafood]] industry along the [[brackish]] portion of the river.

Quote attributed to Congressman [[Steny Hoyer]].</ref> Fowler, as an early-1970s Calvert County Commissioner, led the way in a lawsuit filed by downriver Charles, Calvert and St. Mary's counties against upriver counties.  The lawsuit forced the state, the upriver counties, and the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] to enact pollution control measures.  Between 1985 and 2005, the Patuxent saw a 26% decrease in [[nitrogen]], a 46% decrease in [[phosphorus]], and a 35% reduction in sediment, despite [[urbanization|urban areas]] increasing to 31% of the watershed by 2002.  Of the Chesapeake's major tributaries, the Patuxent is the only one having most of its harmful phosphorus and nitrogen nutrient overloads coming from [[urban runoff]].  The river's other two largest contributors, [[point source]]s ([[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial]], [[sewage]], etc.) and the declining (24%) [[agriculture|agricultural]] areas, contribute less of the nutrient load.  [[Forest]]ed areas account for 43% of the watershed.<ref>{{cite web

Over the past 50 years, nationally recognized land preservation efforts in this part of Maryland have saved tens of thousands of acres from the Baltimore-Washington [[bedroom community]] [[urban sprawl|sprawl]]. The southern half of the U.S. Army's [[Fort Meade]] was added to the [[Patuxent Wildlife Research Center]], which, at {{convert|12300|acre|km2|0}}, is the [[List of parks in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area|second largest contiguous public park-refuge within {{convert|30|mi|km|-1}} of either Washington or Baltimore]].  It is located midway between these two cities.  The contiguous public area of {{convert|8575|acre|km2|0}} centered on Jug Bay, {{convert|42|mi|km|0}} upriver from the Chesapeake, form the fifth largest such Baltimore-DC preserve and largest tidewater one and consist of the [[Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary]], the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, and the Jug Bay component of the Patuxent River Park.  The {{convert|6600|acre|km2|0|sing=on}} Patuxent River State Park in the uppermost part of the basin is the seventh largest.

'''Clark Y''' is the name of a particular [[airfoil|aerofoil]] profile, widely used in general purpose [[aircraft]] designs, and much studied in [[aerodynamics]] over the years. The profile was designed in 1922 by [[Virginius E. Clark]]. The airfoil has a thickness of 11.7 percent and is flat on the lower surface from 30 percent of [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] back. The flat bottom simplifies angle measurements on propellers, and makes for easy construction of wings on a flat surface.

The [[Lockheed Vega]] is one example of the Clark Y used in practice. For many applications the Clark Y has been adequate; it gives reasonable overall performance in respect of its [[lift-to-drag ratio]], and has gentle and relatively benign [[Stall (flight)|stall]] characteristics. But the flat lower surface is sub-optimal from an aerodynamic perspective, and it is rarely used in new designs. The [[Spirit of St. Louis]] used the Clark Y; the [[Piper Cub]] used the quite similar USA 35B.
[[Image:Clark YH.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Clark YH wingroot of a [[Yakovlev Yak-18T|Yak-18T]]]]

The [[Northrop Tacit Blue]] stealth technology demonstrator aircraft also used the Clark-Y.<ref>Piccirillo, Albert, "The Clark Y Airfoil - A Historical Retrospective," SAE/AIAA paper 2000-01-5517, presented at the World Aviation Congress & Exposition, October 10, 2000, San Diego, California.</ref>  The Clark-Y was chosen for this application, as its flat bottom worked well with the design goal of a low radar cross-section.

The Clark YH airfoil is the similar but with a reflexed (turned up) [[trailing edge]] producing a more positive [[pitching moment]] reducing the horizontal tail load required to trim an aircraft. The [[Hawker Hurricane]], [[Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk]] and [[Nanchang CJ-6]] used this profile.<ref>[http://www.ae.illinois.edu/m-selig/ads/aircraft.html The Incomplete Guide to Airfoil Usage] Retrieved 27 May 2013.</ref> ?any [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aircraft of the 1930s and 1940s including all of the [[World War II]] [[Yakovlev]] fighters and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3|MiG-3]] used the Clark YH airfoil.<ref>?????? ?.?.

ISBN 5-217-00477-0) (''History of aircraft design in USSR: 1938-1950'')</ref>

==Model aircraft==
The Clark Y has found tremendous favour for the construction of model aircraft, thanks to the flight performance that the section offers at medium [[Reynolds number]] airflows. Application on model aircraft is very wide, ranging from free-flight gliders through to multi-engined radio control scale models.

The Clark Y is appealing for its near-horizontal lower surface, which aids in the accurate construction of wings on plans mounted on a flat construction board.  Young and inexperienced modellers are able to build model aircraft which provide a good flight performance. The benign stalling characteristics of the airfoil are another aid, as this allows an inexperienced radio-control model hobbyist a better possibility of recovering from a stall in flight, to the benefit of the model.<ref>Martin Simons, ''Model Aeroplane Aerodynamics'', Model & Allied Publications 1978. Chapter 7 - 9, Aerofoil Sections.</ref>

The depth of the section lends itself to easier wing repair, as the modeller will often then have better access to balsa structural elements. In addition, the Clark Y section's depth also permits the flush installation of what are considered "standard" sized R/C servo motors within a wing for actuation of ailerons, flaps etc., without an excessive reduction in performance.

==Applications==

'''Brandon Tartikoff''' (January 13, 1949 – August 27, 1997) was a television executive who was credited with turning around NBC's low [[prime time]] reputation with such hit series as ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', ''[[L.A. Law]]'', ''[[Law & Order]]'', ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'', ''[[Family Ties]]'', ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', ''[[Cheers]]'', ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[Miami Vice]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[The A-Team]]'',[[Saved by the Bell]],[[St. Elsewhere]]'', ''[[Night Court]]'', ''[[Hunter (U.S. TV series)|Hunter]]'', ''[[Highway to Heaven]]'', ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'', ''[[Remington Steele]]'', ''[[A Different World]]'', ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]'', and ''[[Empty Nest (TV series)|Empty Nest]]''.

Tartikoff also helped develop the 1984 sitcom ''[[Punky Brewster]]''; he named the title character after a girl he had a crush on in school. Punky Brewster's pet dog Brandon was named after Tartikoff. He was also involved in the creation of the acclaimed ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Beggars and Choosers (TV series)|Beggars and Choosers]]''.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family<ref>Norwood, Stephen Harlan and Eunice G. Pollack [http://books.google.com/books?id=IB3mBsgfIHQC&pg=PA477&lpg=PA477&dq=Brandon+Tartikoff+jew&source=bl&ots=WmlC5KzkzV&sig=TczUStLCnmrWec6IAnIFldXCr8c&hl=en&sa=X&ei=y7HGUPfSHK-50AGynYC4Aw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&q=Brandon%20Tartikoff&f=false] Encyclopedia of American Jewish History. 2008</ref>  in [[Freeport, New York|Freeport]], [[New York]], Tartikoff was a graduate of the [[Lawrenceville School]] and [[Yale University]], where he contributed to campus humor magazine ''[[The Yale Record]]''.

While attending Yale, Tartikoff worked as an account executive and sales manager for [[WTNH|WNHC-TV]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], as well as in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. Tartikoff spent vacations in Los Angeles looking for a job in network television.

After graduating from Yale, he took a series of jobs in advertising and local television, including [[WLS-TV]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]].

===Career at NBC===
Tartikoff was hired as a program executive at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1976. One year later, he moved to NBC (after being hired by [[Dick Ebersol]] to direct comedy programming). Tartikoff took over programming duties at NBC from [[Fred Silverman]] in 1981.<ref name="BarberaAutoBio">{{cite book|last=Barbera|first=Joseph|title=My Life in "Toons": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century|year=1994|publisher=[[Turner Publishing]]|location=Atlanta, GA|isbn= 1-57036-042-1|pages=188–189}}</ref> At age 32, Tartikoff became the youngest president of NBC's entertainment division.

When Tartikoff took over, NBC was in last place behind ABC and CBS, and the very future of the network was in doubt. A writers' strike was looming, affiliates were defecting, mostly to ABC, and the network had only three [[prime time]] shows in the Top 20: ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' and ''[[Real People]]''. [[Johnny Carson]] was reportedly in talks to move his landmark late-night talk show to ABC. The entire cast and writers of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' had left that late-night sketch-comedy series, and their replacements had received some of the show's worst critical notices.  By 1982, Tartikoff and his new superior, the highly regarded former producer [[Grant Tinker]], slowly, but surely turned the network's fortunes around.<ref name="BrandonAutoBio">{{cite book |last=Tartikoff |first=Brandon |title=The Last Great Ride |publisher=Hyperion Books |location=New York |year=1992 |isbn=0-394-58709-X}}</ref>

As head of NBC's Entertainment Division, Tartikoff's successes included ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', for which Tartikoff had pursued actor-comedian [[Bill Cosby]] to create a [[pilot episode|pilot]] after having been impressed by Cosby's stories when Cosby guest-hosted ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]''. Tartikoff wrote a [[brainstorming]] [[memorandum|memo]] that simply read "[[MTV]] [[police|cops]],"<ref name=makingofvice>{{cite book |last= Janeshutz |first= Trish |authorlink= Trish Janeshutz |title=The Making of Miami Vice |publisher=Ballatine Books |location=New York |year= 1986 |pages=12 |isbn= 0-345-33669-0}}</ref><ref name=coolcops>{{cite journal |last=Zoglin |first=Richard |authorlink= Richard Zoglin |date=1985-09-16 |title=Cool Cops, Hot Show |journal=Time Magazine |publisher=Time Inc. |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959822,00.html |accessdate= 2007-11-02}}</ref><ref name=memo>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1D91438F93AA25757C0A96E948260 |title=Guiding No. 1: The Man Who Programs NBC |date=1988-04-19 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |last=Boyer |first=Peter J. |work=New York Times}}</ref><ref name=nbcmiamivice>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc.com/Vintage_Shows/Miami_Vice/about/index.shtml |title=About the Show |work=NBC Universal, Inc. |accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref> and later presented the memo to series creator [[Anthony Yerkovich]], formerly a writer and producer for ''[[Hill Street Blues]]''. The result was ''[[Miami Vice]]'', which became an icon of 1980s pop culture.<ref name=coolcops/> ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' was inspired by a perceived lack of leading men who could act, with Tartikoff suggesting that a talking car could fill in the gaps in any leading man's acting abilities.<ref name="BrandonAutoBio"/>

During the casting process of ''[[Family Ties]]'', Tartikoff was unexcited about [[Michael J. Fox]] for the role of Alex P. Keaton.<ref name="BrandonAutoBio"/> However, the show's producer, [[Gary David Goldberg]], insisted until Tartikoff relented, saying, "Go ahead if you insist. But I'm telling you, this is not the kind of face you'll ever see on a [[lunch box]]." Some years later, after the movie ''[[Back to the Future]]'' cemented Fox's stardom, Fox good-naturedly sent Tartikoff a lunch box with Fox's picture on it and a note inside reading: "To Brandon: This is for you to put your [[Eat crow|crow]] in. Love and Kisses, Michael J. Fox." Tartikoff kept the lunch box in his office for the rest of his career.

Johnny Carson broke the news of his retirement in February 1991 to Tartikoff at the Grille in Beverly Hills.  For several days only Tartikoff and NBC Chairman Bob Wright knew of the planned retirement.<ref name="BrandonAutoBio"/>

Tartikoff wrote in his memoirs that his biggest professional regret was cancelling the series ''[[Buffalo Bill (TV series)|Buffalo Bill]]'', which he later went on to include in a fantasy "dream schedule" created for a ''[[TV Guide]]'' article that detailed his idea of "The Greatest Network Ever."

====Appearances on NBC's shows====
During his time at NBC, he made appearances in several of the network's shows. He hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1983 and appeared as himself in an episode of ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'', where, very tongue-in-cheek, he shortly entertains the notion of a "show about a high school principal and his kids," before scoffing at the idea. During his 1983 appearance on ''Saturday Night Live'', one skit featured Tartikoff in a black leather ensemble, with the words "Be There" spelled out in [[rhinestone]]s on the back of his jacket. "Be There" was NBC's [[slogan]] during the 1983–1984 season, a fitting example of clever hidden advertising. He also appeared as himself in episodes of ''[[Night Court]]'', ''[[Night Stand with Dick Dietrick]] and ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'', and in the background of one of the final episodes of ''Cheers''. [[David Leisure]] also played Tartikoff in an episode of ''ALF''.

===Post-NBC career===
He left NBC in 1991, moving to [[Paramount Pictures]] to become its chairman. A year later, Brandon left that post to spend more time with his daughter, Calla, who was injured in a car crash near the family's [[Lake Tahoe]] home.

In 1994, he made his comeback to national TV with ''Last Call'', a short-lived late-night discussion show he produced. That same year he also produced ''[[Steven Banks|The Steven Banks Show]]'' for [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. Later that year, he began a brief run as chairman of [[New World Communications|New World Entertainment]]. Just prior to his death, Tartikoff served as the chairman of the [[AOL]] project "Entertainment Asylum," for which he teamed with [[Scott Zakarin]] to build the world's first interactive broadcast studio.  He also continued to do on-air appearances on shows such as ''[[Dave's World]]'' and ''[[Arli$$]]''.

===Family===
In 1982, he married [[Lilly Tartikoff]] (née Samuels). They had two daughters Calla Lianne and Elizabeth Justine. In 1991, their 8 year old daughter Calla suffered a severe brain injury in a car accident and was required to receive intense therapy in order to walk and speak again. Lilly and Calla own a restaurant in West Los Angeles called Colony Cafe.

Tartikoff's parents were survivors of the [[Tenerife disaster|collision of two 747s]] on [[Tenerife]], [[Canary Islands]], in 1977.<ref>''[[Newsweek]]'', March 1977.</ref>

===Death===
Tartikoff died on August 27, 1997 from [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] cancer, with which he had three separate bouts over 25 years. He was 48 years old. He was interred in [[Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The ''Deep Space Nine'' sixth-season premiere, "[[A Time to Stand]]", began with a title card reading "In memory of Brandon Tartikoff." A similar card appeared at the end of the ninth-season premiere of ''[[Seinfeld]]'', "[[The Butter Shave]]".  On Friday, August 29, 1997, ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' ran an extended tribute to Tartikoff which featured many of his proteges, including [[Warren Littlefield]], [[Dick Ebersol]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Ted Danson]], and [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. It won its time period in the Nielsen ratings.

{{Communion}}
'''Closed communion''' is the practice of restricting the serving of the elements of [[Holy Communion]] (also called Eucharist, The Lord's Supper) to those who are members in good standing of a particular church, denomination, sect, or congregation. Though the meaning of the term varies slightly in different [[Christian]] theological traditions, it generally means that a church or denomination limits participation either to members of their own church, members of their own denomination, or members of some specific class (e.g., baptized members of evangelical churches).  See also [[intercommunion]].

A closed-communion church is one that (perhaps with exceptions in unusual circumstances) excludes non-members from receiving [[Eucharist|communion]]. This is the practice of all churches dating from before the [[Protestant Reformation]] and also of some [[Protestant]] church such as [[Lutherans]] and [[Baptists]]. Lutherans require catechetical instruction for all people, even members from other Lutheran Churches, before receiving the Eucharist while some Baptist churches require part membership while others even require ''full membership'' before participating in the communion service.

Churches which practice [[open communion]] allow all Christians to partake in the Lord's Supper, with membership in a particular Christian community not required to receive bread and wine, in contrast to pre-Reformation churches, which hold that what is received in their celebrations ceases to be bread and wine.

==Practice==

===Catholic Church===
The [[Catholic Church]] (including all its component [[particular Church]]es, whether [[Latin Church|Latin]] or [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern]]) practices closed communion. However, provided that "necessity requires it or true spiritual advantage suggests it" and that the danger of error or indifferentism is avoided, it allows those of its members who cannot approach a Catholic minister to receive the Eucharist from ministers of churches that have a valid Eucharist.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2T.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 844 §2]</ref> It also permits properly disposed members of the Eastern churches and of churches judged to be in the same situation with regard to the sacraments to receive the Eucharist from Catholic ministers, if they seek it of their own accord.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2T.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 844 §3]</ref> The ''Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism'' warns that "due consideration should be given to the discipline of the Eastern Churches for their own faithful and any suggestion of proselytism should be avoided."<ref>''Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism'', 125</ref> [[Western Christianity|Western Christians]] who do not share the Catholic theology of the Eucharist (such as those who follow Reformed Protestant teaching on the matter) are absolutely excluded. Those who do personally share Catholic belief in the Eucharist (as the body and blood of the risen Christ, accompanied by his soul and divinity, under the appearances of bread and wine) are permitted to receive the sacrament when there is danger of death or, in the judgement of the diocesan bishop or of the episcopal conference, some other grave necessity urges it and on condition that "the person be unable to have recourse for the sacrament to a minister of his or her own Church or ecclesial Community, ask for the sacrament of his or her own initiative, manifest Catholic faith in the sacrament and be properly disposed".<ref>''Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism'', 131</ref><ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2T.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 844 §4]</ref>

The [[Catholic Church]] does not practise open communion, holding that reception of Holy Communion is reserved for those who are baptized.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2S.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 842 §1] and [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2S.HTM Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 675 §2]</ref> In general it permits access to its Eucharistic communion only to those who share its oneness in faith, worship and ecclesial life.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2S.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 844 §1] and [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_PIN.HTM Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 671 §1]</ref> For the same reasons, it also recognizes that in certain circumstances, by way of exception, and under certain conditions, access to these sacraments may be permitted for Christians of other Churches and ecclesial Communities. Thus it permits [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]] who are not in [[full communion]] with the Catholic Church ([[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and [[Assyrian Church of the East]]) to receive Communion from Catholic ministers, if they request it of their own accord and are properly disposed, and it applies the same rule also to some Western Churches that the [[Holy See]] judges to be in a situation similar to that of Eastern Christians with regard to the sacraments.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2S.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 844 §3] and [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_PIN.HTM Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 671 §3]</ref> For other baptized Christians ([[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], and other [[Protestantism|Protestants]]) the conditions are more severe. Only in danger of death or if, in the judgement of the local bishop, there is a grave and pressing need, may members of these Churches who cannot approach a minister of their own Church be admitted to receive the Eucharist, if they spontaneously ask for it, demonstrate that they have the catholic faith in the Eucharist, and are properly disposed.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2S.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 844 §4] and [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_PIN.HTM Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 671 §4]</ref>

The Catholic Church allows its own faithful to receive Communion from ministers of another Church, only if it recognizes the validity of the sacraments of that Church, and so it never allows reception of Communion as administered in Protestant churches, the validity of whose [[holy orders|orders]] it denies. Other conditions are that it is physically or morally impossible to approach a Catholic minister, that it is a case of real need or spiritual benefit, and that the danger of error or indifferentism is avoided.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2S.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 844 §2] and [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_PIN.HTM Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 671 §2]</ref>

The Catholic Church thus makes a clear distinction between Churches according as it recognizes or denies the validity of their celebration of the Eucharist.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/intercommunion.htm Communion of Non-Catholics or Intercommunion]</ref> It does not allow a Catholic to receive communion in a Protestant church, since it considers that Protestant ministers are not ordained as priests by a bishop in a [[Apostolic Succession|line of valid succession from the apostles]]. It applies this rule also to the Anglican Communion, pursuant to [[Apostolicae Curae]], a position that the [[Church of England]] disputed in ''[[Saepius Officio]]''.

===Lutheran===
[[Confessional Lutheran]] churches, including the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]], practice ''closed communion'' and require [[Luther's Small Catechism|catechetical]] instruction for all people before receiving the Eucharist.<ref>[http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=42 "Closed Communion" @ www.lcms.org].

And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the one loaf" and Paul's teaching of fellowship in 1 Corinthians 1:10, "I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought." These Lutherans also take seriously God's threat in 1 Corinthians 11:27,29 that "Whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of this cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself." Therefore, the belief is that, inviting those forward who have not been first instructed would be unloving on the church's part, because they would inviting people forward to sin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wels.net/news-events/forward-in-christ/june-1986/communion-both-close-and-closed?page=0,1 |title=Communion-both "close" and "closed" &#124; Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod |publisher=WELS |date= |accessdate=14 October 2013}}</ref> This is described as akin to letting someone drink poison without stopping him <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wels.net/what-we-believe/questions-answers/fellowship/wels-fellowship-and-worship-principles |title=&#124; Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod |publisher=WELS |date= |accessdate=14 October 2013}}</ref>

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA), the largest Lutheran Church in America, however, does not practice closed communion, but rather "eucharistic hospitality."<ref name="autogenerated1997">''Use of the Means of Grace: A Statement on the Practice of Word and Sacrament'', ELCA, 1997).</ref> In terms of guests receiving the Sacrament, according to this practice, the burden of decision of admittance to the Sacrament is not on the host congregation, but on its guests. The invitation to the Sacrament is extended to "all baptized persons," along with "a brief written or oral statement in worship which teaches Christ's presence in the sacrament." In terms of members receiving the Sacrament, reception of the Sacrament is always to include "continuing catechesis [which] include[s] instruction for Holy Communion," but this is not a prerequisite for first communion, and even infants may be permitted to receive the Sacrament at or after the service of their baptism.<ref name="autogenerated1997"/><ref>[http://www.elca.org/Growing-In-Faith/Worship/Learning-Center/FAQs/Communion-Age.aspx At what age do ELCA congregations allow members their first Communion?]. Retrieved 2010-01-17.</ref>

===Eastern Orthodox===
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], comprising 14 or 15 [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] hierarchical churches, is even more strictly a closed-communion Church.  Thus, a member of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] attending the [[Divine Liturgy]] in a [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox Church]] will be allowed to receive communion and ''vice versa'', but a [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Nontrinitarianism|Nontrinitarian Christian]], or a Catholic attending an Orthodox [[Divine Liturgy]] will be excluded from communion, although they may otherwise fully participate in the worship service. In the strictest sense, non-Orthodox may be present at the Divine Liturgy only up to the exclamation "The doors! The doors!" and ought to leave the church after that. However, this attitude has been relaxed in most Orthodox churches; a non-communicant may stay and participate in the Divine Liturgy but may not partake of the Eucharist.<ref>Timothy Ware, "The Orthodox Church" 1963.</ref> Thus, while in certain conditions the Catholic Church allows its faithful who cannot approach a Catholic minister to receive the Eucharist from an Eastern Orthodox priest, the Eastern Orthodox Church does not admit Catholics to its Mystery of the Eucharist.  At the very end of the Divine Liturgy, all people come up to receive a little piece of bread, called [[Antidoron]], which is blessed but not consecrated, being taken from the same loaf as the bread used in the consecration.  Non-Orthodox present at the Liturgy are not only permitted but even encouraged to receive the [[Antidoron]] as an expression of Christian fellowship and love.

===Baptists===
Some [[Baptists]] practice ''closed communion'' even more strictly than the [[Catholic Church]], [[Lutheran Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. They restrict communion (or [[the Lord's Supper]]) to members of the local church observing the ordinance.  So thus, members from other churches, even members of other local churches of the same Baptist group are excluded from participating in the communion. The [[Strict Baptists]] in the United Kingdom derive their name from this practice. In the [[United States]], it is usually, but not exclusively, associated with [[Landmark Baptist Church|Landmark]] ecclesiology. For a similar practice by some others, see [[#"Close Communion"|"Close Communion"]], below.

The closed communion practiced by [[Primitive Baptists]] admits participation by Primitive Baptists who do not belong to the local church.<ref>http://marchtozion.com/church/134-why-primitive-baptists-practice-closed-communion</ref>

===Other groups===
The [[Orthodox Presbyterian Church]], the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church]], the [[Reformed Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[Exclusive Brethren]], the [[Apostolic Christian Church]], the [[Church of the Brethren]], [[Mennonites]], [[Amish]], some [[Anglicans]], the [[Church of God in Christ]], the [[Church of God of Prophecy]], and some other churches in the [[Reformed]] tradition such as [[Calvinists]] also practice closed communion. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] hold that only the [[144,000]] should receive communion. Other nontrinitarian Christians that practice closed communion include the [[Church of God (Seventh Day)]], [[Christadelphians]], and [[Oneness Pentecostals]] such as the [[True Jesus Church]].<ref>http://www.cerm.info/bible_studies/Apologetics/Oneness_pentecostalism.htm</ref>

===Latter Day Saints===
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) serves communion to its members only although without forbidding others to participate{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, but the [[Community of Christ]] (formerly the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]) practices open communion.

=="Close Communion"==<!-- This section is linked from [[Baptist]] -->
[[File:FranzPieper.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Pieper]], June 27, 1852 - June 3, 1931]]
Among the modern descendants of the [[Anabaptists]], the [[Amish]], [[Old Order Mennonites]] and [[Conservative Mennonites]] all practice what they term ''close communion'', restricting communion to members of a local congregation only.

The term ''close communion'' normally means the same thing as ''closed communion''. However, some make a distinction, so the terms can be a source of confusion.

The most prominent distinction (which in some circles may be called "cracked communion") is one where a member of a congregation holding the "same faith and practice" as the hosting congregation (generally meaning being a member of a congregation in the same or a similar denomination) may participate in the service, but a member of another denomination may not.  For example, a Southern Baptist congregation practicing close communion might allow a member of another Southern Baptist congregation to participate, on the premise that both congregations are of the "same faith and practice" as they are both in the same denomination.  Similarly, the Southern Baptist congregation might allow a member of an Independent Baptist congregation to participate; though the congregations are of different denominations the differences between them are mainly in the area of church organization and not in doctrinal issues, thus falling under the "same faith and practice" rule.  However, the congregation would thus exclude a Catholic, on the basis that Baptists and Catholics are not of the "same faith and practice".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baptisttheology.org/documents/BaptismasPrerequisteforSupper.pdf |title=Baptism as a Prerequisite  to the Lord’s Supper |first=Nathan |last=Finn |publisher=The Center for Theological Research |date=September 2006 |page=10}}</ref>

The [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of Australia]] allows communion to those who can assent to the first three terms of its [http://rpca.org.au/resources/church-covenants/], and discuss this with the elders ahead of time.  They don't appear to distinguish the term "close communion" from "closed communion", though.

The earliest use of ''close communion'' comes from a mistranslation of the Lutheran theologian Franz August Otto Pieper's ''Christian Dogmatics''. The term has since spread, although both the first edition and later translations corrected the error to "closed communion." <ref>[http://user.txcyber.com/~wd5iqr/tcl/closed.htm Text from Minister to Minister, Sept. 1997 - Gerald Kieschnick, President Texas District]</ref>

==Supporting belief==
Complex reasons underlie the belief. In 1 Corinthians 10, it is written: "The chalice of benediction which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? And the bread which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord? For we, being many, are one bread, one body: all that partake of one bread." Since all Christians are now no longer of a unity that would allow common celebration of the Eucharist between them all, the bread being a visible sign of union, communion is not taken together between separated Churches and communities. Additionally as described in 1Co 11:29:  "For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body."  It is deemed better to prevent outsiders from taking communion than to risk them taking communion "unworthily". Catholics thus see the communion as sinful for those who do not recognise the [[Real Presence]] or who are otherwise 'unworthy', i.e. who are not in the 'right place' to accept the Eucharist (free of [[mortal sin]]). Christian communities that keep close communion often also have accountability within those members that partake of the communion, so that they do not run afoul of this problem.  Such communities will also delay taking communion until the members (the church body) can take communion in Christian unity, as required by 1Co 11:33  "Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another."

[[Justin Martyr]] indicated that the second-century Christian Church had three requirements for sharing in the Eucharist: identity of belief, Christian baptism, and moral life. "No one may share in the eucharist except those who believe in the truth of our teachings and have been washed in the bath which confers forgiveness of sins and rebirth, and who live according to Christ's commands" (''[[First Apology]]'', 66).

Corporate responsibility is another argument often used in favour of closed communion. The [[Heidelberg Catechism]], for example, says that those who "by confession and life, declare themselves unbelieving and ungodly" are not to be admitted to the Lord's Supper, for then "the covenant of God would be profaned, and his wrath kindled against the whole congregation." Church leaders are obliged to do all they can to ensure that this does not happen, and hence "exclude such persons... till they show amendment of life," (Q & A 82).

==Fenced table==

In Protestant theology, a fenced table is a communion table which is open only to accredited members of the Christian community. Fencing the table is thus the opposite of open communion, where the invitation to the sacrament is extended to "all who love the Lord" and members of any denomination are welcome at their own discretion.

The phrase goes back to early Scottish Calvinism, where the communion table literally had a fence around it, with a gate at each end. The members of the congregation were allowed to pass the gate on showing their [[communion token]], a specially minted coin which served as an admission ticket and was given only to those who were in good standing with the local congregation and could pass a test of the catechism. Examples of this kind of church furnishing are still to be seen in a very few highland churches.
[[File:South Leith communion token obverse.jpg|thumb|150px|A [[communion token]] from [[South Leith Parish Church]].]]
The phrase "fencing the table" is also used metaphorically for other kinds of group demarcation and restrictive practices.

==Communion tokens==
{{main|Communion token}}
Many Scottish Protestant churches used to give tokens to members passing a religious test prior to the day of communion, then required the token for entry.  Some US and other churches also used communion tokens.

The '''Cayman Trough''', (also known as the '''Cayman Trench''', '''Bartlett Deep''' and '''Bartlett Trough''') is a complex [[transform fault]] zone [[pull apart basin]] which contains a small [[Divergent boundary|spreading ridge]] on the floor of the western [[Caribbean Sea]] between [[Jamaica]] and the [[Cayman Islands]].<ref>{{cite book| author=Einsele, Gerhard| title=Sedimentary Basins: Evolution, Facies, and Sediment Budget| publisher=Springer |edition=2nd |year=2000|page=630 |isbn=978-3-540-66193-1}}</ref> It is the deepest point in the Caribbean Sea and forms part of the [[tectonics|tectonic]] boundary between the [[North American Plate]] and the [[Caribbean Plate]].  It extends from the [[Windward Passage]], going south of the [[Sierra Maestra]] of [[Cuba]] toward [[Guatemala]]. The transform continues onshore as the [[Motagua Fault]], which cuts across Guatemala and extends offshore under the Pacific Ocean, where it intersects the [[Middle America Trench]] subduction zone.

The relatively narrow trough trends east-northeast to west-southwest and has a maximum depth of {{convert|7686|m}}. Within the trough is a slowly spreading north-south [[Mid-ocean ridge|ridge]] which may be the result of an offset or gap of approximately {{convert|420|km}} along the main fault trace. The Cayman spreading ridge shows a long-term opening rate of {{nowrap|11–12 mm/yr.}}<ref name=DeMets/> The eastern section of the trough has been named the [[Gonâve Microplate]]. The Gonâve plate extends from the spreading ridge east to the island of [[Hispaniola]]. It is bounded on the north by the Oriente and Septentrional fault zones. On the south the Gonâve is bounded by the Walton fault, the [[Jamaica]] restraining bend and the [[Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone]]. The two bounding [[strike slip fault]] zones are left lateral. The motion relative to the [[North American Plate]] is {{nowrap|11 mm/yr}} to the east and the motion relative to the Caribbean Plate is {{nowrap|8 mm/yr}}.<ref name=DeMets>{{cite journal| first1=C.|last1=DeMets|first2=M. |last2=Wiggins-Grandison|title=Deformation of Jamaica and motion of the Gonâve microplate from GPS and seismic data |journal=Geophys.

During the [[Eocene]] the trough was the site of a [[subduction zone]] which formed the [[volcanic arc]] of the [[Cayman Ridge]] and the [[Sierra Maestra]] [[volcanic]] [[terrain]] of Cuba to the north, as the northeastward-moving [[Caribbean Plate]] was subducted beneath the southwest-moving [[North American Plate]], or as some researchers contend, beneath a plate fragment dubbed the East Cuban Microplate.

[[File:Sails 19th century ship.jpg|thumb]]
[[Image:Krusenstern topsails.jpg|thumb|left]]
A '''topsail''' is a [[sail]] set above another sail; on square-rigged vessels further sails may be set above topsails.

== Square rig ==
[[Image:USS Constitution 1997.jpg|right|thumb|[[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']] sailing under (left to right) [[jib]]s, '''topsails''', and [[Spanker (sail)|spanker]].]]
On a [[square rig]]ged vessel, a '''topsail''' is a square sail rigged above the [[Course (sail)|course sail]] and below the [[topgallant sail]] where carried. A [[full rigged ship]] has either single or double ("split" upper and lower) topsails on all masts, the single or lower topsail being the second sail above the deck and the upper topsail where so rigged being the third.

Although described as a "square" sail, this term refers not to a sail's shape but to it and its yard being rigged square to the keel of the vessel rather than in line with it or "fore and aft"; the topsail was and is always trapezoidal, the lengths of the upper yards being progressively smaller the higher they are. The bottom edge (foot) of the topsail, like that of other square sails, is slightly concave, .

Although topsails of a kind were used at least as early as Roman times, they first came into use in Europe some time in the 15th century. Initially small and carried only on main and fore masts, they gradually increased in size and importance until by the middle of the 17th century and were the principal and largest sails of the ship, the first sails to be set and the last to be taken in. It was quite common for a ship to sail with topsails and [[jib]]s alone; the position of the topsails well above the sea ensured that they received a steady breeze even if the seas were rough.

The larger topsails were difficult and dangerous to handle in strong winds. Sometime in the 1680s, [[reef-band]]s were introduced to tie up part of the sail, with topsails eventually getting four of these, and [[reefing]] the sails became a regular occupation of sailors. In the mid 19th century, topsails of merchant vessels were split into separate upper and lower topsails that could be managed separately and far more easily by smaller crews.

== Gaff rig ==
[[Image:La Recouvrance.JPG|right|thumb|''[[La Recouvrance (schooner)|La Recouvrance]]'' with both a yard topsail and two square topsails; the partly obscured sail between the topmasts is a topmast staysail]]
Gaff topsails, like [[gaff rig]]s in general, may still be seen today but were once more common.  The gaff rig has been largely superseded by the [[Bermuda rig]], which has no topsails. On a gaff-rigged sailing boat, topsails may take a few different forms:

A '''jib-headed topsail''' is generally a triangular sail set between the gaff and the top of the [[mast (sailing)|mast]] or [[topmast]]. A gaff-rigged vessel might have a gaff topsail above any or all of its gaff sails.<ref>{{cite book

 | edition = second
 | year    = 2001
 | publisher = Woodenboat Books
 | isbn    = 0-937822-67-1
 | page    = 54
}}</ref>

A '''yard topsail''' is similar, but set on a [[yard (sailing)|yard]]. Early 19th-century topsail yards were set almost horizontally, but gradually increased in angle until they became almost vertical extension of the [[topmast]].<ref>{{cite book
 | last    = Leather
 | first   = John
 | title   = The Gaff Rig Handbook
 | edition = second
 | year    = 2001
 | publisher = Woodenboat Books
 | isbn    = 0-937822-67-1
 | page    = 56
}}</ref>

A '''jack-yard topsail''' (or '''club topsail''') instead has its lower edge (or [[foot (sail)|foot]]) extended out beyond the end of the gaff with a short yard, called a "jack-yard". A jack-yard topsail may also have the aforementioned vertical yard, although this makes for a very large topsail.<ref>{{cite book
 | last    = Leather
 | first   = John

 | edition = second
 | year    = 2001
 | publisher = Woodenboat Books
 | isbn    = 0-937822-67-1
 | page    = 58
}}</ref> 

A '''cornish topsail''' is a triangular sail having its luff extended well above the masthead by being laced to a yard hoisted by a halyard rove through a sheave fitted diagonally in the mast. The heel of the yard fits immediately about the gaff and is kept in place by a [[tackline]] called a ''timminoggy''.<ref>{{cite book
 | last    = Leather
 | first   = John
 | title   = The Gaff Rig Handbook
 | edition = second
 | year    = 2001
 | publisher = Woodenboat Books
 | isbn    = 0-937822-67-1
 | page    = 59
}}</ref> 

A '''square topsail''' is a square-rigged sail, carried above the foresail only, on gaff schooners. (A [[brigantine]] is a two-masted vessel with a forward [[course (sail)|course]].) Schooners carrying square tops are referred to as  "topsail schooners"; gaff topsails are taken for granted on gaff-rigged vessels and pass without comment in a vessel description.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cunliffe |first=Tom |title=Hand, Reef and Steer |year=1992 |publisher=Sheridan House |isbn=1-57409-203-0 |page=21}}</ref>

A '''raffee''' is a square-rigged topsail which is triangular in shape.

==Other uses==

On rigs having multiple [[jib]]s or [[staysail]]s of which at least one is set high, such as many late 19th and 20th Century racing [[cutter (ship)|cutters]], the uppermost of these, set flying or on a topmast [[stays (nautical)|stay]], is often called the '''jib topsail'''.

== Roman navigation ==
Topsails ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''sipharos''; [[Latin]]: ''siparum'') in the form of an [[isosceles triangle]] set above the square [[mainsail]] were used in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] navigation.<ref>[[Lionel Casson|Casson, Lionel]] (1995): "Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World", Johns Hopkins University Press, ISBN 978-0-8018-5130-8, pp.&nbsp;240–241</ref>

'''Cosmic strings''' are hypothetical 1-dimensional [[topological defect]]s which may have formed during a [[symmetry breaking]] [[phase transition]] in the early universe when the [[topology]] of the [[Vacuum state|vacuum]] manifold associated to this symmetry breaking was not [[Simply connected space|simply connected]]. It is expected that at least one string per [[Hubble volume]] is formed. Their existence was first contemplated by the theoretical physicist [[Tom Kibble]] in the 1970s.

The formation of cosmic strings is somewhat analogous to the imperfections that form between crystal grains in solidifying liquids, or the cracks that form when water freezes into ice. The phase transitions leading to the production of cosmic strings are likely to have occurred during the earliest moments of the universe's evolution, just after [[cosmological inflation]], and are a fairly generic prediction in both [[Quantum field theory]] and [[String theory]] models of the [[Early universe]].

==Theories containing cosmic strings==
In string theory the role of cosmic strings can be played by the fundamental strings (or F-strings) themselves that define the theory [[Perturbation theory|perturbatively]], by D-strings which are related to the F-strings by weak-strong or so called [[S-duality]], or higher-dimensional [[D-branes|D-, NS- or M-branes]] that are partially wrapped on compact cycles associated to extra spacetime dimensions so that only one non-compact dimension remains.<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=hep-th/0312067 |bibcode=2004JHEP...06..013C |doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2004/06/013 |title=Cosmic F- and D-strings |year=2004 |last1=Copeland |first1=Edmund J |last2=Myers |first2=Robert C |last3=Polchinski |first3=Joseph |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics |volume=2004 |issue=6 |pages=013}}</ref>

The prototypical example of a quantum field theory with cosmic strings is the [[Abelian Higgs model]]. The quantum field theory and string theory cosmic strings are expected to have many properties in common, but more research is needed to determine the precise distinguishing features. The F-strings for instance are fully quantum-mechanical and do not have a classical definition, whereas the field theory cosmic strings are almost exclusively treated classically.

==Dimensions==
Cosmic strings, if they exist, would be extremely thin with diameters of the same order of magnitude as that of a proton, i.e. ~ 1 fm, or smaller. Given that this scale is much smaller than any cosmological scale these strings are often studied in the zero width, or Nambu-Goto approximation. Under this assumption strings behave as one-dimensional objects and obey the [[Nambu-Goto action]], which is classically equivalent to the [[Polyakov action]] that defines the bosonic sector of [[superstring theory]].

In field theory, the string width is set by the scale of the symmetry breaking phase transition. In string theory, the string width is set (in the simplest cases) by the fundamental string scale, warp factors (associated to the spacetime curvature of an internal six-dimensional spacetime manifold) and/or the size of internal [[compact dimension]]s. (In string theory, the universe is either 10- or 11-dimensional, depending on the strength of interactions and the curvature of spacetime.)

==Gravitation==
A string is a geometrical deviation from [[Euclidean geometry]] in spacetime characterized by an angular deficit: a circle around the outside of a string would comprise a total angle less than 360°.  From the [[general theory of relativity]] such a geometrical defect must be in tension, and would be manifested by mass.  Even though cosmic strings are thought to be extremely thin, they would have immense density, and so would represent significant gravitational wave sources. A cosmic string about a kilometer in length may be more massive than the Earth.

However [[general relativity]] predicts that the gravitational potential of a straight string vanishes: there is no gravitational force on static surrounding matter. The only gravitational effect of a straight cosmic string is a relative deflection of matter (or light) passing the string on opposite sides (a purely topological effect). A closed cosmic string gravitates in a more conventional way.

During the expansion of the universe, cosmic strings would form a network of loops, and in the past it was thought that their gravity could have been responsible for the original clumping of matter into [[galactic supercluster]]s. It is now calculated that their contribution to the structure formation in the universe is less than 10%.

===Negative Mass Cosmic String===

The standard model of cosmic string is a geometrical structure with an angle deficit, which thus is in tension and hence has positive mass.  In 1995, [[Matt Visser|Visser]] ''et al.'' proposed that cosmic string could theoretically also exist with an angle excess, and thus negative tension and hence [[negative mass]]. The stability of such [[exotic matter]] string is problematic; however, they suggested that if a negative mass string were to be wrapped around a [[wormhole]] in the early universe, such a wormhole could be stabilized sufficiently to exist in the present day.<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/9409051 |bibcode=1995PhRvD..51.3117C |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.51.3117 |title=Natural wormholes as gravitational lenses |year=1995 |last1=Cramer |first1=John |last2=Forward |first2=Robert |last3=Morris |first3=Michael |last4=Visser |first4=Matt |last5=Benford |first5=Gregory |last6=Landis |first6=Geoffrey |journal=Physical Review D |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=3117}}</ref><ref>{{cite press |url=http://www.geoffreylandis.com/wormholes.htp |title=Searching for a 'Subway to the Stars'}}</ref>

==Observational evidence==

It was once thought that the gravitational influence of cosmic strings might contribute to the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|large-scale clumping of matter]] in the universe, but all that is known today through galaxy surveys and precision measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) fits an evolution out of random, [[Normal distribution|gaussian]] fluctuations. These precise observations therefore tend to rule out a significant role for cosmic strings and currently it is known that the contribution of cosmic strings to the CMB cannot be more than 10%.

The violent oscillations of cosmic strings generically lead to the formation of [[Cusp (singularity)|cusps]] and [[Sine-Gordon_equation#Soliton_solutions|kinks]]. These in turn cause parts of the string to pinch off into isolated loops. These loops have a finite lifespan and decay (primarily) via [[gravitational radiation]]. This radiation which leads to the strongest signal from cosmic strings may in turn be detectable in gravitational wave experiments, such as LIGO and LISA. An important open question is to what extent do the pinched off loops backreact or change the initial state of the emitting cosmic string—such backreaction effects are almost always neglected in computations and are known to be important, even for order of magnitude estimates.

[[Gravitational lensing]] of a galaxy by a straight section of a cosmic string would produce two identical, undistorted images of the galaxy. In 2003 a group led by [[Mikhail Sazhin]] reported the accidental discovery of two seemingly identical galaxies very close together in the sky, leading to speculation that a cosmic string had been found.<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/0302547 |bibcode=2003MNRAS.343..353S | doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2003.06568.x |title=CSL-1: Chance projection effect or serendipitous discovery of a gravitational lens induced by a cosmic string? |year=2003 |last1=Sazhin |first1=M. |last2=Longo |first2=G. |last3=Capaccioli |first3=M. |last4=Alcala |first4=J.

A second piece of evidence supporting cosmic string theory is a phenomenon observed in observations of the "double [[quasar]]" called [[Twin Quasar|Q0957+561A,B]]. Originally discovered by [[Dennis Walsh]], [[Bob Carswell]], and [[Ray Weymann]] in 1979, the double image of this quasar is caused by a galaxy positioned between it and the Earth. The [[gravitational lens]] effect of this intermediate galaxy bends the quasar's light so that it follows two paths of different lengths to Earth. The result is that we see two images of the same quasar, one arriving a short time after the other (about 417.1 days later). However, a team of astronomers at the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] led by [[Rudolph Schild]] studied the quasar and found that during the period between September 1994 and July 1995 the two images appeared to have no time delay; changes in the brightness of the two images occurred simultaneously on four separate occasions. Schild and his team believe that the only explanation for this observation is that a cosmic string passed between the Earth and the quasar during that time period traveling at very high speed and oscillating with a period of about 100 days.<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/0406434 |bibcode=2004A&A...422..477S|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20040274 |title=Anomalous fluctuations in observations of Q0957+561 A,B: Smoking gun of a cosmic string? |year=2004 |last1=Schild |first1=R. |last2=Masnyak |first2=I.

The earthbound [[LIGO|Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory]] (LIGO) and especially the space-based gravitational wave detector [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna]] (LISA) will search for gravitational waves and are likely to be sensitive enough to detect signals from cosmic strings, provided the relevant cosmic string tensions are not too small.

==String theory and cosmic strings==
During the early days of string theory both string theorists and cosmic string theorists believed that there was no direct connection between [[superstrings]] and cosmic strings (the names were chosen independently by analogy with [[twine|ordinary string]]). The possibility of cosmic strings being produced in the early universe was first envisioned by quantum field theorist [[Tom Kibble]] in 1976, and this sprouted the first flurry of interest in the field. In 1985, during the [[first superstring revolution]], [[Edward Witten]] contemplated on the possibility of fundamental superstrings having been produced in the early universe and stretched to macroscopic scales, in which case (following the nomenclature of Tom Kibble) they would then be referred to as cosmic superstrings. He concluded that had they been produced they would have either disintegrated into smaller strings before ever reaching macroscopic scales (in the case of [[Type I superstring]] theory), they would always appear as boundaries of [[Domain wall (string theory)|domain walls]] whose tension would force the strings to collapse rather than grow to cosmic scales (in the context of [[Heterotic string|Heterotic superstring]] theory), or having a characteristic energy scale close to the [[Planck energy]] they would be produced before [[cosmological inflation]] and hence be diluted away with the expansion of the universe and not be observable.

Much has changed since these early days, primarily due to the [[second superstring revolution]]. It is now known that string theory in addition to the fundamental strings which define the theory perturbatively also contains other one-dimensional objects, such as D-strings, and higher-dimensional objects such as D-branes, NS-branes and M-branes partially wrapped on compact internal spacetime dimensions, while being spatially extended in one non-compact dimension. The possibility of [[Large extra dimension|large compact dimensions]] and large [[Randall–Sundrum model|warp factors]] allows strings with tension much lower than the Planck scale. Furthermore, various dualities that have been discovered point to the conclusion that actually all these apparently different types of string are just the same object as it appears in different regions of parameter space. These new developments have largely revived interest in cosmic strings, starting in the early 2000s.

In 2002, [[Henry Tye]] and collaborators predicted the production of cosmic superstrings during the last stages of [[brane cosmology|brane inflation]],<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=hep-th/0204074 |bibcode=2002PhLB..536..185S |doi=10.1016/S0370-2693(02)01824-5 |title=Cosmic string production towards the end of brane inflation |year=2002 |last1=Sarangi |first1=Saswat |last2=Tye |first2=S.-H.Henry |journal=Physics Letters B |volume=536 |issue=3–4 |pages=185}}</ref> a string theory construction of the early universe that gives leads to an expanding universe and cosmological inflation. It was subsequently realized by string theorist [[Joseph Polchinski]] that the expanding Universe could have stretched a "fundamental" string (the sort which superstring theory considers) until it was of intergalactic size.  Such a stretched string would exhibit many of the properties of the old "cosmic" string variety, making the older calculations useful again.  As theorist [[Tom Kibble]] remarks, "string theory cosmologists have discovered cosmic strings lurking everywhere in the undergrowth".  Older proposals for detecting cosmic strings could now be used to investigate superstring theory.

Superstrings, D-strings or the other stringy objects mentioned above stretched to intergalactic scales would radiate gravitational waves, which could be detected using experiments like LIGO and especially the space-based gravitational wave experiment LISA. They might also cause slight irregularities in the cosmic microwave background, too subtle to have been detected yet but possibly within the realm of future observability.

Note that most of these proposals depend, however, on the appropriate cosmological fundamentals (strings, branes, etc.), and no convincing experimental verification of these has been confirmed to date. Cosmic strings nevertheless provide a window into string theory. If cosmic strings are observed which is a real possibility for a wide range of cosmological string models this would provide the first experimental evidence of a string theory model underlying the structure of spacetime.

'''Mount Pulag''' (or sometimes '''Mount Pulog''') is the 3rd highest [[mountain]] in the [[Philippines]] (but is currently the official 2nd highest.<ref>http://tagaloglang.com/The-Philippines/Geography/25-highest-mountains-in-the-philippines.html</ref> It is [[Luzon]]’s highest peak at 2,922 meters above sea level. The borders between the [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] of [[Benguet]], [[Ifugao]], and [[Nueva Vizcaya]] meet at the mountain's peak.

Because of its high elevation, the [[climate]] on Mount Pulag is [[mountain climate|temperate]] with rains predominating the whole year. [[Rainfall]] on the mountain averages 4,489&nbsp;mm yearly with August being the wettest month with an average rainfall of 1,135&nbsp;mm.
Snow has not fallen on its top in at least the past 100 years however, there have been mild flurries occurred in the mountain especially during December, January and February, recently in January 2011, when the temperature also dip into sub-freezing temperatures making the coldest place recorded in the country.

The mountain hosts 528 documented plant species.  It is the natural habitat of the [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] Dwarf Bamboo, (''Yushania niitakayamensis'') and the [[Khasi Pine|Benguet pine]] (''Pinus insularis'') which dominates the areas of [[Luzon tropical pine forests]] found on the mountainside. Among its native wildlife are 33 bird species and several threatened mammals such as the [[Philippine Deer]], [[Giant Bushy-Tailed Cloud Rat]] (“bowet”) and the Long-Haired Fruit Bat. Mount Pulag is the only place that hosts the 4 [[Cloud Rat]] species. It has one of the most diverse [[biodiversity]] of the [[Philippines]], with the newly found (since 1896) 185&nbsp;grams [[Short-footed Luzon Tree Rat|Dwarf cloud rat]], ''[[Carpomys melanurus]]'', a rare breed (endemic to the Cordillera) and the Koch pitta bird among its endangered denizens.<ref>{{cite news|title=NUJP members climb Mt. Pulag for press freedom|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/90545/news/regions/nujp-members-climb-mt-pulag-for-press-freedom|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=GMA News Online|date=20 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Cariño|first=Delmar|title=Team finds rare cloud rat breed after 112 years|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20080426-132920/Team-finds-rare-cloud-rat-breed-after-112-years|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=Inquirer.net|date=26 April 2008}}</ref> 

On February 24, 1964, a large part of the mountain was designated as a National Park with Proclamation No. 56. This  act aims to preserve the environment around the mountain due to threats from increased development such as conversion to agricultural lands, timber production, hunting, and increased tourism.

The [[Ibaloi]] people of Benguet mummify their dead and house in caverns in the mountain. The Kabayan mummy burial caves, one of the main attraction of the site, is considered as Philippine National cultural treasures under Presidential Decree No. 432.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cariño|first=Delmar|title=Respect mummies, Pulag trekkers told|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090427-201614/Respect-mummies-Pulag-trekkers-told|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=Inquirer.net|date=27 April 2009}}</ref> 

==Hiking activity==
As the highest mountain in Luzon, Mount Pulag attracts a lot of mountain climbers. Highlights of the climb include the montane forests and the grassland summit with its "sea of clouds" phenomenon. There are four major trails up the summit: the Ambangeg, Akiki, and Tawangan trails from [[Benguet]] and the Ambaguio trail from [[Nueva Vizcaya]]. These trails are managed by the Mount Pulag National Park, under the [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources (Philippines)|Department of Environment and Natural Resources]].

The National Park is inhabited by different tribes such as the [[Ibaloi]]s, Kalanguya, [[Igorot|Kankana-ey]]s, Karao, [[Ifugao]]s and the [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]]s.

It is the third highest mountain in the [[Philippines]], next to [[Mount Apo]] and [[Mount Dulang-dulang|Mount Dulang-Dulang]]

==Presidential helicopter crash==
On 7 April 2009 a Philippine Air Force (PAF) [[Bell 412]] of the [[250th Presidential Airlift Wing]] crashed at 6,900 feet above sea level in the Kabayan-Pulag pass between Mount Mangingihi and Mount Pulag in thick low cloud and fog. The aircraft pilots and their passengers, who are presidential appointees, died in the crash.<ref>{{cite news|last=Yagumyum|first=Rudy|title=PAF provides more details on presidential chopper crash|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/04/16/09/paf-provides-more-details-presidential-chopper-crash-probe|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=ABS-CBNNews.com|date=16 April 2009}}</ref>

'''''Trouble in Tahiti''''' is a one-act opera in seven scenes composed by [[Leonard Bernstein]] with an [[English language|English]] [[libretto]] by the composer, dedicated to [[Marc Blitzstein]]. It is the darkest among Bernstein's "musicals", and the only one for which he wrote the words as well as the music. The opera received its first performance on 12 June 1952 at Bernstein's Festival of the Creative Arts on the campus of [[Brandeis University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]] to an audience of nearly 3,000 people. The [[NBC Opera Theatre]] subsequently presented the opera on television in November 1952, a production which marked mezzo-soprano [[Beverly Wolff]]'s professional debut in the role of Dinah.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20A15F63B5E177B93C5A8178AD95F468585F9&scp=3&sq=%22Beverly+Wolff%22&st=p|title=BERNSTEIN OPERA ON VIDEO THEATRE; ' Trouble in Tahiti,' One-Act Work Presented by N. B. C., Deals With Suburbia|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[Ross Parmenter]]|date=November 17, 1952}}</ref> Wolff later reprised the role in the [[New York City Opera]]'s first staging of the work in 1958. The original work is about 40 minutes long.

==Background==
Musically, Bernstein utilizes many of the styles he is most recognized for. The heroine's first aria has a wistful melancholy reminiscent of [[Aaron Copland]]'s earlier [[vernacular]] works and of Bernstein's later writing in ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'', while the jazzy interludes harken back to the score Bernstein wrote for ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]''.

Bernstein tried to make his opera as real as possible. He wanted everything about it to be believable. He even went to great lengths to write in language that would be heard in everyday speech during that time.  “All the music [in Trouble in Tahiti] derives from American vernacular roots, as do the words. And the words are very carefully set so that they will sound in the American cadence and with the American kind of syncopated, almost slurred quality” {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
	
While it was rumored that the troubled young couple was based on Leonard Bernstein himself and his new bride, Felicia Monteleagre{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} -- he was working on the work during his honeymoon<ref>Smith, p. 46</ref> -- there is another theory that the story is based on the relationship of Bernstein’s own mother and father.<ref name=Woolfe>{{cite web|last=Woolfe|first=Zachary|title=A Lot of Trouble for Trouble in Tahiti, and It Was Worth It: The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra Works Wonders With Bernstein’s Opera|url=http://observer.com/2012/03/20/a-lot-of-trouble-for-trouble-in-tahiti-and-it-was-worth-it-the-orpheus-chamber-orchestra-works-wonders-with-bernsteins-opera/?show=all|work=The New York Observer|publisher=observer.com|accessdate=17 May 2012|date=20 Mar 2012}}</ref>

==Plot analysis==
The work contains a strong attack on American suburbia. Although "Trouble in Tahiti" is a movie that the characters Sam and Dinah see -- Dinah sees it twice -- the title is also applicable to the life depicted in the opera. It should be Tahiti-like, that sun-kissed suburban life, with the neighborly butchers and parks for the kids. In fact it isn't. There's trouble. Trouble in Tahiti. Indeed.

The opera is frequently performed with minimal scenery and very simple costumes. There are only two singers, a married couple named Sam and Dinah. Their son, Junior, is often referred to but is never seen or heard. Other characters--Sam's secretary Miss Brown, Dinah's [[psychoanalyst]]--are addressed in certain scenes but also are never seen or heard. Sam talks to two men by telephone. 

''Trouble in Tahiti'' is the story of one day in the life of these desperately unhappy, though married people, lonely, longing for love, and unable to communicate. At the end of the opera, Sam and Dinah show a willingness to sacrifice for each other, out of commitment to the marriage, though there's not much pleasure to be had. A copyright is held for an alternate ending by Bernstein, which has not been released.<ref>Helen Smith, ''There's a Place For Us: The Musical Theatre Works of Leonard Bernstein, Ashgate, 2011, ISBN 1409411699, p. xvi.</ref>

The opera also uses a [[scat singing]] [[jazz trio]], whose role is important. Bernstein refers to them as "A Greek chorus born of the radio commercial".{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} It's no accident they sing like a radio commercial: that was the happiest type of music that existed. The trio opens the work singing the glories of Su-bur-bi-a, using the same pattern - c, f, g, c' - as in the line "New York, New York" from the earlier ''On the Town''.  The sun wakens the couple, kindles their love, kisses the windows, kisses the walls, kisses the doorknob and the "pretty red roof," kisses the flagstones on the front lawn, the paper at the front door, the roses around the front door of "the little white house" in Scarsdale (New York), Wellesley Hills (Massachusetts),  Ozone Park (New York), Highland Park (Michigan), Shaker Heights (Ohio), Michigan Park (a white enclave in black Washington, D.C.), and Beverly Hills (California) - all upper-middle-class, white suburbs where people lived who had "made it," who had gotten "out of the hubbub". "Have a good day in the city today. Joy to your labors, until you return." The viewer is about to witness a day in the life of an idyllic couple living there. "Skiddly-day, skiddly-day. Ready, boom."

In the middle of the opening, one member of the trio sings a stanza of nonsense, then sings it again - the same nonsense - accompanied by a solo jazz clarinet.

The trio appears several times later. In an Interlude, they speak well of how possessions contribute to the "wonderful life": up-to-date kitchen, washing machine, colorful bathrooms, Life magazine, Sheridan sofa, Chippendale chair, bone chinaware, real solid silver, two-door sedan and convertible coupe - "Who could ask heaven for anything more?" Their "sweet little son" seems another one of the possessions: "family picture, second to none".

==The critique of contemporary American society==

The dedication to the leftist Marc Blitzstein was no accident. Blitzstein and Bernstein were good friends, fellow students at the [[Curtis Institute]] in Philadelphia, from the same type of Jewish family. Bernstein had produced one production of Blitzstein's most famous work, [[The Cradle Will Rock]].<ref>Helen Smith, '''There's a Place for Us': The Musical Theatre Works of Leonard Bernstein'', pp. 44-45.</ref>

Bernstein, like Blitzstein before him, is skewering American capitalist society. Life as U.S. capitalism prescribes it - in suburbia, in one's own house, full of one's possessions - produces misery and isolation. Home and work are separated. Competition, not love, rules the day. Community - the neighbors - you see on Sunday only (and presumably only the men are interacting, as the Sunday activity is playing golf). The man runs for his train, going to the city to work; the woman stays home. Who you know is important (Bill, who gets the loan, also belongs to Sam's handball club); money gives power gives happiness (Sam's thrill at turning down Mr. Partridge). Culture you get on TV or from the [[Book-of-the-Month]] club. Sex is something a man does with his secretary, or wants to, not something a husband and wife engage in (though they must have done it once). Escapist, false entertainment ("Island Magic") helps make life endurable.

The result is pitiful. Sam and Dinah want to love each other, to learn how to love again, to tear down the walls between them, to care for their child, but they don't know how. They don't even know where to start. They can't talk, can't express their feelings. The only note of cautious optimism comes from Dinah's psychoanalysis (dream).

==Synopsis==


Prelude – A smiling jazz Trio sings of perfect life in an affluent, unnamed suburban town, with its little white houses and happy, loving families ("Mornin' Sun"). The town could be anywhere; many names are mentioned.

Scene I – Real life in suburbia contrasts greatly with what the Trio has painted. Sam and Dinah are having breakfast, alternating between habitual bickering and lyrical moments of longing for kindness. Dinah is angry with Sam. She accuses him of having an affair with his secretary, which he denies ("the subject is closed"). She also reminds Sam that their son Junior's play is that afternoon, but Sam insists that his handball tournament at the gym is more important, to which she retorts, "to hell with the gym". She needs more money to pay for her "doctor", who Sam calls an "out-and-out fake". Dinah says Sam should go too, which suggestion Sam pays no attention to. They agree that this is not the way to live, and they will have a conversation about their relationship problems in the evening. They both ask each other for kindness, ask the other for help "to love you again," and pray that the wall built up between them can be broken down. They continue to argue until Sam leaves for the office, late for his train.

Scene II – Sam, at work, exuding confidence, is dealing with business on the telephone. He turns down the curiously-named Mr. Partridge, presumably for a loan. The chorus calls him a genius, "you marvelous man". "When it comes to the dollar, no one touches marvelous Sam." 

But then comes a call from "Bill", who he is glad to lend money to: "you'll return it whenever you want to... Is it sufficient?" Coincidently, Bill is also participating in the handball tournament with Sam. The chorus observes that "when it comes to the giving, no one touches big-hearted Sam".

Scene III – In her analyst's office, Dinah recalls a dream ("I was standing in a garden").

<blockquote>
I was standing in a garden, a garden gone to seed, choked with every kind of weed. There were twisted trees around me, all black against the sky, black, and bare, and dead, and dry. My father called, come out of this place, I wanted to go, but there was no way, no sign, no path to show me the way. Then another voice was calling, it barely could be heard. I remember every word: "There is a garden, come with me, come with me. A shining garden, come and see, come and see. There love will teach us harmony and grace, harmony and grace. Then love will lead us to a quiet place."
</blockquote>
	
Meanwhile, at Sam's office, he asks his secretary if he ever made a pass at her. When reminded of an incident, he insists, in a menacing way, that it was an accident and that she should forget that it ever happened. 

Scene IV – Sam and Dinah accidentally run into each other on the street. Rather than having lunch with each other, they both make up lies about imaginary commitments to lunch with others. They continue to sing on the stage (though not to each other), reflecting on the confusing and painful course their relationship has taken, and yearn for their lost happiness. 

Interlude – Inside the house, the Trio sings of lovely life in Suburbia, detailing the possessions that contribute to the American dream. 

Scene V – At the gym, Sam has just won the handball tournament. He sings triumphantly about the nature of men ("There's a law") — how some try with all their might to rise to the top, but will never win; while others, like him, are born winners and will always succeed. "Men are created unequal."

Scene VI – In a hat shop, Dinah tells an unidentified person about a South Sea romance movie called "Trouble in Tahiti", which she has just spent the afternoon watching. (Later, we learn that she has missed Junior's play.) At first she dismisses the movie as Technicolor drivel. But as she recounts the story (What a movie!") and its theme song "Island Magic," backed by the Trio, she gets caught up in the escapist fantasy of love. Suddenly self-conscious, she stops herself, as she has to prepare dinner for Sam.

Scene VII – About to enter his home, Sam sings of another law of men — that even the winner must pay "through the nose" for what he gets.

The Trio sings of imaginary evenings of domestic bliss in Suburbia: "bringing the loved ones together, safe by the warmth of the firelight". After dinner, Dinah is knitting and Sam is reading the paper. Sam decides the time has come for their talk, and Dinah, after asking what he wants to talk about, agrees: "anything you say". Yet Sam can't talk; he doesn't know where to begin. He blames Dinah for interruptions, but she has not said anything. "It's no use", he says. In the only ''[[recitative]]'' in the opera, Sam asks Dinah about Junior's play; she didn't go either. He suggests they go to the movies, to see a new film about Tahiti; Dinah consents. ("Sure, why not? Anything.") As they leave, they each long for quiet and communion, wondering if it's possible to rediscover their love for one another. For now, they opt for the "bought-and-paid-for magic" of the silver screen. The Trio makes its final ironic comment, reprising the movie's "Island Magic" theme song.

==Feminism==
Sam comes out looking pretty sick, compared to Dinah. He cuts off discussion ("the subject is closed"). His handball tournament is more important than his son's school play, in which he's wearing his dad's tie. (Curiously, Dinah cuts it too.) He made a pass at his secretary, but belittles Dinah's suspicions, then tells his secretary threateningly to "forget that the incident ever happened." Dinah sees a psychoanalyst, but Sam refuses. He says he can't talk because of Dinah's interruptions, when in fact she's not said a word. Sam is tormented by his need, as a male, to compete, to win. He believes that men "are not created equal".

Dinah at least knows something of what she wants. A woman needs so little, she says: a little feeling of warmth, a little feeling of hope.

==Orchestral suite==
With the permission of the Leonard Bernstein Office Inc. (the [[copyright|musical estate]] of the composer), [[Paul Chihara]] adapted the operatic music into an [[orchestral suite]]. In March 2012, the [[Orpheus Chamber Orchestra]] performed the New York premier of the adaptation at [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref name="Woolfe"/>

==Continuation==
Bernstein's wrote a continuation, ''[[A Quiet Place]]'' (1983, libretto by Stephen Wadsworth), which was poorly received. It was rewritten incorporating ''Trouble in Tahiti'' in the form of an extended flashback.<ref>"''A Quiet Place'': An Opera in Three Acts by Leonard Bernstein", http://www.leonardbernstein.com/works_a_quiet_place.htm, retrieved 2014-09-09</ref> Another continuation, not by Bernstein, focuses on Junior, the "kid" whose parents don't care enough about him to come to the school show in which he is the lead.

As the possession of various Canadian territories changed ownership and then the country gained gradual independence, the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] and [[Title#Titles for heads of state|title]] of the monarchs changed almost as often at the kings and queens themselves. The mode of address currently employed is a combination of a style that originates in the early 17th century and a title established by Canadian law in 1953.

==Title of the monarch==
{{further|List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II}}
The monarch's title is set out by the [[Royal Style and Titles Act]], passed by the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]] in 1953, a year following the accession of [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh]], to the throne as Queen Elizabeth II, and granted [[Royal Assent]] the day before [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|her coronation]].<ref>{{Citation| last=Bousfield| first=Arthur| coauthors=Toffoli, Gary| title=Fifty Years the Queen| publisher=Dundurn Press| year=2002| location=Toronto| page=75| url=http://books.google.com/?id=w8l5reK7NjoC&printsec=frontcover&q=| isbn=1-55002-360-8| ref=CITEREF_Bousfield_2002}}</ref> It was later amended in 1985<ref>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| publication-date=12 December 1985| title=Royal Style and Titles Act| publication-place=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-r-12/latest/rsc-1985-c-r-12.html| accessdate=23 September 2009| ref=CITEREF_Elizabeth_II_1985}}</ref> and sets out the sovereign's title as, in [[Canadian English|English]]:

And in [[Canadian French|French]]:

The title was composed to distinctly mention [[Canada]] so as to highlight the monarch's shared status, being both Queen of Canada and, separately, [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]], as well as of then six (today 14) other [[Commonwealth realm]]s; with emphasis showing the distinct title ''Queen of Canada'' as embedded in the longer formal title:<ref name=Ryerson>{{Citation| last=St. Laurent| first=Louis| author-link=Louis St. Laurent| year=1952| publication-date=1 January 1953| contribution=Speech to the House of Commons| title=Canada at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II| place=Ottawa| publication-place=Toronto| publisher=Ryerson Press}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| last=Smy| first=William A.| title=Royal titles and styles| journal=The Loyalist Gazette| volume=XLVI| issue=1| publisher=United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada| location=Toronto| year=2008| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1372/is_1_46/ai_n29437278/| accessdate=3 January 2011}}</ref> ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God '''of''' the United Kingdom, '''Canada''' and Her other Realms and Territories '''Queen''', Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith''. When composed in 1953, this format was consistent with the monarch's titles in all her other realms; after 40 years of Elizabeth's reign, however, only Canada and [[Grenada]] retained this title, all others, aside from the UK, having dropped the reference to the United Kingdom.

The monarch is typically addressed by the title ''Queen of Canada''<ref>{{cite web| url=http://canadiancrown.gc.ca/DAMAssetPub/DAM-CRN-monarchie-monarchy/STAGING/texte-text/kingsandQueens_1363036597604_eng.pdf?WT.contentAuthority=4.4.4| title=The Kings and Queens of Canada| publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada| date=2013| accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{citation| url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2013/02/03/the-queen-of-canada-is-dead-long-live-the-british-queen/| title=The Queen of Canada is dead, long live the British queen| date=2 March 2013| journal=Macleans| publisher=Rogers Communications| accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://canadiancrown.gc.ca/eng/1331826436671| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=The Queen of Canada| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=A Crown of Maples| publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada| year=2012| location=Ottawa| page=2| isbn=978-1-100-20079-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=How Canadians Govern Themselves| publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada| author=Forsey, Eugene A.| year=2012| location=Ottawa| page=1| isbn=978-1-100-20078-1}}</ref> and will allude to herself as Queen of Canada when in or acting abroad on behalf of that country.

Although the Queen's Canadian title includes the phrase ''Defender of the Faith/Défenseur de la Foi'', neither the monarch nor any of the viceroys have an official religious role in Canada. Unlike in the United Kingdom, where the term (''[[Fidei defensor]]'', in [[Latin]]) signifies the sovereign's position as [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]] and a member and defender of the security of the [[Church of Scotland]], there have been no [[established church]]es in Canada since before [[Canadian Confederation|its confederation]] in 1867. ''Defender of the Faith'' thus has a more vague meaning in the Canadian title, alluding only to the monarch's belief in a higher power. Prime Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]] stated on this matter in his 1953 contribution to the debate on the Royal Style and Titles Act in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]]: "The rather more delicate question arose about the retention of the words defender of the faith... In our countries [Canada and the other non-British monarchies of the Commonwealth] there are no established churches, but in our countries there are people who have faith in the direction of human affairs by an all-wise Providence; and we felt that it was a good thing that the civil authorities would proclaim that their organization is such that it is a defence of the continued beliefs in a supreme power that orders the affairs of mere men, and that there could be no reasonable objection from anyone who believed in the Supreme Being in having the sovereign, the head of the civil authority, described as a believer in and a defender of the faith in a supreme ruler."<ref name=Hans>{{Citation| last=St. Laurent| first=Louis| author-link=Louis St. Laurent| date=3 February 1953| contribution=Hansard| contribution-url=http://www.crht.ca/LibraryShelf/QueenofCanada.html| editor-last=Toffoli| editor-first=Gary| editor2-last=Bousfield| editor2-first=Arthur| title=Queen of Canada| place=Ottawa| publication-place=Toronto| publisher=Canadian Royal Heritage Trust| accessdate=7 October 2009}}</ref>

Also, while the sovereign holds the nominal title ''[[Head of the Commonwealth]]'', this does not imply any political power over member states of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In keeping, however, with the declaration of the prime ministers of the Commonwealth in London in 1949 of "the King as the symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth," the title will pass to the next monarch upon the [[demise of the Crown]].

==Style of the monarch==
The use of the styles ''Highness'' and ''Majesty'' originated in the United Kingdom, where they were used from the 12th century onward. During the reign of [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland and I of England and Ireland]], however, ''Majesty'' became the official style, to the exclusion of all others, and was then brought to [[North America]] during colonial times through usage in reference to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]], who then had sovereignty over the [[British North America|colonies on that continent]]. Its usage has continued since Canada became a [[Monarchy|kingdom]] in its own right in 1867,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~HeritageSaintJohn/CorporateSeal/heraldry.htm| title=Heritage Saint John > Canadian Heraldry| publisher=Heritage Resources of Saint John and New Brunswick Community College| accessdate=3 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/Canada/Historyandpresentgovernment.aspx| last=The Royal Household| title=The Queen and the Commonwealth > Queen and Canada > History and present government| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=3 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| author=Department of Canadian Heritage| authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage | title=The Crown in Canada| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| year=2005| page=7| url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/CH4-127-2003E.pdf| accessdate=3 July 2009}}</ref> and after a process of constitutional evolution ending with full sovereignty from the United Kingdom, is now applied to the Canadian monarch. Unlike in the United Kingdom, where the sovereign is referred to in [[treaties]] and on British [[passport]]s as ''Her [His] Britannic Majesty'', the sovereign in Canada is referred to simply as ''Her [His] Majesty'' (''Sa Majesté''). However, from time to time, the style will be ''Her [His] Canadian Majesty'' so as to differentiate from foreign sovereigns.

==History==
Following [[Canadian Confederation]], Prime Minister of Canada [[John A. Macdonald]], having been denied the name ''Kingdom of Canada'' for the new country, was repeatedly heard to refer to [[Queen Victoria]] as the ''Queen of Canada'',<ref name=Bousfield76>{{Harvnb| Bousfield| 2002| p=76}}</ref> and, similarly, in the lead up to the [[coronation]] of King [[Edward VII]] in 1902, Prime Minister [[Wilfrid Laurier]] desired to have the words ''King of Canada'' included in the royal title by the time of the ceremony.<ref name=Bousfield76 /><ref>{{Citation| last=Pearson| first=Lester| author-link=Lester B.

[[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[Eugène Marquis]] in 1945 tabled a motion in the House of Commons proposing that a change to the King's title be a subject of discussion at the next [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]]; Marquis suggested that the title include each of the King's dominions, giving him the designation ''King of Canada''.<ref>{{Citation| title=King of Canada title urged by Quebec M.P.| newspaper=Toronto Daily Star| page=12| date=6 November 1945| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DpY6AAAAIBAJ&sjid=RCoMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4166,4496218&dq=george-vi+king-of-canada&hl=en| accessdate=14 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Citation| title=King of Canada| newspaper=Ottawa Citizen| page=21| date=9 November 1945| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yK0uAAAAIBAJ&sjid=B9wFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6362,1637716&hl=en| accessdate=14 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Citation| title=King of Canada| newspaper=Ottawa Citizen| page=15| date=7 November 1945| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xq0uAAAAIBAJ&sjid=B9wFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5762,1159761&hl=en| accessdate=14 October 2010}}</ref> But, the motion did not pass and it was only in 1948 that form of address changed, when the Canadian parliament passed in 1947 its own Royal Style and Titles Act and an [[Order in Council]] was issued on 22 June the following year to remove the term ''[[Emperor of India]]'' from the sovereign's Canadian title.<ref>{{Citation| last=King| first=William Lyon Mackenzie| author-link=William Lyon Mackenzie King| contribution=Order in Council| contribution-url=http://www.international.gc.ca/department/history-histoire/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefid=9690| editor-last=Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade| editor-link=Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade| title=Documents on Canadian External Relations| volume=14-1| place=Ottawa| publication-place=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=8 October 2009}}</ref> In 1949, it was suggested by Cabinet that the King's title be altered so that in Canada it would be ''George the Sixth, by the Grace of God, of Canada and the other nations of the British Commonwealth, King'';<ref name=PCO3498>{{Citation| last=Privy Council Office| author-link=Privy Council Office (Canada)| date=24 November 1952| contribution=Memorandum for Prime Minister| contribution-url=http://www.international.gc.ca/department/history-histoire/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefid=3498| editor-last=Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade| editor-link=Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade| title=Documents on Canadian External Relations| volume=18-2| place=Ottawa| publication-place=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=23 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Citation| last=Privy Council Office| author-link=Privy Council Office (Canada)| date=19 January 1949| contribution=Extract from Cabinet Conclusions| contribution-url=http://www.international.gc.ca/department/history-histoire/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefid=8613| editor-last=Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade| editor-link=Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade| title=Documents on Canadian External Relations| volume=15-2| place=Ottawa| publication-place=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=8 October 2009}}</ref> but, again, nothing came of the proposal.

The King's secretaries objected strongly, claiming the monarch had only one title in law and Turgeon's letters eventually used George's full legal title, which referred to him as sovereign of Great Britain "and Ireland."<ref>{{Cite book| last=Lloyd| first=Lorna| title=Diplomacy With a Difference: The Commonwealth Office of High Commissioner, 1880-2006| publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year=2007| location=Lieden| page=146| url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=4z5Qj-7HZ68C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false| isbn=978-90-04-15497-1}}</ref>

The [[Proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II|proclamations of Elizabeth II's accession to the throne]] in February 1952 differed between Canada and the United Kingdom; in the latter, the new queen was referred to unconventionally as ''Queen Elizabeth II by the Grace of God, Queen of this Realm, and of Her other Realms and Territories'', while the Canadian Privy Council adhered to the letter of the law, calling the sovereign ''Elizabeth the Second by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas''.<ref>{{Citation| last=Rinfret| first=Thibaudeau| author-link=Thibaudeau Rinfret| date=6 February 1952| contribution=Notice and Proclamations| contribution-url=http://www.international.gc.ca/department/history-histoire/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefId=3497| editor-last=Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade| editor-link=Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade| title=Documents on Canadian External Relations| volume=14-1| place=Ottawa| publication-place=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=8 October 2009}}</ref> The discrepancies between independent countries sharing one person as sovereign prompted discussions amongst the Commonwealth prime ministers before a meeting in [[London]], [[England]], in December 1952; Canada's then prime minister, Louis St. Laurent, stated that it was important a new composition for the royal title be agreed upon by all realms involved, to "emphasise the fact that the Queen is Queen of Canada, regardless of her sovereignty over other Commonwealth countries." Canada's preferred format was: ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, Queen of Canada and of Her other realms and territories, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith''; the Canadian government preferred to keep the word "queen" next to "Canada", as it made the sovereign's role as monarch of Canada more clear than having "queen" follow several words on after the country's name.<ref>{{citation| url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=YrOFei5WRRkC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false| last=Twomey| first=Anne| authorlink=Anne Twomey| title=The Chameleon Crown| page=105| year=2006| publisher=Federation Press| location=Sydney| isbn=9781862876293}}</ref> However, as [[Australia]]n ministers wished to have the United Kingdom mentioned in all the Queen's titles,<ref name=PCO3498 /> the resolution reached was a designation that included the United Kingdom as well as, for the first time, reference to Canada and the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s separately.

When the act to alter the Queen's title was in 1953 debated in the House of Commons, St. Laurent asserted on the nature of the separate and shared characteristics of [[the Crown]]: "Her Majesty is now Queen of Canada but she is the Queen of Canada because she is Queen of the United Kingdom...

'''William Grey Walter''' (February 19, 1910 – May 6, 1977) was an American-born [[United Kingdom|British]] [[neurophysiologist]] and [[robotician]].

==Overview==

Walter was born in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]], in 1910. His ancestry was German/British on his father's side, and American/British on his mother's side. He was brought to England in 1915, and educated at [[Westminster School]] and afterwards in [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], [[Cambridge]], in 1931. He failed to obtain a research fellowship in Cambridge and so turned to doing basic and applied neurophysiological research in hospitals, in London, from 1935 to 1939 and then at the [[Burden Neurological Institute]] in [[Bristol]], from 1939 to 1970. He also carried out research  work in the [[United States]], in the [[Soviet Union]] and in various other places in [[Europe]].  He married twice, and had two sons from his first marriage and one from the second. According to his eldest son, [[Nicolas Walter]], "he was politically on the left, a [[communist]] fellow-traveller before the [[Second World War]] and an [[anarchist]] sympathiser after it."  Throughout his life he was a pioneer in the field of [[cybernetics]]. In 1970 he suffered brain injury in a motor scooter accident. He died seven years later on May 6, 1977 without fully recovering.

==Brain waves==
As a young man Walter was greatly influenced by the work of the famous Russian physiologist [[Ivan Pavlov]].  He visited the lab of [[Hans Berger]], who invented the [[electroencephalograph]], or [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] machine, for measuring electrical activity in the brain.  Walter produced his own versions of Berger's machine with improved capabilities, which allowed it to detect a variety of [[Neural oscillation|brain wave]] types ranging from the high speed [[alpha waves]] to the slow [[delta wave]]s observed during [[sleep]].

In the 1930s Walter made a number of discoveries using his [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] machines at [[Burden Neurological Institute]] in [[Bristol]].  He was the first to determine by [[triangulation]] the surface location of the strongest [[alpha waves]] within the [[occipital lobe]] (alpha waves originate from the [[human thalamus|thalamus]] deep within the [[brain]]).  Walter demonstrated the use of [[delta wave]]s to locate [[brain tumour]]s or lesions responsible for [[epilepsy]].  He developed the first brain topography machine based on [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], using on an array of spiral-scan [[cathode ray tube|CRT]]s connected to high-gain [[amplifier]]s.

During the [[Second World War]] he worked on scanning [[radar]] technology and [[guided missile]]s, which may have influenced his subsequent ''[[alpha waves|alpha wave]] scanning hypothesis'' of brain activity.

In the 1960s Walter also went on to discover the ''[[contingent negative variation]]'' (CNV) effect (or ''[[readiness potential]]'') whereby a negative spike of electrical activity appears in the [[brain]] half a second prior to a person being consciously aware of movements that he is about to make.  Intriguingly, this effect brings into question the very notion of [[consciousness]] or [[free will]], and should be considered as part of a person's overall [[reaction time]] to events.

Walter's experiments with stroboscopic light, described in The Living Brain, inspired the development of a [[Dreamachine|Dream Machine]] by the artist [[Brion Gysin]] and technician [[Ian Sommerville (technician)|Ian Sommerville]].

Grey Walter's most famous work was his construction of some of the first electronic [[autonomous robot]]s. He wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of [[neurons|brain cells]] could give rise to very complex [[behavior]]s - essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first [[robot]]s, which he used to call ''Machina speculatrix'' and named ''Elmer'' and ''Elsie'', were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as ''tortoises'' due to their shape and slow rate of movement - and because they "taught us" about the secrets of organisation and life.  The three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable of [[phototaxis]], by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power.

In one experiment he placed a light on the "nose" of a tortoise and watched as the robot observed itself in a mirror.  "It began flickering," he wrote. "Twittering, and jigging like a clumsy Narcissus."  Walter argued that if it were seen in an animal it "might be accepted as evidence of some degree of self-awareness."

One of the tortoises was modified, (given the pretend scientific name ''Machina docilis'') and had added to its simple single celled "brain" one, then two conditional reflex circuits in which they could be taught simple behaviors similar to [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s dogs. This tortoise was called ''CORA''. One of these included being hit meant food whilst whistling means food, and when conditioned such a whistle by itself means being hit. When he added another circuit tuned to a whistle of another pitch, this could become whistle means being hit, whistle means food, this would make the animal become "afraid" whenever ''food'' was presented. Walter remedied this behaviour by severing the two additional circuits, and the tortoise reverted to being a ''Machina speculatrix''. The conditioned reflex behaviour was later placed into a static desktop model, also known as ''CORA''.

Later versions of ''Machina speculatrix'' were exhibited at the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951.  
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:greywalterturtle.jpg|thumb|left|Dr. Owen Holland demonstrates Walter's "turtle" at [[MIT]]]] -->
Walter stressed the importance of using purely [[wiktionary:analogue|analogue]] electronics to [[simulate]] brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as [[Alan Turing]] and [[John von Neumann]] were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of [[Digital data|digital]] [[computation]].  His work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers, including [[Rodney Brooks]], [[Hans Moravec]] and [[Mark Tilden]].  Modern incarnations of Walter's ''turtles'' may be found in the form of [[BEAM robotics]].

An original tortoise is on display in London UK in the Science Museum's Making the Modern World gallery. Recently, one was also replicated by Dr. [[Owen Holland]], of the [[University of the West of England]] in 1995 - using some of the original parts. An original tortoise as seen at the Festival of Britain is in the collection of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

Walter's papers including his letters, photographs and press cuttings form part of the Burden archive held at the Science Museum Library & Archives in Wroughton [[Science Museum at Wroughton]].

The '''Natural History Museum''' in London is a [[museum]] exhibiting a vast range of specimens from various segments of [[natural history]]. It is one of three large museums on [[Exhibition Road]] in [[South Kensington]], the others being the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. The Natural History Museum's main frontage, however, is on [[Cromwell Road]].

The museum is home to life and earth science specimens comprising some 80 million items within five main collections: [[botany]], [[entomology]], [[mineralogy]], [[palaeontology]] and [[zoology]]. The museum is a world-renowned centre of research specialising in [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], identification and conservation. Given the age of the institution, many of the collections have great historical as well as scientific value, such as specimens collected by [[Charles Darwin]]. The museum is particularly famous for its exhibition of [[dinosaur]] skeletons and ornate architecture—sometimes dubbed a ''cathedral of nature''—both exemplified by the large ''[[Diplodocus]]'' cast which dominates the vaulted central hall. The Natural History Museum Library contains extensive books, journals, manuscripts, and artwork collections linked to the work and research of the scientific departments; access to the library is by appointment only.

Although commonly referred to as the Natural History Museum, it was actually officially known as '''British Museum (Natural History)''' until 1992, despite legal separation from the [[British Museum]] itself in 1963. Originating from collections within the British Museum, the landmark [[Alfred Waterhouse]] building was built and opened by 1881, and later incorporated the [[Geological Museum]]. The Darwin Centre is a more recent addition, partly designed as a modern facility for storing the valuable collections.

Like other publicly funded national museums in the United Kingdom, the Natural History Museum does not charge an admission fee. The museum is an [[exempt charity]] and a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/corporate-information/museum-governance/index.html |title=Museum governance |publisher=The Natural History Museum |accessdate=14 March 2010}}</ref> [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]] is a patron of the museum.<ref>[http://www.today.com/news/duchess-kate-become-patron-three-new-charities-6C9539365 Today: Duchess Kate becomes patron of three new charities]</ref>

The foundation of the collection was that of the Ulster doctor Sir [[Hans Sloane]] (1660–1753), who allowed his significant collections to be purchased by the British Government at a price well below their market value at the time. This purchase was funded by a lottery. Sloane's collection, which included dried plants, and animal and human skeletons, was initially housed in [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury]], in 1756, which was the home of the [[British Museum]].

Most of the Sloane collection had disappeared by the early decades of the nineteenth century. Sir [[George Shaw]] (Keeper of Zoology 1806–13) sold many specimens to the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]]. His successor, [[William Elford Leach]], made periodical ''bonfires'' in the grounds of the museum<!-- This is unclear; were the bonfires composed of periodicals (eg. magazines, newspapers), or were they 'periodic', as in occurring regularly? -->.<ref>Edwards E. 1870. ''Lives of the founders of the British Museum''. London.</ref> In 1833 the Annual Report states that, of the 5,500 insects listed in the Sloane catalogue, none remained. The inability of the natural history departments to conserve its specimens became notorious: the Treasury refused to entrust it with specimens collected at the government's expense. Appointments of staff were bedevilled by gentlemanly favoritism; in 1862 a nephew of the mistress of a Trustee was appointed Entomological Assistant despite not knowing the difference between a butterfly and a moth.<ref>Gunther, Albert 1975. ''A century of zoology at the British Museum''. London.</ref><ref>Gunther, Albert 1981. ''The founders of science at the British Museum, 1753–1900''. Halesworth, London.</ref>

[[J. E. Gray]] (Keeper of Zoology 1840–74) complained of the incidence of mental illness amongst staff: George Shaw threatened to put his foot on any shell not in the [[12th edition of Systema Naturae|12th edition]] of [[Linnaeus]]' ''[[Systema Naturae]]''; another had removed [[museum label|all the labels]] and registration numbers from [[entomological]] cases arranged by a rival. The huge collection of the [[conchologist]] [[Hugh Cuming]] was acquired by the museum, and Gray's own wife had carried the open trays across the courtyard in a gale: all the labels blew away. That collection is said never to have recovered.<ref>Barber, L. 1980. ''The heyday of natural history 1820–1870''. Cape, London: Chapter 'Omnium gatherum'</ref>

The Principal Librarian at the time was [[Antonio Panizzi]]; his contempt for the natural history departments and for science in general was total. The general public was not encouraged to visit the Museum's natural history exhibits. In 1835 to a Select Committee of Parliament, Sir [[Henry Ellis (librarian)|Henry Ellis]] said this policy was fully approved by the Principal Librarian and his senior colleagues.

Many of these faults were corrected by [[Richard Owen]], appointed Superintendent of the natural history departments of the British Museum in 1856. His changes led [[Bill Bryson]] to write that "by making the Natural History Museum an institution for everyone, Owen transformed our expectations of what museums are for".<ref>Bryson (2003), p. 81.</ref>

Owen saw that the natural history departments needed more space, and that implied a separate building as the British Museum site was limited. Land in South Kensington was purchased, and in 1864 a competition was held to design the new museum. The winning entry was submitted by the civil engineer Captain [[Francis Fowke]], who died shortly afterwards. The scheme was taken over by [[Alfred Waterhouse]] who substantially revised the agreed plans, and designed the façades in his own idiosyncratic [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style which was inspired by his frequent visits to the Continent.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Albertopolis/TheStoryOf/NaturalHistoryMuseum/Interior.aspx| title=Interior of the NHM| publisher=[[Royal Institute of British Architects]]|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref> The original plans included wings on either side of the main building, but these plans were soon abandoned for budgetary reasons. The space these would have occupied are now taken by the Earth Galleries and Darwin Centre.

Work began in 1873 and was completed in 1880. The new museum opened in 1881, although the move from the old museum was not fully completed until 1883.

Both the interiors and exteriors of the Waterhouse building make extensive use of [[terracotta]] tiles to resist the sooty climate of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London, manufactured by the Tamworth-based company of [[Gibbs and Canning Limited]]. The tiles and bricks feature many relief sculptures of flora and fauna, with living and extinct species featured within the west and east wings respectively. This explicit separation was at the request of Owen, and has been seen as a statement of his contemporary rebuttal of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] attempt to link present species with past through the theory of [[natural selection]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110608182831/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/history-architecture/architecture-tour/design/decoration/index.html Decoration – Natural History Museum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The central axis of the museum is aligned with the tower of [[Imperial College London]] (formerly the Imperial Institute) and the [[Royal Albert Hall]] and [[Albert Memorial]] further north. These all form part of the complex known colloquially as [[Albertopolis]].'''

===Separation from the British Museum===
Even after the opening, the NHM legally remained a department of the British Museum with the formal name '''British Museum (Natural History)''', usually abbreviated in the [[scientific literature]] as ''B.M.(N.H.)''. A petition to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] was made in 1866, signed by the heads of the [[Royal Society|Royal]], [[Linnean Society|Linnean]] and [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological]] Societies as well as naturalists including [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]], asking that the museum gain independence from the board of the British Museum, and heated discussions on the matter continued for nearly one hundred years. Finally, with the passing of the [[British Museum Act 1963]], the British Museum (Natural History) became an independent museum with its own Board of Trustees, although – despite a proposed amendment to the act in the [[House of Lords]] – the former name was retained. Only with the [[Museums and Galleries Act 1992]] did the Museum's formal title finally change to the '''Natural History Museum'''.

===Geological Museum===
{{Main|Geological Museum}}
[[File:Globespin.jpg|thumb|left|The spinning globe in 1996]]
In 1986, the museum absorbed the adjacent [[Geological Museum]] of the [[British Geological Survey]], which had long competed for the limited space available in the area. The Geological Museum became world-famous for exhibitions including an active volcano model and an earthquake machine (designed by James Gardner), and housed the world's first computer-enhanced exhibition (''Treasures of the Earth''). The museum's galleries were completely rebuilt and relaunched in 1996 as ''The Earth Galleries'', with the other exhibitions in the Waterhouse building retitled ''The Life Galleries''. The Natural History Museum's own Mineralogy displays remain largely unchanged as an example of the 19th-century display techniques of the Waterhouse building.

The central atrium design by Neal Potter overcame visitors' reluctance to visit the upper galleries by "pulling" them through a model of the Earth made up of random plates on an escalator. The new design covered the walls in recycled slate and sandblasted the major stars and planets onto the wall. The Museums 'star' geological exhibits are displayed within the walls. Six iconic figures are the backdrop to discussing how previous generations have viewed Earth.

===The Darwin Centre===
[[File:NHMDarwinCentreTankRoom.jpg|thumb|right|Backstage at the NHM. The Tank Room within Darwin Centre Phase 1 holds larger fish from the spirit collection, and preparation facilities for them.]]
The Darwin Centre (named after [[Charles Darwin]]) was designed as a new home for the museum's collection of tens of millions of preserved specimens, as well as new work spaces for the museum's scientific staff, and new educational visitor experiences. Built in two distinct phases, with two new buildings adjacent to the main Waterhouse building, it is the most significant new development project in the museum's history.

Phase one of the Darwin Centre opened to the public in 2002, and it houses the [[zoological]] department's 'spirit collections'—organisms preserved in [[alcohol]]. Phase Two was unveiled in September 2008 and opened to the general public in September 2009. It was designed by the Danish architecture practice [[C. F. Møller Architects]] in the shape of a giant, eight-story [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] and houses the [[entomology]] and [[botanical]] collections—the 'dry collections'.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7594295.stm|title=Museum 'cocoon' prepares to open |publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 January 2009|date=2 September 2008}}</ref>

Arguably the most famous creature in the centre is the 8.62-metre-long [[giant squid]], affectionately named Archie.<ref>http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/news/2006/feb/news_5255.html</ref>

===The Attenborough Studio===
[[File:Nature Live at the Natural History Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Nature Live event in the Attenborough Studio, Natural History Museum, on 23 January 2012.]]
As part of the museum's remit to communicate science education and conservation work, a new multimedia studio will form an important part of Darwin Centre Phase 2. In collaboration with the [[BBC Natural History Unit|BBC's Natural History Unit]] (holder of the largest archive of natural history footage) the Attenborough Studio—named after the venerable broadcaster and presenter Sir [[David Attenborough]]—provides a multimedia environment for educational events. The studio plans to continue the daily lectures and demonstrations.

[[File:Large Mammal Room.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A balcony view of the Large Mammals Hall]]
One of the most famous and certainly most prominent of the exhibits—affectionately known as Dippy—is a {{convert|105|ft|m|sing=on}} long replica ''Diplodocus carnegii'' skeleton, situated within the central hall. The cast was given as a gift by the Scottish American industrialist [[Andrew Carnegie]], after a discussion with King [[Edward VII]], then a keen trustee of the British Museum. Carnegie arranged for the cast to be created at his own considerable expense of £2,000, copying the original held at the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History|Carnegie Museum]]. The pieces were sent to London in 36 crates, and on 12 May 1905, the exhibit was unveiled, to great public and media interest (the real fossil had yet to be mounted, as the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] in [[Pittsburgh]] was still being constructed to house it). As word of "Dippy" spread, Mr Carnegie paid to have additional copies made for display in most of the major European capitals and in Latin and South America, making Dippy the most-seen dinosaur skeleton in the world. The dinosaur quickly became an iconic representation of the museum, and has featured in many cartoons and other media, including the 1975 [[Disney]] comedy ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]''.

Another iconic display is the parallel skeleton and model of a [[blue whale]]. The display of the skeleton, weighing 10 tons and some 25 m long, was only made possible in 1934 with the building of the '''New Whale Hall''' (now the '''Large Mammals Hall'''), though it had been in storage for 42 years since its stranding on sandbanks at [[Wexford|Wexford Bay]]. Discussion of the idea of a life-size model also began around this time, and work was undertaken within the Whale Hall itself. Since taking a cast of such a large animal was deemed prohibitively expensive, scale models were used to meticulously piece the structure together. During construction, workmen left a trapdoor within the whale's stomach, which they would use for surreptitious cigarette breaks. Before the door was closed and sealed forever, some coins and a telephone directory were placed inside—this soon growing to an [[urban myth]] that a [[time capsule]] was left inside. The work was completed—entirely within the hall and in full view of the public—in 1938. At the time it was the largest such model in the world, at 28.3 m in length, though the construction details were later borrowed by several American museums, who scaled the plans further.

The Darwin Centre is host to [[Archie (squid)|Archie]], an 8 metre long [[giant squid]] taken alive in a [[fishing net]] near the [[Falkland Islands]] in 2004. The squid is not on general display, but stored in the large tank room in the basement of the Phase 1 building. On arrival at the museum, the specimen was immediately frozen while preparations commenced for its permanent storage. Since few complete and reasonably fresh examples of the species exist, 'wet storage' was chosen, leaving the squid undissected. A 9.45 m acrylic tank was constructed (by the same team that provide tanks to [[Damien Hirst]]), and the body preserved using a mixture of [[formalin]] and [[saline solution]].

The museum holds the remains and bones of the [[River Thames whale]] that lost its way on 20 January 2006 and swam into the [[Thames]]. Although primarily used for research purposes, and held at the museum's storage site at [[Wandsworth]], the skeleton has been put on temporary public display.<ref>[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/news/2007/january/news_10254.html First ever display of Thames whale skeleton – Natural History Museum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Dinocochlea]], one of the longer-standing mysteries of paleontology (originally thought to be a giant [[gastropod shell]], then a [[coprolite]] and now a [[concretion]] of a worm's tunnel), has been part of the collection since its discovery in 1921.

The museum keeps a [[wildlife garden]] on its west lawn, on which a potentially new species of insect resembling [[Arocatus roeselii]] was discovered in 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/618991/mystery-insect-bugs-experts|title=Mystery Insect Bugs Experts|publisher=Sky news|date=15 July 2008}}</ref>

;Red Zone
This is the zone that can be entered from Exhibition Road, on the East side of the building. It is a gallery themed around the changing history of the Earth.

The ''Earth Lab'' is a gallery that centres around [[geology]], and contains specimens of [[fossils]], [[minerals]] and rocks. The "Lab Area" is only open to reserved groups and allows an interactive approach to the gallery, allowing the use of [[microscope]]s. It is currently the only gallery in the red-zone without step free access. ''Earth's Treasury'' shows specimens of rocks, minerals and gemstones behind glass in a dimly lit gallery. ''Lasting Impressions'' is a small gallery containing speciments of rocks, plants and minerals, of which most can be touched.

==Education and public engagement==
[[File:NaturalHistoryMuseumLondon.jpg|thumb|upright|A young student at the Museum]] 
The museum runs a series of [[Museum education|educational]] and public engagement programmes. These include for example a highly praised "How Science Works" hands on workshop for school students demonstrating the use of microfossils in geological research. The museum also played a major role in securing designation of the [[Jurassic Coast]] of [[Devon]] and [[Dorset]] as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]] and has subsequently been a lead partner in the [[Lyme Regis]] Fossil Festivals.

In 2005, the museum launched a project to develop notable gallery characters to patrol display cases, including 'facsimiles' of luminaries such as [[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Mary Anning]], [[Dorothea Bate]] and [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]]. They tell stories and anecdotes of their lives and discoveries and aim to surprise visitors.<ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prehistoric/reviews/05_11_shindler.htm Review by Miles Russell] of ''Discovering Dorothea: the Life of the Pioneering Fossil-Hunter Dorothea Bate'' by Karolyn Shindler at ucl.ac.uk (accessed 23 November 2007)</ref>

In 2010 a six-part [[BBC]] documentary series was filmed at the museum entitled ''[[Museum of Life (documentary)|Museum of Life]]'' exploring the history and ''behind the scenes'' aspects of the museum.<ref name="Museum of Life">{{cite web | url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/museum-of-life/episode-six/index.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100830090305/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/museum-of-life/index.html | archivedate=30 August 2010 | title=Museum of Life | accessdate=5 January 2011 | year=2010 | publisher=The Natural History Museum}}</ref>

== Research and curation ==
<!--This is not a balanced 'summary style' report of the research at the museum, but (WP:UNDUE, maybe WP:RECENT) emphasises just one project as if selling it. This isn't what we should be doing here.-->
The Natural History museum combines museum's life and earth science collections with specialist expertise in "taxonomy, systematics, biodiversity, natural resources, planetary science, evolution and informatics" to tackle scientific questions.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/|title=Research and curation|publisher=Museum of Natural History|date=n.d.|accessdate=22 December 2013}}</ref>

===Nature Live===
Formerly called Darwin Centre Live, the ''Nature Live'' programme of free events gives visitors an opportunity to meet and talk with the scientists who work behind the scenes at the museum. Live events take place every day at 14.30 GMT, with subjects from evolution and climate change, to biodiversity and space. Visitors can ask questions, see specimens that are not normally on public display, and participate in video link-ups to laboratory spaces and field work sites around the world. The events are also webcast live on the museum's website, and online viewers can participate by emailing in questions or comments. Previous events are archived online.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==In fiction==
The museum is a prominent setting in [[Charlie Fletcher]]'s children's book about unLondon ''[[Stoneheart]]''. George Chapman, the hero, sneaks outside when punished on a school trip; he breaks off a small dragon's stone head from a relief and is chased by a [[pterodactyl]] which comes to life from a statue on the roof.

The museum plays an important role in the London-based [[Disney]] live-action feature ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]''; the eponymous skeleton is stolen from the museum, and a group of intrepid [[nanny|nannies]] hide inside the mouth of what is supposed to be the Blue Whale model (in fact a specially created prop – the nannies peer out from behind the whale's teeth, but a real Blue Whale is a [[baleen whale]] and has no teeth). Additionally, the film is set in the 1920s, before the Blue Whale model was built.

British fantasy author [[China Miéville]] based the plot of his 2010 novel ''[[Kraken: An Anatomy]]'' around the theft of "Archie" from the museum's Darwin Centre by a mysterious squid cult.

==Natural History Museum at Tring==
{{Main|Natural History Museum at Tring}}
The NHM also has a sister museum, located at [[Tring]], [[Hertfordshire]]. Built by local eccentric
[[Lionel Walter Rothschild]], the NHM took ownership in 1938. In 2007, the museum announced the name would be changed to the '''Natural History Museum at Tring''', though the older name, the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum is still in widespread use.

'''Silas Comfort Swallow''' (5 March 1839–1930) was a [[United States]] [[Methodist]] [[preacher]] and [[prohibitionist]] politician who was a lifelong opponent of slavery.

==Namesake==
He was presumably named after Methodist preacher ''Silas Comfort'' (1803–1868), a courageous anti-[[slavery]] member of the [[Genesee Conference|Genesee]], [[Oneida Conference|Oneida]] and [[Missouri Conference]]s. While serving in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], Comfort admitted as evidence in a church trial the testimony of a [[Negro]], a practice which was forbidden in public trials in Missouri at the time. He was censured by his Conference, but that censure was overturned by the 1840 General Conference. The [[General conference (United Methodist Church)|General Conference]] then bowed to [[Southern United States|Southern]] pressure and passed a resolution prohibiting the testimony of Negroes in church trials within states that forbade such testimony in public trials. That resolution was rescinded in 1844.
[[File:Swallow, Silas C. (1839-1930).jpg|thumb|Silas Comfort Swallow]]

==Early activities==
Silas Comfort Swallow was born of staunch Methodist parents. His father George was a trustee of [[Wyoming Seminary]]. Before entering the ministry, Silas was employed as a [[school]] [[teacher]] and later studied law. He served as a [[lieutenant]] during the [[American Civil War]].

He entered the [[Baltimore]] Conference in 1863 and became a charter member of the Central [[Pennsylvania]] Conference upon its organization in 1869. He was reportedly an eloquent and forceful preacher and revivalist. He was eminently successful as a church builder, presiding elder, and [[editing|editor]] of ''The Central Pennsylvania Methodist''. In the latter position Swallow vigorously attacked [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], spiritual indifference, and [[Political corruption|corruption]] in state government. His enemies led a campaign to have him prosecuted and convicted of [[slander]], which verdict was later reversed by the State Superior Court.

Swallow died at his home in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] in 1930. He is interred at [[Paxtang Cemetery]] near Harrisburg.

==Church service==
Dr. Swallow’s official conference service record lists the following appointments:
*1863-1864 Milton circuit.
*1864-1866 Berwick.
*1866-1868 Catawissa.
*1868-1871 Newberry.
*1871-1873 Williamsport Third Street.
*1873-1875 Milton.
*1875-1877 Altoona Eighth Avenue.
*1877-1881 presiding elder, Altoona District.
*1881-1884 York First.
*1884-1886 Williamsport Grace.
*1886-1887 agent, Dickinson College.
*1887-1892 Harrisburg Ridge Avenue.
*1892-1902 superintendent, Harrisburg Methodist book room.
*1902-1908 no appointment, by request.
*1908-1930 retired.
*1931-forever dead.

==Political career==
He was the [[Prohibition Party]]’s candidate for [[Mayor]] of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], state legislature, State Treasurer, [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|Governor of Pennsylvania]].

He was also Party candidate for the position of [[President of the United States]] in [[United States presidential election, 1904|1904 election]], running with [[George Washington Carroll]]. Although both men on the 1904 Prohibition ticket were well known in the anti-alcohol community, the campaign of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], allowed little news of the Swallow-Carroll ticket to get out, and the ticket only received 258,000+ votes, a slight increase from the party's 1900 take. The election was won by Incumbent President Roosevelt of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

Swallow was also surpassed by two other unsuccessful presidential candidates:
*[[Alton B. Parker|Alton Brooks Parker]] of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].
*[[Eugene V. Debs|Eugene Victor Debs]] of the [[Socialist Party of America]].

==Autobiography==
Being an editor, Swallow made certain that his life story was recorded for posterity. Upon reaching his 70th birthday in 1909, he published a 482 page hardback autobiography:''III Score and X – Selections, Collections, Recollections of Seventy Busy Years''.

This proved to be so successful that he came out with periodic updates as follows:
*''Toasts and Roasts of III Score and X'', 1911.
*''Then and Now – Some Reminiscences of an [[Octogenarian]]'', 1919.
*''IV Score and More'', 1922.

==Other writings==
Other booklets and pamphlets by Swallow, all of which are preserved in the archives of the Central Pennsylvania Conference of the United Methodist Church, range in date and content from his 1879 ''Camp Meetings and the Sabbath'' to his 1917 ''A Sermon on [[Thanksgiving]] and Thanksliving''.

'''Arthur Stewart''' "'''Art'''" '''Farmer''' (August 21, 1928 – October 4, 1999) was an American [[jazz]] trumpeter and [[flugelhorn]] player. He also played [[flumpet]], a trumpet–flugelhorn combination specially designed for him. He and his identical twin brother, [[double bassist]] [[Addison Farmer]], started playing professionally while in high school. Art gained greater attention after the release of a recording of his composition "Farmer's Market" in 1952. He subsequently moved from Los Angeles to New York, where he performed and recorded with musicians such as [[Horace Silver]], [[Sonny Rollins]], and [[Gigi Gryce]] and became known principally as a [[bebop]] player.

As Farmer's reputation grew, he expanded from bebop into more experimental forms through working with composers such as [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]] and [[Teddy Charles]]. He went on to join [[Gerry Mulligan]]'s quartet and, with [[Benny Golson]], to co-found [[the Jazztet]]. Continuing to develop his own sound, Farmer switched from trumpet to the warmer flugelhorn in the early 1960s, and he helped to establish the flugelhorn as a soloist's instrument in jazz.<ref name="LA1990">Feather, Leonard (March 30, 1990) [http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-30/entertainment/ca-345_1_art-farmer "Jazz Review: Art Farmer's Fluegelhorn of Plenty"]. ''Los Angeles Times''.</ref> He settled in Europe in 1968 and continued to tour internationally until his death. Farmer recorded more than 50 albums under his own name, a dozen with the Jazztet, and dozens more with other leaders. His playing is known for its individuality – most noticeably, its lyricism, warmth of tone and sensitivity.<ref name="Feather" />

At night there were after-hours clubs [...and] anybody who wanted to play was free to come up and play".<ref name="Berliner">Berliner, Paul F.

==Later life and career==

===Early career in Los Angeles and New York===

Farmer left school to tour with a group led by [[Johnny Otis]], but this job lasted for only four months, as Farmer's lip gave out.<ref name="David" /><ref name="Ben" /> Performing for long periods seven days a week for this job put great pressure on his technique, which was insufficiently developed to cope with such physical demands. His lip eventually became lacerated, and he could no longer play.<ref name="Berliner" />{{rp|118}} He then received technique training in New York, where he worked for a time as a janitor and played as a freelance musician during 1947 and 1948.<ref name="Yorker" /> An audition for [[Dizzy Gillespie]]'s big band was unsuccessful, and Farmer returned to the West Coast in 1948 as a member of [[Jay McShann]]'s band.<ref name="Yorker" /> Club and studio work was hard to get in Los Angeles from the late 1940s and into the 1950s, as it was dominated by white musicians.<ref name="Yorker" /> Farmer played and toured with [[Benny Carter]], [[Roy Porter]] and [[Gerald Wilson]], then played with [[Wardell Gray]] in 1951–52.<ref name="Feather">Feather, Leonard & Gitler, Ira (2007) ''The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz''. p. 219. Oxford University Press.</ref><ref name="David" /> The hazards of the touring jazz musician's lifestyle were also present: while travelling overnight by car between Phoenix and [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], to get to another Roy Porter-led gig, the car that Farmer was in overturned at high speed, leaving him concussed and Porter with broken ribs.<ref>Porter, Ray (1995) ''There and Back''. pp. 167–168. Continuum International.</ref>

Farmer's first studio recording appears to have been on June 28 or July 2, 1948, in Los Angeles, under the leadership of vocalist [[Big Joe Turner]] and pianist [[Pete Johnson]]. They recorded "Radar Blues", and at some point in the same or the following year they added a further seven sides; the eight tracks were released as four singles by [[Swing Time Records]].<ref>Jepson, Jorgen Grumet (ed.) (1965) ''Jazz Records 1942–1962 Vol. 8: Te–Z''. p. 110. Karl Emil Knudson.</ref><ref>Fairchild, Rolf. In ''Jumpin' the Blues'' [LP liner notes]. Arhoolie Records.</ref> Farmer recorded further singles with Roy Porter and then, on January 21, 1952, as a member of Wardell Gray's sextet. The latter session produced six tracks that were released as singles. These included "Farmer's Market", a piece that was written by Farmer and brought him greater attention.<ref>Accardi, James [http://wardellgray.org/discography.html "Wardell Gray – A Discography 1944–1955"]. wardellgray.org discography. Retrieved April 2, 2013.</ref><ref name="local" />

===Career after second move to New York===

Farmer worked in Los Angeles for a time as a hotel janitor and a hospital file clerk, before joining [[Lionel Hampton]]'s orchestra in 1952. He toured Europe with the orchestra, and shared the organization's trumpet chairs with [[Clifford Brown]], [[Quincy Jones]] and [[Benny Bailey]].<ref name="Yorker" /> This aided his musical development considerably, as did his 1953 membership of [[Teddy Charles]]' New Directions band – the compositions he encountered in this band allowed him to consider a broader range of expression during improvisation.<ref name="JF">Fordham, John (October 7, 1999) [http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/1999/oct/07/guardianobituaries.johnfordham "Art Farmer"]. ''The Guardian''.</ref>

Farmer relocated to New York and, on July 2, 1953, had his first recording session as leader. This was combined with another recorded 11 months later to form the eight-track [[Prestige Records|Prestige]] LP, ''[[The Art Farmer Septet]]'', featuring arrangements by Quincy Jones and [[Gigi Gryce]].<ref>[http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician_discography.php?id=6637#anchor111 "Art Farmer: Discography"].

''JazzTimes''.</ref>

Farmer recorded only twice with Horace Silver's group, as Silver recorded for [[Blue Note Records]], while Farmer was signed to Prestige. Feuds between the label bosses ruled out extensive cross-label collaboration.<ref>Silver, Horace (2007) ''Let's Get to the Nitty Gritty: The Autobiography of Horace Silver''. pp. 91, 96.

University Press of Mississippi.</ref>{{rp|442}} At this time, Farmer also rented his trumpet on a nightly basis to Miles Davis, who had pawned his own due to his drug dependency.<ref name="AM2" />{{rp|442}}

From the middle of the 1950s, Farmer featured in recordings by leading arrangers of the day, including [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]], Quincy Jones and [[Oliver Nelson]], being in demand because of his reputation for being able to play anything.<ref name="Yorker" /> The wide range of styles these arrangers represented was extended when Farmer took part in a series of experimental sessions with composer [[Edgard Varèse]] in 1957. Varèse used approximate notation and wanted the musicians to improvise within its structure; at least some of the seasoned jazz musicians present regarded this process of creation as similar to their own familiar creations of spontaneously produced [[head arrangement]]s, but their efforts influenced Varèse's composition, [[Poème électronique]].<ref>Mattis, Olivia (2006) "From Bebop to Poo-Wip: Jazz Influences in Varèse's Poème électronique". In Meyer, Felix & Zimmermann, Heidy (eds.) ''Edgar Varèse: Composer Sound Sculptor Visionary''. pp. 309–317. Paul Sacher Foundation / The Boydell Press.</ref> Farmer's playing around this time is summarized by critic [[Whitney Balliett]], commenting on his performance on [[Hal McKusick]]'s 1957 album ''Hal McKusick Quintet'': "Farmer has become one of the few genuinely individual modern trumpeters. (Nine out of ten modern trumpeters are true copies of Dizzy Gillespie or Miles Davis.)"<ref name="whitney">Balliett, Whitney (2000) ''Collected Works: A Journal of Jazz 1954–2000''. p. 37.

''Hartford Courant''.</ref>

Farmer formed [[the Jazztet]] in 1959, with the composer and tenor saxophonist [[Benny Golson]], after each man independently came to the conclusion that the other should be a member of his new sextet. The Jazztet lasted until 1962, recorded several albums for [[Argo Records|Argo]] and [[Mercury Records]], and assisted in the early careers of pianist [[McCoy Tyner]] and trombonist [[Grachan Moncur III]]. In the early 1960s Farmer established a trio with guitarist [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]] and bassist [[Steve Swallow]]; his relationship with Hall lasted from 1962 to 1964, and included two tours of Europe, one of which had concerts recorded for the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Jazz 625]]'' programme, which were later released on DVD.<ref>Krow, Jeff (October 30, 2009) [http://audaud.com/2009/10/art-farmer-%e2%80%93-live-in-1964-%e2%80%93-jazz-icons-iv-series/ "Art Farmer – Live in 1964 – (Jazz Icons IV Series)"].

These bands played laid back, melodious music during a period when [[avant-garde jazz]] was becoming more common.<ref>"Art Farmer" (February 1975) ''Buffalo Jazz Report''. p. 1.</ref>

Farmer toured Europe in 1965–66, then returned to the US and led a small group with [[Jimmy Heath]].<ref name="Feather" /> His stylistic development continued during this period of his career, in part because he "absorbed, understood, and had the technical and artistic gifts to put to personal use the [John] [[John Coltrane|Coltrane]] innovations of the '[[Giant Steps]]' period of the early 1960s".<ref name ="ramsey" />{{rp|45}} Work opportunities, however, were diminishing as rock became more popular in the mid-1960s, so Farmer joined the [[pit orchestra]] of [[Elliot Lawrence]] for the production of ''[[The Apple Tree]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], for six months.<ref name="Yorker" /><ref name="Smith" />{{rp|81}}

===Career after permanent move to Europe===

The visits to Europe continued.<ref name="JF" /> Farmer moved there in 1968 and ultimately settled in [[Vienna]], where he performed with The [[Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band]]<ref name="AM" />{{rp|406}} and joined the Austrian Radio Orchestra.<ref name="LAT" /> The latter job initially required only ten days a month of his time, so he was able to play with other well-known expatriates such as [[Don Byas]], [[Dexter Gordon]], and [[Ben Webster]].<ref name="csm" /> As the orchestra's music gradually changed in style from jazz to simpler forms and took up more of Farmer's time, he found that it was getting in the way of his musical ambitions, so he left after three or four years.<ref name="Smith" />{{rp|67, 71}} Pursuing these ambitions meant that Farmer traveled extensively worldwide. He said in 1976 that "I'm traveling 90 percent of the time. I can live anywhere. It's just a matter of getting to the airport".<ref>Fraser, Gerald C. (August 26, 1976) "Art Farmer Finds Jazz in Europe Challenging" ''The New York Times''. p. 39.</ref> A 1982 revival of the Jazztet, with Golson, led him to play more frequently in the United States than he had over the previous decade.<ref name="Cookin">Mathieson, Kenny (2012) ''Cookin': Hard Bop and Soul Jazz 1954–65: Hard Bop and Soul Jazz 1954–65''. Canongate.</ref> In the 1980s Farmer also created a quintet, featuring saxophonist [[Clifford Jordan]], that toured internationally.<ref name="nea" /> In the early 1980s, Farmer had also made some changes to his lifestyle. Interviewed for a 1985 article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', he reported losing 30 pounds in weight a couple of years earlier, and stopping smoking and drinking a couple of years before that; Farmer "used to think he couldn't play without drinking; now he couldn't play and drink", was the interviewer's summary of Farmer's habits,<ref name="Yorker" />{{rp|44}} which appear to have avoided the drug-related problems of many of his contemporaries.<ref>Gitler, Ira (1966) ''Jazz Masters of the Forties''. p. 272. Collins Books.</ref>

From the early 1990s, Farmer had a second house in New York and divided his time between Vienna and there. He had regular gigs with Clifford Jordan at the [[Sweet Basil Jazz Club]] and, later, with [[Ran Blake]] and [[Jerome Richardson]] at the [[Village Vanguard]], both in New York.<ref name="Feather" /> Farmer was awarded the Austrian Gold Medal of Merit in 1994.<ref name="Cookin" /> In the same year, a concert in honor of his achievements was held at the [[Alice Tully Hall]] in New York.<ref>Watrous, Peter (August 8, 1994) [http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/08/arts/jazz-review-players-play-to-honor-art-farmer.html "Jazz Review; Players Play to Honor Art Farmer"]. ''The New York Times''.</ref> Farmer also recorded extensively as a leader throughout his later career, including some pieces of classical music with US and European orchestras.<ref name="Cookin" /> Farmer's level of playing even towards the end of his career was noted in a review by [[Scott Yanow]] of one of his last recordings, ''Silk Road'', from 1996: "the warm-toned and swinging Farmer is consistently the main star, and at age 68 he proves to still be in his prime".<ref name="AM" />{{rp|409}} In 1999 Farmer was selected as a [[NEA Jazz Masters|National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master]].<ref name="nea" /> A few months later, on October 4, Farmer died of a heart attack at home in [[Manhattan]], aged 71.<ref name="LAT">Heckman, Don & Thurber, Jon (October 7, 1999) [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/07/news/mn-19751 "Art Farmer: Eloquent Jazz Master of the Trumpet and Fluegelhorn"]. ''Los Angeles Times''.</ref><ref>[http://extras.denverpost.com/news/obits/farm1007.htm "Art Farmer"]. (October 7, 1999) ''The Denver Post Online''.</ref>

==Personality and family life==
Farmer first married in the mid-1950s, to a woman from South America; the couple had one son, Arthur Jr, who died in 1994, and they divorced after around a year.<ref name="Smith" />{{rp|68}} Farmer's second wife was a distant cousin; this also ended in divorce.<ref name="Smith" />{{rp|69}} He married again, to a Viennese banker named Mechtilde Lawgger, and their son, Georg, was born in the early 1970s.<ref name="Yorker" /><ref name="local">"Requiem" (November 1999) [http://www.local802afm.org/1999/11/requiem-48/#2 Associated Musicians of Greater New York's ''Allegro''. Volume XCIX, No. 10.]</ref><ref>Feather, Leonard (November 12, 1987) [http://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-12/entertainment/ca-20575_1_art-farmer "Art Farmer Reaps His Musical Harvest"]. ''Los Angeles Times''.</ref> They lived together in a house that they had built in Vienna, and Farmer reported contentment with his lifestyle; notably, in contrast with his homeland, he did not experience racism in Europe.<ref name="Yorker" /> Farmer described himself in 1985 as "an introvert, and kind of reclusive"; a soundproof room in his Austrian house allowed him to practice alone for the four or five hours a day that he desired.<ref name="Yorker" />{{rp|52}} His personality was often described by others as mirroring his playing: [[Leonard Feather]], for instance, observed in 1990 that Farmer was "mellow, relaxed and [...] gentle".<ref name="LA1990" />

Farmer was affected by the sudden death of his twin brother in 1963: more than 20 years later, he said that he still dreamed of his sibling, and admitted that, "It seems there's a part of him I haven't fully gotten over".<ref name="Yorker" />{{rp|49}} Farmer's third wife died from cancer in 1992; speaking three years later, he remarked that "I guess I never will really recover from that because we had been together for over 20 years when she died".<ref name="Smith" />{{rp|69}} After his own death, he was described as being survived by his companion and manager, Lynne Mueller, and son.<ref name="Ben">Ratliff, Ben (October 6, 1999) [http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/06/arts/art-farmer-71-be-bop-master-of-the-trumpet-and-fluegelhorn.html "Art Farmer, 71, Be-Bop Master of the Trumpet and Fluegelhorn"]. ''The New York Times''.</ref>

==Playing style==
Descriptions of Farmer's playing style typically stress his lyricism and the warmth of his sound. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' obituary writers noted that his playing had "a sweetly lyrical tone and a melodic approach to phrasing, neither of which minimized his capacity to produce rhythmically swinging phrases".<ref name="LAT" /> The equivalent comments in ''[[The Guardian]]'' were that "Farmer avoided the bright, penetrating sound of orthodox trumpet playing and was influenced by the more reserved articulation of Miles Davis and [[Kenny Dorham]]", and that, although he could seem more restrained than Davis or [[Lee Morgan]], "Farmer was in his way a true original. His phrasing was always distinctive, letting the beat run ahead of him rather in the manner of [[Billie Holiday]]'s vocals".<ref name="JF" />

Farmer moved from trumpet to playing mostly flugelhorn from the early 1960s, utilising the latter instrument's more mellow sound and Farmer's ability to get what he wanted from it without having to use a mute.<ref name="LAT" /><ref name="ramsey" />{{rp|44}} In 1989, he played a major part in creating a trumpet–flugelhorn hybrid, the [[flumpet]], which was constructed for him by instrument maker [[David Monette]].<ref name="LAT" /> This instrument allowed him to play with more expression in a range of settings, from small groups to big bands. In 1997, Monette presented him with a personalized flumpet, with decorations symbolising important people and places in Farmer's life.<ref>Reich, Howard (August 5, 1997) [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-08-05/features/9708050146_1_flumpet-harry-sweets-edison-jazz-tradition "Specialized Instrument: Jazzman's 'Flumpet' Decorated with Personal Symbols"]. ''Chicago Tribune''.</ref>

Farmer's determination to keep exploring forms of expression continued throughout his life. One comment on a concert given when Farmer was 67 was that "his style was continuing to evolve"; he "delivered several solos in which his characteristically flowing lines were interrupted by sudden, wide melodic leaps and disjunct rhythmic accents".<ref name="LAT" /> A few months before his death, although faster numbers had become perhaps too challenging, ''The Guardian'' observed, Farmer's playing on slower tunes achieved a new level of emotional expression.<ref name="JF" />

The '''University of Sheffield''' (informally '''Sheffield University''') is a research [[university]] in the city of [[Sheffield]] in [[South Yorkshire]], England. It received its [[royal charter]] in 1905 as successor to Sheffield Medical School (1828) and University College of Sheffield (1897). As one of the original [[red brick universities]], it is also a member of the prestigious [[Russell Group]] of research-intensive universities.

The University of Sheffield is widely recognized as a leading research and teaching university in the UK and in the world.<ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/9542312/Third-of-Britains-elite-universities-still-looking-for-students.html</ref><ref>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jul/22/russell-group-universities-in-clearing</ref><ref>http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/nr/times-higher-student-experience-sheffield-university-tops-rusell-group-and-region-1.174528</ref><ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8635891/Top-students-concentrated-in-just-12-elite-universities.html</ref> In 2014, [[QS World University Rankings]]<ref name="topuniversities.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2012?page=1 |title=QS World University Rankings - 2012 |publisher=Top Universities |date=19 December 2012 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref> placed Sheffield as the 69th university worldwide and 12th in the UK.

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Mark Firth MC.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Mark Firth]], opened Firth College in 1879]]
[[File:Sheffield Music Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Sheffield School of Medicine, founded in 1828 (right)]]
[[File:Sheffield Uni.jpg|thumb|right|Firth Court, opened in 1905, with the Royal Charter]]

The University of Sheffield was originally formed by the merger of three colleges. The '''Sheffield School of Medicine''' was founded in 1828, followed in 1879<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.169730!/file/Legacy_Brochure.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Legacy of Excellence |accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref> by the opening of '''Firth College''', which developed out of the Cambridge University Extension Movement scheme, by [[Mark Firth]], a [[steel]] manufacturer, to teach [[arts]] and [[science]] subjects.<ref name="Historical note">{{cite web |url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/about/history.html |title=Historical note |publisher=University of Sheffield |location=Sheffield, United Kingdom}}</ref> Firth College then helped to fund the opening of the '''Sheffield Technical School''' in 1884 to teach [[applied science]], the only major faculty the existing colleges did not cover. The three institutions merged in 1897 to form the '''University College of Sheffield'''.<ref name="Historical note"/> Sheffield is one of the six [[red brick universities]].

===Royal Charter===
It was originally envisaged that the University College would join [[Victoria University of Manchester|Manchester]], [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool]] and [[University of Leeds|Leeds]] as the fourth member of the federal [[Victoria University (UK)|Victoria University]]. However, the Victoria University began to split up before this could happen and so the University College of Sheffield received its own [[Royal Charter]] in 1905 and became the '''University of Sheffield'''.

===Coat of arms===
The arms of the University blazoned Azure, A gold-edged book inscribed with the Latin ''Disce Doce'' (Learn and Teach), A sheaf of eight silver arrows on either side (from the arms of the city), The Crown of Success and The [[White Rose of York]], with a scroll carrying the motto ''Rerum cognoscere causas'' (To Discover the Causes of Things). The University's logo, consists of a redrawn version of the Coat of Arms and the name of the institution, is introduced in 2005, the centenary year of the University. However, the Coat of Arms should not be confused with the logo.

===Development===
From 363 full-time students and 71 staff in 1905, the University grew slowly until the 1950s and 1960s when it began to expand rapidly. Many new buildings (including the famous [[Arts Tower]] and the Main Library) were built and student numbers increased to their present levels of just under 26,000.  In 1987 the University began to collaborate with its once would-be partners of the Victoria University by co-founding the [[NCUK|Northern Consortium]]; a coalition for the education and recruitment of international students.

In 1995, the University took over the Sheffield and North Trent College of Nursing and Midwifery, which greatly increased the size of the medical faculty. In 2005, the South Yorkshire Strategic Health Authority announced that it would split the training between Sheffield and [[Sheffield Hallam University]] – however, the University decided to pull out of providing preregistration nursing and midwifery training due to "costs and operational difficulties".<ref name="guardian-nursing">{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2005/jul/20/nhsstaff.highereducation | title=Sheffield pulls out of nurse training deal | author=Donald MacLeod |newspaper=The Guardian | date=20 July 2005 | accessdate=4 April 2008 | location=London}}</ref>

[[File:Sheffield Arts Tower.png|thumb|The [[Arts Tower]] and Western Bank Library]]
[[File:Information commons.jpg|thumb|The [[Information Commons, Sheffield|Information Commons]]]]

===Main (Western Bank) campus===
[[File:Denny Perak.jpg|thumb|The Alfred Denny Building]]
The University of Sheffield is not a [[campus university]], though most of its buildings are located in fairly close proximity to each other. The centre of the University's presence lies one mile to the west of Sheffield city centre, where there is a mile-long collection of buildings belonging almost entirely to the University. This area includes the [[University of Sheffield Union of Students|Sheffield Students' Union]] (housed next door to [[University House, University of Sheffield|University House]]), the [[Octagon Centre]], [[Firth Court]], the Geography and Planning building, the [[Alfred Denny Building]] (housing [[natural sciences]], the Departments of Animal and Plant Sciences and Biology, and including a small [[museum]]), the Dainton and Richard Roberts Buildings and the [[Hicks Building]]. The [[listed building|Grade II*-listed]] library and [[Arts Tower]] are also located in this cluster. The Arts Tower houses one of Europe's few surviving examples of a [[Paternoster]] lift. A concourse under the main road (the [[A57 road|A57]]) allows students to easily move between these buildings. Amongst the more recent additions to the universities estate are The [[Information Commons, Sheffield|Information Commons]], opened in 2007, The Soundhouse (Carey Jones Architects and Jefferson Sheard Architects 2008) and the Jessop West building (2009), the first UK project by renowned Berlin architects [[Sauerbruch Hutton]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/jessop/developmentandbuildings/jessopwest.html |title=About Jessop |year=2010 |accessdate=6 December 2010 |publisher=The University of Sheffield |location=Sheffield, United Kingdom}}</ref> In addition, throughout 2010 the Western Bank Library received a £3.3m restoration and refurbishment, the [[University of Sheffield Union of Students]] underwent a £5m rebuild, and work commenced on a multimillion pound refurbishment of the grade II* listed [[Arts Tower]] to extend its lifespan by 30 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/artstowerproject/introduction.html|title=Arts Tower Project |date=23 November 2010 |accessdate=6 December 2010 |publisher=The University of Sheffield |location=Sheffield, United Kingdom}}</ref>

====The Octagon Centre====
[[File:Octagon 1.jpg|thumb|The Octagon Centre]]
{{main|Octagon Centre}}
The Octagon Centre is a multi-purpose conference centre and music venue situated at the Western Bank campus, and is joined by a skyway to [[University House, University of Sheffield|University House]]. The Octagon Centre comprises an eight-sided auditorium with a capacity of 1600, offices, meeting rooms, and a lounge with bar and patio.
The Octagon Centre consists of a main auditorium known as the Convocation Hall, with offices and meeting rooms in corridors across two floors at a lower elevation on the southern side of the building, and a bar lounge. All of these areas are connected by a foyer entrance block. The building is connected to University House by a footbridge, offering access to University House's catering facilities.

====Firth Court====
{{main|Firth Court}}
Firth Court is the main administrative centre for the University of Sheffield, stands at the heart of the University precinct on Western Bank. It originally housed the Arts, Science and Medicine departments, while it is currently home to the Department for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology and Biomedical Science.
The building was opened by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in 1905, and is named after [[Mark Firth]].

====Dainton and Richard Roberts Buildings====
The Dainton Building, houses the Department of Chemistry and Faculty of Sciences, is named after Sheffield academic chemist and university chancellor [[Frederick Sydney Dainton]]. The East Wing of Dainton Building was renamed Richard Roberts Building after Nobel Laureate and University graduate [[Richard J. Roberts|Richard Roberts]].

====Hicks Building====
{{main|Hicks Building}}
The Hicks Building is a building named after [[William Mitchinson Hicks]], a British mathematician and physicist who spent most of his career at Sheffield, contributing to the development of the university. It houses the departments of Physics and Astronomy, the Chemistry and Physics Workshop and the School of Mathematics and Statistics.
The Building is in three sections, including a taller building clad in red-brick, a shorter fully linked section clad in blue tiles and glass, and a section facing the University Concourse.

====Arts Tower and Western Bank Library====
{{main|Arts Tower}}
The Arts Tower is a [[Grade II* listed building]] opened in 1966. It was the tallest in Sheffield from 1965 to 2010, and is the tallest university building in the UK. The building, previously housed several academic departments, is now mainly an administration block.
A bridge at the mezzanine level links the tower to Western Bank Library. The two buildings are intended to be viewed together.
Formerly known as the University Library, the Western Bank Library was the main library of the University of Sheffield until the [[Information Commons]] was established. The Grade II*-listed library is home to 25,000 rare books and 150 special collections.

===St George's===
To the east lies St George's Campus, named after [[St George's Church, Portobello|St George's Church]] (now a lecture theatre and postgraduate residence). The campus is centred on Mappin Street, home to a number of University buildings, including the Faculty of [[Engineering]] (partly housed in the [[Listed building|Grade II-listed]] [[Mappin Building]]) and the University of Sheffield School of Management and Department of [[computer science|Computer Science]]. The University also maintains the [[Turner Museum of Glass]] in this area. The University recently converted the listed old [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[Jessop Hospital|Jessop Hospital for Women]] buildings into the new home of the Department of Music. The adjacent Edwardian buildings and a large vacant plot of land opposite [[St George's Church, Portobello|St George's Church]] are awaiting development as and when funding permits. The grade II listed Edwardian wing of the Jessop Hospital is being demolished to be replaced by a new £81 million building for the Faculty of Engineering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/nr/new-engineering-building-sheffield-jessop-west-1.231929 |title=New Engineering Building will open door to growth and investment |publisher=The University of Sheffield |date=17 December 2012 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref>

====Sir Frederick Mappin Building====
{{main|Sir Frederick Mappin Building}}
The Sir Frederick Mappin Building is a grade II-listed building in an area known as the St George's Complex. The building houses much of the Faculty of Engineering and St George's IT centre. The oldest part of the building, the former Technical School, now lies in the centre of the building. The extensive Mappin Street frontage includes the main entrance, the John Carr Library and Mappin Hall, and is connected to the Technical School by a bridge.

===West of the main campus===
Further west lies Weston Park, the [[Weston Park Museum]], the [[Harold Cantor Gallery]], [[Goodwin Sports Centre|sports facilities]] in the [[Crookesmoor]] area, and the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health around the [[Royal Hallamshire Hospital]] (although these subjects are taught in the city's extensive [[teaching hospital]]s under the [[Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]], and throughout [[South Yorkshire]] and [[North East Lincolnshire]]). It is in this area that the new £12m Sheffield Institute for Translational [[Neuroscience]] (SITraN), opened by Her Majesty [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in November 2010, is located.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/mediacentre/2010/1803.html|title=SITraN |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=6 December 2010 |publisher=The University of Sheffield |location=Sheffield, United Kingdom}}</ref>

===Student accommodation===
{{main|University of Sheffield student housing}}
Further west still lie the University [[halls of residence]]. These comprise Tapton Hall of Residence (now vacant awaiting redevelopment into private housing), The Endcliffe Student Village comprising the established Halifax and Stephenson Halls (although much of the Halifax Hall has been converted to conferencing rooms), Endcliffe Vale Flats, Crescent Flats, Crewe Flats, and newly built (2007) Burbage, Stanage, Howden, Froggatt, Millstone, Rivelin, Yarncliffe, Birchen, Curbar, Cratcliffe, Lawrencefield and Derwent, as well as University owned private houses. A new student village was completed (but not fully occupied) for the 2009/10 academic year with 1200 beds on the site of the former Ranmoor Halls of Residence, now known as the Ranmoor Village. Student accommodation in both the Endcliffe and Ranmoor villages is rented out during the summer recess to visiting conference delegations etc.

===Manvers campus===
The [[Manvers]] campus, at [[Wath-on-Dearne]] between [[Rotherham]] and [[Barnsley]], was where the majority of nursing was taught, but this has now been mothballed.

The brand (encompassing the visual identity) is centred on the theme of "discovery", led by the Latin motto from the coat of arms "Rerum Cognoscere Causas" – "to discover the causes of things". It has been applied across print, screen and other areas such as signage, vehicle livery and merchandising. The project was key to the University's Marketing Department receiving "HEIST Marketing Team of the Year, 2005".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/mediacentre/2006/568.html | title=University scoops top marketing award | publisher=The University of Sheffield | date=5 April 2006 | accessdate=29 December 2007}}</ref>

==Student life==
[[File:Shefunistudentunion2012.JPG|thumb|[[University of Sheffield Students' Union|Students' Union]]]]

{{main|University of Sheffield Students' Union}}

The University of Sheffield Students' Union has been rated as the best in the UK by the Times Higher Education Student Experience Survey for 5 years in-a-row (2009-2013). It was founded in 1906 and consists of two bars (''Bar One'' – which has a book-able function room with its own bar, ''The Raynor Lounge'' – and ''The Interval''); three club venues (''Fusion'', ''Foundry'' and ''Studio''); and coffee shops, restaurants, shops, and the student run cinema [[Film Unit]]. There is also a [[student radio]] station called [[Forge Radio]] and a newspaper called ''Forge Press'', which are run under the umbrella of 'Forge Media'. The Union has nearly three hundred student societies and nearly fifty sports teams.

In November 2009 a development project began to redevelop the Students' Union building, funded by £5m by the HEFCE, which was completed and re-opened in September 2010. Works centred on improving circulation around the building by aligning previously disjointed floors, improving internal access between the Union building and neighbouring University House, and constructing a striking new entrance and lobby that incorporates the university's traditional colours of black and gold.

During 2012-13 the Students' Union went under a further redevelopment costing £20 million which led to the refurbishment of the University House. University House, which was one of the first glass curtain walled buildings in the world when it was completed in 1963, has now been integrated with the University’s Students' Union – the number one in the UK - in one single building.<ref>http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/nr/students-union-refurbishment-sheffield-1.311374</ref>

The union has an active volunteering and charity community. The RAG (Raising and Giving society) raised over £180,000 in 2011-12, through general fundraising and several larger events; the union is host to the world's largest student organized charity hitchhike, [[Bummit]], which runs every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheffieldrag.com/pages/money_raised|title=About Us|date=20 May 2013 | accessdate = 20 May 2013 }}</ref> Another RAG tradition is Spiderwalk, a 12.5-mile trek through the city and the [[Peak District]] through the night; other societies run fund-raising activities throughout the night, such as a 24-hour role-playing event. The Union's "SheffieldVolunteering" scheme is one of the country's most active and well-recognised student volunteering schemes, with over 26,269 hours logged in 2011-12, and has won various national acclaims over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/union/get-involved/volunteering/about-us.php|title=About Us|date=20 May 2013 | accessdate = 20 May 2013 }}</ref>

===Varsity sports===
The annual "Varsity Challenge" takes place between teams from the University and its rival [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. The University has 26 varsity sports (sports contested in varsity). The University sports colours are black and gold. The University of Sheffield won the Varsity competition in 2013, beating Sheffield Hallam University for the first time in ten years.<ref>http://www.shef.ac.uk/news/nr/varsity-victory-for-university-of-sheffield-1.267395</ref>

'''Cluster headache''' (CH) is a [[neurological disorder]] characterized by recurrent, severe [[headache]]s on one side of the head, typically around the eye.<ref name=Nesbitt2012 /> There are often accompanying autonomic symptoms during the headache such as eye watering, [[nasal congestion]] and swelling around the eye, typically confined to the side of the head with the pain.<ref name=Nesbitt2012>{{cite journal|author=Nesbitt AD, Goadsby PJ|title=Cluster headache|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Apr 11, 2012|volume=344|pages=e2407|pmid=22496300 |type=Review|doi=10.1136/bmj.e2407}}</ref>

<!--Diagnosis and cause  -->
Cluster headache belongs to a group of primary headache disorders, classified as the [[trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia]]s or (TACs). Cluster Headache is named after the demonstrated grouping of headache attacks occurring together (cluster).<ref name=Nesbitt2012 /> Individuals typically experience repeated attacks of excruciatingly severe unilateral headache pain.<ref name=IHS/> Cluster Headache attacks often occur periodically; spontaneous remissions may interrupt active periods of pain, though about 10–15% of chronic CH never remit.<ref name= IHS/> The cause of Cluster Headache has not been identified.

<!--Treatment and epidemiology  -->
While there is no known cure, cluster headaches can sometimes be prevented and acute attacks treated. Recommended treatments for acute attacks include [[oxygen]] or a fast acting [[triptan]].<ref name=AFP2013/> Primary recommended prevention is [[verapamil]]. Steroids may be used as a transitional treatment and may prevent attack recurrence until preventative treatments take effect. The condition affects approximately 0.2% of the general population,<ref name=Bennett2008>{{cite journal |author=Bennett MH, French C, Schnabel A, Wasiak J, Kranke P |title=Normobaric and hyperbaric oxygen therapy for migraine and cluster headache |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=|issue=3 |pages=CD005219 |year=2008 |pmid=18646121 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005219.pub2 |type=Review}}</ref> and men are more commonly affected than women, by a ratio of about 2.5:1 to 3.5:1.<ref name=Nesbitt2012 />

The onset of an attack is rapid and most often without preliminary signs that are characteristic in migraine. Preliminary sensations of pain in the general area of attack, referred to as "shadows", may signal an imminent CH, or these symptoms may linger after an attack has passed, or even between attacks.<ref>{{primary source-inline|date=January 2014}} {{cite journal |author=Marmura MJ, Pello SJ, Young WB |title=Interictal pain in cluster headache |journal=Cephalalgia |volume=30 |issue=12 |pages=1531–4 |date=December 2010 |pmid=20974600 |doi=10.1177/0333102410372423 }}</ref> Though a CH is strictly unilateral, there are some documented cases of "side-shift" between cluster periods, extremely rare, simultaneously (within the same cluster period) bilateral headache.<ref>{{primary source-inline|date=January 2014}} {{cite journal |author=Meyer EL, Laurell K, Artto V, et al. |title=Lateralization in cluster headache: a Nordic multicenter study |journal=J Headache Pain |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=259–63 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19495933 |pmc=3451747 |doi=10.1007/s10194-009-0129-z}}</ref>

===Pain===
The pain occurs only on one side of the head (unilateral), around the eye (orbital), particularly above the eye (supraorbital), in the temple (temporal), or in any combination.
The pain of CH is remarkably greater than in other headache conditions, including severe migraine. The term "headache" does not adequately convey the severity of the condition; the disease may be the most painful condition known to medical science.<ref name="birth">{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1474-7766.2001.00505.x |title=Cluster Headache |year=2001 |author=Matharu M, Goadsby P |journal=Practical Neurology |volume=1 |page=42}}</ref> The pain is described as burning, stabbing, boring or squeezing and may be located near or behind the eye.<ref name="MehtaMaloney2011">{{cite book|author1=Noshir Mehta|author2=George E.

===Other symptoms===
The typical symptoms of cluster headache are grouping (cluster) of recurring headache attacks of severe or very severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital and/or temporal pain. If left untreated, attack frequency will range from one attack every two days to eight attacks a day.<ref name=IHS/><ref name=AFP2013/> The headache attack is accompanied by at least one of the following autonomic symptoms: [[Ptosis (eyelid)|drooping eyelid]], [[miosis|pupil constriction]], redness of the [[conjunctiva]], [[lacrimation|tearing]], [[rhinorrhea|runny nose]], and, less commonly, [[facial blushing]], swelling, or sweating, commonly but not always appearing on the same side of the head as the pain.<ref name=IHS/>

Restlessness (for example, pacing or rocking back and forth), photosensitivity, aversion to light (photophobia) or sensitivity to noise (phonophobia) may occur during a CH. Nausea is a rare symptom, although it has been reported.<ref name=Beck/> Secondary effects may include inability to organize thoughts and plans, physical exhaustion, confusion, agitation, aggressiveness, depression and anxiety.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Robbins MS |title=The psychiatric comorbidities of cluster headache|journal=Current pain and headache reports|date=Feb 2013|volume=17|issue=2|page=313|pmid=23296640|type= REview|doi=10.1007/s11916-012-0313-8}}</ref>

People with CH may dread facing another headache and adjust their physical or social activities around a possible future occurrence. Likewise they may seek assistance to accomplish what would otherwise be normal tasks. They may hesitate to make plans because of the regularity, or conversely, the unpredictability of the pain schedule. These factors can lead to generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorder,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Robbins MS |title=The psychiatric comorbidities of cluster headache |journal=Curr Pain Headache Rep |volume=17 |issue=2 |page=313 |date=February 2013 |pmid=23296640 |doi=10.1007/s11916-012-0313-8 |type=Review}}</ref> serious depressive disorders,<ref>{{primary source-inline|date=January 2014}} {{cite journal |author=Liang JF, Chen YT, Fuh JL, et al. |title=Cluster headache is associated with an increased risk of depression: a nationwide population-based cohort study |journal=Cephalalgia |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=182–9 |date=February 2013 |pmid=23212294 |doi=10.1177/0333102412469738}}</ref> social withdrawal and isolation.<ref>{{primary source-inline|date=January 2014}} {{cite journal |author=Jensen RM, Lyngberg A, Jensen RH |title=Burden of cluster headache |journal=Cephalalgia |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=535–41 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17459083 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2982.2007.01330.x }}</ref>

===Recurrence===
Cluster headaches are occasionally referred to as "alarm clock headaches" because of the regularity of their timing, CH attacks may awaken individuals from sleep.  Both individual attacks and the cluster grouping can have a metronomic regularity; attacks striking at a precise time of day each morning or night is typical. The grouping of headache clusters can occur more often around solstices, or spring and autumn equinoxes, sometimes showing circannual periodicity. This has prompted researchers to speculate involvement, or dysfunction of the hypothalamus. The Hypothalamus controls the body's "biological clock" and [[circadian rhythm]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pringsheim T |title=Cluster headache: evidence for a disorder of circadian rhythm and hypothalamic function |journal=Can J Neurol Sci |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=33–40 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11858532|type= Review}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dodick DW, Eross EJ, Parish JM, Silber M |title=Clinical, anatomical, and physiologic relationship between sleep and headache |journal=Headache |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=282–92 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12603650 |doi=10.1046/j.1526-4610.2003.03055.x }}</ref> Conversely, attack frequency may be highly unpredictable, showing no periodicity at all.

In episodic cluster headaches, attacks occur once or more daily, often at the same time each day, for a period of several weeks, followed by a headache-free period lasting weeks, months, or years. Approximately 10–15% of cluster headaches [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]], with multiple headaches occurring every day for years, sometimes without any remission.{{mcn|date=January 2014}}

In accordance with the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria, cluster headaches occurring in two or more cluster periods, lasting from 7 to 365 days with a pain-free remission of one month or longer between the clusters may be classified as episodic. If attacks occur for more than a year without pain-free remission of at least one month, the condition is classified chronic.<ref name=IHS>{{cite web |url= http://www.ihs-classification.org/en/02_klassifikation/02_teil1/03.01.00_cluster.html |title= IHS Classification ICHD-II 3.1 Cluster headache |publisher= The International Headache Society |accessdate=2014-01-03}}</ref>
Chronic CH occurs continuously without any remission periods between cycles; there may be high and low variation in cycles, meaning the frequency and severity of attacks may change without predictability, for a period of time. The amount of change during these cycles varies between individuals and does not demonstrate complete remission of the episodic form. The condition may change unpredictably, from chronic to episodic and from episodic to chronic.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Torelli P, Manzoni GC |title=What predicts evolution from episodic to chronic cluster headache? |journal=Curr Pain Headache Rep |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=65–70 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11749880 |doi=10.1007/s11916-002-0026-5|type=Review}}</ref>

The cause of cluster headache is unknown.<ref name=Pinessi2005>{{cite journal |author=Pinessi L, Rainero I, Rivoiro C, Rubino E, Gallone S |title=Genetics of cluster headache: an update |journal=J Headache Pain |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=234–6 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16362673 |pmc=3452030 |doi=10.1007/s10194-005-0194-x|type= Review}}</ref>

===Genetics===
Cluster headache may, but rarely, run in some families in an [[autosomal dominant]] inheritance pattern.<ref name=Pinessi2005 /> People with a [[Consanguinity|first degree relative]] with the condition are about 14-48 times more likely to develop it themselves,<ref name=Nesbitt2012 /> and between 1.9 and 20% of persons with CH have a positive family history.<ref name=Pinessi2005 /> This suggests that genetic factors are important, but the type and number of genes involved is unclear.<ref name=Pinessi2005 />

===Smoking===
About 65% of persons with CH are, or have been, tobacco smokers.<ref name=Nesbitt2012 /> Stopping smoking does not lead to improvement of the condition and CH also occurs in those who have never smoked (e.g. children);<ref name=Nesbitt2012 /> it is thought unlikely that smoking is a cause.<ref name=Nesbitt2012 /> People with CH may be predisposed to certain traits, including smoking or other lifestyle habits.<ref name="pmid18474191">{{cite journal |author=Schürks M, Diener HC |title=Cluster headache and lifestyle habits |journal=Curr Pain Headache Rep |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=115–21 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18474191 |type=Review |doi=10.1007/s11916-008-0022-5}}</ref>

===Hypothalamus===
One theory is that the cause is dysfunction of the [[hypothalamus]], which may explain why cluster headaches frequently strike around the same time each day, and during a particular season.{{mcn|date=January 2014}} One of the functions of the hypothalamus is regulation of the [[Circadian rhythm|biological clock]]. [[Metabolic]] abnormalities have also been reported.{{mcn|date=January 2014}} The [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scans indicate the brain areas which are activated during pain of attack only, compared to pain free periods. These pictures show brain areas which are active during pain in yellow/orange color (called "pain matrix"). The area in the center (in all three views) is specifically activated during CH only. The bottom row [[voxel-based morphometry]] (VBM) shows structural brain differences between individuals with and without CH; only a portion of the [[hypothalamus]] is different.<ref>{{cite journal |author=DaSilva AF, Goadsby PJ, Borsook D |title=Cluster headache: a review of neuroimaging findings |journal=Curr Pain Headache Rep |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=131–6 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17367592|type= Review |doi=10.1007/s11916-007-0010-1}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Cluster headache has been historically classified as [[vascular headache]]s; for decades, it has been proposed that intense pain was caused by [[Vasodilation|dilation of blood vessels]] which was thought to create pressure on the [[trigeminal nerve]]. While this theory was thought to be the immediate cause of the pain, the [[etiology]] (underlying cause or causes) is not fully understood and CH pathogenesis is the subject of ongoing debate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goadsby PJ |title=The vascular theory of migraine--a great story wrecked by the facts |journal=Brain |volume=132 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=6–7 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19098031 |doi=10.1093/brain/awn321 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/132/1/6.long| type= Review}}</ref> Investigations into the vascular theory of headache disorders are helping to identify the role of other possible causative mechanisms in CH.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leone M, Cecchini AP, Tullo V, Curone M, Di Fiore P, Bussone G |title=Cluster headache: what has changed since 1999? |journal=Neurol.

==Diagnosis==
Cluster headaches are often misdiagnosed, mismanaged, or undiagnosed for many years; they may be confused with migraine, "cluster-like" headache (or mimics), CH subtypes, other TACs, or other types of primary or secondary headache syndrome.<ref name=Vliet/>  Cluster-like head pain may be diagnosed as secondary headache rather than cluster headache.<ref name=IHS/>

A detailed oral history aids correct differential diagnosis, as there are no confirmatory tests for CH.  A headache diary can be useful in tracking when and where pain occurs, how severe it is, and how long the pain lasts. A record of coping strategies used may help distinguish between headache type; data on frequency, severity and duration of headache attacks is a necessary tool for initial and correct differential diagnosis in headache conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nps.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/160003/NPS_Headache_Diary_0612.pdf |format= PDF |title= Headache diary: helping you manage your headache |publisher= NPS.org.au |accessdate= 2014-01-02}}</ref>

Correct diagnosis of CH is a challenge for practitioners, and is especially problematic in hospital emergency departments, where staff are not trained in the diagnosis of rare or complex chronic disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Friedman BW, Grosberg BM |title=Diagnosis and management of the primary headache disorders in the emergency department setting |journal=Emerg.

Headaches that may be confused with CH include:
*[[Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania]] (CPH) is a unilateral headache condition, without the male predominance usually seen in CH. Paroxysmal hemicrania may also be episodic. CPH typically responds "absolutely" to treatment with the [[anti-inflammatory]] drug [[indomethacin]]<ref name=IHS/> where in most cases CH typically shows no positive indomethacin response, making "Indomethacin response" an important diagnostic tool for specialist practitioners seeking correct differential diagnosis between the conditions.{{mcn|date=January 2014}}

==Prevention==
Preventive treatments are used to reduce or eliminate cluster headache attacks; they are generally used in combination with abortive and transitional techniques.<ref name=Beck />

===Verapamil===
The recommended first-line preventative therapy is [[verapamil]], a [[calcium channel blocker]].<ref name=AFP2013/><ref name=EFNS>{{cite journal |author=May A, Leone M, Afra J, et al. |title=EFNS guidelines on the treatment of cluster headache and other trigeminal-autonomic cephalalgias |journal=Eur J Neurol |volume=13|issue=10 |pages=1066–77 |date=October 2006 |pmid= 16987158 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-1331.2006.01566.x|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307075912/http://www.efns.org/files/guideline_49.pdf}}</ref> Verapamil was previously underused in people with cluster headache.<ref name=Beck/>

===Steroids===

Treatment for cluster headache is divided into three primary categories: abortive, transitional, and preventative.<ref name=Nal2012>{{cite book|author=Nalini Vadivelu, Alan David Kaye, Jack M.

===Oxygen===
[[Oxygen therapy]] may help people with CH, but it does not help prevent future episodes.<ref name=AFP2013/> Typically it is given via a [[non-rebreather mask]] at 12-15 liters per minute for 15–20 minutes.<ref name=AFP2013/> Around 70% improve within 15 minutes.<ref name=EM2009/>

===Triptans===
The other primarily recommended treatment of acute attacks is subcutaneous or intranasal [[sumatriptan]].<ref name=EFNS/> [[Sumatriptan]] and [[zolmitriptan]] have both been shown to improve symptoms during an attack with sumatriptan being superior.<ref name=Law2013>{{cite journal|author=Law S, Derry S, Moore RA|title=Triptans for acute cluster headache|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Jul 17, 2013|volume=7|pages=CD008042|pmid=24353996|type= Review|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd008042.pub3}}</ref> Because of the vasoconstrictive action of triptans, they are contraindicated in people with [[ischemic heart disease]].<ref name=AFP2013/>

==History==
The first complete description of cluster headache was given by the London neurologist [[Wilfred Harris]] in 1926, who named the disease ''migrainous neuralgia''.<ref>Harris W.: Neuritis and Neuralgia. p. 307-12. Oxford: Oxford University Press 1926.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(59)90651-8 |title=The periodic migrainous neuralgia of Wilfred Harris |year=1959 |author=Bickerstaff  E |journal=The Lancet |volume=273 |issue=7082 |pages=1069–71 |pmid=13655672}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1468-2982.2002.00360.x |title=Wilfred Harris' early description of cluster headache |year=2002 |author=Boes CJ, Capobianco DJ, Matharu MS, Goadsby PJ |journal=Cephalalgia |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=320–6 |pmid=12100097}}</ref>  Descriptions of CH date to 1745 and probably earlier.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pearce JM |title=Gerardi van Swieten: descriptions of episodic cluster headache |journal=J.

The condition was originally named Horton's cephalalgia after B.T. Horton, a US neurologist who postulated the first theory as to their pathogenesis. His original paper describes the severity of the headaches as being able to take normal men and force them to attempt or complete suicide; his 1939 paper said:<blockquote>"Our patients were disabled by the disorder and suffered from bouts of pain from two to twenty times a week. They had found no relief from the usual methods of treatment. Their pain was so severe that several of them had to be constantly watched for fear of suicide. Most of them were willing to submit to any operation which might bring relief."<ref>{{cite journal |author= Horton BT, MacLean AR, Craig WMK |journal= Mayo Clinic Proc |year= 1939 |volume= 14 |page= 257 |title=  A new syndrome of vascular headache: results of treatment with histamine: preliminary report}}</ref></blockquote>

CH has alternately been called erythroprosopalgia of Bing, ciliary neuralgia, [[erythromelalgia]] of the head, Horton's headache, histaminic cephalalgia, petrosal neuralgia, sphenopalatine neuralgia, vidian neuralgia, Sluder's neuralgia, and hemicrania angioparalyticia.<ref>{{cite book |author= Silberstein SD, Lipton RB, Goadsby PJ |title= Headache in Clinical Practice |edition= Second |publisher= Taylor & Francis |year=  2002{{page needed|date=September 2013}}}}</ref>

== Society and culture ==
Robert Shapiro, a professor of neurology, says that while cluster headaches are about as common as [[multiple sclerosis]] with a similar disability level, as of 2013, the US [[National Institutes of Health]] had spent $1.872 billion on research into multiple sclerosis in one decade, but less than $2 million on CH research in 25 years.<ref name=Unlocking>{{cite news |url= http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/16/researcher-unlocking-mysteries-migraines/2165363/ |title= Researcher works to unlock mysteries of migraines |author= Johnson, Tim |work= USA Today |date= May 16, 2013 |accessdate= January 4, 2013}}</ref> Due to an occasional association with suicideal thoughts, cluster headaches have been colloquial named "suicide headaches."<ref name=Rob2013>{{cite journal|last1=Robbins|first1=MS|title=The psychiatric comorbidities of cluster headache.|journal=Current pain and headache reports|date=Feb 2013|volume=17|issue=2|pages=313|pmid=23296640}}</ref>

'''Arad''' ({{lang-he-n|?????}} <small>{{Audio|Arad.ogg|(audio)}}</small>; {{lang-ar|???????}}) is a city in the [[South District (Israel)|South District]] of [[Israel]]. It is located on the border of the [[Negev]] and [[Judean Desert]]s, 25 kilometers (15.5&nbsp;mi) west of the [[Dead Sea]] and 45&nbsp;km (28&nbsp;mi) east of [[Beersheba]]. The city is home to a diverse population of 23,400<ref name="cbs populations"/> including [[Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi]] [[Jews]], both secular and religious, [[Bedouins]] and [[Black Hebrew]]s, as well as new immigrants. The city is notable for its clean, dry air and serves as a major attraction to [[asthmatics]] worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kantor SZ, Frank M, Hoch-Kantor D, ''et al.''|title=Airborne allergens and clinical response of asthmatics in Arad, a new town in a desert area in Israel|journal=The Journal of Allergy|volume= 37|issue=2|pages=65–74|year=1966|pmid=5217164|doi=10.1016/0021-8707(66)90122-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Frank M, de Vries A|title=Further observation on the clinical response of asthmatic settlers in Arad, Israel|journal=The Journal of Allergy|volume= 40|issue=3|pages=182–183|year=1967|pmid=5231431|doi=10.1016/0021-8707(67)90007-X}}</ref>

After attempts to settle the area in the 1920s, Arad was founded in November 1962 as an Israeli [[development town]], the first planned city in Israel. Arad's population grew significantly with the [[Aliyah from the Commonwealth of Independent States in the 1990s]], and peaked in 2002 at 24,500 residents.

Landmarks in Arad include the ruins of [[Tel Arad]], Arad Park, a domestic airfield and Israel's first legal race circuit. The city is known for its annual summer music festival, The Arad Festival.<ref>{{cite news |author=Dafna Arad |date=3 August 2011 |title=Arad Festival returns to its rock roots |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/arad-festival-returns-to-its-rock-roots-1.376644 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref>

==History==

===Antiquity===
Arad is named after the Biblical [[Canaan]]ite town located at [[Tel Arad]] (a [[Biblical archaeology]] site famous for the discovery of [[ostracon|ostraca]]), which is located approximately {{convert|8|km|mi|1|sp=us}} west of modern Arad.<ref name="ariel"/> The Bible (Judges 1:16) describes it as a Canaanite stronghold whose king kept the [[Israelites]] from moving from the [[Negev]] to the [[Judean Mountains]], although Tel Arad was destroyed over 1,200 years before the arrival of the Israelites. However, [[Shoshenq I]]'s chronicles seem to mention a settlement in Tel Arad. During the [[Byzantine]] period, the location was still correctly identified by [[Eusebius]], and the name "Arad" was preserved by the Bedouins.<ref name="mapa"/>

===British Mandate era===
The first modern attempt to settle the area was made by the [[Yishuv]], the body of Jewish residents in [[Mandate Palestine|Mandatory Palestine]], on 23 February 1921, when the British Mandate government allowed discharged soldiers from the [[Jewish Legion]] to settle in the area. Nine men and two women attempted the task, but after four months were forced to leave because water was not found in the area.<ref name="ariel">{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Vilnai, Ze'ev|authorlink=Zev Vilnay|title=Arad|encyclopedia=Ariel Encyclopedia|volume=Volume 7|year=1979|pages=6002–6003|publisher=Am Oved|location=Israel|language=he}}</ref>

===State of Israel===
On 15 November 1960, a planning unit (and a full committee on 29 December) were appointed by the [[Israeli cabinet]] to examine the possibility of settlement in the northeastern [[Negev]] desert and the Arad area. An initial budget of 50,000 [[Israeli lira]]s was given to the project, which was to be under the leadership of [[Aryeh Eliav]]. On 31 January 1961, the final location of the new city was decided ({{convert|3.5|km|mi|1|sp=us}} southwest of Mount Kidod), as well as details about road and water connections. During March 1961, a full city plan for 10,000 and then 20,000 residents was conceived, along with a corresponding map. [[Yona Pitelson]] served as the chief architect of the city and was instrumental in its design.<ref name="museum">{{cite web |url=http://www.arad-museum.com/historyofarad.html |title=Arad – First Days – Preface|accessdate=2007-11-30|publisher=Arad Historical Museum |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070621032532/http://www.arad-museum.com/historyofarad.html |archivedate = 21 June 2007|language=he}}</ref>

Arad's plan took account of the area's topography and climate. Building blocks were constructed in a way that protected large inside areas from desert sun and winds.

'''''Les Misérables''''' is a 1952 American film adapted from the novel ''[[Les Misérables]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]].  It was directed by [[Lewis Milestone]], and featured [[Michael Rennie]] as Jean Valjean, [[Robert Newton]] as Javert, and [[Sylvia Sidney]] as Fantine.

* [[Michael Rennie]] as [[Jean Valjean]]
* [[Debra Paget]] as [[Cosette]]
* Patsy Weil as Cosette (age 7)
* [[Robert Newton]] as [[Javert]]

==Plot==
The film greatly differs from the novel. Entire episode are dropped as well as many characters, including the Thénardiers and Enjolras. The character of Robert is entirely new.

Valjean serves his time on an actual galley. On leaving the bishop's house, Valjean kneels on a fallen rose. This rose becomes for him the symbol of the bishop's forgiveness (it leads him to putting back some objects he intends to steal from a goldsmith).

When rescuing one if his townspeople as Mayor Madelaine, Valjean does not lift the cart but merely stops it. Javert's sets up the trial of an innocent man accused of being the escaped convict Valjean In order to trick Valjean into revealing himself.

Cosette sees her mother Fantine before Fantine dies. Valjean knocks Javert out before fleeing from the hospital. In the book, he accepts arrest and escapes from the city jail.

Marius and Cosette first meet at the convent when Marius is being chased by the police. Javert follows Valjean through the sewers. Valjean witnesses Javert's suicide, which ends the film.

'''Pictish''' is the [[extinct language]], or dialect, spoken by the [[Picts]], the people of northern and central [[Scotland]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. There is virtually no direct attestation of Pictish, short of a limited number of place names and names of people found on monuments and the contemporary records in the area controlled by the Kingdom of the Picts. However, evidence from [[toponymy|place names]] and [[Anthroponymy|personal names]] points to the language being closely related to the [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic language]] spoken prior to [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon settlement]] in what is now southern Scotland, England and Wales. A minority view held by a few scholars claims that Pictish was at least partially non-Indo-European or that a non-Indo-European and Brittonic language coexisted. Pictish was replaced by [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] in the latter centuries of the Pictish period.

==Language classification==
[[File:Columba at Bridei's fort.jpg|thumb|right|Picture by [[Henrietta Elizabeth Marshall|H. E. Marshall]] (1867–1941) depicting [[Columba]] preaching to [[Bridei I of the Picts|Bridei]], king of [[Fortriu]] in 565.]]
The existence of a distinct Pictish language during the Early Middle Ages is attested clearly in [[Bede]]'s early 8th century ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', which names Pictish as a language distinct from that spoken by the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]], the [[Scoti|Irish]], and the [[Anglo-Saxons|English]].<ref name="Bede">{{harvnb|Bede}} HE I.1; references to Pictish also at several other points in that text.</ref> Bede states that [[Columba]], a [[Gaels|Gael]], used an interpreter during his mission to the Picts. A number of competing theories have been advanced regarding the nature of the Pictish language: 
* Pictish was an [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic language]] allied to the [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|P-Celtic]] (Brittonic) languages ([[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]])
* Pictish was an Insular Celtic language allied to the [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|Q-Celtic]] (Goidelic) languages ([[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]])
* Pictish was a Germanic language allied to [[Old English]], the predecessor to the [[Scots language]]
* Pictish was a [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indo-European language]], a relic of the [[Bronze Age]]

Most scholars agree that Pictish was a branch of the Brittonic language, while a few scholars merely accept that it was related to the Brittonic language. Pictish came under increasing pressure and influence from [[Old Irish]] spoken in [[Dál Riata]] from the 5th century until its eventual replacement.<ref>{{harvnb|Forsyth|2006|p=1447}}; {{harvnb|Forsyth|1997}}; {{harvnb|Fraser|2009|pp=52–53}}; {{harvnb|Woolf|2007|pp=322–340}}</ref>

Pictish is thought to have influenced the development of modern Scottish Gaelic. This is perhaps most obvious in the contribution of loan words, but more importantly it is thought that Pictish influenced the syntax of Scottish Gaelic, which bears greater similarity to Brittonic languages than does Irish.<ref>{{harvnb|Forsyth|2006|p=1447}}; {{harvnb|Woolf|2007|pp=322–340}}</ref>

===Position within Celtic===
The evidence of [[toponymy|place names]] and [[Anthroponymy|personal names]] demonstrates that an [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic language]] related to the more southerly [[Brittonic languages]] was formerly spoken in the Pictish area.<ref>{{harvnb|Watson|1926}}; {{harvnb|Jackson|1955}}; {{harvnb|Koch|1983}}; {{harvnb|Smyth|1984}}; {{harvnb|Forsyth|1997}}; {{harvnb|Price|2000}}; {{harvnb|Forsyth|2006}}; {{harvnb|Woolf|2007}}; {{harvnb|Fraser|2009}}</ref> The view of Pictish as a [[P-Celtic]] language was first proposed in 1582 by [[George Buchanan (humanist)|George Buchanan]], who aligned the language with [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]].<ref>All other research into Pictish has been described as a postscript to Buchanan's work. This view may be something of an oversimplification: {{harvnb|Forsyth|1997}} offers a short account of the debate; {{harvnb|Cowan|2000}} may be helpful for a broader view.</ref> A compatible view was advanced by antiquarian [[George Chalmers (antiquarian)|George Chalmers]] in the early 19th century. Chalmers considered that Pictish and [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] were one and the same, basing his argument on P-Celtic orthography in the Pictish king lists and in place names predominant in historically Pictish areas.<ref>{{harvnb|Chalmers|1807|pp=198–224}}</ref>

[[File:Calgacus.JPG|left|thumb|Personal names of Roman-era chieftains from the Pictish area, including [[Calgacus]] (above) have a Celtic origin.<ref>Calgacus ('swordsman') was recorded by [[Tacitus]] in his [[Agricola (book)|''Agricola'']]. Another example is ''Argentocoxus'' ('steel leg'), recorded by [[Cassius Dio]]. See: {{harvnb|Forsyth|2006}}</ref>]]
Celtic scholar [[Whitley Stokes (scholar)|Whitley Stokes]], in a philological study of the [[Irish annals]], concluded that Pictish was closely related to Welsh.<ref>{{harvnb|Stokes|1890|p=392}}</ref> This conclusion was supported by philologist [[Alexander MacBain]]'s analysis of the place and tribe names in Ptolemy's 2nd century [[Geographia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Macbain|1892}}</ref> Toponymist [[William J. Watson|William Watson's]] exhaustive review of Scottish place names demonstrated convincingly the existence of a dominant P-Celtic language in historically Pictish areas, concluding that the Pictish language was a Northern extension of British and that Gaelic was a later introduction from Ireland.<ref name="Watson 1926">{{harvnb|Watson|1926}}</ref>

[[William Forbes Skene]] argued in 1837 that Pictish was a Goidelic language, the ancestor of modern [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]].<ref>{{harvnb|Skene|1837|pp=67–87}}; {{harvnb|Fraser|1923}}</ref> He suggested that Columba's use of an interpreter reflected his preaching to the Picts in [[Latin]], rather than any difference between the Irish and Pictish languages.<ref>{{harvnb|Skene|1837|pp=71–72}}</ref> This view, involving independent settlement of Ireland and Scotland by Goedelic people, obviated an Irish influence in the development of Gaelic Scotland and enjoyed wide popular acceptance in 19th century Scotland, but is no longer given credence.<ref>{{harvnb|Jackson|1955|p=131}}; {{harvnb|Forsyth|1997|p=6}}</ref>

While Skene's notion of an exclusively Q-Celtic Pictish language has long been rejected, the Picts were under increasing political, social and linguistic pressure from Dál Riata from around the 5th century. The Picts were steadily [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]] through the latter centuries of the Pictish Kingdom, and by the time of the merging of the Pictish and Dál Riatan kingdoms, the Picts were essentially a Gaelic-speaking people.<ref>{{harvnb|Forsyth|2006|p=1447}}</ref> [[Katherine Forsyth|Forsyth]] speculates that a period of bilingualism may have outlasted the Pictish kingdom in peripheral areas by several generations.<ref>{{harvnb|Forsyth|1995a}}</ref> [[Scottish Gaelic]], unlike [[Irish language|Irish]] (and, for that matter, [[Old Irish]]) maintains a substantial corpus of Brittonic loan-words and, moreover, uses a verbal system modelled on the same pattern as [[Welsh language|Welsh]].<ref>{{harvnb|Greene|1966|p=135}}</ref>
{{clear}}

===Pre-Indo-European theory===
[[File:Brandsbutt stone.jpg|right|thumb|Difficulties in translation of [[Ogham]] inscriptions, like those found on the [[Brandsbutt Stone]], led to a widely held belief that Pictish was a non-Indo-European language]]
[[John Rhys]], in 1892, proposed that Pictish was a non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language. This opinion was based on the apparently unintelligible [[ogham inscription]]s found in historically Pictish areas.<ref>{{harvnb|Rhys|1892}}; {{harvnb|Rhys|1898}}</ref> A similar position was taken by [[Heinrich Zimmer (Celticist)|Heinrich Zimmer]], who argued that the Picts' supposedly exotic cultural practices (tattooing and matriliny) were equally non-Indo-European,<ref>{{harvnb|Zimmer|1898}}; see {{harvnb|Woolf|1998}} for a more current view of Pictish matriliny</ref> and a Pre-Indo-European model was maintained by some well into the 20th century.<ref>For example: {{harvnb|MacNeil|1938-1939}}; {{harvnb|MacAlister|1940}}</ref>

A modified version of this theory was advanced in an influential 1955 review of Pictish by [[Kenneth H. Jackson|Kenneth Jackson]]. Jackson proposed a two-language model: while Pictish was undoubtedly P-Celtic, it may have had a non-Celtic substratum and a second language may have been used for inscriptions.<ref>{{harvnb|Jackson|1955}}</ref> Jackson's hypothesis was framed in the then-current model that a Brittonic elite, identified as the [[Broch]]-builders, had migrated from the south of Britain into Pictish territory, dominating a pre-Celtic majority.<ref>See, for example, {{harvnb|Piggot|1955}}</ref> He used this to reconcile the perceived translational difficulties of [[Ogham]] with the overwhelming evidence for a P-Celtic Pictish language. Jackson was content to write off Ogham inscriptions as inherently unintelligible.<ref>For a general view, see {{harvnb|Jackson|1955}}</ref>

Jackson's model became the orthodox position for the latter half of the 20th century. However, it has become progressively undermined by advances in understanding of late Iron Age archaeology, as well as by improved understanding of the enigmatic Ogham inscriptions, a number of which have since been interpreted as Celtic.<ref>See {{harvnb|Armit|1990}} for an up-to-date view of the development of proto-Pictish culture and Brochs as an indigenous development; {{harvnb|Forsyth|1998}} gives a general review of the advances in understanding of Ogham.</ref>

Despite this, [[Eric P. Hamp]] in his 2012 Indo-European family tree, classified Pictish as a non-Indo-European language.<ref>{{harvnb|Hamp|2013}}</ref> 
{{clear}}

===Discredited theories===
Traditional accounts (now rejected) claimed that the Picts had migrated to Scotland from [[Scythia]], a region that encompassed Eastern Europe and Central Asia.<ref>See for example {{harvnb|Bede}} HE I:1; {{harvnb|Forsyth|2006}} suggests this tradition originated from a misreading of {{harvnb|Servius}}' fifth century AD commentary on {{harvnb|Virgil}}'s Aeneid:<br>Aeneid 4:146 reads: ''Cretesque Dryopesque fremunt pictique Agathyrsi''.<br>Servius' commentary states: ''Pictique Agathyrsi populi sunt Scythiae, colentes Apollinem hyperboreum, cuius logia, id est responsa, feruntur. 'Picti' autem, non stigmata habentes, sicut gens in Britannia, sed pulchri, hoc est cyanea coma placentes.'' Which actually states that the Scythian [[Agathyrsi]] did ''not'' "bear marks" like the British, but had blue hair.</ref> Buchanan, looking for a Scythian P-Celtic candidate for the ancestral Pict, settled on the Gaulish-speaking [[Cotini]] (which he rendered as ''Gothuni''), a tribe from the region that is now modern-day [[Slovakia]]. This was later misunderstood by [[Robert Sibbald]] in 1710, who equated ''Gothuni'' with the Germanic-speaking ''[[Goth]]s''.<ref>{{harvnb|Sibbald|1710}}</ref> [[John Pinkerton]] expanded on this in 1789, claiming that Pictish was the predecessor to [[Scots language|Modern Scots]].<ref>{{harvnb|Pinkerton|1789}}</ref> Pinkerton's arguments were often rambling, bizarre and clearly motivated by his belief that Celts were an inferior people. The theory of a Germanic Pictish language is no longer considered credible.<ref>For a discussion of Sibbald's misunderstanding and of Pinkerton's thesis, see {{harvnb|Ferguson|1991}}</ref>

'''''Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta'', Sz. 106, BB 114''' is one of the best-known [[Musical composition|compositions]] by the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[composer]] [[Béla Bartók]]. Commissioned by [[Paul Sacher]] to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the chamber orchestra ''Basler Kammerorchester'', the score is dated September 7, 1936. The work was premiered in [[Basel]], Switzerland on January&nbsp;21, 1937 by the chamber orchestra conducted by Sacher, and it was published the same year by [[Universal Edition]].

==Analysis==
As its title suggests, the piece is written for [[string instrument]]s ([[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, [[double bass]]es, and [[harp]]), [[percussion instrument]]s ([[xylophone]], [[snare drum]], [[cymbal]]s, [[tam-tam]], [[bass drum]], and [[timpani]]) and [[celesta]]. The ensemble also includes a [[piano]], which may be classified as either a percussion or string instrument (the celesta player also plays piano during 4-hand passages). Bartók divides the strings into two groups which he directs should be placed [[Antiphon|antiphonally]] on opposite sides of the stage, and he makes use of antiphonal effects particularly in the second and fourth movements.

The piece is in four movements, the first and third slow, the second and fourth quick. All movements are written without [[key signature]]:

# ''Andante tranquillo''
# ''Allegro''
# ''Adagio''
# ''Allegro molto''

The first movement is a slow [[fugue]]. Its [[time signature]] changes constantly. It is based around the note A, on which the movement begins and ends. It begins on [[mute (music)|muted]] strings, and as more voices enter, the texture thickens and the music becomes louder until the climax on Eb, a [[tritone]] away from A. Mutes are then removed, and the music becomes gradually quieter over gentle celesta [[arpeggio]]s. The movement ends with the second phrase of the fugue subject played softly over its inversion. Material from the first movement can be seen as serving as the basis for the later movements, and the fugue subject recurs in different guises at points throughout the piece.

The second movement is quick, with a theme in 2/4 time which is transformed into 3/8 time towards the end. It is marked with loud syncopic piano and percussion accents in a whirling dance, evolving in an extended [[pizzicato]] section, with a piano concerto-like conclusion.

The third movement is slow, an example of what is often called Bartók's [[Night music (Bartók)|"Night music"]]. It features timpani [[glissandi]], which was an unusual technique at the time of the work's composition, as well as a prominent part for the xylophone. It is also commonly thought that the rhythm of the xylophone solo that opens the third movement is based on the [[Fibonacci sequence]] as this "written-out [[Tempo#Terms for change in tempo|accelerando]]/[[ritardando]]" uses the rhythm 1:2:3:5:8:5:3:2:1.

The last movement, which begins with notes on the timpani and strummed [[pizzicato]] chords on the strings, has the character of a lively folk dance.

==Popular culture==
The popularity of the ''Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta'' is demonstrated by the use of themes from this work in films and popular music. The second movement of this work accompanies "Craig's Dance of Despair and Disillusionment" from the film ''[[Being John Malkovich]]''. The Adagio movement was used as the theme music for ''[[The Vampira Show]]'' (1954–1955), and it was also featured in the [[Stanley Kubrick]] film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''. It also was the soundtrack for the 1978 Australian film ''[[Money Movers]]''. Also the ''Music'' is sampled by [[Ant (producer)|Anthony "Ant" Davis]] from the underground [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]], from [[Minneapolis]], on the song "Aspiring Sociopath" of their album ''[[Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EPs|Lucy Ford]]''. The architect [[Steven Holl]] used the overlapping strettos that occur in this piece as a parallel on which the form of the Stretto House (1989) in Dallas, Texas was made.

The novel "City of Night" (1962) by John Rechy makes reference to "Music for Strings Percussion & Celesta" (p.&nbsp;145, passim), a work which haunts the main character.

Much of the music from this collection, along with "[[The Miraculous Mandarin]]", can be heard as underscore for two "[[Doctor Who]]" stories: 1967's "[[The Enemy of the World]]" and 1968's "[[The Web of Fear]]".

==Discography==
The first recording of the work was made in 1949 by the Los Angeles Chamber Symphony under [[Harold Byrns]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpanda.org/pdfs/csob/2001.pdf |title=Central Opera Service Bulletin |format=PDF |date=Winter 1977–78 |accessdate=2010-07-17}}</ref> which until 1952 was still being described as the best version.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,822142,00.html?promoid=googlep |title=Music: New Records, Feb. 18, 1952 : |publisher=TIME |date=1952-02-18 |accessdate=2010-07-17}}</ref>

[[File:Spathoglottis flwrs.jpg|thumb|250px|Flowers and developing fruit capsules of the ground orchid ''[[Spathoglottis plicata]]'']]

In [[botany]] a '''capsule''' is a type of simple, dry [[fruit]] produced by many species of [[flowering plant]]s.  A capsule is a structure composed of two or more [[carpel]]s. In Angiosperms (flowering plants), the term [[locule]] is used to refer to a chamber within the [[fruit]]. Depending on the number of locules in the ovary, fruit can be classified as '''uni-locular''' (unilocular), '''bi-locular''', '''tri-locular''' or '''multi-locular'''. The number of locules present in a gynoecium may be equal to or less than the number of carpels. The locules contain the [[ovule]]s or [[seed]]s.

In most cases the capsule is [[Dehiscence (botany)|dehiscent]], i.e. at maturity, it splits apart (dehisces) to release the [[seed]]s within. A few capsules are indehiscent, for example those of ''[[Adansonia digitata]]'', ''[[Alphitonia]]'', and ''[[Merciera]]''. In some capsules, the split occurs between carpels, and in others each carpel splits open. Where a capsule splits into distinguishable parts, these are called '''valves'''; the borders of the valves may or may not coincide with the borders of carpels.

If the split occurs along junctions between carpels (i.e. along the [[Septum |septa]]) with the valves remaining in place, the capsule is described as '''septicidal'''. By contrast when it splits into [[cells]] (i.e. not at the septa) along the midrib or dorsal suture of the [[locule|locules]]s, it is described as '''loculicidal'''. The latter is common among many members of the [[Liliaceae]].

In yet other forms of capsule, such as those of [[poppy|poppies]], seeds are released through openings or pores that form in the capsule. If it is the upper part of the capsule that dehisces, the capsule is also called a '''pyxis'''. For example, in the [[Brazil nut]], a lid on the capsule opens, but is too small to release the dozen or so seeds (the actual "Brazil nut" of commerce) within. These germinate inside the capsule after it falls to the ground.

Capsules are sometimes mislabeled as [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], as in the example of the [[Brazil nut]] or the [[Aesculus|Horse-chestnut]].  A capsule is not a nut because it releases its seeds and it splits apart.  Nuts on the other hand do not release seeds as they are a compound [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] containing both a single seed and the fruit.  Nuts also do not split.

Examples of plants that produce capsules are [[nigella]], [[Papaveraceae|poppy]], [[lily]], [[orchid]], [[willow]], [[cotton]], and [[jimson weed]].

==Biography==
Sacher studied under [[Felix Weingartner]], among others. In 1926 he founded the chamber orchestra ''Basler Kammerorchester'', which specialized in both modern (twentieth-century) and pre-classical (mid-eighteenth-century) repertory. Immensely wealthy, he commissioned works from many well-known composers, including [[Igor Stravinsky]] (who provided him with the [[Concerto in D (Stravinsky)|Concerto in D]]), [[Béla Bartók]] ([[Divertimento for String Orchestra (Bartok)|''Divertimento for Strings'']], the ''[[Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion]]'', the [[String Quartet No. 6 (Bartók)|String Quartet No. 6]] and the ''[[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]]''), [[Bohuslav Martin?]] (many works including the [[Double Concerto for Two String Orchestras, Piano, and Timpani]], Concerto da camera etc.),  [[Arthur Honegger]] (many works, including his Second and  Fourth Symphonies (''Deliciae Basilienses''), [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]] (six works, including the ''Petite Symphonie Concertante''), [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Hans Werner Henze]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Elliott Carter]], [[Witold Lutos?awski]] (Sacher Variation, Double Concerto, Chain 2, etc.), [[Henri Dutilleux]] (''3 Strophes sur le Nom de Sacher'' and ''Mystère de l'Instant'') and [[Harrison Birtwistle]]. 

[[Pierre Boulez]] wrote his [[Grawemeyer Award]]-winning work ''[[Incises|Sur Incises]]'' for Sacher's 90th birthday.  Boulez bequeathed his entire catalogue (including drafts) to the Paul Sacher Foundation.  Henze dedicated his [[Symphony No. 10 (Henze)|Tenth Symphony]] to Sacher's memory, who had commissioned it but died before its completion.

In 1983, Sacher acquired the Stravinsky estate.<ref>[http://www.paul-sacher-stiftung.ch/e/foundation/the%20founder.htm "The Founder"]: Chronology, ''Paul Sacher Foundation''.</ref>  The '''Paul Sacher Stiftung''' (Foundation) is located in the center of Basel (in Münsterplatz) and houses one of the world's most important musical-manuscript collections.  Sacher bought most of these manuscripts himself, and they include complete collections by several important twentieth-century composers (including Lutos?awski, [[Ligeti]] and Boulez). In 1997, he received an honorary doctorate from the [[Academy of Music in Kraków]].<ref>[http://www.amuz.krakow.pl/en/3/25/83/Dr-Paul-Sacher-1997]</ref>

He was considered the world's third-richest man of the 1990s after marrying the heiress of the [[pharmaceutical]] company [[Hoffmann–La Roche]].  At the time of his death, he was reputed in various publications to be the richest man in Europe.  He died in 1999, aged 93.

Perhaps his finest recorded performance was preserved on mid-1950s late mono Columbia LP, [[Johann Christian Bach]]'s Symphony in D major, Op. 18, No. 4, distinguished by its overall serenity, stylishness and smooth flow but also by his taking BOTH repeats (including the second long one, apparently never since taken in later recordings) of the rondo finale quintessentially representative of Johann Christian's serene melding of pre-classical galant (in the opening and closing rondo theme) and sensitive styles (in the canonic middle episode in D minor).

On the occasion of Sacher's 70th birthday, twelve composer-friends of his ([[Conrad Beck]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Henri Dutilleux]], [[Wolfgang Fortner]], [[Alberto Ginastera]], [[Cristóbal Halffter]], [[Hans Werner Henze]], [[Heinz Holliger]], [[Klaus Huber]] and [[Witold Lutos?awski]]) were asked by Russian cellist [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] to write compositions for cello solo using his name spelled out in musical notes ([[musical cryptogram]]) as the [[theme (music)|theme]] (eS, A, C, H, E, Re). Many of them were performed in a Zurich concert on 2 May 1976. The whole "eSACHERe" project was performed in its entirety for the first time by Czech cellist [[František Brikcius]] on 9 May 2011 in Prague.<ref>[http://www.mfiles.co.uk/reviews/eSACHERe-premiere-cellist-Frantisek-Brikcius.htm  mfiles].

'''John Franklin Broyles''' (born December 26, 1924) is a former [[American football]] player and coach, athletics administrator, and broadcaster.  He served as the head football coach at the [[University of Missouri]] in 1957 and at the [[University of Arkansas]] from 1958 to 1976.  Broyles also was Arkansas' [[athletic director]] from 1974 until his retirement on December 31, 2007.<ref name="resign">{{cite news|work=USA Today|title=Arkansas AD Frank Broyles will resign at end of year|date=2007-02-18|accessdate=2007-03-22|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2007-02-17-broyles-resignation_x.htm}}</ref>

As a head football coach, Broyles compiled a record of 149&ndash;62&ndash;6.  His mark of 144&ndash;58&ndash;5 in 19 seasons constitutes the record number of wins by a coach in [[Arkansas Razorbacks football]] history.  With Arkansas, Broyles won seven [[Southwest Conference]] titles and his [[1964 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|1964 team]] was named a [[NCAA Division I FBS national football championship|national champion]] by a number of selectors including the [[Football Writers Association of America]].  He was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1983.

==Playing career==
After his graduation from [[Decatur High School (Georgia)|Decatur Boys High School]], Broyles studied at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], where he was a [[quarterback]] from 1944 to 1946. He graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in Industrial Management. He led the Georgia Tech football team to four bowl appearances. He was named [[Southeastern Conference]] Player of the Year in 1944. Until [[Michigan Wolverines|Michigan]] quarterback [[Tom Brady]] broke his record in 2000, Broyles held the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] record for most passing yards in a game and is a member of the Orange Bowl, [[Gator Bowl]], and [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] Halls of Fame and the Georgia Tech Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frank Broyles|url=http://www.hognation.net/broyles.html|work=Hog Nation|publisher=Hog Nation|accessdate=15 February 2013}}</ref> Broyles was later drafted by the [[Chicago Bears]] in the third round of the [[1946 NFL Draft]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/These-Bears-draft-picks-gained-fame-in-other-areas/ec6dca7b-ad41-43ac-839c-e61e0197ecc9|title=These Bears draft picks gained fame in other areas|publisher=[[Chicago Bears]]|date=25 April 2013|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>

==Coaching career==
Broyles entered coaching in 1947 as an assistant coach under head coach [[Bob Woodruff (American football)|Bob Woodruff]] at [[Baylor University]]. In 1950 Broyles followed Woodruff when the latter took the head coach position at the [[University of Florida]].  In 1951 he left Florida and returned to Georgia Tech as an [[offensive coordinator]] under coach [[Bobby Dodd]]. Broyles sought the head coaching position at [[Northwestern University]] in 1954,<ref name="Northwestern">{{cite web|url = http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/northwestern/summer2002/features/coverstory/index.htm| title = Keeping the Faith|publisher = Northwestern|accessdate = 2007-07-20}}</ref> and ultimately left Georgia Tech in 1957 when he was offered the position of head coach at the [[University of Missouri]]. Broyles stayed at Missouri only one season when he was offered the head coaching job at Arkansas. During his many decades there he was offered other major coaching and leadership positions, but remained at Arkansas.

During his tenure at [[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]] Broyles coached the Razorbacks to seven [[Southwest Conference]] championships and two [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] wins.  His 1964 team was proclaimed national champions by the [[Football Writers Association of America]], and to date is the last Razorback team to go undefeated and untied in a season. He still holds the record for most wins by a head coach in the history of Arkansas football. During the 1960s and 1970s one of college football's most intense rivalries was between Broyles' Razorbacks and the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] [[Texas Longhorns football|Longhorns]] under legendary coach [[Darrell Royal]].

==Broadcasting career==
After his retirement from coaching, but concurrent with the early part of his tenure as [[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]] Athletic Director, Broyles served as the primary [[color commentator]] for [[ABC Sports]] television coverage of College Football, normally alongside top play-by-play man [[Keith Jackson]].  Broyles' time as a broadcaster at [[ABC Sports|ABC]] lasted from 1977 to 1985.  Broyles was often assigned games involving [[Southeastern Conference]] or [[Southwest Conference]] teams, but if the primary game of a particular week involved the [[Arkansas Razorbacks]], Broyles was paired with another play-by-play man, many times [[Al Michaels]] or [[Chris Schenkel]], while [[Keith Jackson|Jackson]] called the game with another color commentator, many times [[Ara Parseghian]].  Broyles' commentary was normally focused on play calling and coaching strategy, and while paired with [[Keith Jackson|Jackson]], resulted in an all-Georgian booth at [[ABC Sports|ABC]].

==Athletic director==
In 1974 Broyles was appointed Men's [[Athletic Director]] of the University of Arkansas. (Arkansas had a [[Arkansas Ladybacks|completely separate women's athletics department]] from 1971 until the men's and women's programs were merged in 2008.) Broyles continued as head football coach for three years. Since stepping down as head coach, the University of Arkansas men's athletic programs, under his leadership as athletic director, have won 43 national championships. The Razorbacks have won 57 [[Southwest Conference]] championships and 47 [[Southeastern Conference]] championships while he has been men's athletic director. As athletic Director of Arkansas Broyles cancelled the men's swimming and diving program to satisfy new regulations from the SEC of having two more women's sports than men's sports. 

On February 17, 2007, Broyles announced his plans to retire as Men's Athletic Director at the [[University of Arkansas]], effective December 31, 2007, which ended the 50 years of association with the Arkansas athletic programs as either head football coach or men's athletic director.<ref name="resign"/>

==Criticism==
Broyles was known for being very hands-on with the football program.  Indeed, at least one head coach, [[Ken Hatfield]], left the school because he couldn't abide Broyles' meddling.  After Hatfield left, at least one booster doubted whether the Razorbacks would ever attract a top-tier head coach as long as Broyles was athletic director.<ref>Murphy, Austin. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1004245/index.htm Not exactly Hog Heaven]. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 1992-09-21.</ref>

In 2000, following an expansion of Razorback Stadium, Broyles announced that one home game would move from War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock to Fayetteville, and that, in the near future, all home games might be played on campus. This move, known in Arkansas as the "Great Stadium Debate," drew heavy fire from the politicians in Little Rock, as well as businessmen and Razorback boosters Warren Stephens (Stephens, Inc.) and Joe Ford (CEO of Alltel). Broyles held meetings in Little Rock to try to persuade his case, and the University Board of Trustees even took student responses to the Great Stadium Debate on the Fayetteville campus. In the end, a long term agreement was reached to keep 2-3 games in Little Rock, while the rest would be played in Fayetteville.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://littlerock.about.com/library/weekly/aa021500a.htm/
| date = February 15, 2000|title= Were We Robbed of the Razorbacks?:UA announces that more games will be played in Fayetteville}}</ref>

Broyles' relationship with Ted Herrod, a wealthy booster in Dallas, came under fire after Herrod was accused of overcompensating Razorback athletes who worked part-time jobs at his trucking company.  A lengthy NCAA investigation followed, and the University was placed on probation by the NCAA.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DD123CF937A15751C1A9649C8B63&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fU%2fUniversity%20of%20Arkansas/

==Legacy==
[[File:Frank Broyles, Vic Snyder and Mike Ross.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Broyles (center) with Reps. [[Vic Snyder]] (left) and [[Mike Ross (politician)|Mike Ross]] (right)]]
Over thirty of his former players have also become college or professional football coaches. Broyles is known for producing high quality coaches and the prestigious ''Broyles Award'', the annual award for best assistant coach, is named after him.  [[Barry Switzer]], [[Johnny Majors]], [[Joe Gibbs]], [[Hayden Fry]], and [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] all served under Broyles and have combined to win five collegiate national championships and six [[Super Bowl]]s.  Broyles' assistants have won more than 40 conference titles.

Broyles' tenure as men's athletic director has seen the construction of world-class facilities for basketball, football, track and field (indoor and outdoor), golf, and baseball at Arkansas.  Broyles was selected as the 20th century's most influential Arkansas sports figure. Broyles will be remembered as the only SEC athletic director that had to drop a men's sport bringing into questions the health of the athletic department under his leadership. 

Broyles is known as a fierce competitor both as a head coach and athletic director. Broyles led Arkansas out of the Southwest Conference and into the Southeastern Conference.

In 1983 Broyles was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]], and in 1996, the [[Broyles Award]] was established to recognize the top [[assistant coach]]es in college football. He is a member of the [[Augusta National Golf Club]].<ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/golf/masters/2002-09-27-augusta-list.htm Augusta National Golf Club members list], ''[[USA Today]]''</ref>
