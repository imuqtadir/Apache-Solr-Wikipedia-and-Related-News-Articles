'''Raúl “El Gordo” De Molina''' (born March 29, 1959 in [[Cuba]]) is the multiple Emmy award winning co-host of [[Univision]] Networks #1 rated entertainment news show ''[[El Gordo y la Flaca]]''.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/raul-de-molina/paquita-from-the-hood_b_527377.html</ref>

==Biography==
Raúl De Molina was born in Cuba but left at the age of 10. For the following years he grew up in Madrid, Spain and eventually arrived in the United States at the age of 16.

After graduating from the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale, Raúl worked for the Associated Press as a freelance photographer during the 1980s.

His photographs have been published in Time, Life, Newsweek, and Paris Match among others. For the past 21 years he has been anchoring television shows, first for Telemundo and now for Univision.

A well-known television personality among Hispanics in the USA, Raúl can be seen every weekday at 4pm EST as the host of Univision’s “El Gordo y la Flaca”, a show he has co-hosted with [[Lili Estefan]] since 1998.
De Molina’s popularity is demonstrated by the show’s consistently high ratings. It has more viewers on its time slot than ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX combined.<ref>http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/univision-track-becoming-top-us-32448</ref>

The '''Penguin''' ('''Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] who appears in [[comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. He is known as one of [[Batman]]'s oldest and most persistent enemies. Artist [[Bob Kane]] and writer [[Bill Finger]] introduced him in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #58 (December 1941). The Penguin is a short, round man known for his love of [[bird]]s and his specialized high-tech umbrellas. A [[mobster]] and thief, he fancies himself as being a "gentleman of crime;" his nightclub business provides a cover for criminal activity, which Batman sometimes uses as a source of criminal underworld information. According to Kane the character was inspired from the then advertising mascot of [[Kool (cigarette)|Kool]] cigarettes&nbsp;&ndash; a [[penguin]] with a top hat and cane. Finger thought the image of high-society gentlemen in tuxedos was reminiscent of [[Emperor Penguin|emperor penguins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics101.com/comics101//?mode=project&action=view&project=Comics%20101&chapter=67|title=The Enemies List|publisher=Comics 101|date=January 14, 2004|accessdate=December 25, 2010}}</ref>

[[Burgess Meredith]] portrayed the Penguin in the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' television series]] and its movie. [[Danny DeVito]] played a darker, more grotesque version in the 1992 film ''[[Batman Returns]].'' Subsequent ''Batman'' [[animated series]] featured him in depictions that alternated between deformed outcast and high-profile aristocrat. The former interpretation appeared in comics, most notably in the miniseries ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'' and its sequel ''[[Batman: Dark Victory|Dark Victory]].'' He made a cameo appearance at the end of the ''Long Halloween'' with no lines. He had a slightly more notable role in ''Dark Victory''&nbsp;&ndash; this incarnation included elements of Meredith's interpretation. Paradoxically, the Penguin has repeatedly been named among the worst<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldstein|first=Hilary|url=http://au.comics.ign.com/articles/622/622304p1.html|title=IGN Best and Worst Batman villains|publisher=Au.comics.ign.com|date=June 3, 2005|accessdate=December 25, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-lamest-batman-villains.php|title=Top Tenz Lamest Batman villains|publisher=Toptenz.net|accessdate=December 25, 2010}}</ref> and best<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.premiere.com/gallery.aspx?section_id=66&webtrends_section=best&article_id=4654&window_id=2&gallery_id=559&page_number=1&seq=4&slide=off&cnt=6 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081210130654/http://www.premiere.com/gallery.aspx?section_id=66&webtrends_section=best&article_id=4654&window_id=2&gallery_id=559&page_number=1&seq=4&slide=off&cnt=6|archivedate=2008-12-10|title=Premiere Best and Worst Batman villains|publisher=Web.archive.org|date=2008-12-10|accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref><ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/51.html Penguin is number 51], [[IGN]].</ref> of Batman's villains.

Unlike most of Batman's rogues gallery, the Penguin is in control of his actions and perfectly [[sanity|sane]], features that help him maintain a unique relationship with the crime-fighter. His latest characterization has him running a [[Iceberg Lounge|nightclub and casino]] that is popular with the underworld. Batman comes to tolerate his operations so long as the Penguin remains one of his informants. The entrepreneurial Penguin often [[Fence (criminal)|fences]] stolen property or arranges early prison furloughs&nbsp;&ndash; for a hefty fee, of course.

==Fictional character biography==
Born '''Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot''',<ref>In the television series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', his heavily-accented mother's name is Gertrud Kapelput, implying an immigrant background.</ref> the Penguin was [[bullying|bullied]] as a child for his short stature, weight, and beak-like nose. In some media, his fingers are fused, resulting in [[flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]-like hands. Several stories relate that he was forced as a child to always carry an umbrella by his overprotective mother due to his father's death from [[pneumonia]] after a drenching. His mother owns pet birds that Cobblepot lavishes with attention, and served as his only friends growing up. His love for birds would eventually lead him to obtaining an [[Ornithology]] major in college. In some versions, Cobblepot turns to crime after his mother dies and the birds are repossessed to pay his mother's debts; in others, he is an outcast in his high society family and their rejection drives him to become a criminal. In keeping with his origins, the Penguin pursues his criminal career with class. He prefers [[formal wear]] such as a [[top hat]], [[monocle]], and [[tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedo]] while he steals.

The Penguin's alias first came from a childhood taunt over his grotesque appearance and love of [[bird]]s.<ref>The Penguin's origin was first revealed in the digest publication ''Best of DC Blue Ribbon Digest'' #10 (March 1981), almost 40 years after the character was introduced.</ref> In an early account, when Cobblepot first attempted to join a gang, he was belittled as a "penguin" and mocked for his umbrella before being literally kicked from the crime den. Outraged at the rejection, he resolved to make "the Penguin" a name to fear and the umbrella a fearsome weapon. He returned to the den and killed the crime boss with "the world's first .45 caliber umbrella," then claimed leadership of the now-terrified criminals. Some later stories suggest that he tried to abandon the nickname, which he initially hated but came to accept.

===Pre-''Crisis''===
Originally known only by his alias, the Penguin first appeared in Gotham City as a skilled thief, sneaking a priceless painting out of the museum by hiding the rolled-up canvas in the handle of his umbrella. The Penguin later used the canvas as proof of his intellect to a local mob, which he was then allowed to join. With the Penguin's help, the mob pulled off a string of ingenious heists, but the mob's leader and the "be-monocled bird" eventually fell out, leading Cobblepot to kill him with his umbrella gun. The Penguin became leader of the mob and attempted to neutralize Batman by framing him for theft. The Penguin's plans were eventually thwarted, but the bandit himself escaped.<ref>''Detective Comics''#58</ref>

The Penguin was a persistent nemesis for the Dynamic Duo ([[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]) throughout the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden]] and [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Ages]], pulling off ploy after ploy, such as teaming up with [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]],<ref>''Batman #25''</ref> attempting to extort money from a shipping company by pretending to flash-freeze a member of its board of directors,<ref>''Detective Comics'' #99</ref> and participating in [[Hugo Strange|Hugo Strange's]] auction of Batman's secret identity.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #472</ref>

The Penguin made his last appearance, fittingly, during the last appearance of the [[Earth-One]] Batman. After he and a multitude of Batman's enemies are broken out of [[Arkham Asylum]] and [[Blackgate Prison]] by [[Ra's al Ghul]], the Penguin carries out Ra's' plans to kidnap Batman's friends and allies. The Penguin, along with the Joker, [[Mad Hatter (comics)|the Mad Hatter]], [[Cavalier (comics)|Cavalier]], [[Deadshot]] and [[Killer Moth]], lay siege to Gotham City Police Headquarters, but are infuriated when the Joker sabotages their attempt at holding Commissioner Gordon for ransom. A standoff ensued, with the Joker on one side and the Penguin and the Mad Hatter on the other. The Joker quickly subdues both with a burst of laughing gas from one of his many gadgets.<ref>''Batman'' #400</ref>

===Post-''Crisis''===
Following [[Crisis On Infinite Earths|the Crisis]] rebooting the history of the [[DC Universe]], the Penguin was relegated to cameo appearances, until writer [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] (who had earlier penned the Penguin-origin story "The Killing Peck") and artist [[Norm Breyfogle]] brought him back, deadlier than ever. Within the era of the [[Tim Drake]] [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], the Penguin forms a brief partnership with macabre criminal and hypnotist Mortimer Kadaver, who helps him fake his own death as a ploy to strike an unsuspecting Gotham. The Penguin later guns down Kadaver, after plugging his own ears with [[toilet paper]] so that the hypnotist no longer has power over him.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #610-611</ref>

After Batman foils this particular endeavor, the Penguin embarks on one of his grandest schemes in the three-part story "The Penguin Affair." After finding [[Harold Allnut]] on a lonely street, undergoing physical and verbal abuse by two gang members, the Penguin takes the technologically-gifted hunchback in, showing him kindness in exchange for services. Harold builds a gadget that allowed the Penguin to control flocks of birds from miles away, which the Penguin utilized to destroy radio communications in Gotham and crash a passenger plane. This endeavor, too, was foiled by Batman. Batman finally hired Harold as his mechanic.

The Penguin resurfaces during [[Jean Paul Valley]]'s tenure as Batman as one of the few to deduce that Valley is not the original Caped Crusader. To confirm this theory, he kidnaps [[Sarah Essen Gordon]], places her in a death-trap set to go off at midnight, and turns himself in, utilizing the opportunity to mock [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] as midnight approached. An increasingly infuriated Gordon is nearly driven to throw him off the police headquarters roof before Valley shows up in the nick of time with a rescued Sarah. As Valley left, he commented, "There's nothing the Penguin can throw at me that I haven't encountered before." The Penguin reluctantly agrees with this sentiment, accepting that he has become passé.<ref>''Showcase '94'' #7</ref>

Subsequently, the Penguin turned his attentions to a new ''modus operandi'', operating under the front of a legitimate restaurant and casino known as the [[Iceberg Lounge]].<ref>''Detective Comics'' #683</ref> Though he is arrested for criminal activities several times during the course of his "reform", he always manages to secure a release from prison thanks to his high-priced lawyers.

During the storyline "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]," when [[Gotham City]] is nearly leveled by an [[earthquake]], the Penguin stays behind when the [[US government]] closes down and blockades the city. He becomes one of the major players in the lawless city, using his connections to profit by trading the money that nobody else in Gotham could use for goods through his outer-Gotham contacts. One of these connections is discovered to be [[Lex Luthor]] and his company, [[LexCorp]].

[[File:Batman287.JPG|thumb|The Penguin, as seen in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #287 (May 1977). Art by [[Mike Grell]].]]
The Penguin is swept up in the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. In the limited series' seventh issue, he is briefly seen as part of the [[Battle of Metropolis]], a multi-character brawl started by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. The Penguin, along with several other villains, is bowled over at the surprise appearance of [[Bart Allen]].

[[One Year Later]], while the Penguin is away from Gotham City, the [[Great White (comics)|Great White Shark]] and [[Tally Man]] kill many of the villains who had worked for him, and frame the reformed [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]]. Great White had planned to take over Gotham's criminal syndicate and eliminate the competition, the Penguin included. Upon his return to Gotham, the Penguin continues to claim that he has gone straight, and reopens the Iceberg, selling overpriced Penguin merchandise. He urges the [[Riddler]] to avoid crime, as their non-criminal lifestyle is more lucrative.

The Penguin was featured as a prominent figure in the new ''[[Gotham Underground]]'' tie-in to the series ''[[Countdown (comics)|Countdown]].'' He fights a gang war against [[Tobias Whale]] and [[Intergang]] while supposedly running an "underground railroad" for criminals. As the Penguin conducts his affairs, Two-Face enters the club and demands to be let in on his underground railroad project. The Penguin tells him to meet him after hours and subsequently brings him into a meeting with several of Gotham's most notorious villains, including [[Hugo Strange]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], and [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]]. Batman, in the disguise of Matches Malone, spies on the meeting from behind a darkened alcove. Suddenly, the [[Suicide Squad (comics)|Suicide Squad]] bursts into the room and attacks the assemblage of villains.<ref>''Gotham Underground'' #1</ref> It is revealed that the Penguin is involved with the Suicide Squad, and that he had set up the other villains to gain the favor of the Squad.<ref>''Gotham Underground'' #2</ref> The Penguin later meets up with Tobias Whale in order to negotiate with him.<ref>''Gotham Underground'' #3</ref> The Penguin and Spoiler had assembled gangs like the Bat Killers, who were based on Batman's enemies; the Dead End Boys, based on the Suicide Squad; the Femme Fatales, based on female villains; the Five Points Gang, based on the [[Fearsome Five]]; the L.O.D., based on the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]] to which the Penguin himself had once belonged; and the New Rogues, based on the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]].<ref>''Gotham Underground'' #6</ref> The Penguin and Tobias Whale fight each other as Robin, the Huntress, Batgirl, and the fourth Wildcat all get involved. Even though the Penguin gets the upper hand, Whale reluctantly calls a truce with him to stop Johnny Stitches and Intergang.<ref>''Gotham Underground'' #7</ref> Johnny Stitches sends the Penguin a package containing the Riddler's glasses and Mr. Jessup's dismembered body. Johnny tells the Penguin that Tobias Whale was not on his side any longer. Johnny also mentions that he had threatened the families of those fighting on the Penguin's side, and that he is giving him one day to get out of town.<ref>''Gotham Underground'' #8</ref> The Intergang then attacks the Iceberg Lounge, only to be foiled by Batman. In return for his help, Batman makes the Penguin become his informant.<ref>''Gotham Underground'' #9</ref>

Cobblepot later loses Batman's support after [[Batman R.I.P.|the latter's mysterious disappearance]] and Intergang's exploitation of [[Final Crisis|the return of the Apokoliptan Gods]]. He appears in ''Battle for the Cowl: The Underground'', which portrays the effects of Batman's disappearance on his enemies.

The Penguin's mob is absorbed by [[Jeremiah Arkham|Black Mask II]], who controls his criminal activities. The Penguin, with the aid of [[Mad Hatter (comics)|the Mad Hatter]], abducts Batman and brainwashes him to assassinate Black Mask.

During the events of ''[[Brightest Day]]'', the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] discover the Penguin beaten and stabbed at the feet of the [[White Canary (comics)|White Canary]].<ref>''Birds of Prey'' vol. 2 #1</ref> The Birds rescue him and flee to the Iceberg. While recovering, the Penguin expresses his attraction to [[Dawn Granger#Holly and Dawn Granger|Dove]].<ref>''Birds of Prey'' vol. 2 #2-3</ref> Eventually, the Penguin reveals that his injury had been a ruse, and that he is working with the White Canary in exchange for valuable computer files on the superhero community. He betrays the Birds and seriously injures both [[Lady Blackhawk]] and [[Hank Hall|Hawk]] before the [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] defeats him.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' vol. 2 #4</ref> The Huntress tapes him up with the intention of taking him with her, only to be informed by [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] that she has to let him go due to a police manhunt for the Birds. The Huntress considers killing him with her crossbow, but ultimately leaves him bound and gagged in an alley with the promise that she would exact her vengeance on him later.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' vol. 2 #5</ref>

The Penguin is eventually attacked by the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]], who kill many of his guards in an ambush at his mansion. [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] informs him that he needs information on Batman's partners, as he plans on killing [[Red Robin (Tim Drake)|Red Robin]], [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Batgirl]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Azrael (comics)#Michael Lane|Azrael]].<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #35</ref> The Penguin soon betrays the team's location, which results in the [[Justice League]], the [[Teen Titans]], the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]], the [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]], and various other heroes hunting down and capturing the criminals.<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #36</ref>

Around this time, a new super-villain, who called himself the Architect, plants a bomb in the Iceberg Lounge as revenge for crimes committed by the Penguin's ancestor. Though [[Cassandra Cain|Blackbat]] and [[Damian Wayne|Robin]] are able to evacuate the building, the Lounge is destroyed in the ensuing explosion.<ref>''Batman: Gates of Gotham'' #2</ref>

===The New 52===
In [[The New 52]] (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), the Penguin is a client of a criminal named Raju who was sent to offer gold to [[Dollmaker (comics)|Dollmaker]] for Batman's release.<ref>''Detective Comics'' Vol. 2 #4</ref> While in his Iceberg Casino, the Penguin views a disguised Charlotte Rivers on his surveillance cameras and he tells his henchwoman Lark to make sure Rivers gets "a story to die for".<ref>''Detective Comics'' vol. 2 #5 (January 2012)</ref> During the ''[[Death of the Family]]'' crossover, the Penguin puts his right-hand man, Ignatius Ogilvy, in charge of his operations in his temporary absence. Ogilvy, however, uses the Penguin's absence to declare him dead, taking over his gang and killing those loyal to him. Under the alias of '''Emperor Penguin''',<ref>''Detective Comics'' vol. 2 #15</ref> Ogilvy takes over the Penguin's operations. Upon the Joker's defeat, Batman unsuccessfully attempts to imprison the Penguin in Blackgate Penitentiary only to be forced to release him later. Upon learning of Ogilvy's betrayal, the Penguin attacks his former henchman's new empire, but Batman intervenes and arrests him. The Penguin is found not guilty, however, thanks to the machinations of his ally Mr. Combustible. Meanwhile, Ogilvy releases Kirk Langstrom's [[Man-Bat]] serum on Gotham City, turning many of the citizens into the creatures. Langstrom discovers a cure, returning the citizens to normal. Ogilvy then takes the serum himself, along with additions made by [[Poison Ivy]]. Emperor Penguin then challenges Batman openly to a fight, defeating the masked vigilante with his newfound prowess, and leaving him to be rescued by the Penguin. The pair forge a temporary alliance, and defeat Ogilvy.

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Penguin is among the villains recruited by the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] to join the Secret Society of Super Villains.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #1</ref> With the heroes gone, Penguin becomes the Mayor of Gotham City and divides the different territories amongst the inmates of [[Arkham Asylum]].<ref>''Detective Comics'' Vol. 2 23.3</ref>

The Penguin is a master criminal and occasional engineer who uses his genius-level intellect to gain money and power through criminal means. Penguin's wealth gives him accessibility to better resources than most other Batman villains and his life as a millionaire gives him superior knowledge of the backgrounds of celebrities and politicians, especially those he plans to target in his future crimes. He is also capable of returning to his luxurious lifestyle very easily despite his violent criminal history and prison record. He has even attempted multiple times to enter the political world, even launching expensive election campaigns. The Penguin also has strong connections with other criminal kingpins across Gotham, allowing him to hire their assassins and workers or to spy on them easily. The Penguin relies on cunning, wit, and intimidation to exploit his surroundings for profit. Penguin is normally depicted as being more rational and sane than other Batman villains, at least relatively speaking.

Although he often delegates the dirty work to his henchmen, he is not above taking aggressive and lethal actions on his own, especially when provoked. In spite of his appearance, he is a dangerous hand-to-hand combatant with enough self-taught skills in [[judo]] and [[bare-knuckle boxing]] to overwhelm attackers many times his size and physical bearing. The Penguin is usually portrayed as a capable physical combatant when he feels the situation calls for it, but his level of skill varies widely depending on the author; the character has been written both as a physical match for Batman and as someone the masked vigilante is capable of defeating with a solid punch. His crimes often revolve around stealing valuable bird-related items, and his car and other vehicles often have an avian theme.

===Equipment===
The Penguin utilizes an assortment of novelty umbrellas, particularly the [[Bulgarian umbrella]]. These usually contain weapons such as machine guns, sword tips, missiles, lasers, flamethrowers, and acid or poison gas spraying devices fired from the ferrule (however Penguin is able to weaponize his umbrellas in an almost unlimited variety of ways). Depending on the writer, some of his umbrellas can carry multiple weapons at once. He often carries an umbrella that can transform its canopy into a series of spinning blades: this can be used as a miniature helicopter or as an offensive weapon; he often uses this to escape a threatening situation. The canopy of the umbrella is sometimes depicted as being a [[Bulletproofing|bullet resistance shield]], and some are patterned in different ways from a spiral capable of hypnotizing opponents to flashy signs.

==Other versions==

===''Joker''===
The Penguin (referred to mockingly as "Abner"<ref name="Wild">[http://comics.ign.com/articles/923/923283p1.html Joker's Wild Ride] (an interview with the author), on [[IGN.com]]</ref> by the Joker) appeared in ''[[Joker (graphic novel)|Joker]],'' a graphic novel by [[Brian Azzarello]] and [[Lee Bermejo]]. This incarnation operates the Iceberg Lounge, handles most of Joker's personal investments, and deals with revenues from boxing matches.

===Elseworlds===
In the [[Elseworlds]] story ''[[Batman & Dracula: Red Rain#Crimson Mist|Batman: Crimson Mist]]'', the third part in a trilogy that turned Batman into a [[vampire]], the Penguin is the first of many criminals to be killed by the vampiric Batman after he surrenders to his darker instincts. Batman brutally tears the Penguin's throat out as he drinks his blood and subsequently decapitates his enemy to ensure that he cannot return as a vampire.

In ''The Doom That Came To Gotham'', an Elseworlds setting based on the works of [[H.P. Lovecraft]], Oswald Cobblepot is the leader of an expedition to Antarctica of which there is only one survivor. The rescue team finds no trace of him, but its revealed to the reader that the now half-mad Cobblepot has abandoned his humanity, and joined the albino penguins of the Elder Things city.

===''Flashpoint''===
In the alternate timeline of ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]],'' Oswald Cobblepot works as the security chief of Wayne Casinos, providing information about his clients and the criminal underworld to that [[fictional universe|universe]]'s Batman, [[Thomas Wayne]].<ref>''Flashpoint: Batman&nbsp;– Knight of Vengeance'' #1 (June 2011)</ref>

===''Earth One''===
In ''[[Batman: Earth One]]'' by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Gary Frank]], Oswald Cobblepot is the corrupt mayor of Gotham City. He attempts to have Thomas Wayne, the opposing mayoral candidate, killed, but his plan fails. Wayne, along with his wife, are instead killed in a random mugging on election night. Cobblepot runs Gotham with an iron fist, controlling all the power centers of the city and using a hired killer named "Birthday Boy". He almost kills Batman with his umbrella (which conceals a blade) once he discovers Batman's secret identity, but [[Alfred Pennyworth]] shoots and kills him just in time. It is also implied that Cobblepot had [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]]'s wife murdered when the detective got too close to finding out Cobblepot's involvement with the Waynes' murder. He tries to do the same thing to Gordon's daughter Barbara by "sending" her to Birthday Boy, but she is saved by Batman, Gordon, and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]].<ref>''Batman: Earth One''</ref>

===Television===
[[File:Penguin1BurgessMeredith.jpg|thumb|[[Burgess Meredith]] as the Penguin as he was seen in ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]].'']]

====Live Action====
* Burgess Meredith made a brief cameo appearance as the Penguin in the 1968 episode of ''[[The Monkees]]'' titled "Monkees Blow Their Minds".

=====''Batman''=====
* The Penguin is one of the main villains in the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, in which he was portrayed by [[Burgess Meredith]]. Meredith's performance is perhaps best remembered for his signature laugh, meant to mimic the squawk of a [[penguin]]. (One cause of the laugh was the cigarettes the character always smoked, which irritated Meredith's throat as he was a non smoker.) His thugs wear black bowler hats and dark clothing adorned with names of various animals of prey, such as birds ("[[Hawk]]") or fish ("[[Shark]]"), or sometimes simply "Henchman". His prison cell is in the "Supervillains" section next to that of Joker, Riddler, [[Catwoman]], [[Egghead (Batman)|Egghead]] and [[King Tut (Batman)|King Tut]]. In one episode, he claims to have been an actor. In the [[Batman (1966 film)|theatrical film spin-off]], he commands a nuclear submarine painted to resemble a penguin. However, his given name, Oswald Cobblepot, was never used in this series or the film.

=====''Gotham''=====
* [[Robin Lord Taylor]] plays a young Oswald Cobblepot in the TV series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]''. This version of the character is a small-time criminal working for mobster Fish Mooney ([[Jada Pinkett Smith]]). His last name appears to be an Anglicization of the name "Kapelput."<ref>''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]] ''episode "Selina Kyle"</ref> In the pilot episode, Cobblepot snitches on Mooney to the [[Gotham City Police Department]]; she finds out and tries to kill him, in the process hobbling him and giving him his distinctive "penguin walk".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/foxs-gotham-casts-classic-batman-characters-the-penguin-alfred-pennyworth-1201097899/ |title=Fox’s ‘Gotham’ Casts Classic ‘Batman’ Characters the Penguin, Alfred Pennyworth|publisher=Variety |date=2014-02-11 |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}</ref> [[Carmine Falcone]] ([[John Doman]]), Mooney's boss, orders Detectives [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] ([[Ben McKenzie]]) and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] ([[Donal Logue]]) to dispose of the traitor. Gordon tricks Bullock by pretending to kill Cobblepot, who drops into the river. He resurfaces once the cops are gone, however, and sets out to create his own criminal empire. In "Selina Kyle", he hitches a ride with two college students; he kills one and kidnaps the other, holding him for ransom. In "The Balloonman," he gets a job at Mafia Don [[Sal Maroni]]'s restaurant. In "Arkham", Gordon reluctantly takes Cobblepot on as an informant when he tells Gordon about an upcoming mafia war involving [[Arkham Asylum]], and gives him information that helps him thwart an assassination attempt on Mayor Aubrey James ([[Richard Kind]]). Cobblepot hires a gang of thugs to rob the mob's restaurant so he can save the money being counted there and endear himself to Maroni. Sure enough, Maroni promotes him to restaurant manager after the original restaurant manager is killed during the robbery. Cobblepot later visits the thugs he hired and kills them with poisoned [[cannoli]]. In "Viper," Cobblepot overhears Maroni's plans to attack Falcone's casino. He tells Maroni that he knows the janitor there, and that he might be of use to them. He later tells Maroni his real name and that he used to work for Mooney. Maroni then pins his head to the table. Maroni has Gordon brought to his restaurant and demands confirmation of Cobblepot's story, or else he will kill both of them. Gordon tells Maroni that he faked Cobblepot's death to fool Falcone, Mooney, and the Gotham City Police Department. Maroni spares Cobblepot's life and takes him up on his offer to help rob the casino. In "Spirit of the Goat," Cobblepot pays his mother Gertrude ([[Carol Kane]]) a visit to get cleaned up, and then appears at GCPD headquarters just as Detectives [[Renee Montoya]] ([[Victoria Cartagena]]) and [[Crispus Allen]] ([[Andrew Stewart-Jones]]) have arrested Gordon and Bullock for his supposed murder. In "Penguin's Umbrella," Cobblepot leads Maroni's men to a warehouse owned by Falcone's underling, Nikolai, killing him and his fellow operatives inside. Cobblepot then stabs Frankie Carbone with the help of two Maroni operatives. Cobblepot then meets with Falcone, and a flashback reveals that Cobblepot offered to be Falcone's spy when he was caught informing on Mooney.

====Animation====
[[File:Pengers.JPG|thumb|Penguin, as seen in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'']]

* Penguin is a major character in [[Filmation]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Batman]]'' voiced by [[Ted Knight]].

* Along with Joker, Penguin was one of the villains appearing in episodes of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' - "The Dynamic Scooby-Doo Affair" and "The Caped Crusader Caper" - that were later combined on the DVD ''Scooby-Doo Meets Batman''. He was once again voiced by Ted Knight. 

* In [[Filmation]]'s series ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'', Penguin is voiced by [[Lennie Weinrib]]. He frequently rolls his 'r's and laughs in a manner similar to Burgess Meredith's portrayal. He appears in "Reading, Writing and Wronging," "Birds of a Feather Fool Around Together" and "Have an Evil Day" Pt. 1, and "Have an Evil Day" Pt. 2.

* Penguin appeared in ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' episode "The Case of the Stolen Powers" voiced by [[Robert Morse]]. He is shown in prison as a cellmate of [[Felix Faust]]. He gains Superman's superpowers by accident when Felix Faust tries to get them for himself. Batman is not featured in the episode.

* When ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' debuted in 1992, Penguin was voiced by [[Academy Award]]-winner [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]]. This version of the character featured the film version's physical deformities, such as flippers and a beak-like nose, but he retained the traditional refined mannerisms and personality of his comics counterpart. His most prominent appearances include the episodes "I've Got Batman in My Basement", "The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne", "Almost Got 'Im", "The Mechanic", "Birds of a Feather", "Blind as a Bat", and "Second Chance". He is the only villain in the series, other than the Joker, not to be given an origin story.

* Paul Williams reprised his role as Penguin in the 1997 follow-up to the original animated series, ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. In this series, the character appeared more like his traditional comic book portrayal. His role was also similar to that in the [[comic book]]s: a "legitimate" businessman and mob boss who runs a night club called the "Iceberg Lounge". He appears in "Joker's Millions", "The Ultimate Thrill", "Girl's Night Out", and "Judgment Day".

* While the Penguin does not appear in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', his club, the Iceberg Lounge, makes a cameo appearance at the beginning of the episode "This Little Piggy".

* The character appeared in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]],'' voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]. In this continuity, Penguin is primarily concerned with re-establishing the Cobblepot family name in society by stealing from the citizens of Gotham to rebuild his wealth. While he shares the comic incarnation's love for birds and aristocratic look, this Penguin retained a deformed appearance more similar to the ''Batman Returns'' incarnation, with orange hair instead of black and sharp, pointy teeth and fused fingers. When captured, he is placed in Arkham Asylum instead of Gotham State Penitentiary. He is sometimes aided by two henchwomen, a masked pair called the [[Kabuki Twins]]. In addition, he knows [[martial arts]] and is athletic enough to engage in hand-to-hand combat with Batman, dodging and parrying with his various trick umbrellas. He holds a grudge against [[Alfred Pennyworth]] because the Pennyworths left the service of the Cobblepots generations before. Unused concept art from the show indicates that a more classic version of Penguin was considered for the show.<ref>{{cite web| last = Matsuda | first = Jeff | title = ''The Batman'' Unused Character Designs&nbsp;– Behind the Scenes| publisher = BringOnTheBatman.com| url =http://www.legionsofgotham.org/BATMANbtsUnUsed.html| archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070521183602/http://www.legionsofgotham.org/BATMANbtsUnUsed.html| archivedate =May 21, 2007| accessdate =August 29, 2008}}</ref>

* In the animated series ''[[Krypto the Superdog]],'' the Penguin's pet birds are recurring foes of [[Krypto]] and [[Ace the Bat-Hound]]. Although the Penguin is referenced in this series, he never makes an appearance.

* The Penguin is featured in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' voiced by [[Stephen Root]]. In "Legends of the Dark Mite!", he appears in [[Bat-Mite]]'s fantasy. In "Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure!", Batman ends up dealing with the Penguin's crime spree. When Batman is captured and placed in a deadly drinking bird trap, [[Aquaman]] comes to his rescue and gets shocked by the Penguin, who reveals that his umbrella drones will spread a paralytic gas over Gotham City. Aquaman manages to make contact with some crabs to free the family as the Penguin sics his minions on Batman and the Aquaman family. Batman redirects the umbrella drones into the ocean and then pursues the Penguin. Upon catching up to him at his submarine, Batman manages to jam the Penguin's umbrella with his cape and defeat him. He then cameos in "Chill of the Night!" as one of the villains at a weapons auction held by [[Joe Chill]]. The Penguin has a quick cameo in the teaser for "The Last Patrol!" and also appears in "Night of the Batmen!" fighting Aquaman in a Batman costume, only to be defeated later on.

* The Penguin is referred to twice in ''[[Beware the Batman]]''. In "Animal", [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] and his Special Crime Unit are looking at a sketch of the Penguin, with Dent wondering if he just looks like a penguin or actually is one. In "Epitaph", a news report ticker desplays the headline "Oswald Cobblepot identified as the 'Penguin Man'".

===Film===
* Burgess Meredith reprised his role as the Penguin in the 1966 film ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]'' alongside several other villains from the television show.

[[File:Batman returns ver5.jpg|thumb|right|Movie poster for ''Batman Returns'' (1992) featuring [[Danny DeVito]] as the Penguin.]]
* [[Danny Devito]] portrayed The Penguin as the main antagonist in ''[[Batman Returns]]''. Director [[Tim Burton]], inspired by the film ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]],'' re-imagined the character not as an eloquent gentleman of crime, but a former [[freak show]] performer who holds a homicidal grudge against the aristocrats of Gotham City. The film provides him a backstory in which his wealthy parents threw him into the sewer as a baby, but he survived and was raised by penguins. He resurfaces as an adult to run for mayor of Gotham with the help of corrupt businessman Max Shreck ([[Christopher Walken]]). Meanwhile, he plans to kill every first-born son of Gotham's elite, and teams up with [[Catwoman]] ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]) to frame Batman ([[Michael Keaton]]) for murder. Batman foils his scheme, however, and the Penguin dies following a climactic duel with Batman. While this Penguin retained many trademarks, such as a variety of trick umbrellas and the use of a [[monocle]], he was given a dramatic visual makeover. Where the comic version varies between a balding head of short cropped hair and varying degrees of thinning, this Penguin is still bald at the top but with his remaining length of hair long and stringy. His hands are flippers with a thumb and index finger, and the remaining three fingers [[Syndactyly|fused]]. An unidentified thick, dark green [[bile]]-like liquid sometimes trickles from his nose and mouth. Instead of a tuxedo, he wears a more [[Gothic fashion|gothic]], [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]]-style outfit with a [[Jabot (neckwear)|jabot]] as opposed to a bow tie. In certain scenes, he also wears black boots, a [[dickey (garment)|dickey]], and a [[union suit]]. However, Burton's design maintained the top hat seen in the comics along with a [[monocle]] and a [[cigarette]] in some scenes. He also has penguin-like appetites, as shown in a scene where he devours a raw fish.

* He appears in ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'' as the main antagonist, this time voiced by [[David Ogden Stiers]]. The plot involves the Penguin, [[Rupert Thorne]] and Carlton Duquesne in an illegal arms deal with the President of [[Kasnia]]. Of the three Batwomen, the Penguin shares a personal history with Dr. Roxanne Ballantine; he framed her fiancée Kevin years before, which led him into prison in order to find evidence that would get his sentence commuted. When Batwoman proves to be more than he expected, he hires [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] to kill her. In the aftermath, he is arrested with Thorne and Duquesne.

* Tom Kenny reprised his role of Penguin in the animated movie ''[[The Batman vs. Dracula]].'' In the movie, after escaping from [[Arkham Asylum]], he accidentally resurrects [[Count Dracula]] with his blood in the Gotham cemetery (while in search of buried treasure). Dracula then [[Hypnosis|hypnotizes]] the Penguin to work for him. He is later released from the spell upon Dracula's death and accused of the vampire's crimes, and is thus returned to Arkham Asylum.

* Penguin appears in the animated film ''[[Lego Batman: The Movie - DC Super Heroes Unite]]'' (an adaptation of the video game of the [[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes|same name]]), voiced by [[Steven Blum]].

* Penguin appears in ''[[Batman: Assault on Arkham]]'' voiced again by [[Nolan North]]. He is hired by [[Amanda Waller]] to give the [[Suicide Squad]] arms, equipment, and shelter in his Iceberg Lounge for the night prior to their mission to infiltrate Arkham Asylum and take out the Riddler. He appears to have worked with [[Deadshot (comics)|Deadshot]] before, and holds a grudge against the Joker and [[Harley Quinn]] for sinking a truck of his cigarettes.

===Video games===
* The Penguin has appeared as a boss in several Batman [[video game]]s, including ''[[Batman: The Caped Crusader]]'', the various video game adaptations of the movie ''[[Batman Returns (video game)|Batman Returns]]'', ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''[[Adventures of Batman & Robin]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]].

* At one point he was planned to appear as a boss in ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' for the [[Sega CD]], in which he would try to kidnap [[Summer Gleeson]]. The Penguin was cut from the game because it was tight on villains, but the storyboards for his animated cut-scene are displayed in [[Paul Dini]]'s book, ''[[Batman Animated]]''.

* The Penguin is the chief villain of an online flash game, ''Batman: The Cobblebot Caper'', which is modeled after ''The Batman'' animated series. His ultimate plan is to construct a giant mechanical phoenix which he intends to use as a war machine against Gotham City.

* The Penguin appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by [[David Jennison]]. Following Bane's defeat, a cut-scene features the Penguin stating his anger at the competition from the Falcone Crime Family, Bane, Two-Face, the Mad Hatter, Hush, Killer Croc, the Catwoman and the Joker due to all the chaos, but being a cunning crook, he plans on tricking them into wiping each other out and taking Gotham for himself. The players discover that a hacked kiosk contained a message from Two-Face describing the Penguin's smuggling operation in Gotham's old subway tunnels. The Penguin is served by Cryo Pengbots, Louie Sluggers, Machine Gun Tommies, Nickie Blades, Pengbots, Pyro Pengbots, Tammy Two Guns and a Pengbot Maximus.

* The Penguin appears in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'' voiced by [[Steven Blum]].

* The Penguin makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' sporting his ''Arkham City'' look. In the Arkham Asylum level, if one of the characters is thrown through the cell door on the right side of the second tier, they will be attacked by Two-Face, Killer Croc, Riddler, and Penguin before being punched by Croc into the next tier of the Arkham arena.



====[[Batman: Arkham]]====

* While the Penguin is not featured as an actual character in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', as a key character in Batman's universe he is repeatedly referenced. An asylum security guard notes that he had witnessed the attempted smuggling of sharpened umbrellas into Arkham on at least one occasion before, a reference to the character. Additionally, an Iceberg Lounge advertisement can be seen in the Intensive Treatment wards, while a collection of trick umbrellas and top hats (apparently confiscated from Penguin upon his admittance to the facility) may be observed on display in the old Arkham Mansion. He is also one of the villains whose name is listed on the party list.

* The Penguin appears as one of the villains in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkhamcity.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2573 |title=Batman Arkham City • Portrait of a Penguin |publisher=Arkhamcity.co.uk |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2011-07-12}}</ref> voiced by [[Nolan North]] in a Cockney accent.<ref>{{cite web|author=Logan Westbrook |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112122-Arkham-Citys-Penguin-Shares-a-Voice-With-Nathan-Drake |title=Arkham City's Penguin Shares a Voice With Nathan Drake &#124; The Escapist |publisher=Escapistmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14}}</ref> The Penguin is redesigned without penguin-like mannerisms such as the waddle or the squawk-laugh, but retains his beaked nose and monocle (here depicted as the bottom of a glass bottle, said to have been shoved into his face by the friend of a young man that Penguin was torturing after cheating at cards).  In this game, Penguin is also responsible for [[Victor Zsasz]]'s descent into villainy, having cheated a young Zsasz out of his inheritance at a game of poker.  He also wears what appears to be an [[electrolarynx]] strapped to or implanted in his neck. According to the Arkham City Stories included in the game, Cobblepot became trapped in the open-air prison perimeter of Arkham City after refusing to vacate his residence at the Iceberg Lounge (which was condemned as part of the new project). Cobblepot went on to establish himself as a warlord in the new criminal underworld, using the nearby museum to enshrine defeated enemies, vying with the Joker for control of Arkham City. At the start of the game he and his minions attack the just-incarcerated Bruce Wayne, only to have his hand broken by Wayne (which results in its being bandaged in such a fashion that it resembles the ''Batman Returns'' Penguin's flipper-hand). Later in the game, Batman tracks him down in order to retrieve Mr. Freeze, who Penguin is holding captive, as Freeze is the only one who knows how to cure Joker, Batman, and half of Gotham of the TITAN poison. Making matters worse is the fact that Penguin is holding several undercover cops captive. Despite his use of [[Mr. Freeze]]'s freeze gun and the captive [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], Penguin is ultimately defeated by Batman. Mr. Freeze adds insult to injury by locking Cobblepot in the exhibit planned for Bruce Wayne, where he remains for the rest of the game.

* A younger version of the Penguin from ''Batman: Arkham City'' appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'' with Nolan North reprising his role. In the game, Penguin is credited as Gotham's number one weapons dealer, using a legal loophole by staying aboard his refitted cruise liner, The Final Offer, to evade the law, while his goons make deals with the other gangs in Gotham. He is first mentioned after Batman scans a smashed recon drone found during the Blackgate riot, revealing that Penguin had been using it to spy on who he thought was [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], but was really a disguised [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. After interrogating one of his dealers, Batman makes his way to Penguin's ship. After fighting his way through Penguin's thugs, his assistant Tracey, and [[Electrocutioner]], Batman finds and interrogates Penguin for information about [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]. Penguin mentions a murder in Lacey Towers, but is unable to reveal more before Batman is attacked by [[Deathstroke]]. He does not appear afterwards, but is mentioned as the prime suspect in Black Mask's "murder". In the game, Penguin does not yet have the bottle in his eye from ''Arkham City'' meaning the accident will happen after Origins. In the DLC "Cold, Cold Heart", the Penguin's thugs are working with [[Mr. Freeze]] in his revenge mission against [[GothCorp]] CEO Ferris Boyle. Mr. Freeze had offered the Penguin weapons in exchange for his aid breaking into GothCorp, only for Penguin to attempt to betray Mr. Freeze into making him give them superior weapons, culminating in Freeze trapping Penguin in a vast block of ice while Batman leaves Penguin to shiver until the police arrive. During the credits of the "Cold, Cold Heart" DLC, it was mentioned in a news voiceover that Penguin, Mr. Freeze, and Ferris Boyle have been arrested by the police.

* The younger Penguin from Arkham Origins appears in the spin-off game ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate]]'' as one of the criminals released in the Breakout, having been imprisoned after the events of ''Cold, Cold Heart''. [[Nolan North]] once again voices The Penguin. Along with the Joker and Black Mask, Penguin takes control of one of three buildings at Blackgate; Penguin takes control of the Cell Blocks, being able to control movement around the island. He recruits any inmates not loyal to the clown or Sionis; when [[Bronze Tiger]] saves a guard from being hanged by his men, Penguin forces him to fight guards to the death in his makeshift arena in the Exercise Yard. Batman later arrives and defeats Bronze Tiger, who injures Penguin with a gun. Followed all the way to the entrance to the Arkham Wing, Penguin is soundly defeated by Batman. Penguin later escapes thanks to a guard he bribed, and kills said guard to keep him quiet.

* The Penguin is set to appear in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]''. He is portrayed as "grungier" and more like a mob boss, now with a shaved head. Due to the warmer weather, the Penguin is seen without his long coat.

====[[Lego: Batman]]====

* The Penguin appears in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]''<ref>''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery," ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.</ref> voiced by Tom Kenny. He is one of the leaders of the Arkham breakout. His plan is to use mind-controlled penguins to wreak havok in Gotham. To this end, he employs the [[Catwoman]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], [[Killer Croc]], and the [[Man-Bat]]. He has the ability to call out [[robot]]ic penguins from under his [[top hat]]. He can use his [[umbrella]] both as a gliding apparatus and a [[rifle]]. Despite his comic book appearance he has some ideas and characteristics of [[Danny DeVito]]'s Penguin (e.g. taking over Gotham with a penguin army, having a liking for raw fish, and working with Catwoman). Being a Lego game, he cannot be portrayed as fat, nor does he have his signature pointed nose.

* The Penguin will appear as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]''. Nolan North will reprise his role.

===Toys===
[[File:PenguinOrder.JPG|thumb|The Lego version of the Penguin orders his penguins to attack the [[Batboat]].]]

* An 8" version of the Penguin was created by the [[Mego Corporation#Official "World's Greatest Superheroes!"|Mego Corporation]] as part of their "World's Greatest Super-Heroes" line in 1974.  Mego also released a 3 3/4" Penguin as a part of their Comic Action Heroes line in 1976.

* The [[Lego Batman]] line includes one particular set, ''The Batcave: The Penguin and Mr. Freeze's Invasion,'' which features Penguin. He appears as a [[minifigure]] in the set, with short, unbending legs, the classic top hat and monocle and a purple pin-stripe suit, but lacks the familiar pointy nose. Penguin rides in a submarine reminiscent of the one in the 1960s TV series and is assisted by miniature penguin robots. The set also includes a depiction of the [[Batcave]].

* He also appears in the Batman Lego promotional video. He is the final villain to be caught (after Two-Face, [[Mr. Freeze]] and Joker).

* The Penguin was featured in the 1980s [[Super Powers Collection]] toy-line, featuring various [[DC Comics]] villains and heroes. The Penguin's appearance was much like that of the time, with a blue coat and top-hat. Penguin had "umbrella action" where his legs could be squeezed together, triggering his arm (holding an umbrella) to move up and down. - (This figure sculpt was later used for the ''[[Batman Returns]]'' figure line, with a new black paint application).

* There have been various toys of the Penguin for cartoon series, from the sophisticated aristocrat to the deformed outcast styles.

* Recently the Penguin was made into a toy by [[Funko]] who made small 3.75" figures with large heads and also soft toy version of the Penguin. The Penguin figure looked much like he had in Burgess Meredith's style from the 1960s, along with the comic book look. The figure featured an umbrella accessory, but the plush did not.

===Parodies===
* The Penguin appears in the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' segment "Superman's Funeral." When he makes his trademark "Penguin Cackle," Batman angrily tells him to stop laughing to which the Penguin replies, "I'm '''''not''''' laughing! This is also how I cry." In that appearance, the Penguin was portrayed by [[Robert Smigel]].

* In the ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' episode "Inside Plucky Duck," a cartoon called "Bat's All Folks" parodied the Penguin as [[Puffin]] who assisted Jackster (a [[donkey]] parody of Joker), Question Mark (a parody of Riddler), and Polecatwoman (a parody of Catwoman) in a plot to rub out Bat-Duck so that everyone would buy their T-shirts.

* In ''[[Yin Yang Yo!]]'', the villain called Puffin is a parody of the Penguin. His dressy appearance is based on the Penguin, although characters in the show stop talking before the connection is made and before lawsuits can be filed. Puffin is mentioned to have an advantage in the rain which has not been demonstrated.

* Episode 24<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/241/20-acts-in-60-minutes |title=Episode 241 |publisher=Thisamericanlife.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14}}</ref> of ''[[This American Life]]'' on [[Public Radio International]], "20 Acts in 60 Minutes," contains a short story that supplies the Penguin with an alternate [[origin story]]. In this story, the Penguin and [[Mary Poppins]] are introduced at a dinner party by a friend who thinks that their ability to fly or float using umbrellas will bring them together. Unfortunately, the two have nothing in common, and Mary Poppins soon leaves with another guest, one who wears a conspicuous black cape.

* The Penguin appears in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "Drippy Pony," where he is voiced by [[Seth Green]]. In a segment that parodies the Penguin in the style of the popular documentary film ''[[March of the Penguins]],'' it shows him drinking heavily and soliciting prostitutes. [[Tom Kane]] provides a narrative style similar to that of [[Morgan Freeman]] in the English-language version of ''March of the Penguins.'' He appears in another sketch from a later episode, in which his umbrella was accidentally switched with that of an old woman.

* The Penguin is played by [[Patton Oswalt]] in a [[CollegeHumor]] skit, in which he and Commissioner Gordon tries to explain the concept of death to an oblivious Batman, who thinks that the henchman felled by the edged weapons merely go to "sleep".<ref>Bricken, Rob (April 15, 2013).

The character of the Penguin, particularly as portrayed by Burgess Meredith, has often been used as a theme to mock public figures that supposedly resemble him. [[Jon Stewart]], host of ''[[The Daily Show]],'' has made numerous references comparing former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] with the Penguin, including a laugh similar to the one heard in the 1960s ''Batman'' series.<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/17/AR2006091700696.html |title=Jon Stewart Gets His Props, Even Without Them |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= September 18, 2006|accessdate=December 25, 2010}}</ref> In a similar manner, [[Stephen Colbert]], host of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', called [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] a criminal and told his audience to "ask Batman" "if they don't believe him," showing a picture of Meredith as the Penguin next to one of the former President; Roosevelt and the Penguin are both pictured wearing a monocle and sporting a [[cigarette holder]], suggesting a resemblance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/full-episodes/index.jhtml?episodeId=221834 |title=The Colbert Report Full Episode &#124; Monday Mar 16 2009 |publisher=Comedy Central |date= |accessdate=December 25, 2010}}</ref> Cheney was mocked in a similar capacity on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]],'' while ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' chose to imitate [[John McCain]] with Meredith's Penguin laugh.

In May 2006, a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]-led [[Public relations|PR]] firm, [[DCI Group]], created a [[Al Gore's Penguin Army video controversy|YouTube video]] satirizing [[Al Gore]]'s film ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]].'' The video portrayed Gore as the Penguin using one of his trick umbrellas to [[hypnosis|hypnotize]] a flock of penguins into believing in the existence of [[global warming|global warming and climate change]].<ref>Regalado, Antonio and Searcey, Dionne, "[http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB115457177198425388-0TpYE6bU6EGvf%20SqtP8_hHjJJ77I_20060810.html?mod=blogs Where Did That Video Spoofing Gore's Film Come From?]", [[Wall Street Journal|online.wsj.com]], 3 August 2006, retrieved 1 August 2012</ref>

In botany, a '''pome''' (after the [[Latin]] word for [[fruit]]: ''p?mum'') is a type of fruit produced by [[flowering plant]]s in the subtribe [[Malinae]] of the family [[Rosaceae]]. Pome's origin of the word came from the Middle English (fruit), from Anglo-French ''pume'', ''pomme'' (apple, fruit) and, ultimately from Late Latin ''pomum''. First use, 15th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Morphology ==
A pome is an [[accessory fruit]] composed of one or more [[Gynoecium|carpel]]s surrounded by accessory tissue. The accessory tissue is interpreted by some specialists as an extension of the [[receptacle (botany)|receptacle]] and is then referred to as "fruit cortex",<ref name=Esau>Esau, K. 1977. ''Anatomy of seed plants''. John Wiley and Sons, New York.</ref> and by others as a fused [[hypanthium]]<ref name=Esau/> or "torus";<ref name=Pereira>[[Jonathan Pereira]], [[Fred B. Kilmer]], [[Joseph Carson]], [[Alfred Swaine Taylor]], [[George Owen Rees]] (1857) ''The Elements of Materia Medica and Therapeutics'', Published by Longman, Brown, Green, and Longman's, v.2:pt.2</ref> it is the most edible part of this fruit.

The carpels of a pome are fused within the "core".<ref>{{cite book|author=Hickey, M.; King, C.|year=2001|title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=translated by}}</ref> Although the [[epicarp]], [[mesocarp]], and [[endocarp]] of some other fruit types look very much like the skin, flesh, and core respectively of a pome, they are parts of the carpel (see diagram). The [[epicarp]] and [[mesocarp]] of a pome may be fleshy and difficult to distinguish from one another and from the hypanthial tissue. The [[endocarp]] forms a leathery or stony case around the [[seed]], and corresponds to what is commonly called the core. Pome-type fruit with stony rather than leathery endocarp may be called a '''polypyrenous [[drupe]]'''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Potter, D.; Eriksson, T.; Evans, R.C.; Oh, S.; Smedmark, J.E.E.; Morgan, D.R.; Kerr, M.; Robertson, K.R.; Arsenault, M.; Dickinson, T.A.; Campbell, C.S.|year=2007|title=Phylogeny and classification of Rosaceae|journal=Plant Systematics and Evolution|volume=266|issue=1–2|pages=5–43|url=http://rd.springer.com/journal/606/266/1/page/1| doi = 10.1007/s00606-007-0539-9 }}</ref> The shriveled remains of the [[sepal]]s, [[Gynoecium|style]] and [[stamen]]s can sometimes be seen at the end of a pome opposite the stem, and the [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] is therefore often described as [[ovary (plants)#Inferior ovary|inferior]] in these flowers.

==Examples==
[[image:Mespilus germanica 01.jpg|thumb|right|Pomes of common medlar, ''[[Mespilus germanica]]'']]
The best-known example of a pome is the [[apple]]. Other examples of plants that produce fruit classified as a pome are [[cotoneaster]], [[Crataegus|hawthorn]], [[loquat]], [[medlar]], [[pear]], ''[[pyracantha]]'', [[toyon]], [[quince]],<ref name=Pereira/> [[rowan]], and [[whitebeam]]. 

Some pomes may have a mealy texture (e.g., some apples); others (e.g., ''[[Amelanchier]]'', ''[[Aronia]]'') are berry-like with juicy flesh and a core that is not very noticeable.

'''Crown Prince Dan''' ({{zh|c=???}}) was a crown prince of the [[State of Yan]] during the [[Warring States period]] of [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]].  He was also called '''Yan Dan''' (??).

He lived in the [[State of Qin]] as a hostage, but returned to Yan in 232 BC.  He sent [[Jing Ke]] to assassinate King Zheng of Qin, who later assumed the title [[Qin Shi Huang]] and became the first [[Emperor of China]], but Jing failed. [[King Xi of Yan]], Dan's father and the last king of Yan, ordered the execution of Dan to please Qin after Ji, the capital of Yan, had fallen {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. Invasion of Qin did halt for few years, during which time the states of [[state of Wei|Wei]] and [[state of Chu|Chu]] were conquered. Meanwhile the [[King Xi of Yan]] moved to the [[Liaodong Commandery]]. 

The state of Yan was conquered in 222 BC and King Xi was captured.

All except King Xi were featured in the Chinese period epic ''[[The Emperor and the Assassin]]''. Prince Dan is also featured in the 2004 TV series ''[[Assassinator Jing Ke]]''.

The '''16"/50 caliber Mark 7 – United States Naval Gun''' was the main armament of the {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship}}s.

==Description==
[[Image:Iowa 16 inch Gun-EN.svg|thumb|left|200px|A cutaway of a turret mounting 16-inch guns]]
Due to a lack of communication during design, the [[Bureau of Ordnance]] assumed the ''Iowa'' class would use the [[16"/50 caliber Mark 2 gun|16"/50 Mark 2]] guns constructed for the [[South Dakota-class battleship (1920)|1920 ''South Dakota''-class battleships]]. However, the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] assumed that the ships would carry a new, lighter, more compact 16"/50 and designed the ships with [[barbette]]s too small to accommodate a 16"/50 Mark 2 triple turret. The new 16"/50 Mark 7 was designed to resolve this conflict.

These guns were 66.6&nbsp;feet (20&nbsp;m) long—50&nbsp;times their {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on|0}} bore, or 50&nbsp;calibers, from [[breechface]] to [[muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]. Each gun weighed about 239,000&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|pound]]s (108,000&nbsp;kg) without the breech, or 267,900&nbsp;pounds (121,517&nbsp;kg) with the breech.<ref name="Mark7">{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_16-50_mk7.htm | title = United States of America 16"/50 (40.6&nbsp;cm) Mark 7 | accessdate =25 February 2007 |date=November 2006 | work = NavWeaps.com  | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070205233558/http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_16-50_mk7.htm| archivedate= 5 February 2007 <!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref> They fired projectiles weighing from 1,900 to 2,700&nbsp;pounds (850 to 1,200&nbsp;kg) at a maximum speed of {{convert|2690|ft/s|m/s}} with a range of up to 24 miles (39&nbsp;km). At maximum range the projectile spent almost 1½&nbsp;minutes in flight.<ref name="Mark7"/> Each turret required a crew of 79&nbsp;men to operate.<ref name="Mark7"/> The turrets themselves cost US$1.4&nbsp;million each, to which the cost of the guns had to be added.<ref name="Mark7"/>

The turrets were "three-gun", not "triple", because each barrel could be elevated and fired independently. The ships could fire any combination of their guns, including a [[broadside]] of all nine. The turret interiors were subdivided and so designed as to permit the independent loading, elevation and firing of each gun.  Each turret was also installed with an optical range finder and ballistic [[analog computer]].  This permitted the turret’s gun captain and crew to locally engage targets, should battle damage disrupt communication with the ship’s primary or auxiliary fire control centers.  Considering the large mass of the ship, compared to the mass of the projectiles, the ships barely moved sideways at all, even when a full broadside was fired. With the damping effect of the water around the hull the pressure wave generated by the gunfire was felt much more than the slight change in lateral velocity.<ref>{{cite web | title =Do battleships move sideways when they fire? | work = NavWeaps.com| url = http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-022.htm|author= Landgraff, R. A.; Locock, Greg | accessdate =19 May 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080509065249/http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-022.htm| archivedate= 9 May 2008 <!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref>

The guns could be elevated from ?5&nbsp;degrees to +45&nbsp;degrees, moving at up to 12&nbsp;degrees per second. The turrets could rotate about 300&nbsp;degrees at about 4&nbsp;degrees per second and could even be fired back beyond the [[Beam (nautical)|beam]], which is sometimes called "over the shoulder". Within each turret, a red stripe on the wall of the turret, just inches from the railing, marked the boundary of the gun's recoil, providing the crew of each gun turret with a visual reference for the minimum safe distance range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/mk-7.htm |title=Mark 7 16-inch/50-caliber gun |accessdate=12 March 2007 |work=Federation of American Scientists| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070311085437/http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/mk-7.htm| archivedate= 11 March 2007 <!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref>

Complementing the 16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun was a fire control computer, in this case the Ford Instrument Company Mark 8 [[Rangekeeper|Range Keeper]]. This [[analog computer]] was used to direct the fire from the battleship's big guns, taking into account several factors such as the speed of the targeted ship, the time it takes for a projectile to travel, and air resistance to the shells fired at a target. At the time the {{sclass-|Montana|battleship|4}} was set to begin construction, the rangekeepers had gained the ability to use radar data to help target enemy ships and land-based targets. The results of this advance were telling: the rangekeeper was able to track and fire at targets at a greater range and with increased accuracy.<ref name = "early">{{cite journal | last = Clymer | first = A. Ben | title = The Mechanical Analog Computers of Hannibal Ford and William Newell | publisher =Massachusetts Institute of Technology| work= [[IEEE Annals of the History of Computing]] | year = 1993 | volume = 15 | number = 2 | url = http://web.mit.edu/STS.035/www/PDFs/Newell.pdf | format = pdf | pages = 19–34 | accessdate =8 October 2011}}</ref> This gave the US Navy a major advantage in World War II, as the Japanese did not develop radar or automated fire control to the level of the US Navy.

==Mark 8 "Super-heavy" shell==
The Mark 7 gun was originally intended to fire the relatively light {{convert|2240|lb|adj=on}} Mark 5 armor-piercing shell. However, the shell-handling system for these guns was redesigned to use the "super-heavy" {{convert|2700|lb|adj=on}} APC ([[Armor Piercing]], Capped) Mark 8 shell before any of the {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship}}s were laid down. The large caliber guns were designed to fire two different 16 in (406&nbsp;mm) shells: an armor piercing round for anti-ship and anti-structure work, and a high explosive round designed for use against unarmored targets and shore bombardment.

The Mark 7 guns and the 2,700-pound projectiles were 25 percent lighter than the [[46 cm/45 Type 94 naval gun]]s of the Japanese {{sclass-|Yamato|battleship}}s, but had nearly the same armor penetration ability.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_16-50_mk7.htm | publisher = NavWeaps.com | title = 16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun | year = 2009 | accessdate =20 May 2012 }}</ref>

The {{sclass-|North Carolina|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1939)|5}} classes could also fire the 2,700-pound Mark 8 shell, although with a shorter range, using the [[16"/45 caliber Mark 6 gun]]. The Mark 6 gun was lighter than the Mark 7, which helped both battleship classes to conform to the limits of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_16-45_mk6.htm | publisher = NavWeaps.com | title = USA 16"/45 (40.6&nbsp;cm) Mark 6 | year = 2009 | accessdate =8 October 2011 }}</ref>

The Mark 8 shells gave the ''North Carolina'', ''South Dakota'', and ''Iowa'' classes the second heaviest broadside of all battleship classes, even though the ''North Carolina'' and ''South Dakota'' ships were [[treaty battleship]]s. Only the ''Yamato''-class super-battleships could throw more weight.

The propellant consists of small cylindrical grains of [[smokeless powder]] with an extremely high burning rate.  A maximum charge consists of six silk bags, each filled with 110 pounds of propellant.<ref>{{cite news | last = Trainor | first = Bernard E. | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/23/us/iowa-blast-inquiry-long-search-ahead.html | title = Iowa Blast Inquiry: Long Search Ahead |work=The New York Times | date = 23 April 1989 | accessdate =8 October 2011 }}</ref>

The [[built-up gun]] is constructed of liner, tube, jacket, three hoops, two locking rings, tube and liner locking ring, yoke ring and screw box liner. Some components were [[autofrettage|autofretted]]. Typical of [[List of artillery#Naval guns|United States naval weapons]] built in the 1940s, the bore was chromium plated for longer barrel life. It uses a [[Welin breech block]] that opens downwards and is hydraulically operated. The screw box liner and breech plug are segmented with stepped screw threads arranged in fifteen sectors of 24 degrees each.

==Background==
Information in the United States on psychic research in some foreign countries was sketchy and poorly detailed, based mostly on rumor or innuendo from second-hand or tertiary reporting, attributed to both reliable and unreliable [[disinformation]] sources from the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>''Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain: The astounding facts behind psychic research in official laboratories from Prague to Moscow'' by Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder, Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1970, A New Age Bestseller [http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/psycdisc.html] and [http://www.biomindsuperpowers.com/Pages/RealStoryCh13.html]</ref><ref>"Some of the intelligence people I've talked to know that remote viewing works, although they still block further research on it, since they claim it is not yet as good as satellite photography. But it seems to me that it would be a hell of a cheap radar system. And if the Russians have it and we don't, we are in serious trouble." ''Omni'', July 1979, Congressman Charles Rose, Chairman, House Sub-Committee on Intelligence Evaluation and Oversight.</ref>

The CIA and the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] decided they should investigate and know as much about it as possible. Various programs were approved yearly and re-funded accordingly.  Reviews were made semi-annually at the Senate and House [[Select or special committee (United States)|select committee]] level. Work results were reviewed, and remote viewing was attempted with the results being kept secret from the "viewer". It was thought that if the viewer was shown they were incorrect it would damage the viewer's confidence and skill. This was standard operating procedure throughout the years of military and domestic remote viewing programs. Feedback to the remote viewer of any kind was rare; it was kept classified and secret.<ref name="autogenerated3">''Memoirs of a Psychic Spy: The Remarkable Life of U.S. Government Remote Viewer 001'' by Joseph McMoneagle, Hampton Roads Publishing Co., 2002, 2006.</ref>

Remote viewing attempts to sense unknown information about places or events. Normally it is performed to detect current events, but during military and domestic intelligence applications viewers claimed to sense things in the future, experiencing [[precognition]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

== History ==
In 1970, United States intelligence sources believed that the Soviet Union was spending 60 million [[Soviet_ruble#Sixth_Soviet_ruble.2C_1961_-_1991|ruble]]s annually on "[[psychotronics|psychotronic]]" research.  In response to claims that the Soviet program had produced results, the CIA initiated funding for a new program SCANATE ("scan by coordinate") in 1970.<ref name=FAS>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/program/collect/stargate.htm|title=STAR GATE [Controlled Remote Viewing]|publisher=Federation of American Scientists|date=2005-12-29}}</ref>  [[Remote viewing]] research began in 1972 at the [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI) in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], California.<ref name=FAS />  Proponents of the research said that a minimum accuracy rate of 65% required by the clients was consistently exceeded in the later experiments.<ref name=FAS />

In 1977, the [[Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence]] (ACSI) [[Systems Exploitation Detachment]] (SED) started the GONDOLA WISH program to "evaluate potential adversary applications of remote viewing."<ref name=FAS />  Army Intelligence then formalized this in mid-1978 as an operational program GRILL FLAME, based in buildings 2560 and 2561 at [[Fort Meade]], MD ([[INSCOM]] "Detachment G").<ref name=FAS />  In early 1979 the research at SRI was integrated into GRILL FLAME, which was redesignated INSCOM CENTER LANE Project (ICLP) in 1983.<ref name=FAS />  

In 1984 the existence of the program was reported by [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]], and in that year it was unfavorably received by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]].<ref name = FAS />  In late 1985 the Army funding was terminated, but the program was redesignated SUN STREAK and funded by the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] [[Scientific and Technical Intelligence Directorate]] (office code DT-S).<ref name = FAS />

In 1991 most of the contracting for the program was transferred from SRI to [[Science Applications International Corporation|SAIC]], with Edwin May controlling 70% of the contractor funds and 85% of the data.  Its security was altered from [[Special Access Program]] (SAP) to Limited Dissemination ([[LIMDIS]]), and it was given the name STAR GATE.<ref name = FAS />

In 1995, the defense appropriations bill directed that the program be transferred from DIA to CIA oversight.  The CIA commissioned a report by [[American Institutes for Research]] that found that remote viewing had not been proved to work by a psychic mechanism, and said it had not been used operationally.  The CIA subsequently cancelled and declassified the program.<ref name = FAS /><!--- I left a better version of this paragraph at [[Russell Targ]], should recover and reuse here --->

The Stargate Project created a set of protocols designed to make the research of [[clairvoyance]] and [[out-of-body experiences]] more [[Scientific method|scientific]], and to minimize as much as possible session noise and inaccuracy. The term "[[remote viewing]]" emerged as shorthand to describe this more structured approach to clairvoyance. Stargate only received a mission after all other intelligence attempts, methods, or approaches had already been exhausted.<ref>''The Ultimate Time Machine'' by Joseph McMoneagle, Hampton Roads Publishing Co., 1998, p. 21.</ref> 

It was reported that there were over 22 active military and domestic remote viewers providing data. When the project closed in 1995 this number had dwindled down to three. One was using tarot cards. People leaving the project were not replaced. According to [[Joseph McMoneagle]], "The Army ''never'' had a truly open attitude toward psychic functioning". Hence, the use of the term "giggle factor"<ref>''Mind Trek: Exploring Consciousness, Time, and Space Through Remote Viewing'' by Joseph Mcmoneagle, Hampton Roads, Publishing Co., 1997, p. 247.</ref> and the saying, "I wouldn't want to be found dead next to a psychic."<ref>''Memoirs of a Psychic Spy : The Remarkable Life of U.S. Government Remote Viewer 001'' by Joseph McMoneagle, Hampton Roads Publishing Co., 2002, 2006,  Revised and updated version of McMoneagles' ''The Stargate Chronicles'', first edition.</ref>

In 1995, the project was transferred to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and a retrospective evaluation of the results was done. The appointed panel consisted primarily of [[Jessica Utts]] and [[Ray Hyman]]. A report by Utts claimed the results were evidence of psychic functioning, however Hyman in his report argued Utts' conclusion that ESP had been proven to exist, especially precognition, was premature and the findings had not been independently replicated.<ref>[http://www.mceagle.com/remote-viewing/refs/science/air/hyman.html Evaluation of a Program on Anomalous Mental Phenomena] by [[Ray Hyman]].</ref> Hyman came to the conclusion:

<blockquote>Psychologists, such as myself, who study subjective validation find nothing striking or surprising in the reported matching of reports against targets in the Stargate data. The overwhelming amount of data generated by the viewers is vague, general, and way off target. The few apparent hits are just what we would expect if nothing other than reasonable guessing and subjective validation are operating.<ref>[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/evidence_for_psychic_functioning_claims_vs._reality The Evidence for Psychic Functioning: Claims vs. Reality] by [[Ray Hyman]].</ref></blockquote>

A later report by the American Institutes for Research (AIR) also came to a negative conclusion. [[Joe Nickell]] has written:

<blockquote>Other evaluators-two psychologists from AIR assessed the potential intelligence-gathering usefulness of remote viewing. They concluded that the alleged psychic technique was of dubious value and lacked the concreteness and reliability necessary for it to be used as a basis for making decisions or taking action. The final report found “reason to suspect” that in “some well publicised cases of dramatic hits” the remote viewers might have had “substantially more background information” than might otherwise be apparent.<ref>[http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/remotely_viewed_the_charlie_jordan_case/ Remotely Viewed? The Charlie Jordan Case] by [[Joe Nickell]].</ref></blockquote>

Based upon the collected findings, which recommended a higher level of critical research and tighter controls, the CIA terminated the 20 million dollar project, citing a lack of documented evidence that the program had any value to the intelligence community. ''Time'' magazine stated in 1995 three full-time psychics were still working on a $500,000-a-year budget out of [[Fort Meade]], [[Maryland]], which would soon close.<ref name="Time">{{cite web | publisher= Time magazine | date = 1995-12-11 | page = 45 | title = The Vision Thing | first = Douglas | last = Waller | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983829,00.html}}</ref>

According to the American Institute for Research, which performed a review of the project, no remote viewing report ever provided actionable information for any intelligence operation.<ref name="psiland"/><ref name="Time"/>

===Official statement===

The Stargate Project was claimed to have been terminated in 1995 following an independent review which concluded:

{{quotation|The foregoing observations provide a compelling argument against continuation of the program within the intelligence community. Even though a statistically significant effect has been observed in the laboratory, it remains unclear whether the existence of a paranormal phenomenon, remote viewing, has been demonstrated. The laboratory studies do not provide evidence regarding the origins or nature of the phenomenon, assuming it exists, nor do they address an important methodological issue of inter-judge reliability.<br />
<br />
Further, even if it could be demonstrated unequivocally that a paranormal phenomenon occurs under the conditions present in the laboratory paradigm, these conditions have limited applicability and utility for intelligence gathering operations. For example, the nature of the remote viewing targets are vastly dissimilar, as are the specific tasks required of the remote viewers. Most importantly, the information provided by remote viewing is vague and ambiguous, making it difficult, if not impossible, for the technique to yield information of sufficient quality and accuracy of information for actionable intelligence. Thus, we conclude that continued use of remote viewing in intelligence gathering operations is not warranted.|Executive summary, "An Evaluation of Remote Viewing: Research and Applications", American Institutes for Research, Sept. 29, 1995<ref>[http://www.lfr.org/lfr/csl/library/AirReport.pdf Executive summary], "An Evaluation of Remote Viewing: Research and Applications", American Institutes for Research, Sept. 29, 1995</ref>}}

===Ingo Swann===
{{Main|Ingo Swann}}
Originally tested in the "Phase One" were OOBE-Beacon "RV" experiments at The [[American Society for Psychical Research]], under research director Dr. [[Karlis Osis]]. A former [[Operating Thetan|OT VII]] Scientologist, who alleged to have coined the term 'remote viewing' as a derivation of protocols originally developed by [[René Warcollier]], a French chemical engineer in the early 20th century, documented in the book ''Mind to Mind''. Swann's achievement was to break free from the conventional mold of casual experimentation and candidate burn out, and develop a viable set of protocols that put clairvoyance within a framework named “Coordinate Remote Viewing” (CRV). In a 1995 letter [[Edwin C. May, Ph.D.|Ed May]] wrote he had not used Swann for two years because there were rumors of him briefing a high level person at [[Science Applications International Corporation|SAIC]] on remote viewing and aliens, ETs.<ref name="autogenerated4"> Beginning in 1976, Dr. May joined the ongoing, U.S. Government-sponsored work at SRI International (formerly called Stanford Research Institute). In 1985, he inherited the program directorship of what was now called the Cognitive Sciences Program. Dr. May shifted that program to Science Applications International Corporation in 1991. Dr. May’s association with government-sponsored parapsychology research ended in 1995, when the program, now called STAR GATE, was closed.</ref>

===Pat Price===
A former Burbank, California, police officer who participated in a number of [[Cold War]] era [[Remote viewing]] experiments, including the US government sponsored project [[SCANATE]] and the Stargate Project. Working with maps and photographs provided to him by the CIA, Price claimed to have been able to retrieve information from facilities behind Soviet Lines. He is probably best known for his sketches of cranes and gantries which appeared to conform to CIA intelligence photographs. At the time, his claims were taken seriously by the CIA.<ref name=multiple1>

==Military personnel==
===Major General Albert Stubblebine===
{{Main|Albert Stubblebine}}
A key sponsor of the research internally at [[Fort Meade]], MD, MG Stubblebine was convinced of the reality of a wide variety of psychic phenomena.  He required that all of his Battalion Commanders learn how to bend spoons a la [[Uri Geller]], and he himself attempted several psychic feats, even attempting to walk through walls. In the early 1980s he was responsible for the [[United States Army Intelligence and Security Command]] (INSCOM), during which time the remote viewing project in the US Army began. Some commentators have confused a "Project Jedi", allegedly run by [[United States Army Special Forces|Special Forces]] primarily out of [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina|Fort Bragg]], with Stargate. After some controversy involving these experiments and alleged security violations from uncleared civilian psychics working in Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs), Major General Stubblebine was placed on retirement.  His successor as the INSCOM commander was Major General [[Harry Soyster]], who had a reputation as a much more conservative and conventional intelligence officer. MG Soyster was not amenable to continuing paranormal experiments and the Army's participation in Project Stargate ended during his tenure.<ref name="autogenerated3" />

===Joseph McMoneagle===
{{Main|Joseph McMoneagle}}
McMoneagle claims he had a remarkable memory of very early childhood events. He grew up surrounded by alcoholism, abuse, and poverty. As a child, he had visions at night when scared, and first began to hone his psychic abilities in his teens for his own protection when he hitchhiked. He enlisted to get away. McMoneagle became an experimental remote viewer, while serving in U.S. Army Intelligence.<ref>

===Ed Dames===
Dames was one of the first five Army students trained by Ingo Swann through Stage 3 in coordinate remote viewing.  Because Dames' role was intended to be as session monitor and analyst as an aid to Fred Atwater{{cn|date=May 2014}} rather than a remote viewer, Dames received no further formal remote viewing training. After his assignment to the remote viewing unit at the end of January 1986, he was used to "run" remote viewers (as monitor) and provide training and practice sessions to viewer personnel.  He soon established a reputation for pushing CRV to extremes, with target sessions on [[Atlantis]], [[Mars]], [[UFO]]s, and aliens. He has been a guest more than 30 times on the [[Coast to Coast AM]] radio show.<ref>[http://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/dames-major-ed/5589 Ed Dames on Coast to Coast AM]</ref>

== Taxonomy ==
The [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] differences within the species ''C. pepo'' are so vast that its various subspecies and [[cultivar]]s have been misidentified as totally separate species. These vast differences are rooted in its widespread geographic distribution.<ref name="deckerwalters" /> ''C. pepo'' is one of the oldest, if not the oldest domesticated species.<ref name="nee" /><ref name = "gibbonames238">{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Guy E.|last2=Ames|first2=Kenneth M.|title=Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|location=New York||year=1998|page=238|isbn=978-0-815-30725-9}}</ref><ref name="tamu">{{cite web|publisher=Texas A&M Bioinformatics Working Group|url=http://botany.csdl.tamu.edu/FLORA/flcp/flcp3.htm|title=Free-living ''Cucurbita pepo'' in the United States Viral Resistance, Gene Flow, and Risk Assessment|accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref> The oldest known locations are in southern Mexico in [[Oaxaca]] 8,000-10,000 years ago and [[Ocampo, Tamaulipas]], Mexico about 7,000 years ago.<ref name="nee" /><ref name = "gibbonames238" /><ref name="tamu" /> Its ancient territory extended north into [[Texas]] and up the [[Mississippi River|Greater Mississippi River Valley]] into [[Illinois]] and east to Florida, and possibly even to Maine.<ref name="deckerwalters" /> It is known to have appeared in [[Missouri]] at least 4,000 years ago.<ref name="saade">{{cite web|last1=Saade|first1=R.

Debates about the origin of ''C. pepo'' have been going on since at least 1857.<ref name="kirkpatrick">{{cite jstor|2444217}}</ref> There have traditionally been two opposing theories about its origin: 1) that ''C. pepo'' is a direct descendant of ''C. texana'' and 2) that ''C. texana'' is [[Feral organism|feral]] ''C. pepo''.<ref name="nee" /> A more recent theory is that it is a descendant of ''C. fraterna'' and hybridized with ''C. texana'';<ref name="andres2" /> resulting in two distinct domestication events in two different areas: one in Mexico and one in the eastern United States, with ''C. fraterna'' and ''C. texana'', respectively, as the ancestral species.<ref name="saade" /><ref name="andres2" /><ref name="sanjur" /><ref name="soltis">{{cite book|last1=Soltis|first1=Douglas E.|last2=Soltis|first2=Pamela S.|title=Isozymes in Plant Biology|page=176|location=London|publisher=Dioscorodes Press|isbn=0-412-36500-6}}</ref> ''C. pepo'' may have appeared in the Old World prior to moving from Mexico into South America.<ref name="saade" /> 

It is found from sea level to slightly above {{convert|2000|m|ft}}. Leaves have 3-5 lobes and are 20–35&nbsp;cm wide. All the subspecies, varieties, and [[cultivar]]s are [[Conspecificity|conspecific]] and [[Hybrid (biology)|interfertile]]. [[RAPD|Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA]] (RAPD [[DNA]]) has proven useful in sorting out the relationships of the ''C. pepo'' species, varieties, and cultivars, showing that few, if any, modern cultivars have their origins with ''C. texana.'' They are associated with ''C. fraterna'' or a still unknown ancestral specimen in southern Mexico.<ref name="deckerwalters" /> 

Wild ''C. pepo'' is still found in the same areas as ''C. fraterna'' in Mexico. Their [[isozyme]]s are very similar. ''C. pepo'' has more similarities to ''C. fraterna'', than it does to ''C. texana,'' which is also claimed to be an ancestor of ''C. pepo''. All studied ''C. fraterna'' [[allele]]s are also found in ''C. pepo''.<ref name="andres2" /> Consequently ''C. fraterna'' is the nearest relative of ''C. pepo''. ''C. pepo'' is most likely an early domesticated form of ''C. fraterna''. It crosses well with both ''C. pepo'' and ''C. texana''. Unlike most wild ''Cucurbita'', some fruit specimens of ''C. fraterna'' have been found that were not bitter. Its usual habitat is dry upland scrub areas. ''C. pepo'' could be a [[compilospecies]] of ''C. fraterna'' and ''C. texana'', which appear to be two species that were originally separate.<ref name="andres2">{{cite journal|last=Andres|first= Thomas C.|year=1987|title=''Cucurbita fraterna'', the Closest Wild Relative and Progenitor of ''C. pepo''|url=http://cuke.hort.ncsu.edu/cgc/cgc10/cgc10-36.html|journal= Cucurbit Genetics Cooperative Report|publisher=North Carolina State University|location=Raleigh, NC|volume=10|pages=69–71}}</ref><ref name="sanjur">{{cite jstor|3057572}}</ref> Based on genetic allele analysis, there are two distinct groups within ''C. pepo'': pumpkin, calabaza, criolla, and marrow squash are in one; and ornamental gourds, crookneck, acorn, scallop, and a few others in the second one.

'''Binge eating''' is a pattern of [[disordered eating]] which consists of episodes of uncontrollable eating. It is sometimes a symptom of [[binge eating disorder]] or [[compulsive overeating]] disorder. During such binges, a person rapidly consumes an excessive amount of food. Most people who have eating binges try to hide this behavior from others, and often feel ashamed about being overweight or depressed about their overeating. Although people who do not have any [[eating disorder]] may occasionally experience episodes of overeating, frequent binge eating is often a symptom of an [[eating disorder]].

About one in five young women report that they have had binge-eating symptoms, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Women account for about 60% of binge-eating disorder symptoms.

Binge-eating disorder, as the name implies, is characterized by uncontrollable, excessive eating, followed by feelings of shame and guilt. Unlike those with bulimia, those with binge-eating disorder symptoms typically do not purge their food, fast, or excessively exercise to compensate for binges. Additionally, these individuals tend to diet more often, enroll in weight-control programs and have a history of family obesity. <ref name=Abnormal>{{cite book|last=Nolen-Hoeksema|first=Susan|title=(Ab)normal Psychology|date=2013|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=0078035384|page=345-346}}</ref> However, many who have bulimia also have binge-eating disorder.

'''Hasim Sharif Rahman''' (born November 7, 1972) is an [[United States|American]] professional [[Boxing|boxer]]. Rahman is the former [[Lineal championship|Lineal]], [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]], & [[IBF]] heavyweight champion. He won the titles in 2001 with a shock defeat of [[Lennox Lewis]] by KO in the fifth round, subsequently losing them back to Lewis in the rematch, which was Rahman's first title defense.

Nicknamed "The Rock", Rahman began his professional career on December 3, 1994, at age 22.

Rahman lives in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], and trains in [[Rochester, New York]].<ref>[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-03-13/sports/0603130039_1_rahman-rochester-donovan]</ref>

==Professional career==
===1994-1997: Prospect===
Rahman got a relatively late start in the sport.  He was an enforcer for [[drug dealers]], and was known for surviving several shootings.<ref>http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2001/Nov-11-Sun-2001/sports/17422300.html</ref>  He nearly died in a car accident (which left him with permanent scarring on his cheek and ear) and once survived a shooting where five bullets entered his body.<ref>http://www.baltimoresun.com/about/bal-5rahman,0,1174653.story</ref>  He took up boxing at age 20 and had just 10 amateur bouts before making his pro debut on December 3, 1994, at age 22.

Despite his inexperience, Rahman had obvious natural boxing skills that propelled him to 11 [[knockout]] wins in his first 12 fights. Then he took a step up in class in March 1996 with a 10-round decision win over veteran [[Ross Puritty]] and seven months later, he repeated the feat against former world champion [[Trevor Berbick]].

In July 1997, he won the regional [[United States Boxing Association|USBA]] heavyweight title, and four months later, he added another regional belt, the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] Intercontinental heavyweight title. Defending the USBA title three times and the Intercontinental belt twice. By the fall of 1998, he was ranked as one of the top five heavyweights in the world.

===1998-2000: Contention===
On December 19, 1998, Rahman faced fellow contender [[David Tua]] in a fight to determine the IBF's mandatory contender. Rahman was using his power jab well, out boxing Tua virtually every round. At the end of the 9th round Tua staggered Rahman with a devastating punch that dazed him. At the beginning of the next round Tua pounced on him immediately and the referee jumped in when Rahman was bobbing and weaving. Tua won by [[Knockout#Technical knockout|TKO]]. It was argued that it should have been a [[Disqualification (boxing)|DQ]].

Because of the controversial nature of the loss, Rahman's ranking did not suffer, but in November 1999, he was knocked out by [[Oleg Maskaev]] in the eighth round of a fight he looked to be winning. At one point during the match, Rahman was knocked through the ropes onto the floor, hitting his head on the floor. Hasim dropped out of the ''[[Ring Magazine]]'' top 10 as a result of the surprise loss. Rahman later said that he had seen Maskaev earlier in his career get knocked out in the first round by former champion [[Oliver McCall]] and he assumed he was brought in as an easy win. Because of this, he did not train as hard as he should have and was beaten.

===2001: First World Title & Lewis Rivalry===
{{Main|Lennox Lewis vs. Hasim Rahman|Hasim Rahman vs. Lennox Lewis II}}
Rahman came back with three wins, including one in May 2000 over [[Corrie Sanders]] in a war in which he was dropped twice and came back to win in 7, and after that he was moved back up in the rankings. Finally, on April 22, 2001, Rahman earned a shot at [[Lennox Lewis]] the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] and [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] heavyweight champion with a win over Frankie Swindell.  Rahman beat Swindell via 7th-round [[Referee technical decision|RTD]].

In the fight, held at [[Brakpan, Gauteng|Brakpan]], [[South Africa]], Lewis and Rahman traded hard blows for five rounds before Rahman, a 20-to-1 underdog, stunned the crowd by defeating Lewis via 5th-round [[Knockout|KO]]. It was only the second loss of Lewis' career.  His first was on September 24, 1994, when Oliver McCall defeated him via 2nd-round TKO.

Lewis had an immediate-rematch clause in the contract for his defense against Hasim, and chose to invoke it.  Rahman and his new promoter, [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]], made plans to defend the titles against [[David Izon]], rather than giving Lewis his rematch.  Lewis sued Rahman in [[U.S. federal court]] to enforce their contract.  The judge, Neil McCluskey sided with Lewis and on November 17, 2001, in Las Vegas, the two men met again. This time, Lewis knocked Rahman out in the fourth round.

===2002-2004: Comeback===
Rahman's comeback fight ended in disappointment, he was beaten by a technical decision by aging former champion [[Evander Holyfield]] after headbutts from Holyfield caused a massive swelling (severe [[hematoma]]) on Rahman's forehead. On March 29, 2003, Rahman faced Tua for a second time. The fight was ruled a draw after one judge scored it for Rahman, a second for Tua and a third had the score even. Rahman came in at the heaviest weight of his career. In June, Rahman was elevated to the No. 1 contender's position by the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]]. On December 13, Rahman was matched with former [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] world champion [[John Ruiz]], in a match for an Interim WBA heavyweight title (caused by [[Roy Jones, Jr.]] deciding whether he wanted to stay a heavyweight or return to Light Heavyweight).  Rahman was favored, but he lost by (twelve round) unanimous decision and again was out of condition.

After this defeat, Rahman stepped back to a lower level of competition and defeated four journeyman fighters while working to get back into shape. His efforts paid off when he was rewarded with a fight against [[Kali Meehan]] on November 13, 2004.  The fight was an elimination bout for the IBF, WBA, and WBC, with the winner being the number-one contender in more than one world-title organization. Rahman scored the victory by a fourth-round knockout at New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]].

===2005: Second World Title & Klitschko Cancellation===
The WBC designated Rahman as [[Vitali Klitschko]]'s next mandatory challenger; the fight was set for April 30, 2005.  Klitschko injured his thigh while training for the fight, so it was rescheduled for June 18.  As this date approached, Klitschko's camp said that the thigh had not fully healed; the WBC made July 23 the new fight date. Soon after this second postponement, Vitali's doctors reportedly discovered back injuries that they said demanded minor-yet-immediate corrective surgery.  The WBC pushed Rahman's title shot back again, this time to November 12; Rahman's share of the purse following this match would reportedly be around US$4.2&nbsp;million.

After this third rescheduling, Rahman, fought for a WBC "Interim" heavyweight championship and defeated [[Monte Barrett]] on August 13, 2005, via unanimous decision.

At this point, Klitschko would be stripped of his WBC title if his first fight back was not against Rahman.  On November 7, it was announced that Klitschko had suffered severe right knee injuries during training; the WBC said it would strip him of the championship if he was unable to box within 60–90 days of a soon-to-be-announced base date.  However, on November 9, Vitali Klitschko retired instead. On November 10, 2005, the WBC voted to award its heavyweight championship to Rahman, making Rahman a two-time heavyweight champion.

On December 9, 2005, a  [[U.S. Bankruptcy Court]] judge ended Rahman's contract with Don King and he signed instead with [[Top Rank Boxing]].<ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2254873</ref>

===2006: Toney & Maskaev Title Fights===
<!-- [[File:OlegMaskaev.png|thumb|right|200px|Oleg Maskaev vs. Hasim Rahman II; photo courtesy Bret Newton.]] -->
On March 18, 2006, Rahman fought [[James Toney]] to a draw, in a 12-round fight in [[Atlantic City]], New Jersey, and he retained the WBC heavyweight title. On August 12, 2006, Rahman lost the WBC heavyweight championship to rival [[Oleg Maskaev]] by 12th Round TKO in a mandatory defense of his title. Afterwards he said he should have followed his trainer's game plan.

===2007: Second Comeback===
[[File:Hasim Rahman.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hasim Rahman in 2008]]
After a long layoff, Rahman resumed his career with a ten-round unanimous decision over [[Taurus Sykes]] June 14, 2007, at [[The Main Street Armory]] in [[Rochester, New York]].<ref>http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070615/SPORTS/706150358/-1/archive1</ref> Rahman then fought three times in three months defeating Dicky Ryan by second round TKO on September 7, 2007. Hasim followed up by stopping Cerrone Fox on October 18, 2007.  On November 15, 2007, Rahman then scored a 10th round TKO for the [[North American Boxing Federation|NABF]] title against [[Zuri Lawrence]].

===2008: Toney II & Klitschko Title Shot===
On July 16, 2008, Rahman was stopped by an accidental headbutt against James Toney.  Toney was originally awarded a TKO victory as the referee declared Rahman had quit between rounds, nonetheless, the TKO victory was overturned and changed to a [[No contest (combat sports)|No Contest]] due to the headbutt.

Rahman lost to [[Wladimir Klitschko]] (TKO in the 7th round) on December 13, 2008, for his WBO, IBO & IBF titles in a fight some believe showed himself to be past his best. Klitschko dominated the fight, winning every round while making good use of his left jab. Rahman seemed unable to withstand the Ukrainian's punch power. The referee called a stop to the contest in the 7th round after Rahman failed to respond to a series of shots.

===2009-2011: Layoff & Third Comeback===
In an interview dated February 26, 2009, with DreamFighters.com, Rahman expressed his interest in crossing over into [[mixed martial arts]].<ref>http://dreamfighters.com/?p=1588</ref>

Fifteen months after the seventh round loss to [[Wladimir Klitschko]] in December 2008, Rahman made a comeback against 43 year old journeyman Clinton Boldridge winning the fight via TKO 1. The former world champion next fought on June 19, 2010, against journeyman Shannon Miller (16–4, 9 KO) in a match that took in the Niagara Falls Conference Centre, [[Niagara Falls]], New York, United States. Rahman came into the ring at 260 pounds and won the bout by TKO in the 4th round, after sending Miller down in each of the four rounds.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&id=28652 | title =Hasim Rahman Destroys Shannon Miller in Four Round | last =Vester | first =Mark | work = | publisher =BoxingScene.com | date =June 20, 2010 | accessdate =June 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.boxingnews24.com/2010/06/rahman-stops-miller/ | title =Rahman stops Miller | last =Kim | first =Jason | work = | publisher =BoxingNews24.com | date =June 20, 2010 | accessdate =June 20, 2010}}</ref> He then won his next three fights (all by knockout), against Damon Reed, Marcus McGee and Galen Brown. His win over Galen Brown marked Rahmans 50th professional win in his career. He is now 5-1 (all  wins via knock out) since his loss to Wladimir Klitschko. 

===2012: Title Shot Vs. Povetkin===
He was elevated to the WBA number one contender to face [[Alexander Povetkin]] on September 29 - 2012, for the WBA regular heavyweight championship.<ref>http://rt.com/sport/boxing/povetkin-rahman-wba-cohen-211/</ref>

Povetkin beat Rahman via 2nd-round TKO.

===2014: Super 8 Tournament===
In yet another attempt to re-enter the heavyweight scene Rahman signed up for the super 8 tournament, an elimination-style event staged in Auckland, New Zealand. But despite holding the tag as tournament favorite the ageing Rahman was outpointed by little-known club fighter  [[Anthony Nansen]] in the quarter-final on the 4th June 2014.

Since 2006, Kemp has received international recognition as an investigative journalist for his critically acclaimed and award-winning documentary series ''Ross Kemp on Gangs''.

==Acting career==

===Early career===
Kemp first came to notice in a TV commercial for [[Kellogg's]] [[Fruit 'n Fibre]] breakfast cereal. Other roles included, for example, in 1986, playing Graham Lodsworth in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] soap opera ''Emmerdale Farm'' (now ''[[Emmerdale]]''). He then made guest appearances in episodes of ''[[London's Burning]]'' and ''[[Birds of a Feather]]''. He was in a film called ''[[Playing Away]]'' in 1987 in a minor role alongside [[Neil Morrissey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0447360/awards|title=Ross Kemp – Awards|publisher=IMDB}}</ref>

===''EastEnders''===
His most famous role to date is that of hardman Grant Mitchell in the BBC soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]''. Kemp made his debut in February 1990. On-screen, Kemp, as Grant, was often at the centre of ''EastEnders''' plots, amongst them abusive marriages to [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) and [[Tiffany Mitchell]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]), and the "[[Sharongate]]" storyline, that saw Grant's brother [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) conduct an affair with his wife.

Kemp announced his departure from the show in April 1999, his last appearance being aired in October 1999 when his character moved to [[Brazil]]. Kemp refused to rule out an eventual return to ''EastEnders'', and various media reports over the next few years speculated that he would be returning to the series. In early 2005, the BBC confirmed that Kemp would be returning to ''EastEnders'' later that year after six years away. Kemp joked that he originally auditioned to play the part of Wellard the dog. It was co-star [[Barbara Windsor]] who convinced him to go back for a brief period.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a21365/ross-kemp-finally-lured-back-to-eastenders.html Soaps – News – Ross Kemp finally lured back to 'EastEnders' – Digital Spy]</ref> His first comeback lasted just a few weeks in 2005, but he returned for a period of three months in 2006, before departing once again in June that year. BBC bosses have left Kemp's role open for a possible future return. Kemp has won various awards for his portrayal of Grant.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0447360/awards</ref>

In December 2008, [[Barbara Windsor]], Kemp's onscreen mother Peggy publicly called for Kemp to return to the role of Grant. In September 2009, [[Steve McFadden]] (Phil) and [[Danniella Westbrook]] (Sam), Kemp's onscreen siblings, also expressed their desire to have him back on the show.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a176366/westbrook-mcfadden-wed-love-grant-back.html Westbrook, McFadden: 'We'd love Grant back']</ref> Kemp has not ruled out returning to the soap again, but he said a return would not be any time soon.

===Other roles===
Following his initial departure from ''EastEnders'', Kemp moved from the BBC to ITV for a reported £1.2 million. Kemp's first role for ITV was in ''Hero of the Hour''. During its filming, on 27 October 1999, Kemp required hospital treatment after being shot in the face when a stunt went wrong. He suffered cuts to his chest and face after safety glass shattered, and was also hit in the face by the discharge from a blank round. He was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to Barnet Hospital in north London, but made a full recovery. although he was facing 2–5 months of recovery after the incident

He also starred as the lead in ITV's Christmas edition of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. He took the lead roles in the television series, ''Without Motive'' and ''In Defence'' in 2000, and in 2002's ''[[Ultimate Force]]'', where he took the role of Army Staff sergeant Henry Garvie from the British [[Special Air Service]]. He continued to appear in this role until 2006. He also gained the role of "Cirra" in the 2004 TV film, ''[[Spartacus (2004 film)|Spartacus]]''. [[Gerald Seymour]]'s ''A Line in the Sand'' in which he starred as a businessman at danger from an Iranian hit-man, was due to be aired in September 2001, but was considered too sensitive because it dealt with Iran's alleged nuclear weapons program and was not shown until 2004.

In 2005, Kemp appeared in an episode of BBC's ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' and in a two-part adaptation of the [[Gerald Seymour]] novel ''A Line in the Sand'' for ITV, and he has also presented, on ''[[The Friday Night Project]]'' and as a stand in host on ''[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]'' (2007; 2008).

Kemp appeared in the 4th episode of [[Top Gear (series 14)|Series 14]] of BBC's motoring show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''. He was the "Man in Boot" of a [[Renault Twingo]] Sport being tested by [[Jeremy Clarkson]]. The test ended with Clarkson driving the car off the quayside of [[Belfast Harbour]], after which Clarkson joked that Kemp was killed.<ref>[http://www.inautonews.com/video-top-gear-season-14-episode-4 Video: Top Gear Season 14 Episode 4]</ref>

Kemp's success in infiltrating such notorious gangs is often accredited to his appearance as a generic bald man and tough exterior. The second series featured "[[Mara Salvatrucha|MS13]]" from [[El Salvador]], neo-Nazis in Russia, football hooligans in [[Poland]], American "[[Bloods]]" and "[[Crips]]" gangs in [[St. Louis]], and the Numbers gang in South Africa. In May 2007, ''[[Ross Kemp on Gangs]]'' was awarded a [[BAFTA]] award for factual programming. .

The show returned in September 2008 for four more episodes, starting in the Los Angeles district of [[Compton, California|Compton]]. A famously hazardous scene was filmed in Compton when gangland junior Matt 'Malicious' Ward misfired his gun in a rival gang's neighbourhood.

The show has also been released on DVD.

In early 2007 Kemp published his experiences from the TV programme in book form, in 'Ross Kemp. Gangs'.

In early 2009, ''[[Ross Kemp on Gangs]]'' began airing in the United States on the [[Investigation Discovery]] channel under the title "Gang Nation."

In preparation for the assignment, Kemp had to participate in military training for personal defence, including use of the [[SA80]] assault rifle. Kemp has a personal interest in the Royal Anglians, as he is from their recruiting area, and his father served with one of the predecessor regiments of the 1st Battalion, the [[Royal Norfolk Regiment]], in [[Cyprus]]. He has since returned to Afghanistan to film a second series of Ross Kemp in Afghanistan, which began its broadcast on Sky One on 1 February 2009, titled ''Ross Kemp Return to Afghanistan''.

He begins in London, where he discovers the economic impact of hijackings on global trade, before joining a Royal Navy anti-piracy ship in the [[Gulf of Aden]] off [[Somalia]].

Then he explores the impact of piracy in [[Nigeria]], where more people are killed in raids than anywhere else in the world. He discovers the devastating effects that pirates are having on the area's fishing fleet, with almost 300 workers killed over the past few years, and how attacks on oil tankers at the port of Lagos are threatening the country's economy.

{{Hatnote|This article is about the holiday celebrated in mainland China, Taiwan, Vietnam and by ethnic Chinese worldwide. Mid-Autumn Festival is a term sometimes also used to describe [[Chuseok]] in Korea and [[Tsukimi]] in Japan.}}

The '''Mid-Autumn Festival''' is a [[harvest festival]] celebrated by ethnic [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] peoples.<ref name="xinhua" /><ref name="vietnam-nguyen" /> The festival is held on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese [[Han calendar]] and [[Vietnamese calendar]] (within 15 days of the [[autumnal equinox]]), on the night of the [[full moon]] between early September to early October of the [[Gregorian calendar]].<ref name=xinhua>{{cite news|last=Yang|first=Fang|title=Mid-Autumn Festival and its traditions |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/culture/2011-09/12/c_131134150.htm |quote=The festival, celebrated on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese calendar, has no fixed date on the Western calendar, but the day always coincides with a full moon.}}</ref>

[[Mainland China]] listed the festival as an "intangible cultural heritage" in 2006 and a [[Public holidays in China|public holiday]] in 2008.<ref name="xinhua" /> It is also a [[Public holidays in Taiwan|public holiday in Taiwan]]. Among the Vietnamese, it is considered the second-most important holiday tradition.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Alternative names==

The Mid-Autumn Festival is also known by other names, such as:
* '''Moon Festival''' or '''Harvest Moon Festival''', because of the celebration's association with the full moon on this night, as well as the traditions of moon worship and moon gazing.
* '''Mooncake Festival''', because of the popular tradition of eating [[mooncakes]] on this occasion.
* '''Zh?ngqi? Festival''', the official name in [[pinyin]].
* '''Lantern Festival''', a term sometimes used in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]], which is not to be confused with the [[Lantern Festival]] in China that occurs on the 15th day of the first month of the Chinese calendar.
* '''Reunion Festival''', because in olden times, a woman in China would take the occasion to visit her parents before returning to celebrate with her husband and his parents.<ref name="minority-li" />
* '''Children's Festival''', in Vietnam, because of the emphasis on the celebration of children.<ref name="lee">{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Jonathan H.X.|title=Encyclopedia of Asian American folklore and folklife|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=0313350663|page=1180|coauthors=editors, Kathleen M. Nadeau,}}</ref>

==Meanings of the festival==
The festival celebrates three fundamental concepts which are closely tied to one another:
* '''Gathering''', such as family and friends coming together, or harvesting crops for the festival.
* '''Thanksgiving''', to give thanks for the harvest, or for harmonious unions
* '''Praying''' (asking for conceptual or material satisfaction), such as for babies, a spouse, beauty, longevity, or for a good future

Traditions and myths surrounding the festival are formed around these three concepts,<ref name="siu">{{cite journal|last=Siu|first=K. W. Michael|title=Lanterns of the Mid-Autumn Festival: A Reflection of Hong Kong Cultural Change|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|year=1999|volume=33|issue=2|pages=67–86|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1999.3302_67.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0022-3840.1999.3302_67.x/abstract|accessdate=10 November 2012}}</ref> although traditions have changed over time due to changes in technology, science, economy, culture, and religion.<ref name="siu" />

==Origins and development==

The Chinese have celebrated the harvest during the autumn full moon since the [[Shang Dynasty]] (c. 16th to 10th century BCE).<ref name="siu" /> Morris Berkowitz, who studied the [[Hakka people]] during the 1960s, theorizes that the harvest celebration originally began with worshiping Mountain Gods after the harvest was completed.<ref name="yu" /> The celebration as a festival only started to gain popularity during the early [[Tang Dynasty]] (618&ndash;907 CE).<ref name="xinhua" /> One legend explains that [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] started to hold formal celebrations in his palace after having explored the Moon-Palace.<ref name="siu" /> The term ''mid-autumn'' (??) first appeared in ''[[Rites of Zhou]]'', a written collection of rituals of the [[Western Zhou Dynasty]] (1046&ndash;771 BCE).<ref name="xinhua" />

[[Empress Dowager Cixi]] (late 19th century) enjoyed celebrating Mid-Autumn Festival so much that she would spend the period between the thirteenth and seventeenth day of the eighth month staging elaborate rituals.<ref name="roy">{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Christian|title=Traditional festivals: a multicultural encyclopedia|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576070891|pages=282–286}}</ref>

For the Vietnamese, in its most ancient form, the evening commemorated the dragon who brought rain for the crops.<ref name="vietnam-nguyen">{{Citation
| last=Nguyen| first=Van Huy| author-name-separator=| editor-last=Kendall| editor-first=Laurel| contribution=The Mid-Autumn Festival (Tet Trung Thu), Yesterday and Today| title = Vietnam: Journeys of Body, Mind, and Spirit| pages  = 93–106| publisher = University of California Press| publication-date = 2003
| isbn=0520238729}}</ref> Celebrants would observe the moon to divine the future of the people and harvests. Eventually the celebration came to symbolize a reverence for fertility, with prayers given for bountiful harvests, increase in livestock, and human babies. Over time, the prayers for children evolved into a celebration of children.<ref name="vietnam-nguyen" /> Confucian scholars continued the tradition of gazing at the moon, but to sip wine and improvise poetry and song.<ref name="vietnam-nguyen" /> By the early twentieth century in Hanoi, the festival had begun to assume its identity as a children's festival.<ref name="vietnam-nguyen" />

===Moon worship===

An important part of the festival celebration is moon worship. The ancient Chinese believed in rejuvenation being associated with the moon and water, and connected this concept to the [[menses]] of women, calling it "monthly water".<ref name="minority-li">{{cite book|last=Li|first=Xing|author-name-separator=|title=Festivals of China's Ethnic Minorities|year=2006|publisher=China Intercontinental Press|isbn=7508509994|pages=124–127|chapter=Chapter VI: Women's Festivals}}</ref> The [[Zhuang people]], for example, have an ancient fable saying the sun and moon are a couple and the stars are their children, and when the moon is pregnant, it becomes round, and then becomes crescent after giving birth to a child. These beliefs made it popular among women to worship and give offerings to the moon on this evening.<ref name="minority-li" /> In some areas of China, there are still customs in which "men don't worship the moon and the women don't offer sacrifices to the kitchen gods."<ref name="minority-li" />

Offerings are also made to a more well-known lunar deity, [[Chang'e]], known as the Moon Goddess of Immortality. The myths associated with Chang'e explain the origin of moon worship during this day. One version of the story is as follows, as described in Lihui Yang's ''Handbook of Chinese Mythology'':<ref name="handbook">{{cite book|last=Yang|first=Lihui|title=Handbook of Chinese mythology|year=2005|publisher=ABC-Clio|location=Santa Barbara, Calif. [u.a.]|isbn=157607806X|pages=89–90|author2=Deming An}}</ref>

<blockquote>In the ancient past, there was a hero named [[Houyi|[Hou] Yi]] who was excellent at archery. His wife was Chang'e. One year, the ten suns rose in the sky together, causing great disaster to people. Yi shot down nine of the suns and left only one to provide light. An immortal admired Yi and sent him the elixir of immortality. Yi did not want to leave Chang'e and be immortal without her, so he let Chang'e keep the elixir. But [[Feng Meng]], one of his apprentices, knew this secret. So, on the fifteenth of August in the lunar calendar, when Yi went hunting, Feng Meng broke into Yi's house and forced Chang'e to give the elixir to him. Chang'e refused to do so. Instead, she swallowed it and flew into the sky. Since she loved her husband very much and hoped to live nearby, she chose the moon for her residence. When Yi came back and learned what had happened, he felt so sad that he displayed the fruits and cakes Chang'e liked in the yard and gave sacrifices to his wife. People soon learned about these activities, and since they also were sympathetic to Chang'e they participated in these sacrifices with Yi.</blockquote>

Yang describes another version of the tale which provides a different reason for Chang'e ascending to the moon:

<blockquote>After the hero Houyi shot down nine of the ten suns, he was pronounced king by the thankful people. However, he soon became a conceited and tyrannical ruler. In order to live long without death, he asked for the elixir from [[Xiwangmu]]. But his wife, Chang'e, stole it on the fifteenth of August because she did not want the cruel king to live long and hurt more people. She took the magic potion to prevent her husband from becoming immortal. Houyi was so angry when discovered that Chang'e took the elixir, he shot at his wife as she flew toward the moon, though he missed. Chang'e fled to the moon and became the spirit of the moon. Houyi died soon because he was overcome with great anger. Thereafter, people offer a sacrifice to Chang'e on every lunar fifteenth of August to commemorate Chang'e's action.</blockquote>

==Modern celebration==

The festival was a time to enjoy the successful reaping of rice and wheat with food offerings made in honor of the moon. Today, it is still an occasion for outdoor reunions among friends and relatives to eat mooncakes and watch the moon, a symbol of harmony and unity.<ref name="stepanchuk">{{cite book|last=Stepanchuk|first=Carol|title=Mooncakes and hungry ghosts: festivals of China|year=1991|publisher=China Books & Periodicals|location=San Francisco|isbn=0835124819|author2=Wong, Charles|pages=51–60}}</ref> The festival is celebrated with many cultural or regional customs, among them:

* Burning [[incense]] in reverence to deities including [[Chang'e (mythology)|Chang'e]].
* Performance of [[dragon dance|dragon]] and [[lion dance]]s, which is mainly practiced in southern China<ref name="xinhua" /> and Vietnam.

===Lanterns===

{{Hatnote|For information on a different festival that also involve lanterns, see [[Lantern Festival]]}}

 | caption2 = Mid-Autumn Festival lanterns at a shop in Hong Kong
}}

A notable part of celebrating the holiday is the carrying of brightly lit [[lantern]]s, lighting lanterns on towers, or floating [[sky lantern]]s.<ref name="xinhua" /> One tradition involving lanterns, ''d?ng mí'' ({{zh | s=?? | t=??}}), is to write riddles on lanterns and have other people try to guess the answers.<ref name="yang">{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Lemei|title=China's Mid-Autumn Day|journal=Journal of Folklore Research|date=Sep–Dec 2006|volume=43|issue=3|pages=263&ndash;270|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4640212|accessdate=10 November 2012|publisher=Indiana University Press|doi=10.2979/jfr.2006.43.3.263}}</ref>

It is difficult to discern the original purpose of lanterns in connection to the festival, but it is certain that lanterns were not used in conjunction with moon-worship prior to the Tang Dynasty.<ref name="siu" /> Traditionally, the lantern has been used to symbolize fertility, and functioned mainly as a toy and decoration. But today the lantern has come to symbolize the festival itself.<ref name="siu" /> In the old days, lanterns were made in the image of natural things, myths, and local cultures.<ref name="siu" /> Over time, a greater variety of lanterns could be found as local cultures became influenced by their neighbors.<ref name="siu" />

As China gradually evolved from an agrarian society to a mixed agrarian-commercial one, traditions from other festivals began to be transmitted into the Mid-Autumn Festival, such as the putting of lanterns on rivers to guide the spirits of the drowned as practiced during the [[Ghost Festival]], which is observed a month before.<ref name="siu" /> Hong Kong fishermen during the [[Qing Dynasty]], for example, would put up lanterns on their boats for the Ghost Festival and keep the lanterns up until Mid-Autumn Festival.<ref name="siu" />

In Vietnam, children participate in parades with lanterns of various forms and colors. Traditionally, lanterns signified the wish for the sun's light and warmth to return after winter.<ref name="cohen">{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Barbara|title=Mid-Autumn Children's Festival|url=http://www.destinationvietnam.com/stories-photos/1055/60789485/4/con0_rec;jsessionid=96D02A8A1D3653C5D0AD9165EDC708B6|accessdate=10 November 2012|date=1 October 1995}}</ref> In addition to carrying lanterns, the children also don masks. Elaborate masks were made of [[papier-mâché]], though it is more common to find masks made of plastic nowadays.<ref name="vietnam-nguyen" /> Handcrafted shadow lanterns were an important part of Mid-Autumn displays since the 12th-century [[Ly dynasty]], often of historical figures from Vietnamese history.<ref name="vietnam-nguyen" /> Handcrafted lantern-making declined in modern times due to the availability of mass-produced plastic lanterns, which often depict internationally recognized figures such as [[Pokemon|Pokemon's]] [[Pikachu]], [[Disney]] characters, and [[Hello Kitty]].<ref name="vietnam-nguyen" />

{{Main|Mooncake}}

Making and sharing mooncakes is one of the hallmark traditions of this festival. In Chinese culture, a round shape symbolizes completeness and unity. Thus, the sharing of round mooncakes among family members signify the completeness and unity of families.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the previous two sentences.|date=December 2012}} In some areas of China, there is a tradition of making mooncakes during the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival.<ref name="chiculture1">{{cite web|url=http://www.chiculture.net/1302/html/1302festivals_b02b01.shtml |title=???? |publisher=Academy of Chinese Studies |accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref> The senior person in that household would cut the mooncakes into pieces and distribute them to each family member, signifying family reunion.<ref name="chiculture1" /> In modern times, however, making mooncakes at home has given way to the more popular custom of giving mooncakes to family members, although the meaning of maintaining familial unity remains.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the previous sentence.|date=December 2012}}

Although typical mooncakes can be around a few inches in diameter, imperial chefs have made some as large as several feet in diameter, with its surface impressed with designs of Chang'e, [[Cinnamomum_cassia|cassia]] trees, or the Moon-Palace.<ref name="stepanchuk" />  One tradition is to pile 13 mooncakes on top of each other to mimic a [[pagoda]], the number 13 being chosen to represent the 13 months in a full lunar year.<ref name="stepanchuk" />

According to Chinese folklore, a [[Turpan]] businessman offered cakes to [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] in his victory against the [[Xiongnu]] on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month. Taizong took the round cakes and pointed to the moon with a smile, saying, "I'd like to invite the toad to enjoy the ''hú'' (?) cake." After sharing the cakes with his ministers, the custom of eating these ''hú'' cakes spread throughout the country.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wei|first=Liming|author-name-separator=|title=Chinese festivals|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521186595|edition=Updated|author2=Lang, Tao}}</ref> Eventually these became known as [[mooncakes]]. Although the legend explains the beginnings of mooncake-giving, its popularity and ties to the festival began during the [[Song Dynasty]] (906&ndash;1279 CE).<ref name="siu" />

Another popular legend concerns the [[Han Chinese|Han Chinese's]] uprising against the ruling [[Mongols]] at the end of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1280–1368 CE), in which the Han Chinese used traditional mooncakes to conceal the message that they were to rebel on Mid-Autumn Day.<ref name="yang" />

Imperial dishes served on this occasion included nine-jointed lotus roots which symbolize peace, and watermelons cut in the shape of lotus petals which symbolize reunion.<ref name="stepanchuk" /> Teacups were placed on stone tables in the garden, where the family would pour [[tea]] and chat, waiting for the moment when the full moon's reflection appeared in the center of their cups.<ref name="stepanchuk" /> Owing to the timing of the plant's blossoms, [[cassia wine]] is the traditional choice for the "reunion wine" drunk on the occasion. Also, people will celebrate by eating cassia cakes and candy.<ref>Li Zhengping. ''Chinese Wine'', [http://books.google.no/books?id=Ph2QpKioOCcC&pg=PA101 p. 101].

Food offerings made to deities are placed on an altar set up in the courtyard, including apples, pears, peaches, grapes, [[pomegranate]]s, melons, oranges, and [[pomelo]]s.<ref name="tom">{{cite book|last=Tom|first=K.S.|title=Echoes from old China: life, legends, and lore of the Middle Kingdom|year=1989|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=0824812859}}</ref> One of the first decorations purchased for the celebration table is a clay statue of the [[Jade Rabbit]]. In Chinese folklore, the Jade Rabbit was an animal that lived on the moon and accompanied Chang'e. Offerings of yellow beans and cockscomb flowers were made to the Jade Rabbit.<ref name="stepanchuk" />

In Vietnam, cakes and fruits are not only consumed, but elaborately prepared as food displays. For example, glutinous rice flour and rice paste are molded into familiar animals. Pomelo sections can be fashioned into unicorns, rabbits, or dogs.<ref name="vietnam-nguyen" /> Villagers of [[Xuân La, Tây H?|Xuân La]], just south of [[Hanoi]], produce ''tò he'', figurines made from rice paste and colored with natural food dyes.<ref name="vietnam-nguyen" /> Into the early decades of the twentieth century of Vietnam, daughters of wealthy families would prepare elaborate centerpieces filled with treats for their younger siblings. Well-dressed visitors could visit to observe the daughter's handiwork as an indication of her capabilities as a wife in the future. Eventually the practice of arranging centerpieces became a tradition not just limited to wealthy families.<ref name="vietnam-nguyen" />

===Courtship and matchmaking===

The Mid-Autumn moon has traditionally been a choice occasion to celebrate marriages. Girls would pray to Chang'e to help fulfill their romantic wishes.<ref name="roy" />

In some parts of China, dances are held for young men and women to find partners. For example, young women are encouraged to throw their handkerchiefs to the crowd, and the young man who catches and returns the handkerchief has a chance at romance.<ref name="xinhua" /> In [[Daguang]], in northeast [[Guizhou Province]], young men and women of the [[Dong people]] would make an appointment at a certain place. The young women would arrive early to overhear remarks made about them by the young men. The young men would praise their lovers in front of their fellows, in which finally the listening women would walk out of the thicket. Pairs of lovers would go off to a quiet place to open their hearts to each other.<ref name="minority-li" />

Into the early decades of the twentieth century Vietnam, young men and women used the festival as a chance to meet future life companions. Groups would assemble in a courtyard and exchange verses of song while gazing at the moon. Those who performed poorly were sidelined until one young man and one young woman remained, after which they would win prizes as well as entertain matrimonial prospects.<ref name="vietnam-nguyen" />

===Games and activities===
During the 1920s and 1930s, ethnographer Chao Wei-pang conducted research on traditional games among men, women and children on or around the Mid-Autumn day in the [[Guangdong]] Province. These games relate to flights of the soul, spirit possession, or fortunetelling.<ref name="stepanchuk" />

* One type of activity, "Ascent to Heaven" ({{zh|???}} ''shàng ti?ntáng'') involves a young lady selected from a circle of women to "ascend" into the celestial realm. While being enveloped in the smoke of burning incense, she describes the beautiful sights and sounds she encounters.<ref name="stepanchuk" />
* Another activity, "Descent into the Garden" ({{zh|???}} ''luò hu?yuán''), played among younger girls, detailed each girl's visit to the heavenly gardens. According to legend, a flower tree represented her, and the number and color of the flowers indicated the sex and number of children she would have in her lifetime.<ref name="stepanchuk" />
* Men played a game called "Descent of the [[Eight Immortals]]" (''jiangbaxian''), where one of the Eight Immortals took possession of a player, who would then assume the role of a scholar or warrior.<ref name="stepanchuk" />
* Children would play a game called "Encircling the Toad" (''guanxiamo''), where the group would form a circle around a child chosen to be a Toad King and chanted a song that transformed the child into a toad. He would jump around like a toad until water was sprinkled on his head, in which he would then stop.<ref name="stepanchuk" />

===Taiwan===

In [[Taiwan]], the Mid-Autumn Festival is a public holiday. Outdoor barbecues have become a popular affair for friends and family to gather and enjoy each other's company.<ref>{{cite news|last=Yeo|first=Joanna|title=Traditional BBQ for Mid-Autumn Festival?|url=http://sg.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/traditional-bbq-mid-autumn-festival-132534304.html|accessdate=10 November 2012|newspaper=Makansutra|date=20 September 2012}}</ref> As of 2011, [[Taipei City]] designated 11 riverside parks to accommodate outdoor barbecues for the public.<ref>{{cite news|last=Liu|first=Fang|title=Mid-Autumn Festival celebrated in Taiwan |url=http://english.cntv.cn/program/cultureexpress/20110913/105995.shtml|accessdate=10 November 2012|newspaper=CNTV.CN|date=13 September 2011}}</ref>

===Hong Kong and Macau===

In [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], the day after the Mid-Autumn Festival is a public holiday rather than the festival date itself (unless that date falls on a Sunday, then Monday is also a holiday), because many celebration events are held at night. There are a number of festive activities such as lighting lanterns, but [[mooncakes]] are the most important feature there. However, people don't usually buy mooncakes for themselves, but to give their relatives as presents. People start to exchange these presents well in advance of the festival. Hence, mooncakes are sold in elegant boxes for presentation purpose. Also, the price for these boxes are not considered cheap&mdash;a four-mooncake box of the lotus seeds paste with egg yolks variety, can generally cost US$40 or more. However, as [[environmental protection]] has become a concern of the public in recent years, many mooncake manufacturers in Hong Kong have adopted practices to reduce [[packaging]] materials to practical limits.<ref name="hkepd-1">{{cite web|url=http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/environmentinhk/waste/eco_responsibility/gts_packaging.html|title=Voluntary Agreement on Management of Mooncake Packaging|last=|first=|work=|publisher=Environmental Protection Department of Hong Kong|date=2013-03-18|accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref> The mooncake manufacturers also explore in the creation of new types of mooncakes, such as [[ice-cream|ice-cream mooncake]] and [[snow skin mooncake]].

===Ethnic minorities in China===

* Korean minorities living in China near [[Changbai Mountain]] have a custom of welcoming the moon, where they put up a large conical house frame made of dry pine branches and call it a "moon house". The moonlight would shine inside for gazers to appreciate.<ref name="minority-li" />
* The [[Bouyei people]] call the occasion "Worshiping Moon Festival", where after praying to ancestors and dining together, they bring rice cakes to the doorway to worship the Moon Grandmother.<ref name="minority-li" />
* The [[Tu people]] practice a ceremony called "Beating the Moon", where they place a basin of clear water in the courtyard to reflect an image of the moon, and then beat the water surface with branches.<ref name="minority-li" />
* The [[Maonan people]] tie a bamboo near the table, on which a grapefruit is hung, with three lit incense sticks on it. This is called "Shooting the Moon".<ref name="minority-li" />

===Vietnam===
[[Image:Den ong sao.JPG|thumb|Vietnamese children celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival with traditional 5-pointed star-shaped lantern]]
The Mid-Autumn festival is named "'''T?t Trung Thu'''" in Vietnamese. It is also known as '''Children's Festival''' because of the event's emphasis on children.<ref name="lee" /> In olden times, the Vietnamese believed that children, being innocent and pure, had the closest connection to the sacred and natural world. Being close to children was seen as a way to connect with [[animism|animist]] spirits and deities.<ref name="cohen" />

Aside from the story of Chang'e (Vietnamese: H?ng Nga), there are two other popular folktales associated with the festival. The first describes the legend of ''Cu?i'', whose wife accidentally urinated on a sacred [[banyan]] tree. The tree began to float towards the moon, and Cu?i, trying to pull it back down to earth, floated to the moon with it, leaving him stranded there. Every year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, children light lanterns and participate in a procession to show Cu?i the way back to Earth.<ref name="tet">{{cite web | url=http://www.buffalotours.com/blog/festivals-in-southeast-asia-vietnams-mid-autumn-festival/ | title=Festivals in Southeast Asia: Vietnam’s Mid-Autumn Festival | publisher=Buffalotours.com | accessdate=27 Oct 2014}}</ref> The other tale involves a carp who wanted to become a dragon, and as a result, worked hard throughout the year until he was able to transform himself into a dragon.<ref name="lee" />

One important event before and during the festival are [[lion dance]]s. Dances are performed by both non-professional children's groups and trained professional groups. Lion dance groups perform on the streets, going to houses asking for permission to perform for them. If the host consents, the "lion" will come in and start dancing as a blessing of luck and fortune for the home. In return, the host gives [[lucky money]] to show their gratitude.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Philippines===

In the [[Philippines]], [[Chinese Filipino|Chinese–Filipinos]] celebrate the evening and exchange mooncakes with all Filipinos friends, families, and neighbors.<ref name="yu">{{cite book|last=Yu|first=Jose Vidamor B.|title=Inculturation of Filipino-Chinese culture mentality|year=2000|publisher=Pontificia università gregoriana|location=Roma|isbn=8876528482|pages=111&ndash;112}}</ref>  A game of chance, known as the [[mooncake dice game]], or simply mooncake game, is also played by both Chinese-Filipinos and Filipinos alike.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ember|first=Carol R.|title=Encyclopedia of diasporas : immigrant and refugee cultures around the world|year=2004|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht, Netherlands|isbn=0306483211|page=767|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|author2=Ember, Melvin |author3=Skoggard, Ian }}</ref>

'''''The Good Son''''' is a 1993 American [[psychological thriller|psychological thriller film]] directed by [[Joseph Ruben]] and written by English novelist [[Ian McEwan]]. The film stars [[Macaulay Culkin]] and [[Elijah Wood]].

==Plot==

Mark Evans ([[Elijah Wood]]) has recently experienced the death of mother, Janice ([[Ashley Crow]]). Having been assigned for a business trip out of the country, Mark is taken by his father, Jack ([[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]), to stay with his uncle Wallace ([[Daniel Hugh Kelly]]) and aunt Susan ([[Wendy Crewson]]) in Maine. Mark is re-introduced to his extended family, including his cousins Connie ([[Quinn Kay Culkin]]) and Henry ([[Macaulay Culkin]]). Mark and Henry get along at first, and Henry seems to be nice and well-mannered. In discussing the death of Mark's mother and that of Henry's baby brother Richard, however, Henry expresses an abnormal fascination with death, making Mark uneasy.

Henry continues to display increasingly [[psychopathic]] behavior, which Mark is unable to tell Wallace and Susan about due to Henry's dark threats. Later, Henry insinuates he will try to kill his sister. Terrified that something might happen to Connie, Mark spends the night in her room. The next morning, Mark awakens to find Henry has taken Connie ice skating. At the pond, Henry purposely throws his sister toward thin ice. The ice collapses and Connie nearly drowns before she is rescued and taken to the hospital. Susan becomes suspicious of Henry when he visits Connie's room, planning to smother her, but Susan, who has been sitting in the dark out of view, interrupts him.

Susan finds a rubber duck Henry has hidden; it had once belonged to Richard and was with him in the bathtub the night he drowned, after which it went missing. When Susan confronts Henry, he coldly reminds her the toy had belonged to him before it had been Richard's and asks for it back. Susan refuses, and Henry tries to take it from her. After a violent tug-of-war, Henry takes the toy and escapes to the cemetery where he throws it down a well, indicating that Richard meant nothing to him.

As Susan and Mark grow closer, Henry insinuates he will kill Susan rather than let Mark continue to develop a relationship with her. When a struggle breaks out between the two boys, Wallace locks Mark in the den. Henry asks a suspicious Susan to go for a walk with him, while Mark escapes the den and chases after them. Susan firmly asks if Henry killed his brother. Henry indirectly replies, "What if I did?" 

Horrified by what her son has become, Susan tells Henry that he needs help, but Henry flees into the woods. Susan gives chase, and upon arriving at a cliff, Henry shoves her over the edge. As Susan dangles precariously, Henry picks up a large rock he intends to throw down at her, but Mark intervenes and tackles his cousin, and they fight while Susan climbs back up. In the ensuing brawl, the boys roll off the cliff, but are caught by Susan. She arduously hangs onto both boys, each with one hand. Henry holds on with both hands, but Mark's one-handed grip begins to slip. With only enough strength to save one of them, Susan notes her disturbed son's icy-calm demeanor, confident that his mother will save him. However, Susan, now aware of her son's deeply evil nature, allows Henry to slip from her grasp and he falls to his death. Susan pulls Mark up from the ledge, and they look down upon Henry's corpse on the rocks below, before it is washed away into the sea. Susan and Mark share an emotional embrace.

When Mark returns to Arizona, he reflects upon Susan's choice to save him instead of Henry and wonders if she would make the same choice again, but knows it is something he will never ask her.

==Development==

Following the completion of his novel ''[[The Child in Time]]'', English novelist [[Ian McEwan]] was invited by 20th Century Fox to write a screenplay "about evil - possible concerning children."  McEwan recalled, "The idea was to make a low budget, high class movie, not something that Fox would naturally make a lot of money on."

Despite being well received, the end result was deemed insufficiently commercial by the parties that commissioned it, and it floated around Hollywood until being discovered by independent producer [[Mary Ann Page]]. Enthusiastic about the script, originally sent to her as a writing sample, Page tried to get the project off the ground for three and a half years. The film was briefly set up at [[Universal Studios]], during which [[Brian Gilbert (director)|Brian Gilbert]] was attached as director, but it collapsed thereafter.

Following the successes of ''[[Home Alone]]'' and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|Silence of the Lambs]]'', which respectively demonstrated the appeal of both a movie about kids and of an "extreme thriller," Fox itself chose to revisit the project, which they now saw as viable. Director [[Michael Lehmann]] (''[[Heathers]]'') became attached, [[Laurence Mark]] was appointed as a co-producer, and McEwan was called in for rewrites. [[Mary Steenburgen]] was cast as the mother with two unknowns (including [[Jesse Bradford]] as the bad seed) starring as the boys. McEwan was optimistic about the project and by November 1991, sets were being built in Maine for a production that would cost approximately $12 million.

This progress was suddenly interrupted when [[Kit Culkin]], [[Macaulay Culkin]]'s father and manager, at the time a notoriously influential force in Hollywood due to the child's stardom, wanted his son to star in the film. Wishing to prove Macaulay's capacity in a dark role, he made his part in the ''The Good Son'' a condition for his appearing in ''[[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]''. Fox agreed enthusiastically due to Culkin's bankability. As the movie was originally scheduled to shoot at the same time as ''Home Alone 2'', the start date for ''The Good Son'' was pushed back for a year, making Steenburgen no longer available but enabling [[Elijah Wood]]'s involvement.

Director Lehmann and producer Mark conflicted with the imposition, leading both to leave the project. The demanding Culkin would go on to insist that his daughter Quinn receive a role in the film and vetted replacement director [[Joseph Ruben]] (''[[Sleeping with the Enemy]]''). Furthermore, the budget had risen to an estimated $20 million.

McEwan found himself performing further rewrites that continued to simplify the story to satisfy Ruben's comparatively mainstream tastes, and was ultimately unceremoniously removed from the project altogether when another screenwriter was commissioned. Despite this, McEwan was awarded sole writing credit in [[arbitration]] when he contested a shared credit.<ref>{{cite news|title= FILM / 'I thought nothing could possibly go wrong.

==Novel==

A tie-in novel was published alongside the movie's release in 1993, written by Todd Strasser. The novel elaborates on the movie, detailing how Henry was born a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]], rather than being some personification of evil.

In the novel, Henry's mother Susan eventually discovers that Henry is unable to understand emotions like love and sorrow, and that pleasure derived from selfish actions and the torment of others are the few things he truly feels. The book also concludes differently from the movie, ending with Mark returning to Uncle Wallace's home in Maine one year later. Mark and Susan visit Henry's grave, which includes an [[epitaph]]: "Without Darkness There Can be No Light".

Also in the novelization, Wallace and Susan's date is cut short because Susan gets a feeling something is wrong at the house.

'''Glenn Thomas Jacobs''' (born April 26, 1967) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], actor and insurer.<ref>http://www.jacobsagencytn.com/about-us-2</ref> He works for [[WWE]], and is best known by his [[ring name]] '''Kane'''. Jacobs starred in his first feature film in 2006, with the release of ''[[See No Evil (2006 film)|See No Evil]]''. Jacobs began his professional wrestling career on the [[independent circuit]] in 1992. He wrestled in [[professional wrestling promotion|promotions]] such as [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] and the [[United States Wrestling Association]] before joining the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE) in <!--JACOBS DEBUTED IN THE WWF IN 1995 AS "ISAAC YANKEM DDS". HE WAS REPACKAGED AS "KANE" IN 1997.-->1995. Jacobs played various [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|characters]] until 1997, when he was repackaged as Kane, the [[wrestling mask|masked]] half-brother of [[The Undertaker]], whom Jacobs would alternatively [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] or [[tag team|team]] with as the [[Brothers of Destruction]]. Following his debut, Kane remained a pivotal component of the company's [[Attitude Era]] of the late 1990s and early 2000s, defeating [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] – described as the "poster boy" of that era<ref>{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Fin|journal=[[Power Slam]]|issue=226|title=The 10 best U.S.-style all-rounders|publisher=SW Publishing|date=July 2013|pages=31|quote='Stone Cold' came back from a devastating neck injury caused by a botched Owen Hart tombstone at SummerSlam 1997 to become wrestling's biggest star from 1998-2003.

He has continued to headline WWE pay-per-view cards through the mid 2010s.

Kane has won 18 total [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championships]] during his WWF/E career, including being a three-time world champion (having held the WWF Championship, [[ECW Championship]], and [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] once each), and is also a 12-time [[tag team]] champion, having held the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF/World Tag Team Championship]], [[WCW Tag Team Championship]], and [[WWE Tag Team Championship]]s with various partners. He is a [[Money in the Bank (2010)|2010 Money in the Bank winner]].

==Early life==
Jacobs was born in [[Torrejón de Ardoz]], [[Community of Madrid|Madrid]], to a [[United States Air Force]] family stationed in Spain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/438/438161p1.html|date=September 15, 2003|last=Dunham|first=Jeremy|title=Smackdown Countdown 2003: Kane|publisher=IGN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ca/wwfkane/interview.html|title=Calm Influence of Family at Center of Life For This WWF Dynamo.|first=Terry|last=Morrow|publisher=Knoxville News-Sentinel|date=March 26, 1999|accessdate= September 22, 2007}}</ref> Jacobs earned a degree in [[English literature]] at [[Truman State University|Northeast Missouri State University]], where he played both basketball and football.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1992–1995)===
In the ring, Jacobs was first known as Angus King<ref name="bella">{{cite web|url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art56022.asp|title=The Big Red Machine|first=Vance|last=Rowe|date=May 5, 2008|accessdate=May 22, 2008|publisher=BellaOnline}}</ref> when he debuted in the St. Louis, Missouri area with the CSWA which was owned and run by Jacobs' childhood friend Mark Morton. Jacobs later moved south and began wrestling as Doomsday, appearing in the [[United States Wrestling Association]] as The Christmas Creature and as Unabomb in [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]], where he held the [[SMW Tag Team Championship]] with [[Al Snow]] in a team called [[The Dynamic Duo]].<ref name="r040795">{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/smw/results/1995b.html#040795|title=Bluegrass Brawl III results|accessdate=October 17, 2007|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments}}</ref><ref name="smwtitles">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/tn/knoxville/smw/smw-t.html|title=Smoky Mountain Wrestling Tag Team Title|accessdate=October 17, 2007|publisher=Hisa's Puroresu Dojo}}</ref><ref name="smwsupercards">{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/smw/results/smwtitles.html#tag|title=SMW Tag Team Title|accessdate=October 21, 2007|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments}}</ref> During his time in the United States Wrestling Association, Jacobs (as Doomsday) held the [[Memphis Wrestling Southern Heavyweight Championship|USWA Heavyweight Championship]]. Jacobs also worked for [[Pro Wrestling Fujiwara Gumi]] under his real name.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE (1995–present)===
====Early gimmicks (1995–1997)====
Jacobs made his first television appearance with the [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) as Dr. Isaac Yankem, [[Dental degree|DDS]], [[Jerry Lawler]]'s private dentist, in a vignette on the June 26, 1995, episode of ''Raw''.<ref name="1995 results">[http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/95.htm 1995 results]. The History of WWE. Retrieved December 21, 2011.</ref><ref name="pwhof">{{cite book|title=The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Heels|last=Oliver|first=Greg|year=2007|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|isbn=1-55022-759-9|page=227}}</ref> Placing emphasis on Jacobs' imposing height and weight, Yankem was portrayed as a monstrous figure whom Lawler had hired for the purpose of ridding the WWF of his longtime nemesis, [[Bret Hart]]. His in-ring debut occurred at a ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'' taping on August 15, where he lost to Hart by countout.<ref name="1995 results"/> At [[SummerSlam (1995)|SummerSlam]], Jacobs was disqualified when he hung Hart by twisting him in the top and middle ropes by his neck. He lost to Hart in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]] in the [[main event]] of the October 16 episode of ''Raw'', and finally in a tag team match against Hart and [[Jinsei Shinzaki|Hakushi]], in which he was partnered with Lawler, on the November 6 episode of the show.<ref name="1995 results"/> After his initial run with Hart, Jacobs' push dwindled. His team was unsuccessful in an elimination match at [[Survivor Series (1995)|Survivor Series]]. He participated in the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|1996 Royal Rumble]] match, but the remainder of Yankem's television appearances through April were spent as a [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber to the stars]], including losses to [[The Undertaker]], [[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]], [[Marc Mero]] and [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]]. Jacobs continued to use the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] at live events through September.<ref name=K1996>[http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/96.htm 1996 results]. The History of WWE. Retrieved July 14, 2011.</ref>

Later that month, [[Sports commentary|play-by-play]] announcer [[Jim Ross]] introduced [[Rick Bognar]] as "[[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Razor Ramon]]" and Jacobs as "[[Kevin Nash|Diesel]]" as part of a storyline mocking the departure of former employees [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]] and [[Kevin Nash]] respectively, while attempting to portray Ross as a disgruntled employee. The idea proved unpopular and was dropped almost immediately, and despite receiving a [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] match against [[Owen Hart and the British Bulldog]] at [[In Your House 12: It's Time]], the gimmick's television lifespan lasted only until the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|1997 Royal Rumble]], where Jacobs was the second-to-last participant (with the exception of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], who was previously eliminated by Bret Hart but the officials did not witness the elimination, so he re-entered the ring). He continued to work live events as "Diesel" through April, but did not make any WWF appearances from then until October, as the character of Kane was gradually introduced.<ref>[http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/97.htm 1997 results].

====The Undertaker's brother and WWF Champion (1997–2000)====
{{Main|Brothers of Destruction}}
{{See also|D-Generation X}}
At April 1997's [[In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker]] event, The Undertaker launched a fireball into the face of former manager, [[Paul Bearer]], who had unsuccessfully attempted to assist his protege, [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] to victory in their [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] match. On the May 12 episode of ''Raw'', Foley reintroduced Bearer, whose face was heavily bandaged due to the burns The Undertaker had inflicted. The injury prompted Bearer to attempt to reunite with The Undertaker after a long period of mutual hostility, using the [[ultimatum]] of revealing The Undertaker's "biggest secret"; during the cryptic interview, Bearer likened the fire that had burned his face to a fire that had occurred during The Undertaker's childhood. When The Undertaker continually refused to once again align with Bearer, Bearer began tormenting him by telling him that his long-lost brother, Kane (later revealed as Bearer's son and the Undertaker's [[Sibling#half|half-brother]]), was coming to the WWF to challenge him.<ref name="pwhof"/> In the ensuing months, Bearer implied that The Undertaker had killed his family by starting a fire at their funeral home, with the exception of Kane, who was left physically and mentally scarred by the event; The Undertaker claimed that Kane, a [[pyromaniac]], was the one who started the fire and could not possibly have survived (however, in October 1998, this was exposed as a falsehood when the Undertaker confessed to burning down the home, shortly prior to his 1999 gimmick as the "dark priest" of [[The Ministry of Darkness]]).

Jacobs made his first appearance as Kane at [[Badd Blood: In Your House]] on October 5, 1997, by using The Undertaker's signature [[Tombstone Piledriver]] to cost him the victory in the first [[Hell in a Cell]] match with [[Shawn Michaels]]. In keeping with the notion that Kane had been scarred by the fire – and to conceal Jacobs' identity – the character wore a mask, sported long hair, and wore red and black ring attire that almost covered his entire body. Kane and The Undertaker [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with one another over the following year, during which time their history vis-à-vis one another was expounded. Jacobs won his first match as Kane against Mankind at [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]]. In weeks prior on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', Kane had randomly attacked other wrestlers including [[Ahmed Johnson]], [[Road Warrior Hawk]], the [[Hardy Boyz]], [[2 Cold Scorpio|Flash Funk]], and Cactus Jack/Mankind's alter ego, Dude Love. The Undertaker initially refused to face him, saying he would not fight his own "flesh and blood". After a brief partnership, Kane betrayed his brother when he cost him the WWF Championship; he [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Run-in|interfered]] in The Undertaker's WWF Championship title match with Shawn Michaels at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]]. After the match, Kane locked The Undertaker in a [[Coffin|casket]] and set it on fire, though it was later revealed that Undertaker managed to escape the casket without being seen before Kane set it on fire. This provoked The Undertaker into returning to face Kane at [[WrestleMania XIV]] on March 29. Kane was defeated by The Undertaker after three Tombstone Piledrivers. After the match Kane and Paul Bearer attacked The Undertaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/mania.html#XIV|title=WrestleMania XIV Results|accessdate=November 5, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> They continued to feud until [[Unforgiven: In Your House]] on April 26, when The Undertaker defeated Kane in an [[Professional wrestling match types#Inferno match|Inferno match]]. In this match, Bearer tried to help Kane by attacking The Undertaker; however, at one point of the match, as Kane was retreating backstage, [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] forced Kane back towards the ring, and The Undertaker attacked them both by jumping over the ring ropes surrounded by fire before setting Kane's right arm on fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/april/1998.htm|title=Unforgiven 1998 Results|accessdate=November 5, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> Over the next few months, Kane and The Undertaker continued to feud, with more details of their history being revealed in the process.

After defeating The Undertaker to win a WWF Championship title shot, Kane won the WWF Championship at the [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]] tournament, defeating [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#First Blood match|First Blood match]] after being helped by his brother. However, Kane lost the title back to Austin the next night on ''Raw''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/kingring.html#98|title=King Of The Ring 1998 Results|accessdate=November 5, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref><ref name="WWFtitle">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/30445412|title=Kane's first WWE title reign|accessdate=November 9, 2007|publisher=WWE}}</ref> He formed a tag team with Mankind, with whom he won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]] twice.<ref name="Worldtag">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/|title=World Tag Team Title History|accessdate=November 9, 2007|publisher=WWE}}</ref> After losing the titles and turning on Mankind, Kane formed a short-lived tag team with his brother. The brothers fought one another for the vacant WWF Championship at [[Judgment Day: In Your House]], with the match ending in a [[Professional wrestling#No contest|no contest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/judgment.html|title=Judgment Day 1998 Results|accessdate=November 5, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> During the match, The Undertaker betrayed Kane for Paul Bearer turning Kane face and Undertaker heel. Kane took part in the "Deadly Games" tournament for the WWF Championship at [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]] but was eliminated by The Undertaker in the quarter-finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/november/1998.htm|title=Survivor Series 1998 Results|accessdate=November 5, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> At [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]], Kane interfered in the [[Professional wrestling#Container-based variations|Buried Alive match]] between Austin and The Undertaker, by attacking The Undertaker. As a result, [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]] had Kane committed to an insane asylum.

In December 1998 however, Kane joined The Corporation, in order to stay out of the insane asylum. He was later betrayed by The Corporation and thrown out of the alliance. Shortly afterward, Kane formed a tag team with [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] and acquired a girlfriend, [[Terri Poch|Tori]]. While teaming with X-Pac, Kane evolved from being [[Speech disorder|mute]] to aided speech through an [[electrolarynx]] to speaking unaided. He also became associated with [[D-Generation X]], the faction of which X-Pac was a member. His first unaided words were the DX slogan "suck it".<ref>[http://kulasd.tripod.com/dx/dxhistory.html Degeneration X History]. Kulasd.tripod.com. Retrieved on November 29, 2011. {{verify credibility|date=July 2013}}</ref> The duo won the WWF World Tag Team Championship twice.<ref name=Worldtag/> The tag team broke apart when X-Pac turned on Kane and rejoined D-Generation X. Kane and X-Pac then engaged in a lengthy feud against each other, which was exacerbated in early 2000, when Tori betrayed Kane and joined X-Pac and D-Generation X. The former partners' feud eventually ended at [[WrestleMania 2000]], where Kane teamed with [[Solofa Fatu|Rikishi]] to defeat X-Pac and [[Road Dogg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/mania.html#2000|title=WrestleManiaXVI Results|accessdate=November 5, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Shortly after WrestleMania, Kane suffered a hand injury that kept him out of action for a month.

{{Main|The Undertaker and Kane|l1=Brothers of Destruction|}}
Kane returned on the May 29  episode of Raw, when he helped The Undertaker and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] fight off the [[McMahon-Helmsley Faction]]. His involvement in this feud culminated in a main event match at [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring]] against [[Vince McMahon|Vince]] and [[Shane McMahon]], and then-champion [[Triple H]].<ref name="KotR00">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/june/2000.htm|title=King Of The Ring 2000 Results|accessdate=November 5, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> The Undertaker and Kane's rivalry resurfaced during the match,<ref name="KotR00"/> but they patched their relationship up soon after.

Triple H later threatened to show video footage of Kane committing the act in question; however, the footage that finally aired showed Triple H (dressed as Kane) simulating mock sex with a [[mannequin]] in a casket;<ref name="wc267"/> Kane's tag team partner The Hurricane responded the following week by showing a video of Triple H (rather, someone wearing a Triple H series of masks) getting an [[enema]]. The [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] was very unpopular with fans,<ref>{{cite video|date=2006|title=McMahon|medium=DVD|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref> and was de-emphasised before the title match. Triple H defeated Kane at No Mercy, due to Triple H and Flair cheating, unifying the two titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/october/2002.htm|title=No Mercy 2002 Results|accessdate=November 3, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>

Kane then formed a tag team with [[Rob Van Dam]], with the duo eventually winning the World Tag Team Championship.<ref name=Worldtag/> After they lost their World Tag Team Championship to [[La Résistance (professional wrestling)|La Résistance]] at [[Bad Blood (2003)|Bad Blood]], Triple H offered Kane a spot in his stable [[Evolution (professional wrestling)|Evolution]]. Raw co-general manager Stone Cold Steve Austin offered Kane the opportunity to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship if he rejected Triple H's offer; however, co-general manager [[Eric Bischoff]] insisted that if Kane lost the match, he would unmask. Kane accepted Austin's offer and went to challenge Triple H the following week in [[Madison Square Garden]]. Triple H won the match following interference from his stablemates, and on the June 23, 2003 episode of ''Raw'', Kane removed his mask. He then turned heel and chokeslamed partner Van Dam, and defeated him at [[SummerSlam (2003)|SummerSlam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/august/2003.htm|title=SummerSlam 2003 Results|accessdate=October 30, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> The unmasking rendered Kane emotionally unstable, and in an interview with [[Jim Ross]], Kane attacked Ross and set him on fire. He later attacked [[Linda McMahon]] on the Raw stage. This action sparked a feud between Kane and Shane McMahon, Linda's son, with Kane defeating Shane in a Last Man Standing match at [[Unforgiven (2003)|Unforgiven]] and an ambulance match at [[Survivor Series (2003)|Survivor Series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/september/2003.htm|title=Unforgiven 2003 Results|accessdate=October 30, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref><ref name="Survivor Series 03">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/november/2003.htm|title=Survivor Series 2003 Results|accessdate=October 30, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> During the latter event, Kane also interfered in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Buried Alive match]] between Vince McMahon and The Undertaker, helping McMahon bury The Undertaker and win the match.<ref name="Survivor Series 03"/> The following month at [[Armageddon (2003)|Armageddon]], Kane competed in a triple threat match for the World Heavyweight Championship against Triple H and defending champion [[Bill Goldberg]], a match which Triple H won.

====Relationship with Lita (2004–2005)====
In January 2004, Kane took part in the [[Royal Rumble (2004)|Royal Rumble]] match. He was eliminated when he heard the bell toll from The Undertaker's entrance music, distracting and distressing Kane and enabling [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] to eliminate him. Over the following weeks, Kane repeatedly insisted that The Undertaker was "dead", only to be met with various paranormal incidents such as a rainstorm localized over the ring in which he stood. The Undertaker finally returned at [[WrestleMania XX]] (again sporting his "Deadman" persona) with Paul Bearer at his side, defeating Kane.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania20.html|title=WrestleMania XX Results|accessdate=October 30, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>

[[File:Steel Cage.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kane in a steel cage match against Edge.]]
Following his defeat at WrestleMania XX, Kane fell in love with [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]], but was spurned. This led to him kidnapping Lita in May and asking her an unknown question, to which she replied in the affirmative later that month. On the same night, Kane won a twenty-man [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] to receive a World Heavyweight Championship title shot against [[Chris Benoit]] at [[Bad Blood (2004)|Bad Blood]]. Lita later announced that she was pregnant, with [[Matt Hardy]] her then-boyfriend both on- and off- screen, assuming that he was the child's father. On the June 21 episode of ''Raw'', Kane claimed that he was the father. The following week, Kane explained that he had impregnated Lita in order to continue his legacy and justified a vicious attack on Shawn Michaels several weeks earlier by claiming that Michaels had stood in the way of him winning the World Heavyweight Championship. In order to appease Kane, General Manager Eric Bischoff gave Kane a rematch with Benoit, instructing Benoit that he could only win by submission, whereas Kane could win the title by any means. Despite dominating much of the match, Kane again lost to Benoit. Following the match, Lita came to the ring and low-blowed Kane, who initially went to chokeslam her in revenge but stopped when he realized that she was trying to force him to cause her to miscarry their child.

Kane and Matt Hardy faced one another in a "Till Death Do Us Part" match at [[SummerSlam (2004)|SummerSlam]], with Lita obliged to wed the victor. Kane defeated Hardy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2004/08/16/585826.html|title=Orton-Benoit, Guerrero-Angle save SummerSlam|date=August 16, 2004|last=Clevett|first=Jason|accessdate=November 9, 2013|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref> and "married" Lita on the August 23 episode of ''Raw''. Although he was attacked by Hardy during the ceremony, he gained the upper hand and ultimately chokeslammed Hardy off the stage (in reality, Hardy needed time off because of a knee injury and later a staph infection). On the September 13 episode of ''Raw'', Kane accidentally fell on Lita during a match with the debuting [[Gene Snitsky]], who hit him on the back with a steel chair, ostensibly causing Lita to miscarry. Kane turned face after he sought revenge against Snitsky for causing the death of his child. He lost to Snitsky in a steel chain match at [[Taboo Tuesday (2004)|Taboo Tuesday]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2004/10/20/788799.html|title=Nothing Taboo at Tuesday PPV|date=October 20, 2004|last=Sokol|first=Chris|accessdate=November 9, 2013|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref> and he was sidelined for several months after Snitsky crushed his [[larynx]] with a chair following the match. This attack was a repeat performance of the storyline where Kane "injured" Michaels in the same exact manner. The "injury" gave Kane time to complete his starring role in the film, ''[[See No Evil (2006 film)|See No Evil]]''. Kane returned in January 2005, defeating Snitsky at [[New Year's Revolution (2005)|New Year's Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2005/01/10/901074.html|title=No Revolution: Triple H prevails|date=January 10, 2005|last=Tylwalk|first=Nick|accessdate=November 9, 2013|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref> After [[WrestleMania 21]], Kane and Lita reconciled with one another and began antagonizing Lita's rival [[Trish Stratus]]. This led to a match between Kane and Stratus' hired bodyguard [[Nelson Frazier, Jr.|Viscera]] at [[Backlash (2005)|Backlash]] that was won by Kane.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2005/05/02/1021811.html|title=Hulkamania rules Backlash|date=May 2, 2005|last=Sokol|first=Chris|accessdate=November 9, 2013|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref>

Lita later turned on Kane and sided with [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], leading to a feud between Kane and Edge. Kane was able to defeat Edge at [[Vengeance (2005)|Vengeance]], despite interference from Snitsky. The feud ended when Edge defeated Kane in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Stretcher match]] on the July 25 episode of ''Raw''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2005/06/27/1106996.html|title=Batista retains with a Vengeance|date=June 27, 2005|last=Sokol|first=Chris|accessdate=November 9, 2013|work=Slam!

====Teaming with Big Show (2005–2006)====
{{main|Big Show and Kane}}
Kane returned to WWE television on October 17, 2005, winning an eighteen-man battle royal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/051017.html|title=RAW results – October 17, 2005|accessdate=October 25, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> As a result of his victory, he, along with Big Show and Shawn Michaels, was featured in an Internet poll to decide who would receive a shot at the [[WWE Championship]] at [[Taboo Tuesday (2005)|Taboo Tuesday]]. In the weeks before Taboo Tuesday, Kane and Big Show teamed together on several occasions. The poll was won by Michaels, and Kane and Big Show teamed together to face [[Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch]], defeating them for the World Tag Team Championship.<ref name=Worldtag/> The duo successfully retained their championship throughout the remainder of 2005, during which time they engaged in an inter-promotional feud with members of the SmackDown! brand. He and Big Show feuded with [[Carly Colón|Carlito]] and [[Chris Masters]] throughout early 2006, culminating in a successful title defense at [[WrestleMania 22]] on April 2. The following evening, Kane and the Big Show lost the World Tag Team Championship to [[Spirit Squad]] members [[Kenny Dykstra|Kenny]] and [[Mike Mondo|Mikey]].<ref name=Worldtag/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060403.html|title=RAW results – April 3, 2006|accessdate=October 25, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> One week later, Kane and Big Show faced Spirit Squad members [[Johnny Jeter|Johnny]] and [[Dolph Ziggler|Nicky]] in a rematch for the title, but were disqualified after Kane "snapped", ostensibly due to "voices in his head".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060410.html|title=RAW results – April 10, 2006|accessdate=October 25, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>

In subsequent weeks, Kane began attacking anyone who mentioned the date May 19. During the match between Kane and Big Show at [[Backlash (2006)|Backlash]], Kane's voice began echoing throughout the arena saying "May 19", "It's happening again" and "They're all going to know" leaving Kane visibly shaken. Big Show then struck Kane with a chair, resulting in a no contest. On May 19, Kane appeared on ''SmackDown!'' as [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield]]'s hand-picked opponent for [[Rey Mysterio]].<ref name="May 19">{{cite web|url=http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/060519.html|title=SmackDown results – May 19, 2006|accessdate=October 25, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> After both the aforementioned voices and mask video began playing, Kane chokeslammed both Layfield and Mysterio before leaving the ring.<ref name="May 19"/> On the following episode of ''Raw'', he claimed that May 19 was the date on which his mother and adopted family were killed in a fire. The voices continued on to the May 29 episode of ''Raw'', when Kane was confronted by the source of the voice, an impostor Kane ([[Drew Hankinson]]); wearing Kane's old mask and ring attire, he chokeslammed Kane during his match against [[Shelton Benjamin]] for the Intercontinental Championship. Kane and the look-alike continued to fight one another in subsequent weeks, leading to a match between the two being scheduled for [[Vengeance (2006)|Vengeance]], in which the real Kane lost to the impostor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/june/2006.htm|title=Vengeance 2006 Results|accessdate=October 25, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> On the June 26 episode of ''Raw'', Kane threw the impostor out of the arena and removed his mask, saying "I believe that this is mine."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060626.html|title=RAW results – June 26, 2006|accessdate= October 25, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> Kane was absent from WWE television for several weeks thereafter as he toured Europe to promote ''See No Evil''. Upon his return, he faced his former partner Big Show for the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW Championship]] in a losing effort. When he returned to ''Raw'', he engaged in a major feud with [[Umaga (wrestler)|Umaga]] that concluded on October 9 in a "Loser Leaves Raw" match, which Kane lost.

====Brothers of Destruction reunion and various feuds (2006–2007)====
[[File:Brothers of Destruction.jpg|thumb||Kane and the Undertaker in 2007. Kane was reunited with [[The Undertaker]] when he returned to SmackDown.]]
On October 13, Kane moved to SmackDown for the first time since the 2002 brand extension. On November 3, Kane reunited with The Undertaker as The Brothers of Destruction to defeat [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] (MVP) and [[Ken Anderson (wrestler)|Mr. Kennedy]]. Kane continued a feud with MVP competing in several gimmick matches. The end result of the feud was an Inferno match at [[Armageddon (2006)|Armageddon]]; Kane won by setting MVP's back on fire which resulted in first degree burns. Kane continued to have matches throughout the year with MVP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/december/2006.htm|title=Armageddon 2006 Results| accessdate=October 25, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>
On the ''SmackDown!'' before the [[Royal Rumble (2007)|Royal Rumble]], Kane was involved in a six-man elimination over-the-top-rope battle royal, with King Booker, MVP, [[The Miz]], Chris Benoit and [[Dave Finlay|Finlay]]. This match went to a no contest as The Undertaker interrupted after Kane had been eliminated and punished by the remaining opponents. At the Royal Rumble, Kane eliminated King Booker, but Booker re-entered the ring and eliminated Kane.<ref name="RR07">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/january/2007.htm|title=Royal Rumble 2007 Results|accessdate=October 24, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> A couple weeks later on ''SmackDown!'', while receiving the key to the city in his hometown of Houston, Booker was attacked by Kane starting a feud between the two. At [[No Way Out (2007)|No Way Out]], Kane defeated King Booker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/2007/matches/3465668112|title= Kane def.

Prior to [[WrestleMania 23]], Kane started to walk around with a hook, similar to the hook he used as Jacob Goodnight in ''See No Evil''. At the event, Kane was defeated by Khali. During the match, in homage to [[Hulk Hogan]] slamming [[André the Giant]] twenty years earlier at [[WrestleMania III]], Kane picked up Khali for the first time and body-slammed him to the mat. After WrestleMania, he began to feud with [[The Blue Bloods|William Regal and Dave Taylor]]. [[Marty Wright|The Boogeyman]] then joined the feud, teaming up with Kane. On the May 4 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Kane competed in a number one contender's match for the United States Championship held by MVP. Kane lost due to interference by Regal and Taylor. On the May 25 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Kane competed in a fatal four-way number one contender's match for the World Heavyweight Championship which was won by Batista. Kane then entered a short feud with [[Mark Henry]]. Kane was defeated by Henry in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Lumberjack match|Lumberjack match]] at [[One Night Stand (2007)|One Night Stand]] due to interference from lumberjacks Kenny Dykstra and [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/june/2007-01.htm|title=One Night Stand 2007 Results|accessdate=October 26, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> and then took a short hiatus.

On the July 6 episode of ''SmackDown!'', General Manager [[Theodore Long]] announced that Kane would face Edge for his [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] at [[The Great American Bash (2007)|The Great American Bash]]. After Edge was attacked and injured by Kane and the title was vacated, [[Dave Batista|Batista]] faced Kane in a number one contender's match. During the match, new World Heavyweight Champion The Great Khali interfered by attacking Batista; the match was ruled a no contest and both men were ruled the number one contenders, and were scheduled to face Batista in a triple threat match at the Great American Bash. Khali retained the title after pinning Kane for the win.<ref name="Great American Bash - Khali vs Batista vs Kane">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/thebash/2007/matches/408116411|title=World Heavyweight Champion The Great Khali def.

====ECW Champion (2007–2008)====
[[File:Kane - ECW Champion.jpg|left|thumb|Kane as the ECW champion in 2008.]]
He then made an appearance on the October 16 episode of ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW]]'' as the hand-chosen partner of [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW Champion]] [[CM Punk]], helping him defeat John Morrison, The Miz, and [[Nelson Frazier, Jr.|Big Daddy V]] in a three-on-two handicap match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/10162007/|title=Setting the night on fire|first=Andrew|last=Rote|accessdate=October 24, 2007|date=October 16, 2007|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> In retaliation, Big Daddy V attacked Kane on the October 19 ''SmackDown'', igniting a feud between the two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/071019.html|title=SmackDown results – October 19, 2007|accessdate=April 9, 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> The two continued to battle in the following weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/071102.html|title=SmackDown results – November 7, 2007|accessdate=April 9, 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> Kane was voted to face the defending champion MVP for his United States Championship at [[Cyber Sunday (2007)|Cyber Sunday]], which Kane won by countout and thus did not win the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/cybersunday/2007/matches/526761031|title=Kane def.

The feud concluded at [[Armageddon (2007)|Armageddon]], where Kane and Punk lost to Big Daddy V and Henry after Big Daddy V pinned CM Punk.

In a battle royal before [[WrestleMania XXIV]], Kane won by last eliminating former rival Mark Henry, earning a match for the [[ECW Championship]] against Chavo Guerrero later that night. Kane defeated Guerrero in the fastest-ever WrestleMania match with a record-setting [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Squash|eleven seconds]] to win the ECW Championship.<ref name="ECW">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/titlehistory/ecwchampionship|accessdate=June 21, 2008|title=ECW Championship official title history|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref><ref name="WM24 Res">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/WrestleMania24/2008/03/31/5148416.html|title=Mayweather, Orton survive Mania; Edge, Flair don't|date=March 31, 2008|last=Plummer|first=Dale|accessdate=November 9, 2013|work=Slam!

====World Heavyweight Champion (2008–2011)====
[[File:Kane as World Heavyweight Champion.jpg|thumb||Kane as the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] in July 2010.]]
On the July 7 episode of ''Raw'', Kane was denied a [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] match at [[The Great American Bash (2008)|The Great American Bash]] leading him to attack commentators [[Michael Cole]] and Jerry Lawler turning heel in the process. At The Great American Bash, Kane interfered and attacked both the champion CM Punk and the challenger [[Dave Batista|Batista]]. In September 2008, Kane began a feud with Rey Mysterio that lasted through [[Survivor Series (2008)|Survivor Series 2008]]. On the March 2 episode of ''Raw'', Kane pinned [[Mike Knox]] in a triple threat match, also involving Rey Mysterio, to earn a spot in the [[Money in the Bank ladder match]] at [[WrestleMania XXV]], a match ultimately won by CM Punk.<ref>[http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/03022009/ Breaking the news]. WWE. Retrieved on November 29, 2011.</ref>

During the [[WWE Draft 2009|2009 Draft]] Kane beat The [[Brian Kendrick]] for a draft pick and, later in the night, was drafted back to SmackDown. There, Kane feuded with CM Punk and defeated him to cap it off at [[Backlash (2009)|Backlash]]. He then took a break to tour India and also heal injuries, returning at [[The Bash (2009)|The Bash]] to assist [[Dolph Ziggler]] in his match with The Great Khali by hitting Khali with a steel chair, allowing Ziggler to win. This started a feud with Khali, whom he defeated at [[SummerSlam (2009)|SummerSlam]] and in a Singapore Cane match at [[WWE Breaking Point]]. Alongside Chris Jericho, Kane was co-captain for the victorious Team SmackDown at [[Bragging Rights (2009)|Bragging Rights]]. Kane then unsuccessfully challenged Jericho in a number one contender's match for an opportunity to face World Heavyweight Champion The Undertaker and Big Show in a triple threat match at [[Survivor Series (2009)|Survivor Series]]. In 2010, at [[WrestleMania XXVI]] during the Money in the Bank ladder match, Kane was unsuccessful in claiming the briefcase. Over the next few months, Kane was involved in sporadic singles matches on episodes of ''SmackDown!'', including a loss to CM Punk in  May in a qualifying match for the World Heavyweight Championship match for the [[WWE Fatal 4-Way]] pay-per-view event. The following week on ''SmackDown'', Kane stated he had found his brother The Undertaker in a "vegetative state" over [[Memorial Day]] weekend and vowed revenge on whoever was responsible. Due to The Undertaker's injury, a battle royal was held to determine his replacement for Fatal 4-Way, which Rey Mysterio won by last eliminating Kane.

Kane participated in his fourth Money in the Bank ladder match at its first [[Money in the Bank (2010)|eponymous pay-per-view]]. He won the match, and cashed in his Money in the Bank contract later that night and defeated Rey Mysterio (who had just defeated [[Jack Swagger]]) to win the World Heavyweight Championship. He became the only wrestler to cash in the Money in the Bank contract on the same night it was won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/moneyinthebank/currentepisode/14864414|title=Kane won SmackDown Money in the Bank Ladder Match|date=July 18, 2010|accessdate=July 19, 2013|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/moneyinthebank/currentepisode/14862670|title=World Champion Rey Mysterio def.

At [[SummerSlam (2010)|SummerSlam]], Kane retained the World Heavyweight Championship against Mysterio, and following their match, The Undertaker appeared. Kane was revealed as The Undertaker's attacker, reigniting their feud. He successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against The Undertaker, in a [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|No Holds Barred match]] at [[Night of Champions (2010)|Night of Champions]]. On the following episode of ''Smackdown!'', a [[casket]] was brought to ringside by [[druid]]s to reveal the return of Paul Bearer, supporting The Undertaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2010/09/25/15475181.html|title=Smackdown: Kickin’ it old school|date=September 25, 2010|last=Hillhouse|first=Dave|accessdate=October 4, 2010|work=Slam!

Kane then rekindled his feud with [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], who, on the October 28 episode of ''SmackDown!'', was named the new challenger to Kane's World Heavyweight Championship at [[Survivor Series (2010)|Survivor Series]]. On the November 12 episode of ''SmackDown'', Edge kidnapped Bearer and started to play mind games with Kane, trying to psychologically wear him down before their title match. At Survivor Series, Kane retained his title after the referee determined the match a draw due to both men pinning each other at the same time. As Edge still had Bearer in his captivity, Kane agreed to a rematch at the next pay-per-view. On December 3, Edge defeated Kane in a non-title match to win the right to determine the stipulation for the title match; Edge chose a [[Tables, Ladders and Chairs match]]. The following week, Kane accidentally injured Bearer, believing it to be another hoax by Edge, and Bearer was written out of the storyline. At [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2010)|TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs]], Kane lost the championship to Edge, in a four-way Tables, Ladders and Chairs match, also involving Mysterio and [[Alberto Del Rio]]. Kane received his rematch for the World Heavyweight Championship on the January 7, 2011 episode of ''SmackDown'' in a Last Man Standing match, but was unsuccessful. Kane competed in the [[Royal Rumble (2011)|2011 Royal Rumble match]], and was the last person to enter the match, but was eliminated by Mysterio. Kane competed in the [[Elimination Chamber (2011)|2011 Elimination Chamber]] match, eliminating [[Drew McIntyre]] and the Big Show before being eliminated by Edge.

The following month, Kane reunited with The Big Show against a common enemy, turning face in the process: [[The Corre]]. Kane and Big Show challenged them for the tag team title and saving other wrestlers from their attacks. At [[WrestleMania XXVII]], Big Show and Kane teamed with [[Santino Marella]] and [[Kofi Kingston]] to beat The Corre.<ref>{{cite web|title=WrestleMania 27 live coverage from the Georgia Dome|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/component/content/article/20116/|work=Wrestling Observer|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}</ref> The next week, a rematch took place, under two of three falls rules, which Kane's team won. On the April 22 episode of ''SmackDown'', the duo defeated Corre members [[Justin Gabriel]] and [[Heath Slater]] to win the [[WWE Tag Team Championship]], their second championship as a team.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tedesco|first=Mike|title=Smackdown Results – 4ref|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1303535352|publisher=Wrestleview|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}</ref> Big Show and Kane then started feuding with the New Nexus. After defending the titles against CM Punk and [[Mason Ryan]] at [[Over the Limit (2011)|Over the Limit]], Kane and Big Show lost the championship to [[Michael McGillicutty]] and [[David Otunga]] on the following day on ''Raw''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Plummer|first=Dale|title=RAW: Cena gets nothing but the R-Truth|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2011/05/23/18183151.html|work=SLAM!

Kane participated in the [[Money in the Bank (2011)|second annual]] SmackDown [[Money in the Bank ladder match]] but the match was won by [[Daniel Bryan]]. On the July 22 episode of ''SmackDown'', Kane was attacked by [[Mark Henry]], who injured his leg with a steel chair. WWE reported the attack had fractured Kane's [[fibula]], likely to sideline him for five months.<ref name="BrokenLeg2011">{{cite web|title=Mark Henry injures Kane|publisher=WWE|date=July 23, 2011|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2011-07-22/kane-injury|accessdate=September 16, 2011}}</ref>

In an interview conducted with the Pitch, Jacobs revealed that he has no plans to retire from WWE. Jacobs said "I’m still having fun, I’ve been fortunate in that I haven’t had any really bad injuries. I stay in good shape. I can still perform at a high level. I get in there and hang with guys that are almost half my age. And, in fact, I feel like they have to hang with me rather than me hang with them. So as long as I can do that, I’m good with WWE as long as I’m having fun and as long as that I’m performing at a level that is acceptable to me.<ref>http://www.pitch.com/FastPitch/archives/2014/10/17/wwe-superstar-kane-talks-about-his-97-raw-debut-in-kc-see-no-evil-2-undertaker-paul-bearer-and-more</ref>

'''Rubbernecking''' is the act of gawking or staring, usually stupidly and slack-jawed, at something of interest.  A common example of rubbernecking is drivers trying to view the aftermath of a [[Car accident|traffic accident]]. The term ''rubbernecking'' refers to the physical act of craning one's neck, performed in order to get a better view.<ref>Rosalind Fergusson, Eric Partridge, Paul Beale [http://books.google.com/books?id=Hvxk4FiaATwC&pg=PA178&dq=rubbernecking&lr= ''Shorter slang dictionary''] Routledge, 1994 ISBN 978-0-415-08866-4, page 178</ref>

Rubbernecking has been described as a human trait that is associated with morbid [[curiosity]].<ref>Daniel P. Franklin [Politics and film: the political culture of film in the United States] Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2006 University of Michigan ISBN 978-0-7425-3808-5, page 96</ref> It can be the cause of traffic jams (sometimes referred to as "Gapers' blocks"), as drivers slow down to see what happened in a crash. It is also a cause of further accidents in the vicinity of the original accident, as drivers become distracted and unexpectedly change their rate of travel, while other drivers are also distracted, and so forth. The word ''rubbernecking'' has also come to be used more generally to describe a voyeuristic interest in someone else's business or affairs. Fires in buildings tend to attract rubberneckers, as there is little danger for them in observing the spectacle from a distance.

The term is generally considered to be [[slang]] or unconventional English.<ref>Victor, T. and Dalzell, V. (2007), ''The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'', Routledge, p.550. ISBN 978-1134615346</ref>

==Etymology==
The term ''rubbernecking'' was a term coined in America in the 1890s to refer to tourists.<ref name="City in Slang">Irving Lewis Allen [http://books.google.com/books?id=j41z0yeKbeIC&pg=PA83&dq=rubbernecking&lr= The City in Slang: New York Life and Popular Speech] Oxford University Press US, 1995 ISBN 978-0-19-509265-3</ref> [[H.L. Mencken]] said the word ''rubberneck'' is "almost a complete treatise on American psychology" and "one of the best words ever coined".<ref name="City in Slang"/>

By 1909 ''rubbernecking'' was used to describe the wagons, automobiles and buses used in tours around American cities,<ref name="City in Slang"/> and through their Chinatowns.<ref name="Asian Americans"/> The tours included a megaphone-wielding individual offering commentary on the urban landscape.<ref name="Asian Americans">Peter X. Feng [''Screening Asian Americans''] Rutgers University Press, 2002 ISBN 9780813530253</ref> ''Chinese Rubbernecks'' was the title of a 1903 film.<ref name="Asian Americans"/>

One writer described the "out-of-towners" stretching their necks to see New York while having misinformation shouted at them, and artist [[John Sloan]] depicted them as [[geese]] in a 1917 etching called ''Seeing New York''.<ref name="City in Slang"/> [[Hawker (trade)|Hawkers]], touts and steerers were used to market the rubbernecking tours, also known as "gape wagons" or "yap wagons."<ref name="City in Slang"/>

When phone lines were shared as "[[Party line (telephony)|party lines]]" the term ''rubbernecking'' applied to someone who listened in on the conversation of others.<ref>Frederic Gomes Cassidy, Joan Houston Hall [http://books.google.com/books?id=i33BWgxbvXgC&pg=PA657&dq=rubbernecking&lr= Dictionary of American regional English] Harvard University Press, 2002 ISBN 978-0-674-00884-7, page 657</ref>

==Rubbernecking and the automobile==
{{see also|Distracted driving}}

The term is often used to refer to the activity of motorists slowing down in order to see something on the other side of a road or highway, often the scene of a traffic accident. According to a 2003 study, rubbernecking was the cause of 16 percent of distraction-related traffic accidents.<ref name="Most dangerous"/> It features in the book ''100 Most Dangerous Things in Everyday Life and What You Can Do About Them'' and is said to be factored into highway design.<ref name="Most dangerous">Laura Lee [http://books.google.com/books?id=SbiZyN-29NIC&pg=PT165&dq=rubbernecking#PPT165,M1 100 Most Dangerous Things in Everyday Life and What You Can Do About Them] 
July 1, 2004 Murdoch Books ISBN 978-1-74045-422-3, page 161</ref> The book advises that the safest course when there are flashing lights and an accident is to keep moving, "there is nothing to see here". Rubbernecking's impact on traffic has been the subject of studies.<ref>Jonathan P Masinick [http://books.google.com/books?id=iwaqNwAACAAJ&dq=rubbernecking&lr=&source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&cad=0_2 An Analysis on the Impact of Rubbernecking on Urban Freeway] 2004 University of Virginia</ref> In the United Kingdom, the [[Department for Transport]] has made use of "incident screens", plastic partitions to shield accidents from passing motorists in order to deter rubbernecking and improve the flow of traffic around accidents.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-20851775|title = Motorway screens bid to stop rubbernecking by motorists|last = |first = |date = 27 December 2012|work = |accessdate = 21 August 2014|publisher = [[BBC News]]}}</ref>

==Prevention==
In the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, incident screens have been designed that can be erected around vehicle accidents to discourage rubbernecking.<ref>[http://www.wilchem.nl/nl/innovaties/anti-kijkfile-scherm "Rubbernecking prevention using incident screens"]</ref><ref name="Incident screens">{{cite web|title=Incident Screens - Functional Specification|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120810121037/http://www.highways.gov.uk/business/19765.aspx|work=The National Archives|accessdate=2013-08-26}}</ref>

Dictionary.com http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/oldmoney</ref> The term typically describes a class of the rich who've been able to maintain their wealth over multiple generations, often referring to perceived members of the ''de facto'' aristocracy in societies which for historical reasons lack an officially established aristocratic class (typically, the United States of America).

== United States ==
American locations such as the [[Upper East Side]] of Manhattan; [[Westchester County]], New York; Long Island's [[North Shore (Long Island)|North Shore]]; [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]]; Newport, Rhode Island; Boston's [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] and [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]]; Weston and Wellesley, Massachusetts; Philadelphia's [[Philadelphia Main Line|Main Line]]; Chicago's [[North Shore (Chicago)|North Shore]] suburbs; and the [[Grosse Pointe]] area of suburban [[Detroit]], Michigan are associated with old money. Ironically, these areas' inhabitants that are colloquially described as "old money" are almost always descendants of the people the term "nouveau riche" (new money) was originally coined to describe: nineteenth century industrialists, bankers, and builders. Traditionally, wealth was associated with landowning and these Gilded Age fortunes made money in a new way, hence the term new money. [[Edith Wharton]], among [[Gilded Age]] America's greatest chroniclers, referred to industrialists and their ilk as "brazen new money".

''[[Wealth]]''—assets held by an individual or by a household—provides an important dimension of [[social stratification]] because it can pass from generation to generation, ensuring that a family's offspring will remain financially stable. Families with "old money" use accumulated assets or savings to bridge interruptions in income, thus guarding against downward [[social mobility]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia

"Old money" applies to those of the upper class whose wealth separates them from lower social classes. According to anthropologist [[W. Lloyd Warner]], the upper class in the United States during the 1930s was divided into the upper-upper and the lower-upper classes.<ref name=warner>{{Cite book

}}</ref> The lower-upper were those that did not come from traditionally wealthy families. They earned their money from investments and [[business]] rather than [[inheritance]]. In contrast to the ''[[nouveau riche]]'', the upper-upper class was families viewed as "quasi-aristocratic" and "high-society".<ref name=warner /> These had been rich for generations. They lived off idle inheritances rather than earned wealth.

During the early 20th century, the upper-upper class were seen as more prestigious.<ref name=warner />

"Old money" contrasts with the ''[[nouveau riche]]'' and ''[[parvenus]]''. These fall under the category "new money" (those not from traditionally wealthy families). Some families with "old money" include:

* The [[Roosevelt family]] of Manhattan arrived from the [[Netherlands]] as colonists and later became prominent in politics, producing presidents [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]].

* The [[Cabots]] arrived in Salem from the Isle of Jersey in 1700 and made fortunes in shipping. At the age of 21, Godfrey Lowell Cabot (see Lowells below) founded the [[Cabot Corporation]], the largest producer of carbon black in the country.

* The [[Lowell family]] are descended from Boston colonists. [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]] began the fortune in shipping and later textiles. The family has produced several noteworthy individuals, including [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]], who presided over [[Harvard]] for 24 years.

*The [[Du Pont family]] fortune began in 1803, but they became an extraordinarily wealthy family by selling [[gunpowder]] during the [[American Civil War]]. By [[World War I]], the DuPont family produced virtually all American gunpowder. In 1968, Ferdinand Lundberg declared the Du Pont fortune to be America's largest family fortune.<ref>{{Cite book

*The [[Astor family]] made their fortune in the 18th century, through real estate, the hotel industry and other investments.

Although many "old money" individuals do not rank as high on the list of [[Forbes 400]] richest Americans as they once did, their wealth continues to grow. Many families increased their holdings by investment strategies such as the pooling of resources.<ref name="Phillips">{{Cite book

== Europe ==
The [[Rothschild family]], as an example, established finance houses across Europe from the 18th century and was ennobled by the [[Habsburg]] Emperor and [[Queen Victoria]]. Throughout the 19th century, they controlled the largest fortune in the world, in today's terms many hundreds of billions, if not in trillions ([[United States dollar|US$]]). The family has, at least to some extent, maintained its wealth for over two centuries. The Rothschilds were not, however, considered "old money" by their British counterparts. In Britain, the term generally exclusively refers to the [[landed gentry]], usually the [[Hereditary peer|aristocracy and nobility]] who traditionally live off the land inherited paternally.<ref>{{Cite book

== Effects of World War II ==
Economists assert that the largest transfer of wealth will be as the older generation leaves wealth to the [[baby boomer]]s. Inheritance has been estimated to make up 6% of the US GDP each year.<ref name="haseler" />{{rp|16}} The current generation is wealthier than any generation before. This increase in wealth and inheritance indicates a rise of "old money" in American families. [[Stephen Haseler]] argues that America is becoming an inheritance culture in which much economic opportunity is from family inheritance and not personal achievement.<ref name="haseler" />{{rp|17}}

'''Reunion Island ornate day gecko''' ('''''Phelsuma inexpectata''''' <small>[[Robert Mertens|Mertens]], 1966</small>) is a [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] [[species]]  of [[gecko]]s. It occurs only on the island [[Réunion]] and typically inhabits different trees. The Reunion Island ornate day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

== Scientific synonyms ==
*''Phelsuma ornata inexpectata'' <small>[[Robert Mertens|Mertens]], 1966</small> 
*''Phelsuma inexpectata'' <small>Bour, 1995</small> 

== Description ==
This lizard is one of the smallest day geckos. It can reach a total length of about 12&nbsp;cm at most. The body colour is dark green. Three red stripes extend from the snout to the neck. From behind the eye, a thick brown stripe and a thin green-white extend to above the front leg. The snout is partly dark blue. The back is covered with reddish-coloured dots, which are greatly reduced in females. The ventral side is off-white.

== Distribution ==
This species is endemic to [[Réunion]]. It is found in the coastal areas in the region of Manapany-Les-Bains and St.-Joseph.

== Habitat ==
''P. inexpectata'' typically lives on trees such as papaya, banana, pandanus and other pantropic vegetation. They also inhabit human dwellings and have been spotted on postboxes and fences. This biotope is relatively dry and hot.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft sweet fruit, pollen and nectar. 

== Behaviour ==
This ''Phelsuma'' species can be quite shy in captivity. These day geckos are also surprisingly speedy.

== Reproduction ==
At a temperature of 28°C, the young will hatch after approximately 50&ndash;52 days. The juveniles measure around 48&nbsp;mm.

== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
These animals should be housed in pairs in a well planted enclosure. The temperature should be between 29 and 32°C during the day and drop to around 22°C at night. The humidity should be maintained between 50 and 60% during the day and 80&ndash;90% at night. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moths, fruit flies, mealworms and houseflies.

The '''Eurasian spoonbill''' or '''common spoonbill''' (''Platalea leucorodia'') is a wading [[bird]] of the [[ibis]] and [[spoonbill]] family [[Threskiornithidae]],

==Distribution==
This is a [[Palearctic]] species, breeding from the United Kingdom and Spain in the west through to [[Japan]], and also in [[North Africa]]. In Europe, only The Netherlands, Spain, Austria, Hungary and Greece have sizeable populations.<ref>Overdijk 2002, p. 88</ref> Most birds [[bird migration|migrate]] to the tropics in winter, with [[Europe]]an breeders mainly going to [[Africa]], but a few remaining in mild winter areas of western Europe south to the [[United Kingdom]].  It was [[extirpated]] from the United Kingdom but sporadic breeding attempts in the early 21st century culminated with the formation of a colony at [[Holkham]] in [[Norfolk]] in 2010.  In 2011, 8 breeding pairs nested, successfully fledging 14 young.<ref>http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/about_us/news/2011/120911.aspx</ref>

==Description==
This species is almost unmistakable in most of its range. The breeding bird is all white except for its dark legs, black bill with a yellow tip, and a yellow breast patch like a [[pelican]]. It has a crest in the breeding season. Non-breeders lack the crest and breast patch, and immature birds have a pale bill and black tips to the primary flight feathers. Unlike herons, spoonbills fly with their necks outstretched. The Eurasian spoonbill differs from the [[African spoonbill]] with which in overlaps in winter, in that the latter species has a red face and legs, and no crest.
They are mostly silent. Even at their breeding colonies the main sounds are bill snapping, occasional deep grunting and occasional trumpeting noises.

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Platalea leucorodia -Holes Bay, Poole, Dorset, England-8.jpg|right|thumb|Juvenile in Holes Bay, Dorset, England]]
A study of mitochondrial DNA of the spoonbills found that the Eurasian spoonbill is sister taxon to a clade containing the [[royal spoonbill|royal]] and [[black-faced spoonbill]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Chesser, R.Terry; Yeung, Carol K.L.; Yao, Cheng-Te; Tians, Xiu-Hua; Li Shou-Hsien|year=2010|title=Molecular phylogeny of the spoonbills (Aves: Threskiornithidae) based on mitochondrial DNA|journal=Zootaxa|issue= 2603|pages=53–60|issn=1175-5326}}</ref>

[[File:Eurasian spoonbill.JPG|thumb|A Eurasian spoonbill in Bharatpur Bird sanctuary, Rajasthan,India]]

The Eurasian spoonbill has three [[subspecies]]:
*''P. l. leucorodia'', the nominate race, occupies all the range except as below.
*''P. l. balsaci''. Islands off the [[Banc d'Arguin]], [[Mauritania]].
*''P. l. archeri''. The coasts of the [[Red Sea]] and [[Somalia]].

Birds in Asia are sometimes separated as ''P. l. major''

==Habitat==
Eurasian spoonbills show a preference for extensive shallow, wetlands with muddy, clay or fine sandy beds. They may inhabit any type of marsh, river, lake, flooded area and mangrove swamp, whether fresh, brackish or saline, but especially those with islands for nesting or dense emergent vegetation (e.g. reedbeds) and scattered trees or srubs (especially [[willow]] [[Salix]] spp., [[oak]] [[Quercus]] spp. or [[poplar]] [[Populus]] spp.). Eurasian spoonbills may also frequent sheltered marine habitats during the winter such as deltas, estuaries, tidal creeks and coastal lagoons.<ref name=IUCN/>

==Diet==
The diet consists of aquatic [[insect]]s, [[mollusks]], [[newt]]s, [[crustacean]]s, worms, leeches, [[frog]]s, tadpoles and small fish up to 10–15&nbsp;cm long. It may also take algae or small fragments of aquatic plants (although these are possibly ingested accidentally with animal matter).<ref name=IUCN/>

==Behaviour==
More northerly breeding populations are fully migratory but may only migrate short distances while other, more southerly populations are resident and nomadic or partially migratory. In the Palearctic the species breeds in spring (e.g. from April) but in tropical parts of its range it times breeding to coincide with rainfall. Breeding is normally in single species colonies or in small single species groups amidst mixed-species colonies of other waterbirds such as herons, egrets and cormorants. Outside the breeding season Eurasian spoonbills forage singly or in small flocks of up to 100 individuals. Migration is usually conducted in flocks of up to 100 individuals. Most activity takes place during the morning and evening (although in coastal areas it foraging is governed by tidal rhythms), they often roost communally in roosts which are up to 15&nbsp;km away from the feeding areas.<ref name=IUCN/>

[[Image:Junge Löffler im Nest.JPG|250px|thumb|centre|Nestlings]]

The nest is a platform of sticks and vegetation which is either constructed on the ground on islands in lakes and rivers or in dense stands of reeds, bushes, mangroves or deciduous trees up to 5 m above the ground. Within colonies neighbouring nests are usually quite close together, no more than 1 or 2m apart. Breeding colonies are normally sited within 10–15&nbsp;km of feeding areas, often much less (although the species may also feed up to 35–40&nbsp;km away).<ref name=IUCN/>

==Conservation==
Threats to the Eurasian spoonbill include habitat destruction by drainage and degradation by pollution,  It is especially adversely affected by the disappearance of reed swamps. In Greece over-fishing and disturbance have caused the population to decline, and human exploitation of eggs and nestlings for food has threatened the species in the past.<ref name=IUCN/>  As stated above it has recently started to breed in the United Kingdom from where it was extirpated in the 17th century.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/spoonbills-return-to-breed-in-the-uk-after-300-years-710261.html | work=The Independent | first=Brian | last=Unwin | date=27 August 2000 | location=London | title=Spoonbills return to breed in the UK after 300 years}}</ref>

'''Kairos''' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:??????#Ancient Greek|??????]]}}) is an [[ancient Greek]] word meaning the right or opportune moment (the supreme moment). The ancient Greeks had two words for time, [[chronos]] and kairos. While the former refers to [[chronology|chronological]] or sequential [[time]], the latter signifies a time lapse, a moment of indeterminate time in which everything happens. What is happening when referring to kairos depends on who is using the word. While chronos is quantitative, kairos has a qualitative, permanent nature. ''Kairos'' also means ''weather'' in both ancient{{cn|date=October 2014}} and modern Greek. The plural, ?????? (''kairoi'' (Ancient Gk. and Mod. Gk.)) means ''the times''.

==In classical rhetoric==
In [[rhetoric]] ''kairos'' is "a passing instant when an opening appears which must be driven through with force if success is to be achieved."<ref>E. C. White, ''Kaironomia'' p. 13</ref>

Kairos was central to the [[Sophists]], who stressed the rhetor's ability to adapt to and take advantage of changing, contingent circumstances. In ''Panathenaicus'', [[Isocrates]] writes that educated people are those “who manage well the circumstances which they encounter day by day, and who possess a judgment which is accurate in meeting occasions as they arise and rarely misses the expedient course of action".

Kairos is also very important in [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] scheme of rhetoric. Kairos is, for Aristotle, the time and space context in which the [[Proof (truth)|proof]] will be delivered. Kairos stands alongside other contextual elements of rhetoric: ''The Audience'', which is the psychological and emotional makeup of those who will receive the proof; and ''To Prepon'', which is the style with which the orator clothes the proof.

In Ancient Greece, kairos was utilized by both of the two main schools of thought in the field of rhetoric. The competing schools were that of the Sophists, and that of their opposition, led by individuals such as Aristotle and Plato. Sophism approached rhetoric as an art form. Members of the school would travel around Greece teaching citizens about the art of rhetoric and successful discourse. In his article "Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric", John Poulakos defines rhetoric from a Sophistic perspective as follows: "Rhetoric is the art which seeks to capture in opportune moments that which is appropriate and attempts to suggest that which is possible."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Poulakos|first=John|title=Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|year=1983|volume=16|issue=1|pages=35–48}}</ref> Aristotle and Plato, on the other hand, viewed Sophistic rhetoric as a tool used to manipulate others, and criticized those who taught it. 
 
Kairos fits into the Sophistic scheme of rhetoric in conjunction with the ideas of  prepon and dynaton. These two terms combined with kairos are their keys to successful rhetoric. As stated by Poulakos, Prepon deals with the notion that "what is said must conform to both audience and occasion."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Poulakos|first=John|title=Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|year=1983|volume=16|issue=1|pages=35–48}}</ref> Dynaton has to do with the idea of the possible, or what the speaker is attempting to convince the audience of. Kairos in the Sophistic context is based on the thought that speech must happen at a certain time in order for it to be most effective. If rhetoric is to be meaningful and successful, it must be presented at the right moment, or else it will not have the same impact on the members of the audience. 
 
Aristotle and his followers also discuss the importance of kairos in their teachings. In his ''Rhetoric'', one of the ways that Aristotle uses the idea of kairos is in reference to the specificity of each rhetorical situation. Aristotle believed that each rhetorical situation was different, and therefore different rhetorical devices needed to be applied at that point in time. One of the most well known parts of Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' is when he discusses the roles of pathos, ethos, and logos. Aristotle ties kairos to these concepts, claiming that there are times in each rhetorical situation when one needs to be utilized over the others.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kinneavy|first=James|author2=Catherine Eskin|title=Kairos in Aristotle's Rhetoric|journal=Written Communication|year=2000|volume=17|issue=3|pages=432–444|doi=10.1177/0741088300017003005}}</ref>

==Modern rhetorical definition==
In his article "Critical-Rhetorical Ethnography: Rethinking the Place and Process of Rhetoric", Aaron Hess submits a definition of kairos for the present day that bridges the two classical applications. Hess addresses Poulakos’s view that, “In short, kairos dictates that what is said must be said at the right time.”<ref>{{cite journal|last=Poulakos|first=John|title=Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|year=1983|volume=16|issue=1|pages=35–48}}</ref> He also suggests that in addition to timeliness kairos considers appropriateness. According to Hess, kairos can either be understood as, "the decorum or propriety of any given moment and speech act, implying a reliance on the given or known" or as, "the opportune, spontaneous, or timely."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hess|first=Aaron|title=Critical-Rhetorical Ethnography: Rethinking the place and Process of Rhetoric|journal=Communication Studies|year=2011|volume=62|issue=2|page=138|doi=10.1080/10510974.2011.529750}}</ref> Although these two ideas of kairos might seem conflicting, Hess says that they offer a more extensive understanding of the term. Furthermore, they encourage creativity, which is necessary to adapt to unforeseen obstacles and opinions that can alter the opportune or appropriate moment, i.e. kairos. Being able to recognize the propriety of a situation while having the ability to adapt one’s rhetoric allows taking advantage of kairos to be successful. Hess’s updated definition of kairos concludes that along with taking advantage of the timeliness and appropriateness of a situation, the term also implies being knowledgeable of and involved in the environment where the situation is taking place in order to benefit fully from seizing the opportune moment.
 
Hess's somewhat conflicting perspective on kairos is exemplified by the disagreement between Lloyd F. Bitzer and Richard E. Vatz about the rhetorical situation. Bitzer argues that rhetorical situations exist independent of human perspective; a situation invites discourse. He discusses the feeling of a missed opportunity to speak (kairos) and the tendency to later create a speech in response to that unseized moment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bitzer|first=Lloyd|title=The Rhetorical Situation|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|date=January 1968|volume=1|pages=1–16}}</ref> However, Vatz counters Bitzer's view by claiming that a situation is made rhetorical by the perception of its interpreter and the way which he chooses to respond to it, whether with discourse or not. It is the rhetor's responsibility to give an event meaning through linguistic depiction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vatz|first=Richard|title=The Myth of the Rhetorical Situation|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|year=1983|volume=6.3|pages=155–60}}</ref> Bitzer's and Vatz's perspectives add depth to Hess's ideas that kairos is concerned with both timeliness and appropriateness. On one hand, Bitzer's argument supports Hess's claim that kairos is spontaneous, and one must be able to recognize the situation as opportune in order to take advantage of it. On the other hand, Vatz's idea that the rhetor is responsible reinforces Hess's suggestion of the need to be knowledgeable and involved in the surrounding environment in order to fully profit from the situation.

==In Christian theology==
In the [[New Testament]] kairos means "the appointed time in the purpose of God", the time when God acts (e.g. Mark 1.15, the kairos is fulfilled). Kairos (used approximately 81 times in the NT) seems to be an indeterminate time, a "moment" or a "season," whereas another Greek term chronos (used 54 times) refers to a specific amount of time, such as a day or an hour (Acts 13.18, 27.9, etc.).

In the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] churches, before the [[Divine Liturgy]] begins, the [[Deacon]] exclaims to the [[Priest]], ''«?????? ??? ?????? ?? ?????'»'', ''Kairos tou poiesai to Kyrio'', " ("It is time [''kairos''] for the Lord to act"); indicating that the time of the Liturgy is an intersection with Eternity.

In ''The Interpretation of History'', [[neo-orthodoxy|neo-orthodox]] [[Lutheran]] theologian [[Paul Tillich]] made prominent use of the term. For him, the ''kairoi'' are those crises in history (see [[Christian existentialism]]) which create an opportunity for, and indeed demand, an existential decision by the human subject - the coming of Christ being the prime example (compare [[Karl Barth]]'s use of ''Geschichte'' as opposed to ''Historie''). In the [[Kairos Document]], an example of [[liberation theology]] in [[South Africa under apartheid]], the term ''kairos'' is used to denote "the appointed time", "the crucial time" into which the document or text is spoken.

The {{nihongo|'''Katase River'''|???|Katase-gawa}} is a segment of a river in [[Shonan]], central [[Japan]], about 50 kilometers southwest of [[Tokyo]]. 

The Katase is an approximately 3-kilometer-long segment of the river from [[Kawana]] (??), [[Fujisawa, Kanagawa|Fujisawa]], where the [[Sakai River (Tokyo, Kanagawa)|Sakai River]] (??) and [[Kashio River]] join, to a point at [[Enoshima]] Island, where the river flows into [[Sagami Bay]]. The river's name refers to the Katase hills (???) along which the river flows. 

As the Katase River and its tributaries are prone to flooding (especially in spring and during the typhoon season), as a protection they were encased in concrete during the postwar period. The rivers continue to flood, but do not overflow their banks as frequently as in the past.

[[File:Thamestunnel.jpg|thumb|300px|Interior of the Thames Tunnel, mid-19th century]]

The '''Thames Tunnel''' is an underwater tunnel, built beneath the [[River Thames]] in London, connecting [[Rotherhithe]] and [[Wapping]]. It measures 35&nbsp;feet (11&nbsp;m) wide by 20&nbsp;feet (6&nbsp;m) high and is 1,300&nbsp;feet (396&nbsp;m) long, running at a depth of 75&nbsp;feet (23&nbsp;m) below the river surface measured at high tide. It was the first tunnel known to have been constructed successfully underneath a navigable river,<ref>

and was built between 1825 and 1843 using [[Marc Isambard Brunel]]'s and [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane's]] newly invented [[tunnelling shield]] technology, by Brunel and his son [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]].

The tunnel was originally designed for, but never used by, horse-drawn carriages. It now forms part of the [[London Overground]] railway network.

==History and development==

===Construction===
[[File:Thames tunnel construction 1830.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Inside the Thames Tunnel during construction, 1830]]
At the start of the 19th century, there was a pressing need for a new land connection between the north and south banks of the Thames to link the expanding docks on each side of the river. The engineer [[Ralph Dodd]] tried, but failed, to build a tunnel between [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] and [[Tilbury]] in 1799.<ref name="timbs">John Timbs, ''Stories of Inventors and Discoverers in Science and the Useful Arts'', p. 287, Kent, 1860</ref>

In 1805–09 a group of [[Cornish people|Cornish]] miners, including [[Richard Trevithick]], tried to dig a tunnel farther upriver between Rotherhithe and Wapping/Limehouse but failed because of the difficult conditions of the ground. The Cornish miners were used to hard rock and did not modify their methods for soft clay and [[quicksand]]. This [[Thames Archway]] project was abandoned after the initial pilot tunnel (a 'driftway') flooded twice when 1,000&nbsp;feet (305&nbsp;m) of a total of 1,200&nbsp;feet (366&nbsp;m) had been dug.<ref name="smith">Denis Smith, "London and the Thames Valley", p. 17, Thomas Telford, 2001</ref> It only measured 2–3&nbsp;feet by 5&nbsp;feet (61–91&nbsp;cm by 1.5&nbsp;m), and was intended as the drain for a larger tunnel for passenger use.<ref name=BT/> The failure of the [[Thames Archway]] project led engineers to conclude that "an underground tunnel is impracticable".<ref>Nathan Aaseng, ''Construction: Building the Impossible'', p. 28, The Oliver Press, Inc., 1999</ref>

However, the Anglo-French engineer Marc Brunel refused to accept this conclusion. In 1814 he proposed to [[Alexander I of Russia|Emperor Alexander I of Russia]] a plan to build a tunnel under the river [[Neva]] in [[St Petersburg]]. This scheme was turned down (a bridge was built instead) but Brunel continued to develop ideas for new methods of tunnelling.<ref name="timbs" />

Brunel and Cochrane patented the [[tunnelling shield]], a revolutionary advance in tunnelling technology, in January 1818. In 1823 Brunel produced a plan for a tunnel between Rotherhithe and Wapping, which would be dug using his new shield. Financing was soon found from private investors, including the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], and a Thames Tunnel Company was formed in 1824, the project beginning in February 1825.<ref name="smith" />

The first step was the construction of a large shaft on the south bank at Rotherhithe, 150&nbsp;feet (46&nbsp;m) back from the river bank. It was dug by assembling an iron ring 50&nbsp;feet (15&nbsp;m) in diameter above ground. A brick wall 40&nbsp;feet (12&nbsp;m) high and 3&nbsp;feet (91&nbsp;cm) thick was built on top of this, with a powerful steam engine surmounting it to drive the excavation's pumps. The whole apparatus was estimated to weigh 1,000 tons.<ref name="timbs" /> The soil below the ring's sharp lower edge was removed manually by Brunel's workers. The whole shaft thus gradually sank under its own weight, slicing through the soft ground rather like an enormous [[pastry cutter]]. The shaft became stuck at one point during its sinking as the pressure of the earth around it held it firmly in position. Extra weight was required to make it continue its descent; 50,000 bricks were added as temporary weights. It was realised that the problem was caused because the shaft's sides were parallel; years later when the Wapping shaft was built, it was slightly wider at the bottom than the top. This non-cylindrical tapering design ensured it did not get stuck. By November 1825 the Rotherhithe shaft was in place and tunnelling work could begin.<ref name="smith" />

The tunnelling shield, built at [[Henry Maudslay]]'s [[Lambeth]] works and assembled in the Rotherhithe shaft, was the key to Brunel's construction of the Thames Tunnel. The ''Illustrated London News'' described how it worked:
[[File:Thames tunnel shield.png|250px|right|thumb|Diagram of the tunnelling shield used to construct the Thames Tunnel]]

[[File:Brunel-shield.JPG|250px|right|thumb|A scale model of the tunnelling shield at the [[Brunel Museum]] at Rotherhithe]]

{{quote|The mode in which this great excavation was accomplished was by means of a powerful apparatus termed a shield, consisting of twelve great frames, lying close to each other like as many volumes on the shelf of a book-case, and divided into three stages or stories, thus presenting 36 chambers of cells, each for one workman, and open to the rear, but closed in the front with moveable boards. The front was placed against the earth to be removed, and the workman, having removed one board, excavated the earth behind it to the depth directed, and placed the board against the new surface exposed. The board was then in advance of the cell, and was kept in its place by props; and having thus proceeded with all the boards, each cell was advanced by two screws, one at its head and the other at its foot, which, resting against the finished brickwork and turned, impelled it forward into the vacant space. The other set of divisions then advanced. As the miners worked at one end of the cell, so the bricklayers formed at the other the top, sides and bottom.<ref>''Illustrated London News'', 25 March 1843</ref>}}

Each of the twelve frames of the shield weighed over seven tons.<ref name=BT/> The key innovation of the tunnelling shield was its support for the unlined ground in front and around it to reduce the risk of collapses. However, many workers, including Brunel himself, soon fell ill from the poor conditions caused by filthy sewage-laden water seeping through from the river above. This sewage gave off methane gas which was ignited by the miner's oil lamps. When the resident engineer, William Armstrong, fell ill in April 1826 Marc's son Isambard Kingdom Brunel took over at the age of 20.

Work was slow, progressing at only 8–12&nbsp;feet a week (3–4&nbsp;m). To earn some income from the tunnel, the company directors allowed sightseers to view the shield in operation. They charged a shilling for the adventure and an estimated 600–800 visitors took advantage of the opportunity every day.

The excavation was also hazardous. The tunnel flooded suddenly on 18 May 1827 after {{convert|549|ft|m}} had been dug.<ref name="smith" /> Isambard Kingdom Brunel lowered a [[diving bell]] from a boat to repair the hole at the bottom of the river, throwing bags filled with clay into the breach in the tunnel's roof. Following the repairs and the drainage of the tunnel, he held a banquet inside it.

====1828====
The tunnel flooded again the following year, on 12 January 1828, when six men died. Isambard was extremely lucky to survive this; the 6 men had made their way to the main stairwell, as the emergency exit was known to be locked. Isambard instead made for the locked exit and presumably made a large amount of noise. A burly contractor by the name of Beamish heard the noise and eventually broke the door down and an unconscious Isambard was pulled out and revived. He was sent to Brislington, near Bristol, to recuperate; there he heard about the competition to build what became the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]].

Financial problems followed, leading in August to the tunnel being walled off just behind the shield and then abandoned for seven years.

====Re-opening====
In December 1834 Marc Brunel succeeded in raising enough money (including a loan of £247,000 from [[HM Treasury|the Treasury]]) to continue construction.<ref name="smith" />

Starting in August 1835 the old rusted shield was dismantled and removed. By March 1836 the new shield, improved and heavier, was assembled in place and boring resumed.<ref name=BT>"The Brunels' Tunnel" 2006, ISBN 0-9504361-2-7</ref>

Impeded by further floods, (23 August 1837, 3 November 1837, 20 March 1838, 3 April 1840)<ref name=BT/> fires and leaks of [[methane]] and [[hydrogen sulfide|hydrogen sulphide]] gas, the remainder of the tunnelling was completed in November 1841, after another five and a half years. The extensive delays and repeated flooding made the tunnel the butt of metropolitan humour:
[[File:Thamestunnel1840.jpg|thumb|250px|Cutaway illustration of the Thames Tunnel excavation as it was probably around 1840]]
{{quote|Good Monsieur Brunel<br />Let misanthropy tell<br />That your work, half complete, is begun ill;<br />Heed them not, bore away<br />Through gravel and clay,<br />Nor doubt the success of your Tunnel.

Colburn, 1840</ref>}}

The Thames Tunnel was fitted out with lighting, roadways and spiral staircases during 1841–1842. An engine house on the Rotherhithe side, which now houses the [[Brunel Museum]], was also constructed to house machinery for draining the tunnel. The tunnel was finally opened to the public on 25 March 1843.<ref name="smith" />

===Pedestrian usage===
Although it was a triumph of civil engineering, the Thames Tunnel was not a financial success. It had cost a fortune to build &ndash; £454,000 to dig and another £180,000 to fit out &ndash; far exceeding its initial cost estimates.<ref name="timbs" /> Proposals to extend the entrance to accommodate wheeled vehicles failed owing to cost, and it was used only by pedestrians. It became a major tourist attraction, attracting about two million people a year, each paying a penny to pass through,<ref name="drew">William Allen Drew, ''Glimpses and Gatherings During a Voyage and Visit to London and the Great Exhibition in the Summer of 1851'', pp. 242–249. Homan & Manley, 1852</ref> and became the subject of popular songs. The American traveller William Allen Drew commented that "No one goes to London without visiting the Tunnel" and described it as the "eighth wonder of the world".<ref name="drew" /> When he saw it for himself in 1851, he pronounced himself "somewhat disappointed in it" but still left a vivid description of its interior, which was more like an underground marketplace than a transport artery:
[[File:Thamestunnelshaft.gif|right|thumb|Entrance shaft to the Thames Tunnel]]
{{quote|Amongst the blocks of buildings [in Wapping] that separate the street from the river, we notice an octagonal edifice of marble. We enter by one of several great doors, and find ourselves in a rotunda of fifty feet diameter, and the floor laid in mosaic work of blue and white marble. The walls are stuccoed, around which are stands for the sale of papers, pamphlets, books, confectioners, beer, &c. A sort of watch-house stands on the side of the rotunda next the river, in which is a fat publican, or tax gatherer. Before him is a brass turnstile, through which you are permitted to pass, on paying him a penny, and, entering a door, you begin to descend the shaft, by a flight of very long marble steps that descend to a wide platform, from which the next series of steps descends in an opposite direction. The walls of the shaft are circular, finished in stucco, and hung with paintings and other curious objects. You halt a few moments on the first platform and listen to the notes of a huge organ that occupies a part of it, discoursing excellent music.

You resume your downward journey till you reach the next story, or marble platform, where you find other objects of curiosity to engage your attention whilst you stop to rest. And thus you go down – down – to the bottom of the shaft eighty feet; the walls meanwhile, being studded with pictures, statues, or figures in plaster, &c. Arrived at the bottom, you find yourself in a rotunda corresponding to that you entered from the street, a round room, with marble floor, fifty feet in diameter. There are alcoves near the walls in which are all sorts of contrivances to get your money, from Egyptian necromancers and fortune-tellers to dancing monkeys. The room is lighted with gas, and is brilliant.

Now look into the Thames Tunnel before you. It consists of two beautiful Arches, extending to the opposite side of the river. These Arches contain each a roadsted, fourteen feet wide and twenty-two feet high, and pathways for pedestrians, three feet wide. The Tunnel appears to be well ventilated, as the air seemed neither damp nor close. The partition between these Arches, running the whole length of the Tunnel, is cut into transverse arches, leading through from one roadsted to the other. There may be fifty of them in all, and these are finished into fancy and toy shops in the richest manner – with polished marble counters, tapestry linings gilded shelves, and mirrors that make everything appear double. Ladies, in fashionable dresses and with smiling faces, wait within and allow no gentleman to pass without giving him an opportunity to purchase some pretty thing to carry home as a remembrancer of the Thames Tunnel. The Arches are lighted with gas burners, that make it as bright as the sun; and the avenues are always crowded with a moving throng of men, women and children, examining the structure of the Tunnel, or inspecting the fancy wares, toys, &c., displayed by the arch-looking girls of these arches ... It is impossible to pass through without purchasing some curiosity. Most of the articles are labelled &ndash; "Bought in the Thames Tunnel" &ndash; "a present from the Thames Tunnel".<ref name="drew" />}}

Drew was perhaps charitable in his view of the tunnel, which came to be regarded as the haunt of prostitutes and "tunnel thieves" who lurked under its arches and mugged passers-by.<ref>Susan Sellers / Sue Roe, ''The Cambridge Companion to Virginia Woolf'', p. 195. Cambridge University Press, 2000</ref> The American writer [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], writing in 1855, took a much more negative view of the tunnel when he visited it a few years after Drew:

{{quote|It consisted of an arched corridor of apparently interminable length, gloomily lighted with jets of gas at regular intervals ... There are people who spend their lives there, seldom or never, I presume, seeing any daylight, except perhaps a little in the morning. All along the extent of this corridor, in little alcoves, there are stalls of shops, kept principally by women, who, as you approach, are seen through the dusk offering for sale ... multifarious trumpery ... So far as any present use is concerned, the tunnel is an entire failure.}}

===Use as a railway tunnel===
[[File:Thames tunnel train.jpg|thumb|250px|1870 view of a train exiting the Thames Tunnel at Wapping]]
[[File:Thames Tunnel walk.jpg|thumb|250px|Inside the tunnel, 2010]]
No doubt to the relief of the tunnel's investors, it was purchased in September 1865 <!--at a cost of £800,000<ref>{{cite news |title=Railway And Other Companies, East London |newspaper=The Times | location = London |date=2 September 1869}}</ref> -->by the [[East London Railway]] Company, a consortium of six mainline railways which sought to use the tunnel to provide a rail link for goods and passengers between Wapping (and later [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street]]) and the [[Inner South London Line|South London Line]]. The tunnel's generous headroom, resulting from the architects' original intention of accommodating horse-drawn carriages, provided a sufficient [[loading gauge]] for trains as well. The first train ran through the tunnel on 7 December 1869.<ref name="smith" /> In 1884, the tunnel's disused construction shaft to the north of the river was repurposed to serve as [[Wapping tube station|Wapping station]].

The East London Railway was later absorbed into the [[London Underground]], where it became the [[East London Line]]. It continued to be used for goods services as late as 1962. During the Underground days, the Thames Tunnel was the oldest piece of the Underground's infrastructure.

It was planned to construct an intersection between the East London Line and the Jubilee Line extension at [[Canada Water tube station]]. As construction would require the temporary closure of the East London Line, it was decided to take this opportunity to perform long-term maintenance on the tunnel and so in 1995 the East London Line was closed to allow construction and maintenance to take place. The proposed repair method for the tunnel was to seal it against leaks by "[[shotcrete|shotcreting]]" it with concrete, obliterating its original appearance, caused a controversy that led to a bitter conflict between London Underground who wished to complete the work as quickly and cheaply as possible and architectural interests wishing to preserve the tunnel's appearance. The architectural interests won with the [[Listed building|Grade II* listing]] of the tunnel on 24 March 1995 (the day London Underground had scheduled the start of the long-term maintenance work).<ref>{{Citation|first=Dan |last=Cruickshank|date=22 March 1995 |title=The Great Bore in its time – a forgotten gem in ours  |newspaper=The Independent |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-great-bore-in-its-time--a-forgotten-gem-in-ours-1612274.html}}</ref><ref name=IoE-441472>{{IoE|441472}} accessed 8 August 2009</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Doyle |first=N. |title=Last minute listing for Thames Tunnel |journal=New Civil Engineer (NCE) |issue=1122 |year=1995 |pages=4–5 |url=http://booksc.org/book/2675372}}</ref>

Following an agreement to leave a short section at one end of the tunnel untreated, and more sympathetic treatment of the rest of the tunnel, the work went ahead and the route reopened&nbsp;– much later than originally anticipated&nbsp;– in 1998. The tunnel closed again from 23 December 2007 to permit tracklaying and resignalling for the [[East London Line extension]]. The extension work resulted in the tunnel becoming part of the new [[London Overground]]. After its reopening on 27 April 2010, it was used by mainline trains again.

===Influence===
[[File:Thames Tunnel plaque.JPG|thumb|200px|Commemorative plaque at [[Rotherhithe tube station]] before the East London line was closed in 2007]]
The construction of the Thames Tunnel showed that it was indeed possible to build underwater tunnels, despite the previous scepticism of many engineers. Several new underwater tunnels were built in the UK in the following decades: the [[Tower Subway]] in London; the [[Severn Tunnel]] under the [[River Severn]]; and the [[Mersey Railway Tunnel]] under the [[River Mersey]]. Brunel's tunnelling shield was later refined, with [[James Henry Greathead]] playing a particularly important role in developing the technology. The historic importance of the Thames Tunnel was recognised on 24 March 1995, when the structure was listed Grade II* in recognition of its architectural importance.<ref name="smith" /><ref name=IoE-441472/> A plaque could be seen above the stairs descending to the Rotherhithe platforms before the temporary closure. The plaque was removed for safe keeping for the duration of the works, but is now reinstated on the tunnel wall and can be seen from the passenger staircase into the station platforms.

==Visiting==
[[File:cmglee London Thames Tunnel shaft stairs.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Interior of the northwest shaft in September 2013]]
Nearby in Rotherhithe, the original Brunel Engine House is open to visitors as the [[Brunel Museum]]. It was built to house the drainage pumps for the tunnel and has now been restored. Until the East London Line was closed in 2007 for major refurbishment and upgrade, the museum organised tours through the tunnel by train.

It is still possible to take a walking tour through the tunnel to Wapping from Rotherhithe and back, but these are infrequent and on an ad-hoc basis as they can only take place when that section of the line is closed for maintenance.<ref>{{cite web

===Entrance shaft===
In the 1860s, when trains started running through the tunnel, the shaft was used for ventilation. The staircase was removed to reduce the risk of fire. In 2011, a concrete raft was built near the bottom of the shaft, above the tracks, when the tunnel was upgraded for the London Overground network. This space, with walls blackened with smoke from steam trains, is now accessible from Railway Avenue via a narrow entrance and scaffolding, and functions as a concert venue. A rooftop garden and bar have been built on top of the shaft.<ref>[http://londonist.com/2011/02/inside-the-brunel-tunnel-shaft.php Inside The Brunel Tunnel Shaft | Londonist]</ref><ref>[http://blogs.nature.com/london/2011/02/15/inside-brunels-thames-tunnel-shaft Inside Brunel’s Thames Tunnel Shaft : London Blog]</ref>

'''Pornography in Japan''' is large and intertwined business of adult entertainment with unique characteristics that readily distinguish it from western [[pornography]].  Reflective of its views on [[Sexuality in Japan|sexuality]] and [[Culture of Japan|culture]], Japanese pornography delves into a wide spectrum of [[heterosexual]], [[homosexual]], and [[transgender]] sexual acts in addition to unique [[Fetish|fetishes]] and [[Philia|philias]].

Starting with erotic stories and woodblock prints from before the 20th century, Japanese pornography evolved into distinct subcategories with the media that in addition of pornographic videos and magazines featuring live actors, there are categories of pornographic [[manga]] (within Japanese comics), pornographic computer games (for both PC and game consoles), and pornographic [[anime]] (animated depictions sexual activity).
	
By Japanese law, the genitals of actors and actresses must be censored and up the mid-1990s so was the depiction of pubic hair.  This type of censoring also extends to comics, video games, and anime made for adults.  In the attempts of circumvent this type of censoring (and to cater to particular fetishes), actors and producers have featured subject matter unseen or rarely depicted in western pornography.  [[Bukkake (sex act)|Bukkake]], [[Gokkun]], [[Omorashi]], and [[tentacle erotica]] are few uniquely Japanese genres known to western viewers.   [[Lolicon]] and its contribution to the controversy regarding the [[Legal status of cartoon pornography depicting minors|regulation of pornography of depicting minors]] that don’t exist has been a major issue for free speech in and outside of Japan.

==History==
===Before the 20th century===
[[Shunga]] or pornographic wood-block pictures were printed with all imaginable situations. Near the end of the Edo period when foreigners became widely known and seen, even sex acts with foreign males were drawn and sold, not to mention [[Zoophilia|acts with animals]], demons (both male ([[incubus]]) and female ([[succubus]])). The actual uses of shunga in the period are still debated, but probably resembled modern uses of pornographic materials, including [[masturbation]] and shared viewing with a lover.

After the [[Meiji Restoration]] in the second half of the 19th century, the publication of pornographic materials declined under government pressure.

===In the 20th century===
In the late [[Taish? period]] and early [[Sh?wa period]], an artistic movement called ''[[Ero guro|Eroguronansensu]],'' literally "erotic-grotesque-nonsense", occurred influenced by decadence works of Europe. Open sexual expressions were permitted in novels and ''[[manga]],'' but a strict control was applied on photographs and films. During [[World War II]], pornographic materials were banned altogether: "Since the end of the Second World War Article 175 of the Japanese Penal Code, known as the obscenity law, has represented the only official restriction on freedom of expression, which is nevertheless guaranteed by Article 21 of the 1947 Constitution."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://redsiglo21.com/eiga9/articulos/obscenity.html |title=Obscenity and Article 175 of the Japanese Penal Code: A Short Introduction to Japanese Censorship |last1= da Silva |first1=Joaquín |date=21 April 2009 |publisher=redsiglo21.com/eiga9: Cine Japonés}}</ref>

Influenced by magazines like ''[[Playboy]],'' pornographic magazines were printed soon after World War II. While Playboy's articles were about the [[Society of the United States|American lifestyle]]; women were mostly non-Asian, interviews were with people largely unknown in Japan, and fashion and sport were American, it thereby spawned a fetish and a genre known as ''Yomono'', literally "Western things".

In the early 1960s, several movie studios began producing "[[pink film]]s,". With censorship laws prohibiting genitals from being seen but otherwise free to express anything, these movies quickly diversified to fill all genres, including rape and bondage. Throughout the 1960s, the "pink films" were mainly produced by low-budget, independent filmmakers such as [[K?ji Wakamatsu]]. In 1971, the major studio [[Nikkatsu]] entered the pink film genre.

Starting in 1971, homosexually-oriented magazines began to appear including [[Barazoku]]. Homosexual magazines tend to be tailored to particular segments of the population, such as ''[[Badi (magazine)|Badi]],'' which features younger adult males, ''[[Samson (magazine)|Samson]],'' devoted to chubby men, and ''[[G-men (magazine)|G-men]],'' featuring muscular men.

====1980s====
The proliferation of pornographic videos in the 1980s commonly called AV - short for adult video - sold more videos because most Japanese families now had at least two television sets and VCRs. It is rumored, but not supported, that [[VHS]] became popular over [[Betamax]] format because large numbers of AV were released in VHS format.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jan2007/gb20070122_279828.htm?campaign_id=rss_topStories |first=Ian|last=Rowley |title=Next-Gen DVD's Porn Struggle|date=22 January 2007|accessdate= 21 January 2008| work = [[Businessweek]] |quote=One oft-recalled explanation for the failure of Sony's (SNE) Betamax videocassette format in the 1980s was the Japanese company's ambivalence towards producers of pornographic videos. By contrast, proponents of VHS, Betamax's rival, welcomed adult content with open arms and, the legend goes, caused Betamax's demise.}}</ref> Few AVs were sold in [[laserdisc]] format. Playing games on [[Personal computer]]s with no limitation on content except for censorship laws was sometimes viewed as being synonymous with playing [[Bish?jo game]]s, because so few Japanese people saw any reason to play video games on these platforms, as opposed to [[video game console]]s.

In the late 1980s, the [[D?jinshi]] market expanded. It is estimated that about half of this market consists of pornography. Copyright problems plague the market, yet the d?jinshi market was a common place for one to start before making a debut in a professional magazine. [[Yaoi]] began in the d?jinshi market.

====1990s====
According to John Carr, a United Kingdom government adviser on Internet safety policy for children, two-thirds of all pedophilic images on the Internet in the late 1990s may have originated in Japan. He further commented: ''"We think that child pornography, in any form, promotes values and sends the message that it is OK to sexually abuse children. It helps pedophiles to justify their ideas or behavior and it desensitizes society as a whole."'' Since the law against child pornography in 1999, the proportion is now believed to be less than 2%. [[ECPAT]] believes that many child pornography producers have simply turned to producing anime or films featuring adults dressed as children.<ref>{{cite news

==Laws and movements==

===Censorship laws===
{{see also|Censorship in Japan}}
In Japan, under Article 175 of the [[Criminal Code of Japan]] people who sell or distribute obscene materials can be punished by fines or imprisonment. Article 175 was included in the original document in 1907 and remains relatively unchanged.<ref>[http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/hourei/data/PC.pdf The Penal Code], translated into English by the [[Cabinet Secretariat (Japan)|Japanese Cabinet Secretariat]]</ref> Showing [[pubic hair]] and adult genitalia was once considered obscene.<ref name=Zanghellini>{{cite doi|10.1177/0964663909103623}}</ref> Video pornography routinely depicts explicit sex scenes with the participants's genitalia obscured by [[Pixelization|mosaics]]. The amount of censorship of the penis can vary. The publication of ''Waterfruit'' and ''Santa Fe'' by [[Kishin Shinoyama]] was likely the first publication that featured [[pubic hair]]. Many video production companies belong to ethical associations which provide guidance on what is acceptable and what is not. The [[Nihon Ethics of Video Association]], the [[Ethics Organization of Computer Software]] and the Contents Soft Association are examples of three such organizations. Recent controversies have frowned upon both pubic hair and even genitalia itself being displayed in works of art and in educational settings.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/20/arts/20arts-SUPREMECOURT_BRF.html |title=Supreme Court in Japan Upholds Mapplethorpe |author=Staff |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=20 February 2008 |accessdate=11 March 2008}}</ref> In 2014 Japanese police discovered an underground pornography store that possessed a machine which was claimed to be able to remove pixelization from the images contained on censored DVDs.<ref>{{cite news|author=Lila Gray|title=Japanese Machine Reportedly De-Pixelates Porn|url=http://www.xbiz.com/news/175578|publisher=X Biz|date=26 February 2014}}</ref>

===Religion and pornography===
{{see also|Religion in Japan}}
Japan's indigenous religion, [[Shinto]] is based in [[animism]], with a belief that supernatural beings dwell in nature. The gods and goddesses of Shinto are not repositories of morality or perfection; instead they exist within nature and thus, sexuality is an innate part of life itself.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12119-002-1000-4 |ref=harv| last =Perper| first = Timothy | last2 = Cornog | first2 = Martha | year = 2002 | title = Eroticism for the Masses: Japanese Manga Comics and Their Assimilation into the U.S. | journal = [[Sexuality & Culture]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–126}}</ref> Therefore, religious attitudes are no obstacle to the presence of pornographic material in Japan's secular society, nor is pornography blasphemous in any way, even when it depicts religious persons (mostly [[miko|shrine maidens]]) or mythological beings.

===Child pornography===
{{Main|Child pornography laws in Japan}}
'''''Possession''''' of [[child pornography]] depicting real children is illegal in Japan since June 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/2892728/japan-finally-bans-child-pornography/ |title=Japan police crack down on 300 child porn cases |publisher=Time Magazine |date=2014-06-18 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}</ref> '''''Distribution''''' of child pornography was made ''[[de jure]]'' illegal in 2003 after international pressure from the [[United Nations]], [[UNICEF]] and other international organizations, although the law made a distinction between [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] pornography and the softcore pornography that is widely available in Japan, such as at [[junior idol]] and [[lolicon]] media centers like [[Akihabara]] and [[Nipponbashi]], and at most [[konbini]], or Japanese convenience stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.e-gov.go.jp/htmldata/H11/H11HO052.html |title=????????????????????????????????? |publisher=Law.e-gov.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}</ref> Prosecutions have been made under the new law by Japan's powerful prosecutors under Japan's unique [[criminal justice system of Japan|legal system]], resulting in some financial verdicts, with relative strictness of enforcement continuing to vary by [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]]{{citation-needed|date=September 2014}}.

In June 2008, a bill that proposed the imposition of a ban on child-pornography possession was submitted to the [[House of Representatives of Japan]] where it was brought before the Diet in September, but failed to pass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUST35097220080808 |title=Japan police crack down on 300 child porn cases |publisher=Reuters |date=2008-08-08 |accessdate=2013-12-10}}</ref>

=== Sexual assault ===
[[Milton Diamond]] and Ayako Uchiyama postulate that the rise of pornographic material in Japan from the 1970s onwards creates a decrease in reported violence.<ref name="Diamond and Uchiyama">{{cite journal |url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/online_artcls/pornography/prngrphy_rape_jp.html |title=Pornography, Rape and Sex Crimes in Japan |author=[[Milton Diamond|Diamond, Milton]]; Uchiyama, Ayako |journal= [[International Journal of Law and Psychiatry]] |volume=22|issue=1|pages=1–22|year=1999|accessdate= 6 January 2008|doi=10.1016/S0160-2527(98)00035-1|pmid=10086287}}</ref>
Research from the University of Pennsylvania headed by Director of Sexual Trauma and Psychopathology Mary Anne Layden heavily disputes this, reporting findings from their research that Japanese males exposed to pornography are more likely to believe women enjoy rape and sexual abuse, and that women exposed to pornography from a young age are more likely to blame themselves for sexual assaults and thus less likely to report the crimes. The report states that males exposed to pornography have a dramatically higher "acceptance of the rape myth, acceptance of violence against women, adversarial sex beliefs, reported likelihood of committing rape and forced sex acts and sex callousness".<ref name="socialcostsofpornography.com">http://www.socialcostsofpornography.com/Layden_Pornography_and_Violence.pdf</ref> The research concludes that "the use of pornography, even that which does not include sexual violence, changes beliefs about rape and sexual violence".<ref name="socialcostsofpornography.com"/>

===Sub-genres of Japanese porn===
Among the various sub-genres of Japanese pornography are the following:
* [[Lolicon]] (short for "Lolita complex") {{nihongo2|????}}: This genre involves prepubescent and adolescent girls between the aged of 6-12. It is typically animated pornography, as the legal age to be featured in a pornographic film in Japan is 18.
* [[Shotacon]] (short for ''"Shoutarou'' Complex"): Similar to Lolicon, this genre involves prepubescent or under-aged boys between the ages 6–12. It is typically animated pornography, as the legal age to be featured in a pornographic film in Japan is 18. {{div col end}}
* [[Yaoi]] ("Boy's Love"): Featuring two grown adult men in a homosexual/gay relationship. Target audience are teenage / young adult women. Typically features a feminine 'Uke,' or submissive, and a masculine 'Seme,' or dominative.
* [[Bara (genre)|Bara]] ("Men's Love"): A sub-genre of Yaoi. typically features adult, masculine men with varying degrees of muscle, body fat, and body hair, akin to beefcakes, or bears. Unlike Yaoi, Bara is normally made by actual homosexual men, for homosexual men, and tends to focus on the more realistic obstacles and challenges that come with being homosexual in Japan.
* [[Yuri (genre)|Yuri]] ("Girl's Love"): Featuring two grown adult women in a homosexual/lesbian relationship. Targets the male audience, but is much less popular than Yaoi.

===D?jin and parodies===
{{Main|D?jinshi}}
''D?jinshi'' (often transliterated as doujinshi) or literally "fan works" often contain pornographic imitations of popular anime, games and manga.

===Anime===
{{Main|Hentai}}
Animated erotica (known in the West as ''[[hentai]],'' but in Japan as "adult anime") is a popular genre in Japan and generally maintains the same style of animation seen in other popular forms of Japanese animation ([[anime]]).

===Games===
{{Main|Bish?jo game|Eroge}}
Adult-oriented games are a genre for video games in Japan. The genre is somewhat unknown outside Japan because of several problems, cultural and translational. Known as "bish?jo games" or "pretty girl games" (alternately spelled "bishoujo") in Japanese, the games are known under several names used by English fans, including PC dating-sim game, [[hentai game]]/[[H game]], and so on. Companies such as [[JAST USA]] and [[MangaGamer]] are translating [[dating sim]]s and [[visual novel]]s into English for the fledgling market outside of Japan. For adult video games in Japan, the rating of "18+" was coined by the [[Ethics Organization of Computer Software]] or Contents Soft Association. Rating of adult video games has not gone in [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization]].

===The Internet===
[[Fanfiction]]s, commonly found in websites, are not limited to fictitious characters and often use real live people as well, though these works would make little sense to those who do not see Japanese TV programs. D?jinshi writers typically use the Internet to market their products by offering previews of new works, a secret address where buyers can find additional works, and a sample of their games. They also recruit new writers and artists online. Several exclusively adult oriented search engines exist to let someone find a site they are looking for, without having to search through commercial websites that list all keywords. Many works of d?jinshi are featured in websites that collect the art and let people look for free.

Many websites feature seasonal greeting pictures, often pornographic, from linked sites and friends who frequent their sites. A typical Christmas greeting picture on such sites features a santa-girl in various stages of undressing. The twelve zodiac animals of [[Chinese astrology]] offer challenging and entertaining examples of [[catgirl]]s.

===Magazines===
Magazines are, along with videos, popular media for pornographic materials. Magazines that contains pornographic manga or pictures are controlled, and feature age requirements for purchase. Many localities in Japan require pornographic magazines to be sealed when sold outside of adult bookstores. But it is not uncommon to find non-pornographic magazines that feature nudity. Many magazines, especially [[Sh?kanshi|weekly tabloids]], include nude images and photo spreads similar to [[Page Three|page three]] girls featured in many western tabloids. So long as these images do not depict sexual organs or sex acts, they are not considered pornographic and, hence, are freely sold in public.<ref name='tough questions'>{{cite book | last1 = Itasaka | first1 = Gen | title = 100 Tough Questions for Japan | chapter = Why are pornographic newspapers and magazines read on trains? | editors = Itasaka Gen | work = Bilingual Books Series | publisher = Kodansha International | year = 1996 | location = Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan | pages = 106–107 | accessdate = 2011-03-28 | isbn = 4-7700-2091-0}}</ref>

Confessional writings by both genders are a popular topic in men's and pornographic magazines.

===Manga===
{{See also|Josei|Seinen|H Manga}}
[[Manga]] with a pornographic content target both male and female audiences and both male and female [[Mangaka|manga artist]] write pornographic works.

===Video===
Many pornographic videos (called "adult video" or "AV" in Japan or sometimes "Japanese adult video" or "JAV" outside of it) have titles that may suggest that they use minors or show the recording of an actual crime; but titles that are circulated with the approval of ''[[Eirin]]'', the Japanese film industry's regulatory body, are in full compliance with, and do not break, any Japanese laws. A common ploy is to have a part of a title replaced with a character, or to use a phonetically similar neologism. For example, a video about "19 years old girls Sex Party!" may be sold with a title like "1X years old Girls Sex Party!". The word {{Nihongo|'''Joshikousei'''|????|}}, lit. "High school girl," cannot be used as it would suggest a girl of 17 years or younger, who cannot legally act in a pornographic video. The homonymic neologism {{Nihongo|'''Joshikousei'''|????|}}, which can mean a "girl student," is used in many titles to promote the product without breaking censorship laws. This fact may be seen in popular places of Japan such as [[Akihabara]] or Den Den Town at Tokyo and Osaka respectively.

Japanese AV also caters to many more fetishes than might be imagined (or thought legal) by non-Japanese. Schoolgirl or uniform themed AV dovetails with the aforementioned "non-consensual" genre&mdash;{{Nihongo|rape|???|reipu|}}&mdash;are common. SM, rope bondage, bestiality, virgins, internal male climax or {{Nihongo|cream-pies|???|nakadashi|}}, {{Nihongo|lesbians|??|rezu|}}, along with more eccentric fetishes (soap, office ladies, game shows) are all covered.

The '''yellow-headed day gecko''' ('''''Phelsuma klemmeri''''' <small>Seipp, 1991</small>) is a [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] [[species]] of [[gecko]]. It is [[Endemism|endemic]] to northwestern [[Madagascar]] and typically inhabits coastal [[rainforests]], dwelling on trees. The yellow-headed day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

== Description ==
This lizard belongs to the smallest subfamily of day geckos. It can reach a total length of about 4 inches. The body colour of this slender and long-snouted gecko is turquoise blue at the upper and mid-back. The lower back is light brown. Most of the tail is turquoise blue. Remarkable is the laterally flattened body. Another typical characteristic  is the yellow head. A dark black spot is present behind the eye, followed by a black stripe which extends to the rear extremities. The legs and toes are brown speckled. The ventral side is grayish white. The sexes can easily be distinguished by the orange color around the femoral pores of the males.

== Distribution ==
This species inhabits northwest Madagascar, along the coast. It is only known from the area around [[Antsatsaka]].

== Habitat ==
''Phelsuma klemmeri'' typically lives in bamboo forests. They sometimes share their habitat with ''[[Phelsuma seippi]]'' and ''[[Phelsuma madagascariensis grandis]]''. They are found only on yellow bamboo canes which they also use to hide in case of danger.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

== Behaviour ==
This ''Phelsuma'' species likes to bask. It often lives in small groups.

== Reproduction ==
The females lay a pair of eggs and hide them in bamboo canes. At a temperature of 27°C (80.6°F), the young will hatch after approximately 39-52 days. The juveniles measure 22-29&nbsp;mm.

'''United States Satellite Broadcasting''' was a [[satellite television]] company that ran from 1981 to 1998. It was purchased by [[DirecTV]] in 1998.

==History==
USSB was founded in 1981 by [[Hubbard Broadcasting Corporation|Hubbard Broadcasting]] founder Stanley S. Hubbard, who is widely considered to be the father of modern satellite broadcasting.  Hubbard spent most of the 1980s raising awareness and money to launch a digital satellite television service.  In the 1990s, he had teamed up with RCA/Thomson Consumer Electronics and Hughes Electronics Corporation to come up with a practical digital satellite service capable of 175 channels. The original name of the service was '''HUBTV''',<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0714839949 "Paul Rand", by Steven Heller; Phaidon Press, 2000]</ref> named after Hubbard, but was soon changed to '''USSB''' before launch. When the service launched, USSB offered a comparatively small slate of channels, but included almost all of the major American [[premium channel]]s, the [[MTV Networks]], and any channel in which [[Viacom International|Viacom]] had a stake at the time. Lacking any news channels, Hubbard instead used its in-house [[All News Channel]], operated as a cooperative of Hubbard and Viacom-owned stations, as well as stations owned by other groups via the CONUS satellite network Hubbard operated.  Hughes offered programming from most other cable television channels under the banner of [[DirecTV]].  DirecTV later acquired USSB.

'''James Francis Byrnes''' ({{IPAc-en|US|?|b|?|n|z}}; May 2, 1882 – April 9, 1972) was an American politician from the state of [[South Carolina]]. During his career, Byrnes served as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] (1911–1925), a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] (1931–1941), a Justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] (1941–1942), [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] (1945–1947), and [[List of Governors of South Carolina|104th]] [[governor of South Carolina]] (1951–1955). He is one of very few politicians to serve in all three branches of the American federal government while also being active in state government. He was a confidant of [[U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and was one of the most powerful men in American domestic and foreign policy in the mid-1940s. Historian [[George E. Mowry]] called Byrnes, "the most influential southern member of Congress between John Calhoun and Lyndon Johnson."<ref>David Robertson, ''Sly and Able: A Political Biography of James F. Byrnes'' (1994) p. 126</ref>

==Early life and career==
James Francis "Jimmy" Byrnes was born at 538 King St. in Charleston, South Carolina<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=0oeUc68sgesC&dat=19450130&printsec=frontpage&hl=en | title=Do You Know Your Charleston? | publisher=Charleston News & Courier | accessdate=September 16, 2012 | page = 8}}</ref> and reared in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Byrnes's father died shortly after Byrnes was born. His mother, Elizabeth McSweeney Byrnes, was an [[Irish-American]] dressmaker. At the age of fourteen, he left St. Patrick's Catholic School to work in a law office, and became a court [[stenographer]]. In 1906, he married the former Maude Perkins Busch of [[Aiken, South Carolina|Aiken]], South Carolina, and became an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]]. Though they had no children, he was the godparent of James Christopher Connor.

Byrnes never attended high school, college, or law school. In 1900, when his cousin Governor [[Miles B. McSweeney]] appointed him as a clerk for Judge Robert Aldrich of Aiken, he needed to be 21. Byrnes, his mother, and Governor McSweeney just changed his date of birth to that of his older sister Leonora.<ref name=birth>{{cite web | url=http://www.sciway.net/hist/governors/byrnes.html | title=SC Governors - James Francis Byrnes, 1951 - 1955 | publisher=SCIWAY | accessdate=July 10, 2012}}</ref> He later apprenticed to a lawyer – a not uncommon practice then – [[Reading law|read for the law]], and was admitted to the bar in 1903. In 1908, he was appointed solicitor for the second circuit of South Carolina, serving until 1910.<ref name="CBD">

In 1910, he narrowly won the [[South Carolina's 3rd congressional district|state's third Congressional District]] in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[primary election|primary]], then [[tantamount to election]]. Byrnes proved a brilliant legislator, working behind the scenes to form coalitions and avoiding the high-profile oratory that characterized much of Southern politics. He was a champion of the "good roads" movement that attracted motorists, and politicians, to large-scale road building programs in the 1920s. He became a close ally to President [[Woodrow Wilson]], and Wilson often entrusted important political tasks to the capable young representative rather than to more experienced lawmakers.

==United States Senate and Supreme Court==
In 1924, Byrnes declined renomination to the House, and instead sought nomination for the Senate seat held by incumbent [[Nathaniel B. Dial]], though both were former allies of the now-deceased "Pitchfork Ben" Tillman. Anti-Tillmanite and extreme racist demagogue [[Coleman Livingston Blease|Coleman Blease]], who had challenged Dial in 1918, also ran again. Blease led the primary with 42 percent; Byrnes was second with 34 percent. Dial finished third with 22 percent.<ref name="SoSRep1925">"Report of the Secretary of State to the General Assembly of South Carolina. Part II." ''Reports of State Officers Boards and Committees to the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina''. Volume I. Columbia, SC: 1925, p. 59.</ref>

Byrnes was opposed by the [[Ku Klux Klan]], which preferred Blease. Byrnes had been raised as a [[Roman Catholic]], and the Klan spread rumors that he was still a secret Catholic. Byrnes countered by citing his support by Episcopalian clergy. Then, three days before the run-off vote, twenty Catholics who said they had been [[altar boy]]s with Byrnes published a professed endorsement of him. The leader of this group was a Blease ally, and the "endorsement" was circulated in anti-Catholic areas.<ref>Pope, Thomas H. ''The History of Newberry County, South Carolina: 1860–1990'' p. 110</ref> Blease won the run-off 51% to 49%.<ref name="SoSRep1925"/>

After his House term ended in 1925, Byrnes was out of office. He moved his law practice to [[Spartanburg, South Carolina|Spartanburg]], in the industrializing Piedmont region. Between his law practice and investment advice from friends such as [[Bernard Baruch]], Byrnes became a wealthy man, but he never took his eyes off of a return to politics. He cultivated the Piedmont textile workers, who were key Blease supporters. In 1930, he challenged Blease again. Blease again led the primary, with 46 percent to 38 percent for Byrnes, but this time Byrnes won the run-off 51 to 49 percent.<ref>"Supplemental Report of the Secretary of State to the General Assembly of South Carolina." ''Reports of State Officers Boards and Committees to the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina''. Volume I. Columbia, SC: 1931, p. 3.</ref>

During his time in the U.S. Senate, Byrnes was regarded as the most influential South Carolinian since [[John C. Calhoun]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/27570082?uid=3739840&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21100908586011 | title=Book Reviews and Notes - Sly and Able: A Political Biography of James F. Byrnes | publisher=South Carolina Historical Society | work=South Carolina Historical Magazine | date=April 1995 | accessdate=July 10, 2012}}</ref>  He had long been friends with Franklin D. Roosevelt, whom he supported for the Democratic nomination in 1932, and made himself the President's spokesman on the Senate floor, where he guided much of the early [[New Deal]] legislation to passage. He won an easy reelection in 1936, promising:
<blockquote>
"I admit I am a New Dealer, and if [the New Deal] takes money from the few who have controlled the country and gives it back to the average man, I am going to Washington to help the President work for the people of South Carolina and the country."
</blockquote>

Since the colonial era, South Carolina's politicians had dreamed of an inland waterway system that would not only aid commerce, but also control flooding. By the 1930s, Byrnes took up the cause for a massive dam-building project, [[Santee Cooper]], that would not only accomplish those tasks but also electrify the entire state with [[hydroelectric]] power. With South Carolina financially strapped by the [[Great Depression]], Senator Byrnes managed to get the federal government to authorize a loan for the entire project, which was completed and put into operation in February 1942. The loan was later paid back to the federal government with full interest and at no cost to South Carolina taxpayers. Santee Cooper has continued to be a model for public-owned electrical utilities world-wide.

In 1937, Byrnes supported Roosevelt on the highly controversial [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|court packing plan]], but voted against the minimum wage law of 1938 that would have made, as he argued, the textile mills in his state uncompetitive. He opposed Roosevelt's efforts to purge conservative Democrats in the 1938 primary elections. On foreign policy, Byrnes was a champion of Roosevelt's positions of helping [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and [[France]] against [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939–1941, and of maintaining a hard diplomatic line against [[Japan]].

Byrnes played a key role in blocking [[Lynching in the United States|anti-lynching]] legislation, notably the Castigan-Wagner bill of 1935 and the Gavagan bill of 1937.<ref>[[Walter Francis White#Anti-Lynching Legislation]]</ref> Byrnes even claimed that lynching was necessary "in order to hold in check the Negro in the south", saying "rape is responsible, directly and indirectly, for most of the lynching in America".<ref>http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RCD6ZezE_3YC&lpg=PA271&ots=dzR1aqgVS2&dq=james%20f%20byrnes%20lynching&pg=PA271#v=onepage&q=james%20f%20byrnes%20lynching&f=false</ref>

Byrnes despised his fellow South Carolina Senator [[Ellison D. Smith|Cotton Ed Smith]], who strongly opposed the New Deal.<ref name=cottime>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,886159,00.html | work=Time | title=ELECTIONS: Curtains for Cotton Ed | date=August 7, 1944}}</ref> He privately sought to help his friend [[Burnet R. Maybank]], then the mayor of Charleston, defeat Smith in the 1938 Senate primary. During the primary, however, [[Olin Johnston]], who was limited to one term as governor, decided to run for the U.S. Senate.

In part as a reward for his crucial support on many issues, Roosevelt appointed Byrnes an Associate Justice of the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in July 1941. He was the last Justice appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States who had been admitted to practice by [[read law|reading law]]; he did not attend law school. Byrnes resigned from the Court after only fifteen months to head the Office of Economic Stabilization.<ref name="CBD"/>

Byrnes left the Supreme Court to head Roosevelt's [[Office of Economic Stabilization]], which dealt with the vitally important issues of prices and taxes.<ref name="CBD"/>  How powerful the new office would become depended entirely on Byrnes's political skills, and Washington insiders soon reported he was fully in charge. In May 1943, he also became head of the [[Office of War Mobilization]].<ref>Wallace, David Duncan. ''South Carolina: A Short History'' (University of North Carolina Press: Chapel Hill, 1951) p. 677.</ref>  Under the leadership of Byrnes, the program managed newly constructed factories across the country that utilized raw materials, civilian and military production, and transportation for U.S. military personnel and was credited with providing the employment needed to officially bring an end to the Great Depression<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/tassava |title=&#124; Economic History Services |publisher=Eh.net |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/economy-world-war-ii-aaw-03/ |title=Research & Articles on Economy, World War II by |publisher=BookRags.com |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/wwii-home-front/economy.html |title=Economy in World War II: Home Front |publisher=Shmoop.com |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2012}}</ref>  Thanks to his political experience, his probing intellect, his close friendship with Roosevelt, and in no small part to his own personal charm, Byrnes was soon exerting influence over many facets of the war effort which were not technically under his departmental jurisdiction. Many in Congress and the press began referring to Byrnes as the "Assistant President."<ref>''Ibid.''</ref><ref>Herman, Arthur.

Many expected that Byrnes would be the [[Democratic vice presidential nomination of 1944|Democratic nominee]] for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] with Roosevelt in 1944,<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> replacing [[Henry A. Wallace]], who party officials strongly felt was too eccentric to replace an ailing president who likely was going to die before his next term ended.<ref>{{cite web|author=LeRoy Ashby |url=http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/88/4/1586.extract |title=American Dreamer: The life and times of Henry A.

Truman]] of [[Missouri]]. Roosevelt brought Byrnes to the [[Yalta Conference]] in early 1945, where he seemed to favor Soviet plans. Written in shorthand, his notes comprise one of the most complete records of the "Big Three" Yalta meetings.

Upon his succession to the presidency after Roosevelt's death on April 12, 1945, Truman relied heavily on Byrnes's counsel, Byrnes having been a mentor to Truman from Truman's earliest days in the U.S. Senate.<ref>Messer, Robert L. 'The End of an Alliance: James F. Byrnes, Roosevelt, Truman, and the Origins of the Cold War'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1982), 13. Cited in reliance on citation in Robert J.

While Truman quickly fell out with Wallace, he retained a good working relationship with Byrnes and increasingly turned to him for support.<ref>''Ibid.'' p. 388.</ref>

Truman appointed Byrnes as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] on July 3, 1945.<ref>''Ibid.''  "A revealing moment during Byrnes' swearing-in ceremony as secretary of state offers insight into the relationship [between President Harry S. Truman and Byrnes]: The diary of Byrnes' friend and assistant Walter Brown records that 'when the oath was completed, the President said, "Jimmy, kiss the Bible."  He did and then handed it over to the President and told him to kiss it, too. The President did so as the crowd laughed..." ([[Gar Alperovitz]], ''The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb and the Architecture of an American Myth'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1995, p. 197).</ref>  He played a major role at the [[Potsdam Conference]], the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Conference]], and other major postwar conferences. According to historian Robert H. Ferrell, Byrnes knew little more about foreign relations than Truman. He made decisions after consulting a few advisors, such as [[Donald S. Russell]] and [[Benjamin V. Cohen]]. Byrnes and his small group paid little attention to the State Department and similarly ignored the President.<ref>Ferrell, Robert H. ''Harry S. Truman: a Life'' (1995), ISBN 0-8262-1050-3, pp. 236–237.</ref>

In 1945 Byrnes was elected an honorary member of the South Carolina [[Society of the Cincinnati]].

Although Byrnes's tough position against the Soviets paralleled the feelings of the President, personal relations between the two men grew strained, particularly when Truman felt that Byrnes was attempting to set foreign policy by himself, and only informing the President afterward. An early instance of this friction was the [[Moscow Conference (1945)|Moscow Conference]] in December 1945. Truman considered the “successes” of the conference to be “unreal” and was highly critical of Byrnes’s failure to protect [[Iran]], which was not mentioned in the final communiqué. “I had been left in the dark about the Moscow conference,” Truman told Byrnes bluntly.<ref>[[Harry S. Truman]], Memoirs, Vol. 1: ''Years of Decision'' (1955), p.547,550, cited in [[George Lenczowski]], ''American Presidents and the Middle East'', p.10</ref> In a subsequent letter to Byrnes, Truman took a harder line in reference to Iran, saying in part, "Without these supplies furnished by the United States, Russia would have been ignominiously defeated. Yet now Russia stirs up rebellion and keeps troops on the soil of her friend and ally— Iran... Unless Russia is faced with an iron fist and strong language another war is in the making. Only one language do they understand—“[[:q:en:Joseph Stalin#Contemporary witnesses|how many divisions do you have?]]”  I do not think we should play compromise any longer ...I am tired of babying the Soviets".<ref>[[Harry S. Truman]], Memoirs, Vol. 1: ''Years of Decision'' (1955), p.551–552, cited in Lenczowski, ''American Presidents'', p.11</ref>  This led to the [[Iran crisis of 1946]], and Byrnes took an increasingly hardline position in opposition to Stalin, culminating in a speech in [[Stuttgart]] on September 6, 1946. The "''[[Restatement of Policy on Germany]]''", also known as the "''Speech of Hope''", set the tone of future U.S. policy as it repudiated the [[Morgenthau Plan]], an economic program that would permanently deindustrialize Germany. Byrnes was named [[Time Person of the Year|''TIME'' Man of the Year]]. Truman and others believed that Byrnes had grown resentful that he had not been Roosevelt's running mate and successor, and in his resentment he was disrespecting Truman. Whether this was true or not, Byrnes felt compelled to resign from the Cabinet in 1947 with some feelings of bitterness.

==Governor of South Carolina==
At an age when most of his contemporaries retired from politics, Byrnes was not yet ready to give up public service. At age sixty-eight, he was elected governor of South Carolina, serving from 1951 to 1955, in which capacity he vigorously criticized the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.

Ironically, Byrnes was initially seen as a relative moderate on race issues. Recognizing that the South could not continue with its entrenched segregationist policies much longer but fearful of Congress imposing sweeping change upon the South, he opted for a course of change from within. To that end, he sought to fulfill at last the "separate but equal" policy which the South had put forward in Supreme Court civil rights cases, particularly in regard to public education. Byrnes poured state money into improving Negro schools, buying new textbooks and new buses, and hiring additional teachers. He also sought to curb the power of the Ku Klux Klan by passing a law that prohibited adults from wearing a mask in public on any day other than [[Halloween]]; he knew that many Klansmen feared exposure, and would not appear in public in their robes unless their faces were hidden as well. Byrnes hoped to make South Carolina an example for other Southern states to follow in modifying their "[[Jim Crow]]" policies. Nonetheless, the [[NAACP]] sued South Carolina to force the state to desegregate its schools. Byrnes requested [[Kansas]], a northern state which also segregated its schools, to provide an ''[[Amicus curiae]]'' brief in supporting the right of a state to segregate its schools. This gave the NAACP's lawyer, [[Thurgood Marshall]], the idea to shift the suit from South Carolina over to Kansas, which led directly to ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.

The South Carolina state constitution limited governors to one four-year term, and Byrnes retired from active political life following the 1954 election.

==Later political career==

In his later years, Byrnes foresaw that the American South could play a more important role in national politics. To hasten that development, he sought to end the region's nearly automatic support of the Democratic Party, which Byrnes believed had grown too liberal and took the "[[Solid South]]" for granted at election time, yet otherwise ignored the region and its needs. In time, he switched his own party affiliation to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and South Carolina within two decades of his death had become a reliably Republican state.

Byrnes endorsed [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1952, segregationist candidate [[Harry F. Byrd, Sr.|Harry Byrd]] in 1956, [[Richard M. Nixon]] in 1960 and 1968 and [[Barry Goldwater]] in 1964.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lamis|first=Alexander|title=The Two-Party South|year=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=15–16}}</ref>  He gave his private blessing to U.S. Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] of South Carolina to bolt the Democratic Party in 1964 and declare himself a Republican, but Byrnes himself remained a Democrat.

In 1965, Byrnes spoke out against the "punishment" and "humiliation" of South Carolina U.S. Representative [[Albert Watson (politician)|Albert W. Watson]], who had been stripped of his congressional seniority by the [[House Democratic Caucus]] after endorsing Goldwater for president. Byrnes openly endorsed Watson retention to Congress in a [[special election]] held in 1965 against the Democrat [[Preston Callison]]. Watson secured $20,000 and the services of a [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] field representative in what he termed "quite a contrast" to his treatment from House colleagues.<ref>Billy Hathorn, "The Changing Politics of Race: Congressman Albert William Watson and the South Carolina Republican Party, 1965-1970", ''South Carolina Historical Magazine'' Vol. 89 (October 1988), p. 230</ref><ref>''Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report'', Vol. 23 (June 18, 1965), p. 1185; Bernard Cosman and Robert J. Huckshorn, eds., ''Republican Politics: The 1964 Campaign and Its Aftermath for the Party'' (New York: Praeger, 1968), pp. 147–148</ref>

In 1968, Byrnes secretly advised Nixon on how to win old-time Southern Democrats to the Republican Party.

Following Byrnes' death on April 9, 1972, at the age of 89, he was interred in the churchyard at [[Trinity Episcopal Church (Columbia, South Carolina)|Trinity Episcopal Church]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].

'''Fourier optics''' is the study of classical [[optics]] using [[Fourier transform]]s, in which the wave is regarded as a superposition of plane waves that are not related to ''any'' identifiable sources; instead they are the natural modes of the propagation medium itself.  Fourier optics can be seen as the dual of the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]], in which the wave is regarded as a superposition of expanding spherical waves which radiate outward from actual (physically identifiable) current sources via a [[Green's function]] relationship (see [[Double-slit experiment]])

A curved phasefront may be synthesized from an infinite number of these "natural modes" i.e., from plane wave phasefronts oriented in different directions in space.  Far from its sources, an expanding spherical wave is locally tangent to a planar phase front (a single plane wave out of the infinite spectrum), which is transverse to the radial direction of propagation.  In this case, a [[Fraunhofer diffraction]] pattern is created, which emanates from a single spherical wave phase center.  In the near field, no single well-defined spherical wave phase center exists, so the wavefront isn't locally tangent to a spherical ball.  In this case, a [[Fresnel diffraction]] pattern would be created, which emanates from an ''extended'' source, consisting of a distribution of (physically identifiable) spherical wave sources in space.  In the near field, a full spectrum of plane waves is necessary to represent the Fresnel near-field wave, ''even locally''.  A "wide" [[wave]] moving forward (like an expanding ocean wave coming toward the shore) can be regarded as an infinite number of "[[Wave function|plane wave modes]]", all of which could (when they collide with something in the way) scatter independently of one other. These mathematical simplifications and calculations are the realm of [[Fourier analysis|Fourier analysis and synthesis]] &ndash; together, they can describe what happens when light passes through various slits, lenses or mirrors curved one way or the other, or is fully or partially reflected. 
Fourier optics forms much of the theory behind [[image processing|image processing techniques]], as well as finding applications where information needs to be extracted from optical sources such as in [[quantum optics]]. To put it in a slightly more complex way, similar to the concept of ''[[frequency]]'' and ''[[Time in physics|time]]'' used in traditional [[Fourier transform| Fourier transform theory]], Fourier optics makes use of the [[spatial frequency]] domain (''k<sub>x</sub>'', ''k<sub>y</sub>'') as the conjugate of the spatial (''x'',''y'') domain. Terms and concepts such as transform theory, spectrum, bandwidth, window functions and sampling from one-dimensional [[signal processing]] are commonly used.

== Overview of light propagation in homogeneous, source-free media ==

Light can be described as a waveform propagating through free space (vacuum) or a material medium (such as air or glass). Mathematically, the (real valued) amplitude of one wave component is represented by a scalar wave function ''u'' that depends on both space and time:

:<math> u = u(\mathbf{r},t)</math>

where

:<math> \mathbf{r} = (x,y,z) </math>

represents position in three dimensional space, and ''t'' represents time.

===The wave equation in the time domain===

Fourier optics begins with the homogeneous, scalar [[wave equation]] (valid in source-free regions):

:<math>
\left(\nabla^2-\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial{t}^2}\right)u(\mathbf{r},t)=0.
</math>

where ''u''('''r''',''t'') is a [[real number|real valued]] Cartesian component of an electromagnetic wave propagating through free space.

===The Helmholtz equation in the frequency domain===

If light of a fixed [[frequency]]/[[wavelength]]/[[color]] (as from a laser) is assumed, then the time-[[harmonic]] (frequency-domain) form of the optical field is given as:

:<math>\psi(\mathbf{r}) = a(\mathbf{r}) e^{j \phi (\mathbf{r}) }  </math>

where <math> \psi </math>  is in general a complex quantity, with separate amplitude and phase.

The time-domain field is related to the frequency domain field via the equation,

:<math>u(\mathbf{r},t) = \mathrm{Re} \left\{  \psi(\mathbf{r}) e^{j\omega t} \right\} </math>.

Substituting this expression into the wave equation yields the time-independent form of the wave equation, also known as the [[Helmholtz equation]]:

:<math>\left(\nabla^2+ k^2 \right) \psi (\mathbf{r})=0</math>

where 
:<math>k = { \omega \over c} = { 2 \pi \over \lambda }</math>

is the wave number, ''j'' is the [[imaginary unit]], and ?('''r''') is the time-independent, [[complex number|complex-valued]] component of the propagating wave. Note that the propagation constant, k, and the frequency, <math> \omega </math>, are linearly related to one another, a typical characteristic of transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waves in homogeneous media.

===Paraxial plane waves (Optic axis is assumed z-directed)===

As will be shown rigorously in the following section, an elementary product solution to this equation takes the form:

:<math>\psi(\mathbf{r}) = A(\mathbf{k}) e^{-j \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}}</math>

where

:<math>\mathbf{k} = k_x \mathbf{x} + k_y \mathbf{y} + k_z\mathbf{z} </math>

is the [[wave vector]], and

:<math> k = \|\mathbf{k}\| = \sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2  + k_z^2} = {\omega \over c}</math>

is the wave number. Next, using the [[paraxial approximation]], it is assumed that

:<math>k_x^2 + k_y^2 \ll k_z^2 </math>

or equivalently,

:<math>\sin \theta \approx \theta </math>

where ? is the angle between the wave vector '''k''' and the z-axis.

As a result,
:<math> k_z = k \cos \theta \approx k ( 1 - \theta^2 / 2)</math>
and
:<math>\psi(\mathbf{r}) \approx A(\mathbf{k}) e^{-j(k_x x+k_y y)} e^{jkz \theta^2/2 }  e^{-jk z}</math>

=== The paraxial wave equation ===

Substituting this expression into the Helmholtz equation, the paraxial wave equation is derived:
:<math>\nabla_T^2 A - 2jk { \partial A \over \partial z} = 0</math>
where
:<math>\nabla_T^2 = \nabla^2 - {\partial^2 \over \partial z^2} = {\partial^2 \over \partial x^2} + {\partial^2 \over \partial y^2} </math>
is the transverse [[Laplace operator]], shown here in Cartesian coordinates.

==The plane wave spectrum: the foundation of Fourier optics==

Fourier optics is somewhat different from ordinary ray optics typically used in the analysis and design of focused imaging systems such as cameras, telescopes and microscopes.  Ray optics is the very first type of optics most of us encounter in our lives; it's simple to conceptualize and understand, and works very well in gaining a baseline understanding of common optical devices.  Unfortunately, ray optics does not explain the operation of Fourier optical systems, which are in general not focused systems.  Ray optics is a subset of wave optics (in the jargon, it is "the asymptotic zero-wavelength limit" of wave optics) and therefore has limited applicability.  We have to know when it is valid and when it is not - and this is one of those times when it is not.  For our current task, we must expand our understanding of optical phenomena to encompass wave optics, in which the optical field is seen as a solution to Maxwell's equations.  This more general ''wave optics'' accurately explains the operation of Fourier optics devices.

In this section, we won't go all the way back to Maxwell's equations, but will start instead with the homogeneous Helmholtz equation (valid in source-free media), which is one level of refinement up from Maxwell's equations (Scott [1998]).  From this equation, we'll show how infinite uniform plane waves comprise one field solution (out of many possible) in free space.  These uniform plane waves form the basis for understanding Fourier optics.

The [[plane wave]] spectrum concept is the basic foundation of Fourier Optics. The plane wave spectrum is a continuous spectrum of ''uniform'' plane waves, and there is one plane wave component in the spectrum for every tangent point on the far-field phase front. The amplitude of that plane wave component would be the amplitude of the optical field at that tangent point. Again, this is true only in the far field, defined as: Range = 2 D<sup>2</sup> / ? where D is the maximum linear extent of the optical sources and ? is the wavelength (Scott [1998]). The plane wave spectrum is often regarded as being discrete for certain types of periodic gratings, though in reality, the spectra from gratings are continuous as well, since no physical device can have the infinite extent required to produce a true line spectrum.

As in the case of electrical signals, bandwidth is a measure of how finely detailed an image is; the finer the detail, the greater the bandwidth required to represent it.  A DC electrical signal is constant and has no oscillations; a plane wave propagating parallel to the optic axis has constant value in any ''x''-''y'' plane, and therefore is analogous to the (constant) DC component of an electrical signal.  Bandwidth in electrical signals relates to the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies present in the spectrum of the signal.  For ''optical'' systems, bandwidth also relates to spatial frequency content (spatial bandwidth), but it also has a secondary meaning.  It also measures how far from the optic axis the corresponding plane waves are tilted, and so this type of bandwidth is often referred to also as angular bandwidth. It takes more frequency bandwidth to produce a short pulse in an electrical circuit, and more angular (or, spatial frequency) bandwidth to produce a sharp spot in an optical system (see discussion related to [[Point spread function]]).

The plane wave spectrum arises naturally as the [[eigenfunction]] or "natural mode" solution to the homogeneous [[electromagnetic wave equation]] in rectangular coordinates (see also [[Electromagnetic radiation]], which derives the wave equation from Maxwell's equations in source-free media, or Scott [1998]). In the [[frequency domain]], with an assumed (engineering) time convention of <math>  e^{j \omega t} </math>, the homogeneous electromagnetic wave equation is known as the [[Helmholtz equation]] and takes the form:

: <math>  \nabla^2 E_u + k^2E_u = 0  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(2.0) </math>

where ''u'' = ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' and ''k'' = 2?/? is the [[wavenumber]] of the medium.

===Eigenfunction (natural mode) solutions: background and overview===

In the case of differential equations, as in the case of matrix equations, whenever the right-hand side of an equation is zero (i.e., the forcing function / forcing vector is zero), the equation may still admit a non-trivial solution, known in applied mathematics as an [[eigenfunction]] solution, in physics as a "natural mode" solution and in electrical circuit theory as the "zero-input response."  This is a concept that spans a wide range of physical disciplines.  Common physical examples of ''resonant'' natural modes would include the resonant vibrational modes of stringed instruments (1D), percussion instruments (2D) or the former [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]] (3D).  Examples of ''propagating'' natural modes would include [[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] modes, [[optical fiber]] modes, [[Soliton (optics)|solitons]] and [[Bloch wave]]s.  Infinite homogeneous media admit the rectangular, circular and spherical harmonic solutions to the Helmholtz equation, depending on the coordinate system under consideration.  The propagating plane waves we'll study in this article are perhaps the simplest type of propagating waves found in any type of media. 

There is a striking similarity between the Helmholtz equation (2.0) above, which may be written

: <math>  (\nabla^2 + k^2)~f = 0 , </math>

and the usual equation for the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues/eigenvectors]] of a square matrix, '''A''',

: <math>  (\bold A - \lambda \bold I) ~ \bold x = 0   </math>  ,

particularly since both the scalar Laplacian,  <math>  \nabla^2  </math> and the matrix, '''A''' are linear operators on their respective function/vector spaces (the minus sign in the second equation is, for all intents and purposes, immaterial; the plus sign in the first equation however is significant).  It is perhaps worthwhile to note that both the eigenfunction and eigenvector solutions to these two equations respectively, often yield an orthogonal set of functions/vectors which span (i.e., form a basis set for) the function/vector spaces under consideration. The interested reader may investigate other functional linear operators which give rise to different kinds of orthogonal eigenfunctions such as [[Legendre polynomials]], [[Chebyshev polynomials]] and [[Hermite polynomials]].  

In the matrix case, eigenvalues <math>\lambda</math> may be found by setting the determinant of the matrix equal to zero, i.e. finding where the matrix has no inverse.  Finite matrices have only a finite number of eigenvalues/eigenvectors, whereas linear operators can have a countably infinite number of eigenvalues/eigenfunctions (in confined regions) or uncountably infinite (continuous) spectra of solutions, as in unbounded regions.

In certain physics applications such as in the [[Bloch wave – MoM method|computation of bands in a periodic volume]], it is often the case that the elements of a matrix will be very complicated functions of frequency and wavenumber, and the matrix will be non-singular for most combinations of frequency and wavenumber, but will also be singular for certain specific combinations. By finding which combinations of frequency and wavenumber drive the determinant of the matrix to zero, the propagation characteristics of the medium may be determined. Relations of this type, between frequency and wavenumber, are known as dispersion relations and some physical systems may admit many different kinds of dispersion relations. An example from electromagnetics is the ordinary waveguide, which may admit numerous dispersion relations, each associated with a unique mode of the waveguide. Each propagation mode of the waveguide is known as an [[eigenfunction]] solution (or eigenmode solution) to Maxwell's equations in the waveguide. Free space also admits eigenmode (natural mode) solutions (known more commonly as plane waves), but with the distinction that for any given frequency, free space admits a continuous modal spectrum, whereas waveguides have a discrete mode spectrum.  In this case the dispersion relation is linear, as in section 1.2.

===Solving the Helmholtz equation: separation of variables and elementary product solutions===

Solutions to the Helmholtz equation (2.0) may readily be found in [[rectangular coordinates]] via the principle of [[separation of variables]] for [[partial differential equation]]s. This principle says that in separable [[orthogonal coordinates]], an ''elementary product solution'' to this wave equation may be constructed of the following form:

: <math>  E_u(x, y, z) = f_x(x) \times f_y(y) \times f_z(z)</math>

i.e., as the product of a function of ''x'', times a function of ''y'', times a function of ''z''. If this ''elementary product solution'' is substituted into the wave equation (2.0), using the [[Laplace operator|scalar Laplacian]] in rectangular coordinates:

: <math> \nabla^2 E_u = \frac{\partial^2 E_u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 E_u}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 E_u}{\partial z^2}  </math>

then the following equation for the 3 individual functions is obtained

: <math>f''_x(x)f_y(y)f_z(z) + f_x(x)f''_y(y)f_z(z) + f_x(x)f_y(y)f''_z(z) + k^2f_x(x)f_y(y)f_z(z)=0  \,</math>

which is readliy rearranged into the form:

: <math>   \frac{f''_x(x)}{f_x(x)}+ \frac{f''_y(y)}{f_y(y)} + \frac{f''_z(z)}{f_z(z)} + k^2=0 </math>

It may now be argued that each of the quotients in the equation above must, of necessity, be constant. For, say the first quotient is not constant, and is a function of ''x''. None of the other terms in the equation has any dependence on the variable x. Therefore, the first term may not have any ''x''-dependence either; it must be constant. The constant is denoted as -''k''<sub>x</sub>². Reasoning in a similar way for the ''y'' and ''z'' quotients, three ordinary differential equations are obtained for the ''f''<sub>x</sub>, ''f''<sub>y</sub> and ''f''<sub>z</sub>, along with one ''separation condition'':

: <math>\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f_x(x) + k_x^2 f_x(x)=0</math>

: <math>\frac{d^2}{dy^2}f_y(y) + k_y^2 f_y(y)=0</math>

: <math>\frac{d^2}{dz^2}f_z(z) + k_z^2 f_z(z)=0</math>

: <math>k_x^2+k_y^2+k_z^2= k^2</math>

Each of these 3 differential equations has the same solution: sines, cosines or complex exponentials.  We'll go with the complex exponential for notational simplicity, compatibility with usual FT notation, and the fact that a two-sided integral of complex exponentials picks up both the sine and cosine contributions.  As a result, the elementary product solution for ''E''<sub>u</sub> is:

: <math>E_u(x,y,z)=e^{j(k_x x + k_y y + k_z z)} </math>
::::: <math> =e^{j(k_x x + k_y y)} e^{j k_z z}</math>
::::: <math> =e^{j(k_x x + k_y y)} e^{\pm j z \sqrt{k^2-k_x^2-k_y^2} }</math>

which represents a propagating or exponentially decaying uniform plane wave solution to the homogeneous wave equation. The - sign is used for a wave propagating/decaying in the +z direction and the + sign is used for a wave propagating/decaying in the -z direction (this follows the engineering time convention, which assumes an e<sup>j?t</sup> time dependence). This field represents a propagating plane wave when the quantity under the radical is positive, and an exponentially decaying wave when it is negative (in passive media, the root with a non-positive imaginary part must always be chosen, to represent uniform propagation or decay, but not amplification).

Product solutions to the Helmholtz equation are also readily obtained in [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical]] and [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]], yielding cylindrical and spherical harmonics (with the remaining separable coordinate systems being used much less frequently).

=== The complete solution: the superposition integral ===

A general solution to the homogeneous electromagnetic wave equation in rectangular coordinates may be formed as a weighted superposition of all possible elementary plane wave solutions as:

: <math>E_u(x,y,z)=\int\!\!\!\int E_u(k_x,k_y) ~ e^{j(k_x x + k_y y)} ~ e^{\pm j z \sqrt{k^2-k_x^2-k_y^2} } ~ dk_x dk_y ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(2.1) </math>

where the integrals extend from minus infinity to infinity.

'''This plane wave spectrum representation of the electromagnetic field is the basic foundation of Fourier Optics''' (this point cannot be emphasized strongly enough), because when ''z''=0, the equation above simply becomes a '''Fourier transform (FT) relationship between the field and its plane wave content'''  (hence the name, "Fourier optics").  

All spatial dependence of the individual plane wave components is described explicitly via the exponential functions. The coefficients of the exponentials are only functions of spatial wavenumber ''k<sub>x</sub>'', ''k<sub>y</sub>'', just as in ordinary [[Fourier analysis]] and [[Fourier transform]]s.

=== Free space as a low-pass filter ===
When
: <math>   k_x^2+k_y^2 > k^2   </math>
the plane waves are evanescent (decaying), so that any spatial frequency content in an object plane transparency which is finer than one wavelength will not be transferred over to the image plane, simply because the plane waves corresponding to that content cannot propagate. In connection with lithography of electronic components, this phenomenon is known as the diffraction limit and is the reason why light of progressively higher frequency (smaller wavelength, thus larger ''k'') is required for etching progressively finer features in integrated circuits.

=== The far field approximation and the concept of angular bandwidth ===

The equation above may be evaluated asymptotically in the far field (using the [[stationary phase approximation|stationary phase method]]) to show that the field at the distant point (''x'',''y'',''z'') is indeed due solely to the plane wave component (''k<sub>x</sub>'', ''k<sub>y</sub>'', ''k<sub>z</sub>'') which propagates parallel to the vector (''x'',''y'',''z''), and whose plane is tangent to the phasefront at (''x'',''y'',''z''). The mathematical details of this process may be found in Scott [1998] or Scott [1990]. The result of performing a stationary phase integration on the expression above is the following expression,

: <math>E_u(r,\theta,\phi)~=~2 \pi j~ (k~\cos\theta)~ \frac{e^{-jkr}}{r}~ E_u(k~\sin\theta~\cos\phi,k~\sin\theta~\sin\phi) ~~~~~~~~~~~~(2.2)</math>

which clearly indicates that the field at (x,y,z) is directly proportional to the spectral component in the direction of (x,y,z), where,

: <math> x = r ~ \sin \theta ~ \cos \phi </math>

: <math> y = r ~ \sin \theta ~ \sin \phi </math>

: <math> z = r ~ \cos \theta ~ </math>

and

: <math> k_x = k ~ \sin \theta ~ \cos \phi </math>

: <math> k_y = k ~ \sin \theta ~ \sin \phi </math>

: <math> k_z = k ~ \cos \theta ~ </math>

Stated another way, the radiation pattern of any planar field distribution is the FT of that source distribution (see [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]], wherein the same equation is developed using a [[Green's function]] approach). Note that this is NOT a plane wave, as many might think. The <math> \frac{e^{-jkr}}{r}</math> radial dependence is a spherical wave - both in magnitude and phase - whose local amplitude is the FT of the source plane distribution at that far field angle. The plane wave spectrum has nothing to do with saying that the field behaves something like a plane wave for far distances.

Equation (2.2) above is '''critical''' to making the connection between ''spatial bandwidth'' (on the one hand) and ''angular bandwidth'' (on the other), in the far field. Note that the term "far field" usually means we're talking about a converging or diverging spherical wave with a pretty well defined phase center. The connection between spatial and angular bandwidth in the far field is essential in understanding the low pass filtering property of thin lenses. See section 5.1.3 for the condition defining the far field region.

Once the concept of angular bandwidth is understood, the optical scientist can "jump back and forth" between the spatial and spectral domains to quickly gain insights which would ordinarily not be so readily available just through spatial domain or ray optics considerations alone. For example, any source bandwidth which lies past the edge angle to the first lens (this edge angle sets the bandwidth of the optical system) will not be captured by the system to be processed.

As a side note, electromagnetics scientists have devised an alternative means for calculating the far zone electric field which does not involve stationary phase integration.  They have devised a concept known as "fictitious magnetic currents" usually denoted by '''M''', and defined as
: <math> ~ ~ \bold{M} ~ = ~ 2 \bold{E}^{aper} ~ \bold{x} ~ \bold{\hat{z}} </math>.
In this equation, it is assumed that the unit vector in the z-direction points into the half-space where the far field calculations will be made.  These equivalent magnetic currents are obtained using equivalence principles which, in the case of an infinite planar interface, allow any electric currents, '''J''' to be "imaged away" while the fictitious magnetic currents are obtained from twice the aperture electric field (see Scott [1998]).  Then the radiated electric field is calculated from the magnetic currents using an equation similar to the equation for the magnetic field radiated by an electric current.  In this way, a vector equation is obtained for the radiated electric field in terms of the aperture electric field and the derivation requires no use of stationary phase ideas.

=== K-space ===

The separation condition,

: <math> k_x^2+k_y^2+k_z^2=k^2 </math>

which is identical to the equation for the [[Euclidean metric]] in three-dimensional configuration space, suggests the notion of a [[wave vector|k-vector]] in three-dimensional "k-space", defined (for propagating plane waves) in rectangular coordinates as:

: <math> \bold{k} ~ = ~ k_x  \bold{\hat{x}} + k_y \bold{\hat{y}} + k_z  \bold{\hat{z}} </math>

and in the [[spherical coordinate system]] as

: <math> k_x = k ~ \sin \theta ~ \cos \phi </math>

: <math> k_y = k ~ \sin \theta ~ \sin \phi </math>

: <math> k_z = k ~ \cos \theta ~ </math>

Use will be made of these spherical coordinate system relations in the next section.

The notion of k-space is central to many disciplines in engineering and physics, especially in the study of periodic volumes, such as in crystallography and the band theory of semiconductor materials.

== Fourier's theorem: Fourier transform pairs ==
=== The two-dimensional Fourier transform pairs ===

Analysis Equation (calculating the spectrum of the function):

Synthesis Equation (reconstructing the function from its spectrum):

''Note'': the normalizing factor of:<math>\frac{1}{(2\pi)^2} </math> is present whenever angular frequency (radians) is used, but not when ordinary frequency (cycles) is used.

==Optical systems: General overview and analogy with electrical signal processing systems==

An optical system consists of an input plane, and output plane, and a set of components that transforms the image ''f'' formed at the input into a different image ''g'' formed at the output. The output image is related to the input image by convolving the input image with the optical impulse response, ''h'' (known as the ''point-spread function'', for focused optical systems). The impulse response uniquely defines the input-output behavior of the optical system. By convention, the optic axis of the system is taken as the ''z''-axis. As a result, the two images and the impulse response are all functions of the transverse coordinates, ''x'' and ''y''.

The impulse response of an optical imaging system is the output plane field which is produced when an ideal mathematical point source of light is placed in the input plane (usually on-axis). In practice, it is not necessary to have an ideal point source in order to determine an exact impulse response. This is because any source bandwidth which lies outside the bandwidth of the system won't matter anyway (since it cannot even be captured by the optical system), so therefore it's not necessary in determining the impulse response. The source only needs to have at least as much (angular) bandwidth as the optical system.

Optical systems typically fall into one of two different categories. The first is the ordinary focused optical imaging system, wherein the input plane is called the object plane and the output plane is called the image plane. The field in the image plane is desired to be a high-quality reproduction of the field in the object plane. In this case, the impulse response of the optical system is desired to approximate a 2D delta function, at the same location (or a linearly scaled location) in the output plane corresponding to the location of the impulse in the input plane. The ''actual'' impulse response typically resembles an [[Airy disk|Airy function]], whose radius is on the order of the wavelength of the light used. In this case, the impulse response is typically referred to as a [[point spread function]], since the mathematical point of light in the object plane has been spread out into an Airy function in the image plane.

The second type is the optical image processing system, in which a significant feature in the input plane field is to be located and isolated. In this case, the impulse response of the system is desired to be a close replica (picture) of that feature which is being searched for in the input plane field, so that a convolution of the impulse response (an image of the desired feature) against the input plane field will produce a bright spot at the feature location in the output plane.  It is this latter type of optical ''image processing'' system that is the subject of this section.  Section 5.2 presents one hardware implementation of the optical image processing operations described in this section.

=== Input plane ===

The input plane is defined as the locus of all points such that ''z'' = 0. The input image ''f'' is therefore

:<math>f(x,y) = U(x,y,z)\big|_{z=0} </math>

=== Output plane ===

The output plane is defined as the locus of all points such that ''z'' = ''d''. The output image ''g'' is therefore

:<math>g(x,y) = U(x,y,z)\big|_{z=d} </math>

=== The 2D convolution of input function against the impulse response function ===

:<math> g(x,y) ~ = ~ h(x,y) * f(x,y) </math>

i.e.,

:<math> g(x,y)= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  h(x-x', y-y') ~ f(x',y') ~ dx' dy'   ~~~~~~(4.1)  ~</math>

The alert reader will note that the integral above tacitly assumes that the impulse response is NOT a function of the position (x',y') of the impulse of light in the input plane (if this were not the case, this type of convolution would not be possible). This property is known as ''shift invariance'' (Scott [1998]). No optical system is perfectly shift invariant: as the ideal, mathematical point of light is scanned away from the optic axis, aberrations will eventually degrade the impulse response (known as a [[coma (optics)|coma]] in focused imaging systems). However, high quality optical systems are often "shift invariant enough" over certain regions of the input plane that we may regard the impulse response as being a function of only the difference between input and output plane coordinates, and thereby use the equation above with impunity.

Also, this equation assumes unit magnification. If magnification is present, then eqn. (4.1) becomes

:<math> g(x,y)= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  h_M(x-Mx', y-My') ~ f(x',y') ~ dx' dy'   ~~~~~~(4.2)  ~</math>

which basically translates the impulse response function, h<sub>M</sub>(), from x' to x=Mx'. In (4.2), h<sub>M</sub>() will be a magnified version of the impulse response function h() of a similar, unmagnified system, so that h<sub>M</sub>(x,y) =h(x/M,y/M).

=== Derivation of the convolution equation ===
The extension to two dimensions is trivial, except for the difference that [[causality]] exists in the time domain, but not in the spatial domain. Causality means that the impulse response ''h''(''t'' - t') of an electrical system, due to an impulse applied at time t', must of necessity be zero for all times t such that t - t' < 0.

Obtaining the convolution representation of the system response requires representing the input signal as a weighted superposition over a train of impulse functions by using the ''sifting property'' of [[Dirac delta function]]s.

:<math>  f(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}    \delta(t-t') f(t') dt'</math>

It is then presumed that the system under consideration is ''linear'', that is to say that the output of the system due to two different inputs (possibly at two different times) is the sum of the individual outputs of the system to the two inputs, when introduced individually. Thus the optical system may contain no nonlinear materials nor active devices (except possibly, extremely linear active devices). The output of the system, for a single delta function input is defined as the ''impulse response'' of the system, h(t - t').  And, by our linearity assumption (i.e., that the output of system to a pulse train input is the sum of the outputs due to each individual pulse), we can now say that the general input function ''f''(''t'') produces the output: 

:<math>  Output(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}    h(t-t') f(t') dt'</math>

where ''h''(t - t') is the (impulse) response of the linear system to the delta function input ?(t - t'), applied at time t'. This is where the convolution equation above comes from. The convolution equation is useful because it is often much easier to find the response of a system to a delta function input - and then perform the convolution above to find the response to an arbitrary input - than it is to try to find the response to the arbitrary input directly. Also, the impulse response (in either time or frequency domains) usually yields insight to relevant figures of merit of the system. In the case of most lenses, the point spread function (PSF) is a pretty common figure of merit for evaluation purposes.

The same logic is used in connection with the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]], or Stratton-Chu formulation, wherein the "impulse response" is referred to as the [[Green's function]] of the system. So the spatial domain operation of a linear optical system is analogous in this way to the Huygens–Fresnel principle.

=== System transfer function ===
If the last equation above is Fourier transformed, it becomes:

:<math>  Output(\omega) ~ = ~  H(\omega)~ F(\omega) </math>

where

:<math> Output(\omega) ~ </math> is the spectrum of the output signal

:<math> H(\omega) ~ </math> is the system transfer function

:<math> F(\omega) ~ </math> is the spectrum of the input signal

In like fashion, (4.1) may be Fourier transformed to yield:

:<math> G(k_x,k_y) ~ = ~ H(k_x,k_y) ~ F(k_x,k_y)</math>

The system transfer function, <math>H(\omega)</math>. In optical imaging this function is better known as the [[optical transfer function]] ''(Goodman)''.

Once again it may be noted from the discussion on the [[Abbe sine condition]], that this equation assumes unit magnification.

This equation takes on its real meaning when the Fourier transform, <math> ~G(k_x,k_y)</math> is associated with the coefficient of the plane wave whose transverse wavenumbers are <math>~ (k_x,k_y)</math>. Thus, the input-plane plane wave spectrum is transformed into the output-plane plane wave spectrum through the multiplicative action of the system transfer function. It is at this stage of understanding that the previous background on the plane wave spectrum becomes invaluable to the conceptualization of Fourier optical systems.

==Applications of  Fourier optics principles==
Fourier optics is used in the field of optical information processing, the staple of which is the classical 4F processor. 

The [[Fourier transform]] properties of a [[lens (optics)|lens]] provide numerous applications in [[optical signal processing]] such as [[spatial filtering]], [[optical correlation]] and [[computer generated holograms]]. 

Fourier optical theory is used in [[interferometry]], [[optical tweezers]], [[Magnetic trap (atoms)|atom traps]], and [[quantum computing]]. Concepts of Fourier optics are used to reconstruct the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of light intensity in the spatial frequency plane (see [[adaptive-additive algorithm]]).

===Fourier transforming property of lenses===

If a transmissive object is placed one focal length in front of a [[lens (optics)|lens]], then its [[Fourier transform]] will be formed one focal length behind the lens. Consider the figure to the right (click to enlarge)

[[File:Lens FT.jpg|On the Fourier transforming property of lenses|right|thumb|500px]]

In this figure, a plane wave incident from the left is assumed. The transmittance function in the front focal plane (i.e., Plane 1) ''spatially modulates the incident plane wave'' in magnitude and phase, ''like on the left-hand side of eqn. (2.1)'' (specified to ''z''=0), and ''in so doing, produces a spectrum of plane waves'' corresponding to the FT of the transmittance function, ''like on the right-hand side of eqn. (2.1)'' (for ''z''>0). The various plane wave components propagate at different tilt angles with respect to the optic axis of the lens (i.e., the horizontal axis). The finer the features in the transparency, the broader the angular bandwidth of the plane wave spectrum. We'll consider one such plane wave component, propagating at angle ? with respect to the optic axis. It is assumed that ? is small ([[paraxial approximation]]), so that

: <math>\frac{k_x}{k} = \sin \theta \cong \theta</math>

and 

: <math>\frac{k_z}{k} = \cos \theta \cong 1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2} </math>

and 

: <math> \frac{1}{\cos \theta} \cong \frac{1}{1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2}} \cong 1 + \frac{\theta^2}{2} </math>

In the figure, the ''plane wave'' phase, moving horizontally from the front focal plane to the lens plane, is

: <math> e^{j k f \cos \theta} \,</math>

and the ''spherical wave'' phase from the lens to the spot in the back focal plane is:

: <math> e^{j k f / \cos \theta} \,</math>

and the sum of the two path lengths is ''f'' (1 + ?<sup>2</sup>/2 + 1 - ?<sup>2</sup>/2) = 2''f''   i.e., it is a constant value, independent of tilt angle, ?, for paraxial plane waves. Each paraxial plane wave component of the field in the front focal plane appears as a [[Point spread function]] spot in the back focal plane, with an intensity and phase equal to the intensity and phase of the original plane wave component in the front focal plane. In other words, the field in the back focal plane is the [[Fourier transform]] of the field in the front focal plane.  

All FT components are computed simultaneously - in parallel - at the speed of light. As an example, light travels at a speed of roughly {{convert|1|ft|m|abbr=on}}. / ns, so if a lens has a {{convert|1|ft|m|abbr=on}}. focal length, an entire 2D FT can be computed in about 2 ns (2 x 10<sup>?9</sup> seconds). If the focal length is 1 in., then the time is under 200 ps. No electronic computer can compete with these kinds of numbers or perhaps ever hope to, although new supercomputers such as the petaflop [[IBM Roadrunner]] may actually prove faster than optics, as improbable as that may seem. However, their speed is obtained by combining numerous computers which, individually, are still slower than optics. The disadvantage of the optical FT is that, as the derivation shows, the FT relationship only holds for paraxial plane waves, so this FT "computer" is inherently bandlimited. On the other hand, since the wavelength of visible light is so minute in relation to even the smallest visible feature dimensions in the image i.e.,

: <math> k^2 \gg  k_x ^2 + k_y ^2 </math>

(for all ''k<sub>x</sub>'', ''k<sub>y</sub>'' within the spatial bandwidth of the image, so that ''k<sub>z</sub>'' is nearly equal to ''k''), the paraxial approximation is not terribly limiting in practice. And, of course, this is an analog - not a digital - computer, so precision is limited. Also, phase can be challenging to extract; often it is inferred interferometrically.

Optical processing is especially useful in real time applications where rapid processing of massive amounts of 2D data is required, particularly in relation to pattern recognition.

====Object truncation and Gibbs phenomenon====
  
The spatially modulated electric field, shown on the left-hand side of eqn. (2.1), typically only occupies a finite (usually rectangular) aperture in the x,y plane. The rectangular aperture function acts like a 2D square-top filter, where the field is assumed to be zero outside this 2D rectangle. The spatial domain integrals for calculating the FT coefficients on the right-hand side of eqn. (2.1) are truncated at the boundary of this aperture. This step truncation can introduce inaccuracies in both theoretical calculations and measured values of the plane wave coefficients on the RHS of eqn. (2.1).  

Whenever a function is discontinuously truncated in one FT domain, broadening and rippling are introduced in the other FT domain. A perfect example from optics is in connection with the [[Point spread function]], which for on-axis plane wave illumination of a quadratic lens (with circular aperture), is an Airy function,  ''J''<sub>1</sub>(''x'')/''x''. Literally, the point source has been "spread out" (with ripples added), to form the Airy point spread function (as the result of truncation of the plane wave spectrum by the finite aperture of the lens). This source of error is known as [[Gibbs phenomenon]] and it may be mitigated by simply ensuring that all significant content lies near the center of the transparency, or through the use of [[window function]]s which smoothly taper the field to zero at the frame boundaries. By the convolution theorem, the FT of an arbitrary transparency function - multiplied (or truncated) by an aperture function - is equal to the FT of the non-truncated transparency function convolved against the FT of the aperture function, which in this case becomes a type of "Greens function" or "impulse response function" in the spectral domain. Therefore, the image of a circular lens is equal to the object plane function convolved against the Airy function (the FT of a circular aperture function is ''J''<sub>1</sub>(''x'')/''x'' and the FT of a rectangular aperture function is a product of sinc functions, sin ''x''/''x'').

==== Fourier analysis and functional decomposition ====
 
Even though the input transparency only occupies a finite portion of the ''x''-''y'' plane (Plane 1), the uniform plane waves comprising the plane wave spectrum occupy the '''entire''' ''x''-''y'' plane, which is why (for this purpose) only the longitudinal plane wave phase (in the ''z''-direction, from Plane 1 to Plane 2) must be considered, and not the phase transverse to the ''z''-direction. It is of course, very tempting to think that if a plane wave emanating from the finite aperture of the transparency is tilted too far from horizontal, it will somehow "miss" the lens altogether but again, since the uniform plane wave extends infinitely far in all directions in the transverse (''x''-''y'') plane, the planar wave components cannot miss the lens.

This issue brings up perhaps the predominant difficulty with Fourier analysis, namely that the input-plane function, defined over a finite support (i.e., over its own finite aperture), is being approximated with other functions (sinusiods) which have infinite support (''i''.''e''., they are defined over the entire infinite ''x''-''y'' plane). This is unbelievably inefficient computationally, and is the principal reason why [[wavelet]]s were conceived, that is to represent a function (defiined on a finite interval or area) in terms of oscillatory functions which are also defined over finite intervals or areas. Thus, instead of getting the frequency content of the entire image all at once (along with the frequency content of the entire rest of the ''x''-''y'' plane, over which the image has zero value), the result is instead the frequency content of different parts of the image, which is usually much simpler. Unfortunately, wavelets in the ''x''-''y'' plane don't correspond to any known type of propagating wave function, in the same way that Fourier's sinusoids (in the ''x''-''y'' plane) correspond to plane wave functions in three dimensions. However, the FTs of most wavelets are well known and could possibly be shown to be equivalent to some useful type of propagating field.

On the other hand, [[Sinc function]]s and Airy functions - which are not only the point spread functions of rectangular and circular apertures, respectively, but are also cardinal functions commonly used for functional decomposition in [[Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula|interpolation/sampling theory]] [Scott 1990] - '''do''' correspond to converging or diverging spherical waves, and therefore could potentially be implemented as a whole new functional decomposition of the object plane function, thereby leading to another point of view similar in nature to Fourier optics. This would basically be the same as conventional ray optics, but with diffraction effects included. In this case, each point spread function would be a type of "smooth pixel," in much the same way that a soliton on a fiber is a "smooth pulse."  

Perhaps a lens figure-of-merit in this "point spread function" viewpoint would be to ask how well a lens transforms an Airy function in the object plane into an Airy function in the image plane, as a function of radial distance from the optic axis, or as a function of the size of the object plane Airy function. This is somewhat like the [[Point spread function]], except now we're really looking at it as a kind of input-to-output plane transfer function (like MTF), and not so much in absolute terms, relative to a perfect point. Similarly, Gaussian wavelets, which would correspond to the waist of a propagating Gaussian beam, could also potentially be used in still another functional decomposition of the object plane field.

==== Far-field range and the 2D<sup>2</sup> / ? criterion ====

In the figure above, illustrating the Fourier transforming property of lenses, the lens is in the near field of the object plane transparency, therefore the object plane field at the lens may be regarded as a superposition of plane waves, each one of which propagates at some angle with respect to the z-axis. In this regard, the far-field criterion is loosely defined as: Range = 2 ''D''<sup>2</sup> / ? where ''D'' is the maximum linear extent of the optical sources and ? is the wavelength (Scott [1998]).  The ''D'' of the transparency is on the order of cm (10<sup>?2</sup> m) and the wavelength of light is on the order of 10<sup>?6</sup> m, therefore ''D''/?  for the whole transparency is on the order of 10<sup>4</sup>. This times ''D'' is on the order of 10<sup>2</sup> m, or hundreds of meters. On the other hand the far field distance from a PSF spot is on the order of ?. This is because D for the spot is on the order of ?, so that ''D''/? is on the order of unity; this times ''D'' (i.e., ?) is on the order of ? (10<sup>?6</sup> m).  

Since the lens is in the far field of any PSF spot, the field incident on the lens from the spot may be regarded as being a spherical wave, as in eqn. (2.2), not as a plane wave spectrum, as in eqn. (2.1). On the other hand, the lens is in the near field of the entire input plane transparency, therefore eqn. (2.1) - the full plane wave spectrum - accurately represents the field incident on the lens from that larger, extended source.

==== Lens as a low-pass filter ====

A lens is basically a low-pass plane wave filter (see [[Low-pass filter]]). Consider a "small" light source located on-axis in the object plane of the lens. It is assumed that the source is small enough that, by the far-field criterion, the lens is in the far field of the "small" source. Then, the field radiated by the small source is a spherical wave which is modulated by the FT of the source distribution, as in eqn. (2.2), Then, the lens passes - from the object plane over onto the image plane - only that portion of the radiated spherical wave which lies inside the edge angle of the lens. In this far-field case, truncation of the radiated spherical wave is equivalent to truncation of the plane wave spectrum of the small source. So, the plane wave components in this far-field spherical wave, which lie beyond the edge angle of the lens, are not captured by the lens and are not transferred over to the image plane. Note: this logic is valid only for small sources, such that the lens is in the far field region of the source, according to the 2 ''D''<sup>2</sup> / ? criterion mentioned previously. If an object plane transparency is imagined as a summation over small sources (as in the [[Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula]], Scott [1990]), each of which has its spectrum truncated in this fashion, then every point of the entire object plane transparency suffers the same effects of this low pass filtering.

Loss of the high (spatial) frequency content causes blurring and loss of sharpness (see discussion related to [[Point spread function]]). Bandwidth truncation causes a (fictitious, mathematical, ideal) point source in the object plane to be blurred (or, spread out) in the image plane, giving rise to the term, "point spread function."  Whenever bandwidth is expanded or contracted, image size is typically contracted or expanded accordingly, in such a way that the space-bandwidth product remains constant, by Heisenberg's principle (Scott [1998] and [[Abbe sine condition]]).

==== Coherence and Fourier transforming ====

While working in the frequency domain, with an assumed e<sup>j?t</sup> (engineering) time dependence, coherent (laser) light is implicitly assumed, which has a delta function dependence in the frequency domain. Light at different (delta function) frequencies will "spray" the plane wave spectrum out at different angles, and as a result these plane wave components will be focused at different places in the output plane. The Fourier transforming property of lenses works best with coherent light, unless there is some special reason to combine light of different frequencies, to achieve some special purpose.

===Hardware implementation of the system transfer function: The 4F correlator {{anchor|4F Correlator}}===
{{Main|Optical correlator}}
The theory on optical transfer functions presented in section 4 is somewhat abstract.  However, there is one very well known device which implements the system transfer function H in hardware using only 2 identical lenses and a transparency plate - the 4F correlator.  Although one important application of this device would certainly be to implement the mathematical operations of [[cross-correlation]] and [[convolution]], this device - 4 focal lengths long - actually serves a wide variety of image processing operations that go well beyond what its name implies.  A diagram of a typical 4F correlator is shown in the figure below (click to enlarge).  This device may be readily understood by combining the plane wave spectrum representation of the electric field (''section 2'') with the Fourier transforming property of quadratic lenses (''section 5.1'') to yield the optical image processing operations described in section 4. 

[[File:4F Correlator.svg|4F Correlator|right|thumb|430px]]

The 4F correlator is based on the [[convolution theorem]] from [[Fourier transform]] theory, which states that [[convolution]] in the spatial (''x'',''y'') domain is equivalent to direct multiplication in the spatial frequency (''k''<sub>x</sub>, ''k''<sub>y</sub>) domain (aka: ''spectral domain''). Once again, a plane wave is assumed incident from the left and a transparency containing one 2D function, ''f''(''x'',''y''), is placed in the input plane of the correlator, located one focal length in front of the first lens. The transparency spatially modulates the incident plane wave in magnitude and phase, like on the left-hand side of eqn. (2.1), and in so doing, produces a spectrum of plane waves corresponding to the FT of the transmittance function, like on the right-hand side of eqn. (2.1). That spectrum is then formed as an "image" one focal length behind the first lens, as shown. A transmission mask containing the FT of the second function, ''g''(''x'',''y''), is placed in this same plane, one focal length behind the first lens, causing the transmission through the mask to be equal to the product, ''F''(''k''<sub>x</sub>,''k''<sub>y</sub>) x ''G''(''k''<sub>x</sub>,''k''<sub>y</sub>). This product now lies in the "input plane" of the second lens (one focal length in front), so that the FT of this product (i.e., the [[convolution]] of ''f''(''x'',''y'') and ''g''(''x'',''y'')), is formed in the back focal plane of the second lens.

If an ideal, mathematical point source of light is placed on-axis in the input plane of the first lens, then there will be a uniform, collimated field produced in the output plane of the first lens. When this uniform, collimated field is multiplied by the FT plane mask, and then Fourier transformed by the second lens, the output plane field (which in this case is the ''impulse response'' of the correlator) is just our correlating function, ''g''(''x'',''y''). In practical applications, ''g''(''x'',''y'') will be some type of feature which must be identified and located within the input plane field (see Scott [1998]). In military applications, this feature may be a tank, ship or airplane which must be quickly identified within some more complex scene.

The 4F correlator is an excellent device for illustrating the "systems" aspects of optical instruments, alluded to in ''section 4'' above. The FT plane mask function, ''G''(''k''<sub>x</sub>,''k''<sub>y</sub>) is the system transfer function of the correlator, which we'd in general denote as ''H''(''k''<sub>x</sub>,''k''<sub>y</sub>), and it is the FT of the impulse response function of the correlator, ''h''(''x'',''y'') which is just our correlating function ''g''(''x'',''y''). And, as mentioned above, the impulse response of the correlator is just a picture of the feature we're trying to find in the input image. In the 4F correlator, the system transfer function ''H''(''k''<sub>x</sub>,''k''<sub>y</sub>) is directly multiplied against the spectrum ''F''(''k''<sub>x</sub>,''k''<sub>y</sub>) of the input function, to produce the spectrum of the output function. This is how electrical signal processing systems operate on 1D temporal signals.

==Afterword: Plane wave spectrum within the broader context of functional decomposition==

Electrical fields can be represented mathematically in many different ways. In the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle|Huygens–Fresnel]] or [[Julius Adams Stratton|Stratton]]-Chu viewpoints, the electric field is represented as a superposition of point sources, each one of which gives rise to a [[Green's function]] field. The total field is then the weighted sum of all of the individual Green's function fields. That seems to be the most natural way of viewing the electric field for most people - no doubt because most of us have, at one time or another, drawn out the circles with protractor and paper, much the same way Thomas Young did in his classic paper on the [[double-slit experiment]]. However, it is by no means the only way to represent the electric field, which may also be represented as a spectrum of sinusoidally varying plane waves. In addition, [[Frits Zernike]] proposed still another [[functional decomposition]] based on his [[Zernike polynomials]], defined on the unit disc. The third-order (and lower) Zernike polynomials correspond to the normal lens aberrations. And still another functional decomposition could be made in terms of [[Sinc function]]s and Airy functions, as in the [[Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula]] and the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]]. All of these functional decompositions have utility in different circumstances. The optical scientist having access to these various representational forms has available a richer insight to the nature of these marvelous fields and their properties. These different ways of looking at the field are not conflicting or contradictory, rather, by exploring their connections, one can often gain deeper insight into the nature of wave fields.

=== Functional decomposition and eigenfunctions ===

The twin subjects of [[eigenfunction]] expansions and [[functional decomposition]], both briefly alluded to in this Wikipedia article, are not completely independent. The eigenfunction expansions to certain linear operators defined over a given domain, will often yield a countably infinite set of [[orthogonal functions]] which will span that domain. Depending on the operator and the dimensionality (and shape, and boundary conditions) of its domain, many different types of functional decompositions are, in principle, possible.

The earlier Microsoft versions which run on older versions of Windows are still available and support operating systems older than Windows XP.

=== Virtual PC by Connectix ===
[[File:Virtual PC 3 for Mac OS running Windows 95.png|thumb|[[Connectix]] Virtual PC version 3 in [[Mac OS 9]], running a [[Brazilian Portuguese]] edition of [[Windows 95]]]]

Virtual PC was originally developed as a Macintosh application and released by Connectix in June 1997. The first version of Virtual PC designed for Windows-based systems, version 4.0, was released in June 2001. Connectix sold versions of Virtual PC bundled with a variety of guest operating systems, including Windows, [[OS/2]], and [[Red Hat Linux]]. As virtualization's importance to enterprise users became clear, Microsoft took interest in the sector and acquired Virtual PC and [[Microsoft Virtual Server|Virtual Server]] (unreleased at the time) from Connectix in February 2003.

Virtual PC 4 requires Mac OS 8.5 or later on a G3 or G4 processor, but running Windows ME, Windows 2000 or Red Hat Linux requires Mac OS 9.0 or later. Virtual PC 4 was the first version with expandable drive images.

Virtual PC 5 requires Mac OS 9.1 or newer or Mac OS X 10.1 or later.  For USB support Mac OS X is recommended. To run Virtual PC 5 in Mac OS X a 400&nbsp;MHz or faster processor is required.

Earlier versions of Virtual PC supported the following features: (now removed in Microsoft Virtual PC 2004, 2007, and Windows Virtual PC):
* Older versions of Virtual PC (v5.0 or earlier) may have the hard disk formatted after creating the [[VHD (file format)|Virtual Hard Disk]] file. Newer versions must partition and format the [[VHD (file format)|Virtual Hard Disk]] file manually.
* A ''Virtual Switch'' available in Virtual PC version 4.1 or earlier allows adding multiple network adapters.
* Older operating systems are supported with Virtual Machine additions.
* Older versions of Virtual PC for Macintosh can run on Mac OS 9.2.2 or earlier. Support of Apple [[System 7]].5 are dropped in version 3.

Under agreement with Connectix, Innotek GmbH (makers of [[VirtualBox]], now part of [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]) ported version 5.0 to run on an OS/2 host.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060324234502/http://www.bityard.com/article.php?sid=100#Adds Innotek/Connectix Virtual PC]</ref> This version also included guest extensions (VM additions) for OS/2 guests, which could run on Windows, OS/2 or Mac OS X hosts using Virtual PC versions 5, 6 or 7. A new version of the guest extensions was later included with Microsoft's Virtual PC 2004.

On July 12, 2006, Microsoft released Virtual PC 2004 SP1 for Windows free of charge, but the Mac version was not made free. The equivalent version for Mac, version 7, was the final version of Virtual PC for Mac. It ran on [[Mac OS X]] 10.2.8 or later for [[PowerPC]] and was a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[commercial software]] product.<ref name="vpc-mac-main">{{cite web

Virtual PC 2007 was released only for the Windows platform, with public [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] testing beginning October 11, 2006, and production release on February 19, 2007. It added support for [[x86 virtualization|hardware virtualization]], viewing virtual machines on multiple monitors and support for Windows Vista as both host and guest. (The [[Windows Aero]] interface is disabled on Windows Vista guests due to limitations of the emulated video hardware; however, Aero effects can be rendered by connecting to the guest via [[Remote Desktop Services]] from an Aero-enabled Windows Vista host, provided that the guest is running Windows Vista Business or a higher edition.)<ref name=aero_savill/>

On May 15, 2008, Microsoft released Virtual PC 2007 Service Pack 1, which added support for both Windows XP SP3 and Windows Vista SP1 as guest and host OSes, as well as [[Windows Server 2008]] Standard as a guest OS.<ref>{{cite web|last=Protalinski |first=Emil |url=http://arstechnica.com/journals/microsoft.ars/2008/05/15/microsoft-drops-some-details-on-upcoming-virtual-pc-2007-sp1 |title=Microsoft releases Virtual PC 2007 SP1 |work=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]] |date=15 May 2008 |accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Virtual PC 2007 SP1 Release Notes | publisher = Microsoft | date = May 15, 2008 | url = http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9f3d3eb5-5e03-4712-999c-e96f91bdf128&displaylang=en | accessdate =June 28, 2009}}</ref> A [[hotfix]] rollup for Virtual PC 2007 SP1, released February 20, 2009, solved networking issues and enhanced the maximum screen resolution to 2048×1920 (32-bit),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/958162 |title=Description of the hotfix rollup package for Virtual PC 2007 Service Pack 1: February 20, 2009 (revision 2.0) |work=Support |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=8 October 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref> enabling 16:9 resolutions such as 1920×1080.

* [[Intel]] [[Pentium II]] ([[32-bit]]) processor (but virtualizes the host processor on Windows versions) with an [[Intel]] [[Intel 440BX|440BX]] chipset.
* Standard [[SVGA]] [[VESA]] [[graphics card]] ([[S3 Trio]] 32 [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] with 4 [[megabyte|MB]] [[video RAM]], adjustable in later versions up to 16&nbsp;MB by manually editing a virtual machine's settings file).
* System [[BIOS]] from [[American Megatrends]] (AMI).
* [[Creative Labs]] [[Sound Blaster]] 16 [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] [[Plug and Play|PnP]]. (When Windows Vista is installed as both the host (main) and guest (virtual) operating systems, settings are synchronized with the host and audio configuration is not required.)
* [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] 21041 (DEC 21140 in newer versions) [[Ethernet]] [[computer network|network]] card.
* Programs using undocumented features of hardware, exotic timings, or unsupported [[opcodes]] may not work.

Implementation:
* The [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] version of Virtual PC uses [[dynamic recompilation]] to translate the [[x86]] code used by PCs into equivalent [[PowerPC]] code for Macs.
* The Windows version of Virtual PC also uses dynamic recompilation, but only to translate x86 [[kernel mode]] and [[real mode]] code into x86 [[user mode]] code; original user mode and [[virtual 8086 mode]] code run natively.
* Guest call traps are used, especially for guest extensions, to accelerate emulation or offer additional features, such as integration with the host environment.
* Virtual PC and [[Microsoft Virtual Server|Virtual Server]] encapsulate virtual hard disks in the [[VHD (file format)|Virtual Hard Disk]] (VHD) file format, for which Microsoft has made all documentation available under the [[Microsoft Open Specification Promise|Open Specification Promise]].

Earlier versions of Virtual PC supported the following features: (now removed in Microsoft Virtual PC 2004, 2007, and Windows Virtual PC):
* Older versions of Virtual PC (v5.0 or earlier) may have the hard disk formatted after creating the [[VHD (file format)|Virtual Hard Disk]] file. Newer versions must partition and format the [[VHD (file format)|Virtual Hard Disk]] file manually.
* A ''Virtual Switch'' available in Virtual PC version 4.1 or earlier allows adding multiple network adapters.
* Older operating systems are supported with Virtual Machine additions.
* Older versions of Virtual PC for Macintosh can run on Mac OS 9.2.2 or earlier. Support of Apple [[System 7]].5 was dropped in version 3.

== Virtual machine integration components ==
Windows Virtual PC may enable guest operating systems running inside virtual machines to interact with their host operating system beyond what is feasible between two physical computers, such as sharing physical hardware components or exchanging data. To do so however, ''integration components'' must be installed on the guest operating systems. When no integration component is installed, the only mean of communicating between two machines (either virtual or physical) is through a virtual network interface. Even the mouse cursor can only be controlled by one operating system (either real or virtual) at any given time. However, once the Integration Components are installed on the guest operating systems, the following features are automatically activated:<ref name = "UMVS2">{{Cite book

}}</ref>
* Mouse cursor sharing: Mouse cursor can be moved freely between the machines.
* Host-initiated shutdown: Virtual machine can be shut down, restarted or put into standby or hibernation via a set of [[API]] functions.
* Time synchronization: The virtual machine's clock will be automatically synchronized with the host operating system's clock.
* Process responsiveness monitoring: Host operating system will be able to detect whether the software on the guest operating system is responsive or hung.
* Dynamic screen resolution: The screen resolution of the guest operating system can be changed by simply resizing the window in which it is running. However, the VM can be configured to allow only standard resolutions.

In addition to features described above, guest operating systems may also take advantage of the following integration features but only when the administrator activates them:<ref name = "UMVS2" />
* Audio sharing: Audio played on the guest operating system may be brought to the host operating system and played on it.
* Clipboard sharing: Contents such as text, picture or everything that is cut or copied to [[Clipboard (software)|Windows Clipboard]] maybe pasted in other machines.
* Printer sharing: Guest operating systems may print on the host operating system's printer. This feature should not be confused with File and Printer Sharing over an emulated network connection.
* Smart card sharing: [[Smart card]]s connected to host operating system may be accessed on guest operating systems.
* File sharing: Windows Virtual PC can also share [[disk partition]]s and [[disk drive]]s of the host operating system with guest operating systems.<ref name="DnD-unsupported" /><ref name="Volume-sharing" /> This includes USB mass storage devices that are connected later.<ref>{{cite web

== Supported host and guest operating systems {{Anchor|Host operating systems}} {{Anchor|Guest operating systems}} ==
Virtual PC allows multiple guest operating systems to run virtualized on a single physical host. Although a number of popular host and guest operating systems lack official Microsoft support, there are sometimes few, if any, technical obstacles impeding installation. Instead, a configuration may be unsupported due to Microsoft's own [[EULA|licensing]] restrictions,<ref name=bergstein/><ref name=vista_eula_orig/> or a decision to focus testing and support resources elsewhere, especially when production use of a [[Legacy software#Legacy support|legacy]] product fades.<ref name=vguy_win95/><ref name=vguy_dosadd/>

A program manager on Microsoft's core virtualization team explains what official support entails:
{{quote|With each release of Virtual PC we spend a significant amount of time trying to decide which (guest) operating system should be officially supported.  While Virtual PC is capable of running many operating systems, official support for an operating system means that we will test it thoroughly, not ship Virtual PC if an issue exists with that operating system, and provide full support for customers who encounter problems while running these operating systems under Virtual PC.<ref name=vguy_win95>{{cite web | last = Armstrong | first = Ben | title = Why won't the Virtual PC 2007 Virtual Machine Additions load on Windows 95? | work = Virtual PC Guy's Weblog | publisher = [[MSDN Blogs]] | date = January 3, 2007 | url = http://blogs.msdn.com/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2007/01/03/why-won-t-the-virtual-pc-2007-virtual-machine-additions-load-on-windows-95.aspx | accessdate =July 10, 2009}}</ref>|Ben Armstrong, "Virtual PC Guy"}}

=== Linux guests {{Anchor|Emulating Linux-based environments}} ===
Installing a Linux-based guest environment in Virtual PC is possible.  RedHat and SuSe Linux guests are supported. Linux additions are supported in [[Microsoft Virtual Server]], and these additions should also work in Virtual PC.<ref name=vguy_linux07>{{cite web | last = Armstrong | first = Ben | title = Updated Virtual Machine Additions for Linux available | work = Virtual PC Guy's WebLog | publisher = [[MSDN Blogs]]| date = October 23, 2007 | url = http://blogs.msdn.com/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2007/10/23/updated-virtual-machine-additions-for-linux-available.aspx | accessdate =June 28, 2009 | quote = As always – this is only supported on Virtual Server – but should work just fine on Virtual PC.}}</ref>

Some [[Linux distribution]]s must be installed in text mode, as they do not support Microsoft Virtual PC's emulated graphics chip.  [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 8.10 ([[Intrepid Ibex]]) must be installed in SafeMode, but does not require other changes.

Some websites specialize in listing operating systems that run successfully as Virtual PC guests, to help users avoid issues when installing Linux distributions or other operating systems lacking official Microsoft support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vpc.visualwin.com/ |title=What Works and What Doesn't in Microsoft Virtual PC 2004 |work=visualwin.com |publisher=[[WP:SPS|Self published]] |first=Jonathan |last=Maltz |accessdate=16 June 2013}}{{Verify credibility|date=June 2013}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=June 2013}}

=== Intel-based Mac support ===
[[Microsoft]] announced on August 7, 2006, that Virtual PC for Mac would not be ported to the [[Apple–Intel architecture|Intel Mac]] platform. Microsoft stated, "Alternative solutions offered by Apple and other vendors, combined with a fully packaged retail copy of Windows, will satisfy this need."<ref name=wwdc>{{cite web |url=http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/08/07/vpc/index.php |title=WWDC: Microsoft kills Virtual PC for Mac |publisher=MacWorld |date=August 7, 2006 |accessdate=October 8, 2007 |last=Cohen |first=Peter}}</ref> Similar products available or announced at the time were [[Parallels Desktop]] and [[VMware Fusion]].

==Career==
Toyoda studied [[mechanical engineering]] at [[Tokyo Imperial University]] from 1933 to 1936.<ref name="Kodansha">{{cite book | title= (1987). "Toyota - Fifty Years in Motion| last=Toyoda| first=Eiji| year=1987| publisher=Kodansha International| location=Tokyo| isbn=0-87011-823-4}}</ref> During this time his cousin [[Kiichiro Toyoda|Kiichiro]] established an automobile plant at the [[Toyoda Loom Works|Toyoda Automatic Loom Works]] in the city of Nagoya in central Japan.<ref name=Kodansha/> Toyoda joined his cousin in the plant at the conclusion of his degree and throughout their lives they shared a deep friendship. In 1938, Kiichiro asked Eiji to oversee construction of a newer factory about 32&nbsp;km east of Nagoya on the site of a red pine forest in the town of Koromo, later renamed [[Toyota City]].<ref name="Lexus">{{cite book | title=Lexus: The Relentless Pursuit| last=Dawson| first=Chester| year=2004| publisher=John Wiley & Sons (Asia) Pte Ltd.| location=Singapore| isbn=0-470-82110-8}}</ref> Known as the Honsha ("headquarters") plant, to this day it is considered the "mother factory" for Toyota Motor production facilities worldwide.<ref name=Lexus/>

Toyoda visited [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]'s [[River Rouge Plant]] at [[Dearborn, Michigan]] during the early 1950s. He was awed by the scale of the facility but dismissive of what he saw as its inefficiencies.<ref name="Businessweek-2004-05-24">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_21/b3884031_mz072.htm |title=Kiichiro And Eiji Toyoda: Blazing The Toyota Way|accessdate=2010-01-31|date=2004-05-24|first=Chester|last=Dawson|work=Business Week}}</ref> Toyota Motor had been in the business of manufacturing cars for 13 years at this stage, and had produced just over 2,500 automobiles. The Ford plant in contrast manufactured 8,000 vehicles a day.<ref name=Kodansha/> Due to this experience, Toyoda decided to adopt US automobile mass production methods but with a qualitative twist.

Toyoda collaborated with [[Taiichi Ohno]], a veteran loom machinist, to develop core concepts of what later became known as the 'Toyota Way', such as the ''Kanban'' system of labeling parts used on assembly lines, which was an early precursor to bar codes.<ref name=Businessweek-2004-05-24/> They also fine-tuned the concept of [[Kaizen]], a process of incremental but constant improvements designed to cut production and labor costs while boosting overall quality.<ref name=Businessweek-2004-05-24/>

As a managing director of Toyota Motor, Toyoda failed in his first attempt to crack the U.S. market with the underpowered [[Toyota Crown]] sedan in the 1950s, but he succeeded with the [[Toyota Corolla]] compact in 1968, a year after taking over as president of the company.<ref name=Businessweek-2004-05-24/> During the car's development phase, Toyoda, as executive vice-president, had to overcome the objections of then-president Fukio Nakagawa to install a newly developed 1.0-liter engine, air conditioning and automatic transmissions in the Corolla.<ref name=Lexus/>

Appointed the fifth president of Toyota Motor, Toyoda went on to become the company's longest serving chief executive thus far.<ref name=Lexus/> In 1981, he stepped down as president and assumed the title of chairman. He was succeeded as president by [[Shoichiro Toyoda]].<ref name=Lexus/> In 1983, as chairman, Eiji decided to compete in the luxury car market, which culminated in the 1989 introduction of [[Lexus]].<ref name=Lexus/> Toyoda stepped down as chairman of Toyota in 1994 at the age of 81.<ref name=Businessweek-2004-05-24/>

==Later years and death==
In his later years, Toyoda was hospitalised for hip problems, and was wheelchair-bound for a time, yet remained affable and smiling in interviews. Retaining a clear mind into his 90s, he enjoyed tackling sudoku puzzles. He spent most of his last years undergoing treatment at the Toyota Memorial Hospital in [[Toyota City]], Japan, close to company headquarters.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.asahi.com/area/aichi/articles/MTW1309172400009.html |title=?????????????????? |trans_title=Death of people's auto pioneer Mr. Toyoda Eiji |language=Japanese |work=Asahi Shimbun |first=Tomomi |last=Miyazaki |date=2013-09-17 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}</ref><ref name="Kubota">{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/17/toyota-eijitoyoda-idUSL4E8JN1OL20130917 |title=Eiji Toyoda, who helped steer Toyota's rise, dies at 100 |publisher=Reuters |first=Yoko |last=Kubota |date=2013-09-17 |accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref>

== History ==
In 1998, VMware was founded by [[Diane Greene]], [[Mendel Rosenblum]], Scott Devine, Edward Wang and [[Edouard Bugnion]]. Greene and Rosenblum, who are married, first met while at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>{{ cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/10/15/100536853/index.htm|author=Adam Lashinksky|date=2007-10-02|title=50 Most Powerful Women in Business&nbsp;— Full speed ahead|publisher=CNN | quote = In 1988 she picked up a second master's, in computer science, at the University of California at Berkeley, where she met Rosenblum }}</ref> Edouard Bugnion remained the chief architect and CTO of VMware until 2005,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/01/23/04FEctoedouard_1.html?s=feature|title=Edouard Bugnion lives in the virtual world}}</ref> and went on to found Nuova Systems (now part of [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]]). For the first year, VMware operated in [[stealth mode]], with roughly 20 employees by the end of 1998. The company was launched officially early in the second year, in February 1999, at the [[DEMO Conference]] organized by [[Chris Shipley]].<ref>{{cite web

In 2003, VMware launched VMware Virtual Center, the VMotion, and Virtual SMP technology. 64-bit support appeared in 2004. The same year, the company was acquired by EMC Corporation for US$625 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vmware.com/company/news/releases/emc2.html |title=EMC Completes Acquisition of VMware |publisher=Vmware.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-27}}</ref>

In August 2007, EMC released 15% of the company's shares in VMware in an [[initial public offering]] on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. The stock debuted at [[United States dollar|US$]]29 per share and closed the day at $51.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mullins |first=Robert |date=2007-08-14 |url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/08/14/VMware-the-bright-spot-on-a-gray-Wall-Street-day_1.html |title=Update: VMware the bright spot on a gray Wall Street day |publisher=IDG News Service |accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref>

On July 8, 2008, VMware co-founder, president and CEO [[Diane Greene]], was unexpectedly fired by the VMware Board of Directors and replaced by [[Paul Maritz]], a retired 14-year Microsoft veteran who was heading EMC's [[cloud computing]] business unit.<ref>{{cite web |author=Savitz, Eric |url= http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2008/07/08/vmware-ousts-ceo-diane-greene-cuts-08-guidance/ |title=VMware ousts CEO Diane Greene; cuts '08 guidance |work=Barron's |date=2008-07-08|accessdate=2009-07-01}}</ref>  In the same news release VMware stated that 2008 revenue growth will be "modestly below the previous guidance of 50% growth over 2007". As a result, market price of VMware dropped nearly 25%. Then, on September 10, 2008, Rosenblum, the company's chief scientist, resigned.

On September 16, 2008, VMware announced its collaboration with [[Cisco]] to provide joint data center solutions.  One of the first results of this is the Cisco [[Nexus 1000V]], a distributed virtual software switch that will be an integrated option in the VMware infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/technology/cisco_vmware_virtualizing_the_datacenter.pdf |title=Virtual Networking Features of the VMware vNetwork Distributed Switch and Cisco Nexus 1000V Series Switches}}</ref>

On  April 12, 2011, VMware released an [[open source]] platform-as-a-service system called [[Cloud Foundry]], as well as a hosted version of the service. This supported application deployment for [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Ruby on Rails]], [[Sinatra (software)|Sinatra]], [[Node.js]], and [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], as well as database support for [[MySQL]], [[MongoDB]], [[Redis]], [[Postgres]], [[RabbitMQ]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://cloudfoundry.com/faq |title=Cloud Foundry Frequently Asked Questions}}</ref>

In March 2013, VMware gave details of a spin-off of [[GoPivotal|Pivotal]]. All of VMware's application- and developer-oriented products, including Spring, tc Server, [[Cloud Foundry]], [[RabbitMQ]], GemFire, and SQLFire were transferred to this organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2013/03/11/emc-vmw-analyst-day-street-awaits-pivotal-financial-update/}}</ref> It also announced that it was introducing its own [[IaaS]] service, [[vCloud]] Hybrid Service, in a shift of its strategy of selling software to cloud service providers.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In May 2013, VMware launched vCloud Hybrid Service at its new Palo Alto headquarters (vCloud Hybrid Service now known as vCloud Air),<ref>http://cloudhelix.net/establishing-vmware-hybrid-cloud/</ref> announcing an early access program in a Las Vegas data center. The service is designed to function as an extension of its customer's existing vSphere installations, with full compatibility with existing virtual machines virtualized with VMware software and tightly integrated networking. The service is based on vCloud Director 5.1/vSphere 5.1.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In September 2013 at [[VMworld]] San Francisco, VMware announced general availability of vCloud Hybrid Service and expansion to [[Sterling, Virginia]], [[Santa Clara, California]], [[Dallas, Texas]], and a service beta in the UK. It also pre-announced a disaster recovery and desktop-as-a-service offering based on Desktone, which it went on to acquire in October 2013.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Core product design ==
VMware developed a range of products, most notable of which are their [[hypervisor]]s.  VMware became well known for their first type 2 hypervisor known as GSX.  This product has since evolved into two hypervisor products lines, VMware's type 1 hypervisors running directly on hardware, along with their hosted type 2 hypervisors.

VMware software provides a completely [[Platform virtualization|virtualized]] set of hardware to the guest operating system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,1624080,00.asp |title=How does VMWare Work? |publisher=Extremetech.com |date=2009-06-22 |accessdate=2009-07-01}}</ref> VMware software virtualizes the hardware for a video adapter, a network adapter, and hard disk adapters. The host provides pass-through drivers for guest USB, serial, and parallel devices. In this way, VMware virtual machines become highly portable between computers, because every host looks nearly identical to the guest. In practice, a system administrator can pause operations on a virtual machine guest, move or copy that guest to another physical computer, and there resume execution exactly at the point of suspension. Alternatively, for enterprise servers, a feature called vMotion allows the migration of operational guest virtual machines between similar but separate hardware hosts sharing the same storage (or, with [[vMotion Storage]], separate storage can be used, too). Each of these transitions is completely transparent to any users on the virtual machine at the time it is being migrated.

VMware Workstation, Server, and ESX take a more optimized path to running target operating systems on the host than [[emulator]]s (such as [[Bochs]]) which simulate the function of each CPU instruction on the target machine one-by-one, or [[dynamic recompilation]] which compiles blocks of machine-instructions the first time they execute, and then uses the translated code  directly when the code runs subsequently ([[Microsoft Virtual PC]] for [[Mac OS X]] takes this approach.) VMware software does not emulate an [[instruction set]] for different hardware not physically present. This significantly boosts performance, but can cause problems when moving virtual machine guests between hardware hosts using different instruction-sets (such as found in 64-bit [[Intel]] and [[AMD]] CPUs), or between hardware hosts with a differing number of CPUs. Software that is CPU agnostic can usually survive such a transition, unless it is agnostic by forking at startup, in which case, the software or the guest OS must be stopped before moving it, then restarted after the move.

VMware's products predate the [[x86 virtualization#Hardware assist|virtualization extensions]] to the x86 instruction set, and do not require virtualization-enabled processors.  On newer processors, the hypervisor is now designed to take advantage of the extensions. However, unlike many other hypervisors, VMware still supports older processors. In such cases, it uses the CPU to run code directly whenever possible (as, for example, when running [[user space|user-mode]] and [[virtual 8086 mode]] code on x86). When direct execution cannot operate, such as with kernel-level and [[real mode|real-mode]] code, VMware products use [[Binary translation]] (BT) to re-write the code dynamically. The translated code gets stored in spare memory, typically at the end of the [[address space]], which [[Segmentation (memory)|segmentation]] mechanisms can protect and make invisible. For these reasons, VMware operates dramatically faster than emulators, running at more than 80% of the speed that the virtual guest operating-system would run directly on the same hardware. In one study VMware claims a slowdown over native ranging from 0–6 percent for the VMware ESX Server.<ref>{{cite web| title=A Performance Comparison of Hypervisors| url=http://www.vmware.com/pdf/hypervisor_performance.pdf}}</ref>

VMware's approach avoids some of the difficulties of virtualization on x86-based platforms. Virtual machines may deal with offending instructions by replacing them, or by simply running kernel-code in user-mode. Replacing instructions runs the risk that the code may fail to find the expected content if it reads itself; one cannot protect code against reading while allowing normal execution, and replacing in-place becomes complicated. Running the code unmodified in user-mode will also fail, as most instructions which just read the machine-state do not cause an exception and will betray the real state of the program, and certain instructions silently change behavior in user-mode. One must always rewrite; performing a simulation of the current [[program counter]] in the original location when necessary and (notably) remapping hardware code [[breakpoint]]s.

Although VMware virtual machines run in user-mode, VMware Workstation itself requires the installation of various [[device driver|driver]]s in the host operating-system, notably to dynamically switch the [[Global Descriptor Table|Global Descriptor Table (GDT)]] and the [[Interrupt Descriptor Table|Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)]].

The VMware product line can also run different operating systems on a dual-boot system simultaneously by booting one partition natively while using the other as a guest within VMware Workstation.

In the [[United Kingdom]], '''Packet Switch Stream''' ('''PSS''') was an [[X.25]]-based [[packet-switched network]], provided by the British [[Post Office Telecommunications]] and then [[British Telecommunications]] starting in 1980. After a period of pre-operational testing with customers (mainly UK universities and computer manufacturers at this early phase) the service was launched as a commercial service on 20 August 1981. The experimental predecessor network (EPSS) formally closed down on 31 July 1981 after all the existing connections had been moved to PSS.

Companies and individual users could connect into the PSS network using the full X.25 interface, via a dedicated four-wire telephone circuit using a PSS analog [[modem]] and later on, when problems of 10-100ms transmission failures with the PCM Voice based transmission equipment used by the early [[BT Kilostream|Kilostream]] service were resolved, via a Kilostream digital access circuit (actually a baseband modem). In this early 1980s era installation lead times for suitable 4-wire analog lines could be more than 6 months in the UK.

Companies and individual users could also connect into the PSS network using a basic non-error correcting RS232/V.24 asynchronous character based interface via an X.3/X.28/X.29 PAD ([[Packet Assembler/Disassembler]]) service oriented to the then prevalent [[dumb terminal]] market place. The PAD service could be connected to via a dedicated [[four-wire telephone circuit]] using a PSS analog [[modem]] and later on via a [[BT Kilostream|Kilostream]] digital access circuit. However most customers, for cost reasons, chose to dial up via an [[analog modem]] over the then UK analog telephony network to their nearest public PAD, via published phone numbers, using an ID/password provided as a subscription service.

The current day analogy of ISP's offering broadband always on and dial up services to the internet applies here.

Some customers connected to the PSS network via the X.25 service and bought their own PADs. PSS was one of the first telecommunications networks in the UK to be fully liberalized in that customers could connect their own equipment to the network. This was before privatization and the creation of British Telecommunications plc (BT) in 1984.

PSS could be used to connect to a variety of online databases and mainframe systems. Of particular note was the use of PSS for the first networked [[Clearing House Automated Payment System]] (CHAPS). This was a network system used to transfer all payments over £10,000 UKP (in early 1980s monetary value) between the major UK banks and other major financial institutions based in the UK. It replaced a paper based system that operated in the City of London using electrical vehicles similar to [[milk float]]s. [[Logica]] (now LogicaCMG) designed the CHAPS system and incorporated an encryption system able to cope with HDLC bit stuffing on X.25 links.

There was a choice of different speeds of PSS lines; the faster the line the more expensive it cost to rent it. The highest and lowest speed lines were provided by the ''[[BT Megastream|Megastream]]'' and ''[[BT Kilostream|Kilostream]]'' services, 2M ([[Mega-|Mega]]) bit/s and 256K ([[Kilo-|kilo]]) bit/s respectively. On analog links 2400 bit/s, 4800 bit/s, 9600 bit/s and 48 kbit/s were offered. Individual users could link into PSS, on a pay as you go basis, by using a 110, 300, 1200/75, 1,200 or 2,400 bit/s [[public switched telephone network|PSTN]] modem to connect a Data Terminal Equipment terminal into a local PSS exchange. Note: in those days 2,400 bit/s modems were quite rare; 1,200 bit/s was the usual speed in the 1980s, although 110 and 300 bit/s modems were not uncommon.

The [[International Packet Switch Stream]] (IPSS) is an international X.25 network service launched by the international division of BT to which PSS was linked to other packet switched networks around the world. This started in about 1978 before PSS went into operation due to the high demand for affordable access to US based database and other network services. A PAD service was provided by IPSS to this market in advance of PSS launch.

For a brief time the EEC operated a packet switched network, [[EuroNet (telecommunications network)|Euronet]], and a related project [[Diane (project)|Diane]] to encourage more database and network services to develop in Europe. These connections moved over to PSS and other European networks as commercial X.25 services launched. 

Later on the InterStream gateway between the [[Telex]] network and PSS was introduced based on a low speed PAD interface.

The network was initially based upon a dedicated modular packet switch using DCC's TP 4000 communication processor hardware. The operating system and the packet switching software was developed by Telenet (later on [[GTE Telenet]]). At the time of PSS's launch this was in advance of both Telenet's own network and most others that used general purpose mini-computers as packet switches.

BT bought Telenet's system via [[Plessey Controls]] of Poole, Dorset who also sold Telex and Traffic light systems.

Later on BT used Telematics packet switches for the Vascom network to support the Prestel service and also bought the [[Tymnet]] network from McDonneld Douglas.

In the words of BT's own history:

<blockquote>
British Telecom purchased the Tymnet network systems business and its associated applications activities from the McDonnell Douglas Corporation on 19 November (1989) for $355 million. Its activities included TYMNET, the public network business, plus its associates private and hybrid (mixed public and private) network activities, the OnTyme electronic mail service, the Card Service processing business, and EDI*Net, the US market leader in electronic data interchange. 

BT Tymnet anticipated developing an end to end managed network service for multi-national customers, and developing dedicated or hybrid networks that embraced major trading areas. Customers would be able to enjoy one-stop-shopping for global data networks, and a portfolio of products designed for a global market place. 

These services were subsequently offered by BT Global Network Services, and subsequently by Concert as part of Concert Global Network Services after the Concert joint venture company was launched on 15 June 1994.
</blockquote>

It is believed BT subsequently exchanged major US elements of the Tymnet business with [[MCI Communications|MCI]] for other assets when the proposed merger of their two businesses was thwarted by MCI's purchase by WorldCom.

The last PSS node in the UK was finally switched off Wednesday, June 28, 2006.

Network management had been run on a system of 24 [[Prime Computer|Prime]] 63xx and 48xx computers running a modified versions of Revisions 20 and 22 of the [[Primos]] operating system. These network management systems were based in [[London]] and [[Manchester]]. Packet switches were installed at major trunk exchanges in most major conurbations in the UK.

The DNICs used by IPSS and PSS were 2341 and 2342 respectively.

BT's attitude to packet switching was ambivalent at best. Compared to France's [[Transpac (network)|Transpac]] that had a separate commercial company with dedicated management and saw X.25 packet switching as a core offering BT's then senior management regarded packet switching as a passing phase until the telecommunications nirvana of ISDN's 64 kbit/s for everyone arrived.

Even in its recent history BT's senior management stated that the Internet was "not fit for purpose".

PSS suffered from inconsistent investment during its early years. Sometimes not enough and sometimes too much but mostly for the wrong reasons.

Investments in [[value added network services]] (VANS) and BT's own access level packet switching hardware delayed operating profit. This in turn dented PSS's low credibility with BT's management still further. Despite healthy demand for basic X.25 services and the obvious trend for more demanding bandwidth intensive applications that required investment in more powerful switches a decision to develop BT's own hardware and network applications was made instead.

In the midst of this IBM (the then market leader in computing) and BT attempted to launch a joint venture, called Jove, for managed SNA services in the UK. And for a time significant extra expenditure was allowed for BT's data services, PSS being the major part, as one concern of regulators was this joint venture might damage work on Open Systems Interconnection. This only made cost control worse and achieving operating profit delayed further. Eventually the UK government decided the SNA joint venture was anti-competitive and vetoed it. But not before PSS management was allowed to commit to large investments that caused serious problems later.

One of the few successful value added applications was the transaction phone used to check credit cards by retailer to validate transactions and prevent fraud. It was believed that putting a packet switch in every local telephone exchange would allow this and other low bandwidth applications to drive revenue. The lesson of Tymnet's similar transaction phone that just used a dial up link to a standard PAD based service was not followed. Each low end packet switch installed added costs for floor space, power, etc. without any significant value added revenue benefit resulting. Nor were they adequate for X.25 host traffic.

Ideas like providing a more user friendly menu based interface, called Epad, than X.28 was proven obsolete by the advent windows based clients on PCs.

As the added value services, named PSS Plus collectively, added significant costs and headcount while contributed virtually no revenue a change in PSS's management eventually resulted. While a decision was eventually made to put some of the basic network services people in senior positions and try to launch what had been developed this proved to be a major mistake. An exodus of people who were developing the value added network services helped reduce some costs. However significant on-going expenditure had been committed already to manufacture packet switch hardware and by using the very expensive Tandem computers in existing VANS. Operating profit was still not achieved and a further change in management with McKinsey consulting being called in.

McKinsey's recommendation that increasing revenue while cutting costs was required to turn around the business was duly followed by the new management and an operating profit achieved in about 1988. This rested on running PSS efficiently and cutting the VANS as much as possible. PSS was then merged with other failing business like Prestel as it became part of a larger Managed Network Services division that was used to fix or close BT's problem businesses.

While PSS eventually went the way of all X.25 networks and was overwhelmed by the internet and more significantly the internet's superior application suite and cost model. BT did not capitalise as much as other packet switch operators by subsequent mistakes concerning the internet, Tymnet, BT's North American operations and the Concert Global Services with ATT.

BT's failure to become the major ISP in its own home market unlike every other former PTT and the success of Dixon's Freeserve, Demon and Energis based virtual ISPs in the same sector has only been recovered from recently. Only after BT changed its most senior management who were fixated on circuit switching/ISDN based on System X/Y telephone exchanges and embracing broadband/internet lock stock and barrel has this changed. An emergency rights issue also helped resolve the debt from acquiring second or third ranked old telcos style companies around the world. 

Now BT appears to be inheriting a dominating position in the Global Network Services market, based on packet switching, as CSC and Reuters sell up their networks to BT. As the commodity price of IP services based in their core 21st century MPLS network to carry voice and data finally gives them the real cost efficiencies that packet switching always promised.

[[File:A print from 1845 shows cowry shells being used as money by an Arab trader.jpg|thumb|A print from 1845 shows cowry shells being used as money by an Arab trader.]]

'''Cowry''' or '''cowrie''', plural '''cowries''', is the [[common name]] for a group of small to large [[sea snail]]s, [[ocean|marine]] [[Gastropoda|gastropod]] [[Mollusca|mollusc]]s in the family [[Cypraeidae]], the cowries. The word ''cowry'' is also often used to refer only to the [[Gastropod shell|shell]]s of these snails, which overall are often shaped more or less like an [[Egg (food)|egg]], except that they are rather flat on the underside.

Many people throughout history have found (and still find) the very rounded, shiny, [[porcelain]]-like shells of cowries pleasing to look at and to handle. Indeed the term "porcelain" derives from the old [[Italian language|Italian]] term for the cowrie shell (''porcellana'') due to their similar translucent appearance.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'': "The ceramic material was apparently so named on account of the resemblance of its translucent surface to the [[nacre]]ous shell of the mollusc. [...] The cowrie was probably originally so named on account of the resemblance of the fissure of its shell to a [[vulva]] (it is unclear whether the reference is spec. to the vulva of a sow)."</ref> Shells of certain species have historically been used as [[currency]] in several parts of the world, as well as being used, in the past and present, very extensively in [[jewellery]], and for other decorative and ceremonial purposes.

Some species in the family [[Ovulidae]] are also often referred to as cowries. In the [[British Isles]] the local ''[[Trivia (gastropod)|Trivia]]'' species (family Triviidae, species ''[[Trivia monacha]]'' and ''[[Trivia arctica]]'') are sometimes called cowries. The Ovulidae and the Triviidae are somewhat closely related to  Cypraeidae.

== Shell description ==
[[File:Different cowries.jpg|thumb|Shells of various species of cowries; all but one have their anterior ends pointing towards the top of the page in this image]]

The shells of cowries are usually smooth and shiny and more or less egg-shaped, with a flat under surface which shows a long, narrow, slit-like opening ([[aperture]]), which is often toothed at the edges. The narrower end of the egg-shaped cowry shell is the anterior end. The [[Spire (mollusc)|spire]] of the shell is not visible in the adult shell of most species, but is visible in juveniles, which have a different shape from the adults.

Nearly all cowries have a porcelain-like shine, with some exceptions such as [[Hawaii]]'s granulated cowry, ''[[Nucleolaria granulata]]''. Many have colorful patterns. Lengths range from [[1 millimetre|5 mm]] for some species up to [[1 decimetre|19 cm]] for the Atlantic deer cowry, ''[[Macrocypraea cervus]]''.

== Etymology==

Cowrie 
from Nepali ????? Hindi ????? kauri and Urdu ???? kauri, from Marathi ???? kavadi, which is ultimately from Sanskrit ????? kaparda.

[[File:Cypraea mappa.jpg|thumb|A live map cowry ''[[Cypraea mappa]]'' in [[East Timor]]]]
The shells of cowries (especially ''[[Monetaria moneta]]'') were used for centuries as a currency in Africa. Huge amounts of [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] cowries were introduced into Africa by western nations during the period of [[slave trade]].<ref>Hogendorn, Jan and Johnson Marion: ''The Shell Money of the Slave Trade''. African Studies Series 49, [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Cambridge]], 1986.</ref> The [[Ghana]]ian unit of currency known as the [[Ghanaian cedi]] was named after cowry shells. Starting over three thousand years ago, cowry shells, or copies of the shells, were used as [[Ancient Chinese coinage|Chinese currency]].<ref>[http://www.cowry.org/archive/NSN306CY.HTM#C "Money Cowries"] by [[Ardis Doolin]] in ''[[Hawaiian Shell News]]'', NSN #306, June 1985.</ref> They were also used as means of exchange in [[India]].

The [[Classical Chinese]] [[Wikt:?|character for ''money'' (?)]] originated as a stylized drawing of a Maldivian cowrie shell.<ref>[http://zhongwen.com/cgi-bin/zipux2.cgi?b5=%A8%A9 ? at zhongwen.com]</ref> Words and characters concerning money, property or wealth usually have this as a [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]]. Before the [[Spring and Autumn]] period the cowrie was used as a type of trade token awarding access to a feudal lord's resources to a worthy vassal. {{cn|date=August 2014}}

The [[Ojibway]] aboriginal people in [[North America]] use cowry shells which are called sacred [[Miigis Shell]]s or [[whiteshell]]s in [[Midewiwin]] ceremonies, and the [[Whiteshell Provincial Park]] in [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]] is named after this type of shell. There is some debate about how the Ojibway traded for or found these shells, so far inland and so far north, very distant from the natural habitat. Oral stories and [[birch bark scrolls]] seem to indicate that the shells were found in the ground, or washed up on the shores of lakes or rivers. Finding the cowry shells so far inland could indicate the previous use of them by an earlier tribe or group in the area, who may have obtained them through an extensive trade network in the ancient past. [[Petroforms]] in the [[Whiteshell Provincial Park]] may be as old as 8,000 years. {{cn|date=August 2014}}

In Nepal cowries are used for a gambling game. 16 pieces of cowries are tossed by four different bettors (and sub-bettors under them). This game is usually played at homes and even in the public during the Hindu festival of [[Tihar]]<ref name="Cowries' use in Nepal">{{cite web|title=Tihar|url=http://www.yetitrailadventure.com/nepal/tihar.html|website=Yeti Trial Adventure|accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref> or [[Deepawali]]. In the same festival these shells are also worshiped as a symbol of Goddess Laxmi and wealth.   

Cowry shells were among the devices used for divination by the [[Kaniyar Panicker]] astrologers of [[Kerala]], India.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=D27KRLsFNnAC&pg=PA254 |first=T.

Cowry shells are also worn as [[jewelry]] or otherwise used as [[fashion|ornaments]] or [[amulet|charm]]s. They are viewed as [[symbol]]s of [[womanhood]], [[fertility]], [[birth]] and [[wealth]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=anjOC0zZ6kgC&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=cowrie+feminine&source=web&ots=In00gwxE0Z&sig=ZQ92VdhzvKhaxbpyv4BO6_46LSQ&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA217,M1 ''Radiance from the Waters: Ideals of Feminine Beauty in Mende Art''] by [[Sylvia Ardyn Boone]]. [[Yale University Press]], 1986.</ref> The symbolism of the cowry shell is associated with the appearance of its underside: the lengthwise opening makes the shell look like a [[vulva]] or an [[eye]].<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/1257370 "Cowrie Shells as Amulets in Europe"] by [[W. L. Hildburgh]] in ''[[Folklore Society|Folklore]]'', 1942.</ref>

[[File:Cowrie shells - sozhi roll of 3.jpg|thumb|Cowrie shells used as dice, showing a roll of 3]]
Cowry shells are sometimes used in a way similar to [[dice]], e.g., in [[board games]] like [[Pachisi]], [[Ashta Chamma (board game)]] or in [[divination]] (cf. [[Ifá]] and [[The annual customs of Dahomey|the annual customs]] of [[Dahomey]] of [[Benin]]). A number of shells (6 or 7 in Pachisi) are thrown, with those landing aperture upwards indicating the actual number rolled. {{cn|date=August 2014}}

On the [[Fiji]] Islands, a shell of the golden cowry or [[bulikula]], ''[[Cypraea aurantium]]'', was drilled at the ends and worn on a string around the neck by [[tribal chief|chieftains]] as a badge of rank.<ref>[http://www.stampsfiji.com/fijian.htm Cowries as a badge of rank in Fiji.]</ref> The women of [[Tuvalu]] use [[cowrie]] and other shells in traditional handicrafts.<ref name="ATP">{{cite web| last =Tiraa-Passfield | first = Anna |title= The uses of shells in traditional Tuvaluan handicrafts| publisher= SPC Traditional Marine Resource Management and Knowledge Information Bulletin #7|chapter=|date = September 1996|url= http://www.spc.int/DigitalLibrary/Doc/FAME/InfoBull/TRAD/7/TRAD7_02_Tiraa.pdf| accessdate=8 February 2014}}</ref>

Large cowry shells such as that of a [[Cypraea tigris]] have been used in [[Europe]] in the recent past as a [[darning egg]] over which [[sock]] heels were stretched. The cowry's smooth surface allows the needle to be positioned under the cloth more easily. {{cn|date=August 2014}}

The '''occipital bone''' {{IPAc-en|@|k|'|s|I|p|i-|t|@l}}, a saucer-shaped membrane bone situated at the back and lower part of the [[skull]], is trapezoidal in shape and curved on itself. It is pierced by a large oval opening, the [[foramen magnum]], through which the [[cranial cavity]] communicates with the [[vertebral canal]].

* The curved, expanded plate behind the foramen magnum is named the [[squama occipitalis]].
* The thick, somewhat quadrilateral piece in front of the foramen is called the [[basilar part of occipital bone]], - the basioccipital.
* On either side of the foramen are the [[lateral parts of occipital bone]], -the exoccipitals.

==Structure==
The occipital, like the other cranial has outer and inner tables, between which is the [[cancellous]] tissue or [[diploë]]; the bone is especially thick at the ridges, protuberances, [[Condyle (anatomy)|condyles]], and anterior part of the [[basilar]] part; in the inferior fossæ it is thin, semitransparent, and destitute of diploë.

=== Foramen magnum ===
{{See also|Foramen magnum}}
The foramen magnum (Latin for large hole) is a large oval aperture with its long diameter antero-posterior; it is wider behind than in front where it is encroached upon by the condyles .

It transmits the [[medulla oblongata]] and its membranes, the [[accessory nerves]], the [[vertebral arteries]], the anterior and [[posterior spinal arteries]], and the [[membrana tectoria]] and [[alar ligaments]] .

=== Angles ===
The '''superior angle''' of the occipital bone articulates with the occipital angles of the [[parietal bones]] and, in the fetal skull, corresponds in position with the [[posterior fontanelle]].

The '''inferior angle''' is fused with the body of the sphenoid. The lateral angles are situated at the extremities of the [[Groove for transverse sinus|grooves for the transverse sinuses]]: each is received into the interval between the mastoid angle of the parietal and the mastoid part of the [[Temporal bone|temporal]].

=== Borders ===
The '''superior borders''' extend from the superior to the lateral angles: they are deeply serrated for articulation with the occipital borders of the parietals, and form by this union the [[lambdoidal suture]].

The '''inferior borders''' extend from the lateral angles to the inferior angle; the upper half of each articulates with the mastoid portion of the corresponding [[Temporal bone|temporal]], the lower half with the [[petrous]] part of the same bone.

These two portions of the inferior border are separated from one another by the jugular process, the notch on the anterior surface of which forms the posterior part of the [[jugular foramen]].

}}

===Development===
[[File:Gray131.png|thumb|right|Figure 3 : Occipital bone at birth.]]
The [[planum occipitale]] [Fig. 3] of the squama of the occipital bone is developed in [[membrane (biology)|membrane]], and may remain separate throughout life when it constitutes the interparietal bone; the rest of the bone is developed in cartilage.

The number of nuclei for the planum occipitale is usually given as four, two appearing near the middle line about the second month, and two some little distance from the middle line about the third month of fetal life.

The planum nuchale of the squama is ossified from two centers, which appear about the seventh week of fetal life and soon unite to form a single piece.

Union of the upper and lower portions of the squama takes place in the third month of fetal life.

An occasional center (Kerckring) appears in the posterior margin of the foramen magnum during the fifth month; this forms a separate ossicle (sometimes double) which unites with the rest of the squama before birth.

Each of the lateral parts begins to ossify from a single center during the eighth week of fetal life. The basilar portion is ossified from two centers, one in front of the other; these appear about the sixth week of fetal life and rapidly coalesce.

Mall states that the [[planum occipitale]] is ossified from two centers and the basilar portion from one.

About the fourth year the squama and the two lateral portions unite, and about the sixth year the bone consists of a single piece. Between the 18th and 25th years the occipital and [[Sphenoid bone|sphenoid]] become united, forming a single bone.

== In other animals ==
In many animals these parts stay separate through life; e.g. in the dog as four parts: [[supraoccipital]] (= the squama); left and right [[exoccipital]] (= the lateral parts); [[basioccipital]] (= the basilar part).

The occipital bone is part of the [[endocranium]], the most basal portion of the skull. In [[Chondrichthyes]] and [[Agnatha]]ns, the occipital do not form as a separate element, but remain part of the [[chondrocranium]] throughout life. In most higher vertebrates, the foramen magnum is surrounded by a ring of four bones. The '''basioccipital''' lies in front of the opening, the two '''[[Exoccipital condyle|exoccipital]]s''' lie to either side, and the larger '''supraoccipital''' lies to the posterior, and forms at least part of the rear of the cranium. In many [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]] and [[amphibian]]s, the supraoccipital is never ossified, and remains as [[cartilage]] throughout life. In primitive forms the basioccipital and exoccipitals somewhat resemble the centrum and neural arches of a [[vertebra]], and form in a similar manner in the embryo. Together, these latter bones usually form a single concave circular condyle for the articulation of the first vertebra.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 221–244|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

In [[mammal]]s, however, the condyle has divided in two, a pattern otherwise seen only in a few amphibians. Most mammals also have a single fused occipital bone, formed from the four separate elements around the foramen magnum, along with the paired postparietal bones that form the rear of the [[skull roof|cranial roof]] in other vertebrates.<ref name=VB/>

'''Ksitigarbha''' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|??????????}} ''{{IAST|K?itigarbha}}'') is a [[bodhisattva]] primarily revered in [[East Asian Buddhism]] and usually depicted as a [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]]. His name may be translated as "Earth Treasury", "Earth Store", "Earth Matrix", or "Earth Womb". Ksitigarbha is known for his vow to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the [[Desire realm|six worlds]] between the death of [[Gautama Buddha]] and the rise of [[Maitreya]], as well as his vow not to achieve [[Buddhahood]] until all [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hell]]s are emptied. He is therefore often regarded as the bodhisattva of hell-beings, as well as the guardian of children and patron deity of deceased children and aborted fetuses in Japanese culture.

Usually depicted as a monk with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] around his shaved head, he carries a [[khakkhara|staff]] to force open the gates of hell and a [[Cintamani|wish-fulfilling jewel]] to light up the darkness.

== Overview ==
Ksitigarbha is one of the four principal [[bodhisattva]]s in East Asian [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]]. The others are [[Samantabhadra]], [[Manjusri]], and [[Avalokite?vara]].

At the pre-[[Tang dynasty]] grottos in [[Dunhuang]] and [[Longmen Grottoes|Longmen]], he is depicted in a classical bodhisattva form. After the Tang, he became increasingly depicted as a monk carrying [[Buddhist prayer beads]] and a staff.

His full name in Chinese is ''Dayuan Dizang Pusa'' ({{zh|t=??????|p=Dàyuàn Dìzàng Púsà}}), or "Bodhisattva King Earth-Matrix of the Great Vow", pronounced ''Daigan Jiz? Bosatsu'' in Japanese and ''Jijang Bosal'' in Korean. This name is a reference to his pledge, as recorded in the [[sutra]]s, to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the [[Desire realm|six worlds]] in the era between the [[parinirvana]] of the Buddha and the rise of Maitreya. Because of this important role, shrines to Ksitigarbha often occupy a central role in temples, especially within the memorial halls or mausoleums.

Osore]], a location said to resemble [[Sanzu River|children's limbo]] in Japanese Buddhist tradition. There, Jizo is said to appear to rescue the children from the limbo and its iron club-welding [[oni|demons]]. Because of this, Jizo statues are often adorned with bibs, kerchiefs (pictured) and [[haori]]. In Jizo's right hand, he carries a [[khakkhara]] monk staff, and in his left, a [[cintamani|wish-fulfilling jewel]].]]

=== As a Brahmin maiden ===
The story of Ksitigarbha was first described in the ''[[K?itigarbha Bodhisattva P?rvapra?idh?na S?tra]]'', one of the most popular [[Mahayana sutras|Mah?y?na s?tras]]. This sutra is said to have been spoken by the Buddha towards the end of his life to the beings of the [[Tr?yastri??a]] Heaven as a mark of gratitude and remembrance for his beloved mother, [[Queen Maya|M?y?dev?]].<ref>[http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/clubs/buddhism/ksitigarbha/chap1.html Ksitigarbha Sutra - Chapter One: Miracles In The Palace Of The Trayastrimsas Heaven:] - "Thus have I heard. Once the Buddha was abiding in Trayastrimsas Heaven in order to expound the Dharma to his mother."</ref>

The ''[[K?itigarbha Bodhisattva P?rvapra?idh?na S?tra]]'' was first translated from the [[Sanskrit]] into Chinese in the 7th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]] by the [[Tripitaka|Tripi?aka]] master [[Shikshananda|?ik??nanda]], a Buddhist monk from [[Khotan]] who also provided a new translation of the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avata?saka S?tra]]'' and the ''[[Lankavatara Sutra|La?k?vat?ra S?tra]]''. However, some scholars have suspected that instead of being translated, this text may have originated in [[China]], since no Sanskrit manuscripts of this text have been found. Part of the reason for suspicion is that the text advocates filial piety, which was stereotypically associated with [[Chinese culture]]. It stated that Ksitigarbha practised [[filial piety]] as a mortal, which eventually led to making great vows to save all sentient beings. Since then, other scholars such as [[Gregory Schopen]] have pointed out that Indian Buddhism also had traditions of filial piety.<ref>Schopen, Gregory. ''Filial Piety and the Monk in the Practice of Buddhism: A Question of 'Sinicization' Viewed from the Other Side.''</ref> Currently there is no clear evidence indicating either an Indian or Chinese origin for the text.

In the ''K?itigarbha S?tra'', the Buddha states that in the distant past eons, Ksitigarbha was a maiden of the [[Brahmin]] caste by the name of ''Sacred Girl''.<ref>Frederic, Louis. ''Buddhism: Flammarion Iconographic Guides.'' 1995. pp. 184-185</ref><ref>Edkins, Joseph. ''Chinese Buddhism.'' 2003. pp. 225-226</ref> She was deeply troubled when her mother died, because she had often been slanderous towards the [[Triple Gem]]. To save her from the great tortures of [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hell]], the girl sold whatever she had and used the money to buy offerings that she offered daily to the Buddha of her time, known as the Buddha of the Flower of Meditation and Enlightenment. She prayed fervently that her mother be spared the pains of hell and appealed to the Buddha for help.<ref name="buddhanet1">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206165707/http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/tstang-txt.htm |title=Ti Tsang P'usa: Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-16}}</ref>

While she was pleading for help at the temple, she heard the Buddha telling her to go home, sit down, and recite his name if she wanted to know where her mother was. She did as she was told and her consciousness was transported to a Hell realm, where she met a guardian who informed her that through her fervent prayers and pious offerings, her mother had accumulated much merit and had already ascended to heaven. Sacred Girl was greatly relieved and would have been extremely happy, but the sight of the suffering she had seen in Hell touched her heart. She vowed to do her best to relieve beings of their suffering in her future lives for [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]].<ref name="buddhanet1"/>

=== As a Buddhist monk ===
[[File:Goryeo-Kshitigarbha (Chijang)-late.14c.jpg|thumb|Ksitigarbha painting, [[Goryeo]] Korea, late 14th century]]
[[File:Chijang Posal as Supreme Lord of the Underworld.jpg|thumb|Ji Jang Bosal as Supreme Ruler of the Underworld, late 18th century]]
There is a legend about how Ksitigarbha manifested himself in China, and chose his [[bodhimanda]] to be [[Mount Jiuhua]], one of the [[Sacred Mountains of China|Four Sacred Mountains of China]] in Buddhism.

In the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]], during the reign of [[Emperor Ming of Han|Emperor Ming]], Buddhism started to flourish, reaching its peak in the era of the [[Tang Dynasty]], eventually spreading to Korea. At the time, monks and scholars arrived from those countries to seek the [[dharma]] in China. One of these pilgrims was a former prince from [[Silla]] named [[Kim Gyo-gak]], who became a monk under the name of ''Earth Store'' (also called ''Jijang'', the Korean pronunciation of ''Dizang'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fo365.cn/jswz_view.asp?id=230 |title=??????? |publisher=Fo365.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-01-16}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> He went to Mount Jiuhua in present-day [[Anhui]] province. After ascending, he decided to build a hut in a deep mountain area so that he may be able to cultivate.

According to records, Jijang was bitten by a poisonous snake, but did not move, thus letting the snake go. A woman happened to pass by and gave the monk medicines to cure him of the venom, as well as a spring on her son's behalf. For a few years, Jijang continued to meditate in his hut, until one day, a scholar named Chu-Ke led a group of friends and family to visit the mountain. Noticing the monk meditating in the hut, they went and took a look at his condition. They had noticed that his bowl did not contain any food, and that his hair had grown back.

Taking pity on the monk, Chu-Ke decided to build a temple as an offering to him. The whole group descended the mountain immediately to discuss plans to build the temple. Mount Jiuhua was also property of a wealthy person called Elder Wen-Ke, who obliged to build a temple on his mountain. Therefore, Wen-Ke and the group ascended the mountain once more and asked Jijang how much land he needed.

Jijang replied that he needed a piece of land that could be covered fully by his [[Kasaya (clothing)|kasaya]]. Initially believing that a piece of sash could not provide enough land to build a temple, they were surprised when Jijang threw the kasaya in the air, and the robe expanded in size, covering the entire mountain. Elder Wen-Ke had then decided to renounce the entire mountain to Jijang, and became his protector. Sometime later, Wen-Ke's son also left secular life to become a monk.

Jijang lived in Mount Jiuhua for 75 years before passing away at the age of 99. Three years after his [[nirvana]], his tomb was opened, only to reveal that the body [[incorruptibility|had not decayed]]. Because Jijang led his wayplace with much difficulty, most people had the intuition to believe that he was indeed an incarnation of Ksitigarbha.

Jijang's well-preserved, dehydrated body may still be viewed today at the monastery he built on [[Mount Jiuhua]].

== Iconography ==

=== Traditional iconography ===
In Buddhist iconography, Ksitigarbha is typically depicted with a shaven head, dressed in a monk's simple robes (unlike most other [[bodhisattvas]], who are dressed like Indian royalty). In his left hand, Ksitigarbha holds a [[Cintamani|wish-fulfilling jewel]]; in his right hand, he holds a [[khakkhara|staff]] (called ''shakujo'' ?? in Japanese), which is used to alert insects and small animals of his approach, so that he will not accidentally harm them. This staff is traditionally carried by Buddhist monks. In the Chinese tradition, Ksitigarbha is sometimes depicted wearing a crown like the one worn by [[Vairocana Buddha]]. His image is similar to that of the fictional character [[Xuanzang (fictional character)|Tang Sanzang]] in the classical novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', so observers sometimes mistake Ksitigarbha for the latter.

Like other bodhisattvas, Ksitigarbha usually is seen standing on a lotus base, symbolising his release from the [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|wheel of rebirth]]. Ksitigarbha's face and head are also idealised, featuring the [[third eye]], elongated ears and the other standard attributes of an [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightened]] being.

=== Iconography in Japan ===
[[File:Jizo Children.jpg|thumb|right|Jiz? [[bodhisattva]] statue at Mibudera temple in [[Japan]], depicted with children and bibs.]]

The [[Narihira Santosen Temple]] in [[Katsushika]], [[Tokyo]], contains the "Bound Jiz?" of [[?oka Tadasuke]] fame, dating from the [[Edo Period]]. When petitions are requested before Jiz?, the petitioner ties a rope about the statue. When the wish is granted, the petitioner unties the rope. At the new year, the ropes of the ungranted wishes are cut by the temple priest. The vandalism of a Jiz? statue is the central theme of the Japanese horror film ''[[Shibuya Kaidan]]''. The anime series ''[[Hell Girl]]'' is also loosely based on the legend of Jiz? and the [[zanpakuto]] of [[Mayuri Kurotsuchi]] from the manga series ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'' is Ashisogi Jizo (leg-cutting Jiz?). The dark mass spell utilised by Jellal Fernandes in the manga series ''[[Fairy Tail]]'' features the outline of Ksitigarbha's face when launched.

=== Ksitigarbha as Lord of the Six Ways ===
[[File:K?itigarbha as Lord of the Six Ways (Stein Painting 19).jpg|thumb|left|Painting of Ksitigarbha as the Lord of the Six Ways from [[Mogao Grottoes]] in [[Dunhuang]]]]
Another category of iconographic depiction is Ksitigarbha as the Lord of the Six Ways, an allegorical representation of the Six Paths of Rebirth of the [[Desire realm]] (rebirth into hell, or as pretas, animals, asuras, men, and devas). The Six Paths are often depicted as six rays or beams radiating from the bodhisattva and accompanied by figurative representations of the Six Paths. Many of these depictions in China can be found in [[Shaanxi]] province, perhaps a result of Sanjie Jiao worship in the area.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zhiru|title=The making of a savior bodhisattva: Dizang in Medieval China|year=2007|publisher=University of Hawai'i press|location=Honolulu (T.H.)|isbn=0824830458|pages=68|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}</ref> A Japanese variation of this depiction is the Six Jizo, six full sculptural manifestations of the bodhisattva. An example of this can be found in Konjikid?, the ‘Hall of Gold,’ in the [[Ch?son-ji]] temple.

==In Buddhist traditions==

=== In China ===
[[Mount Jiuhua]] in [[Anhui]] is regarded as Ksitigarbha's [[bodhima??a]]. It is one of the Four Sacred Buddhism Mountains in China, and at one time housed more than 300 temples. Today, 95 of these are open to the public. The mountain is a popular destination for pilgrims offering dedications to Ksitigarbha.

In some areas, the admixture of traditional religions has led to Ksitigarbha being also regarded as a [[Taoist]] deity, albeit his duties differ to what Ksitigarbha does. For example, in Hong Kong and among [[overseas Chinese]] communities, his images are usually found in the memorial halls of Buddhist and Taoist temples.

=== In Japan ===
[[Image:BeheadedJizo.jpg|thumb|250px|Buddhist statues of Jiz?, the [[bosatsu]] beheaded by [[Christianity in Japan|Christian]] rebels during the [[Shimabara Rebellion]]]]
In Japan, Ksitigarbha, known as ''Jiz?'', or ''Ojiz?-sama'' as he is respectfully known, is one of the most loved of all Japanese divinities. His statues are a common sight, especially by roadsides and in graveyards. Traditionally, he is seen as the guardian of children, and in particular, children who died before their parents. He has been worshipped as the guardian of the souls of ''mizuko'', the souls of stillborn, [[miscarriage|miscarried]] or [[abortion|aborted]] [[foetus]]es, in the ritual of [[mizuko kuyo|mizuko kuy?]] (????, lit. ''offering to water children''). In [[Japanese mythology]], it is said that the souls of children who die before their parents are unable to cross the mythical [[Sanzu River]] on their way to the afterlife because they have not had the chance to accumulate enough good deeds and because they have made the parents suffer. It is believed that Jiz? saves these souls from having to pile stones eternally on the bank of the river as penance, by hiding them from demons in his robe, and letting them hear mantras.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Jiz? statues are sometimes accompanied by a little pile of stones and pebbles, put there by people in the hope that it would shorten the time children have to suffer in the underworld. (The act is derived from the tradition of building [[stupas]] as an act of merit-making.) The statues can sometimes be seen wearing tiny children's clothing or bibs, or with toys, put there by grieving parents to help their lost ones and hoping that Jiz? would specially protect them. Sometimes the offerings are put there by parents to thank Jiz? for saving their children from a serious illness. Jiz?'s features are commonly made more baby-like to resemble the children he protects.

As he is seen as the saviour of souls who have to suffer in the underworld, his statues are common in cemeteries. He is also believed to be one of the protective deities of travellers, the ''[[d?sojin]]'', and roadside statues of Jiz? are a common sight in Japan. Firefighters are also believed to be under the protection of Jiz?.

=== In Southeast Asia ===
In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, the story of a Buddhist monk called Phra Malai, who has the similar qualities of Ksitigarbha, is well known throughout Southeast Asia, especially in [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]]. Legend has it that he was an [[arhat]] from [[Sri Lanka]], who achieved great supernatural powers through his own merit and meditation. He is also honoured as a successor to [[Maudgalyayana]], the Buddha's disciple foremost for his supernatural attainments. In the story, this pious and compassionate monk descends to [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Hell]] to give teachings & comfort the suffering hell-beings there. He also learns how the hell-beings are punished according to their sins in the different hells.

== Mantra ==
[[File:Jizo Toi gold mine.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Jiz?]] in the [[Toi gold mine]], [[Shizuoka Prefecture]], [[Japan]].]]
In [[Shingon]] and other schools of East Asian [[Esoteric Buddhism]], the mantra of Ksitigarbha comes from the "Treasury of Mantras" section of the ''[[Mahavairocana Sutra|Mah?vairocana S?tra]]''. The effect of this mantra is producing the "[[Samadhi]] Realm of Adamantine Indestructible Conduct." This mantra is the following:<ref name="autogenerated2005">Giebel, Rolf.

'''The Birmingham Six''' were six men—Hugh Callaghan, Patrick Joseph Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker—sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] in 1975 in England for the  [[Birmingham pub bombings]]. Their convictions were declared [[miscarriage of justice|unsafe and unsatisfactory]] and quashed by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales#Criminal Division|Court of Appeal]] on 14 March 1991. The six men were later awarded compensation ranging from £840,000 to £1.2 million.

==Birmingham pub bombings==
The [[Birmingham pub bombings]] took place on 21 November 1974 and were attributed to the [[Provisional IRA]].<ref>Although the IRA denied that it was involved in the bombings two days after the event, and the IRA has never formally admitted responsibility for the Birmingham bomb, in 1985 a former IRA chief of staff, Joe Cahill, did acknowledge the IRA's role, and 30 years after the bombings [[Gerry Adams]], president of [[Sinn Féin]], expressed his regrets about the bombings and the huge loss of life and injuries they inflicted (Chrisafis, Angelique. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,,1356601,00.html IRA fails to say sorry for Birmingham pub bombs], ''[[The Guardian]]'' 22 November 2004, Staff. 
[http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2004/11/22/story492924770.asp Adams expresses regret for Birmingham pub bombings] ''[[Irish Examiner]]'' 22 November 2004).  [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/feedarticle/10207331 Guardian newspaper: Birmingham Six man signs petition, 22 April 2012] - Patrick Hill, one of the Six, said in April 2012 that the Six had learned the names of the real bombers and claimed it was common knowledge among the upper echelons of both the IRA and the British government.</ref> The devices were placed in two central Birmingham pubs: the Mulberry Bush at the foot of the [[Rotunda (Birmingham)|Rotunda]], and the Tavern in the Town – a basement pub on New Street. The resulting explosions, at 20:25 and 20:27, collectively were the most injurious and serious attacks in Great Britain since [[World War II]]; 21 people were killed (ten at the Mulberry Bush and eleven at the Tavern in the Town) and 182 people were injured. A third device, outside a bank on Hagley Road, failed to detonate.

===Arrests and questioning===
Six men were arrested, of whom five were [[Belfast]]-born Roman Catholics, while John Walker was born in [[Derry]]. All six had lived in Birmingham since the 1960s. Five of the men, Hill, Hunter, McIlkenny, Power and Walker, had left the city early on the  evening of 21 November from [[Birmingham New Street railway station|New Street Station]], shortly before the explosions. They were travelling to Belfast to attend the funeral of [[James McDade]], an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] member who had accidentally killed himself while planting a bomb in [[Coventry]] (Hill was also intending to see an aunt in Belfast who was sick and not expected to live). They were seen off from the station by Callaghan. 

When they reached [[Heysham]] they and others were subject to a [[Special Branch]] [[stop and search]]. The men did not tell the police of the true purpose of their visit to Belfast, a fact that was later held against them. While the search was in progress the police were informed of the Birmingham bombings. The men agreed to be taken to [[Morecambe]] police station for [[forensic]] tests.

On the morning of 22 November, after the forensic tests and questioning at the hands of the Morecambe police, the men were transferred to the custody of [[West Midlands Serious Crime Squad]] police unit. William Power alleged that he was assaulted by members of Birmingham [[Criminal Investigation Department]].<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/other/1974/faul76a.htm CAIN: Events: Birmingham Six: Fr. Denis Faul and Fr. Raymond Murray. (n.d; 1975?) The Birmingham Framework: Six innocent men framed for the Birmingham Bombings<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Callaghan was taken into custody on the evening of 22 November.

While the men were in the custody of the West Midlands Police they were  deprived of food and sleep, they were interrogated sometimes for up to 12 hours without a break;  threats were made against them and the beatings  started: ranging from punches, letting dogs within a foot of them and being the subjects of a mock execution. 
Billy Power confessed while in Morecambe while Hugh Callaghan, John Walker and Richard McIlkenny confessed at Queens Road in Aston with Paddy Hill and Gerry Hunter not signing any documents.

===Trial===
On 12 May 1975 the six men were charged with murder and conspiracy to cause explosions. Three other men, James Kelly, [[Mick Murray (IRA volunteer)|Michael Murray]] and Michael Sheehan, were charged with conspiracy and Kelly and Sheehan also faced charges of unlawful possession of explosives.

The trial began on 9 June 1975 at the [[Crown Court of England and Wales|Crown Court]] sitting at [[Lancaster Castle]], before [[Nigel Bridge, Baron Bridge of Harwich|Mr Justice Bridge]] and a jury. After legal arguments, the statements made in November, the unreliability of which was subsequently established, were deemed admissible as evidence. [[Kenneth Littlejohn#Thomas Watt|Thomas Watt]]  provided [[circumstantial evidence]] about John Walker's association with Provisional IRA members.<ref name=error>p229 [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]] ''Error of Judgement''</ref>  

[[Forensic scientist]] Dr [[Frank Skuse]] used positive [[Griess test]] results to claim that Hill and Power had handled explosives. Callaghan, Hunter, McIlkenny and Walker all had tested negative. [[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry|GCMS]] tests at a later date were negative for Power and contradicted the initial results for Hill.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.aic.gov.au/conferences/medicine/schurr.pdf |title= Expert Witnesses And The Duties Of Disclosure & Impartiality: The Lessons Of The IRA Cases In England. |accessdate=5 August 2007 |author= Beverley Schurr |authorlink= NSW Legal Aid Commission  |month= |pages= |quote=}}</ref> Skuse's claim that he was 99% certain that Power and Hill had explosives traces on their hands was opposed by defence expert Dr Hugh Kenneth Black of the [[Royal Institute of Chemistry]], the former HM Chief Inspector of Explosives, Home Office. Skuse's evidence was clearly preferred by Bridge.<ref>R v McIlkenney (1991) 93 Cr.App.R. 287</ref> The jury found the six men guilty of murder. On 15 August 1975, they were each sentenced to 21 life sentences.

===Criminal charges against prison officers and civil actions against police===
On 28 November, the men appeared in court for the second time after they had been remanded into custody at [[Birmingham (HM Prison)|HM Prison Winson Green]]. All showed bruising and other signs of ill-treatment.<ref>[http://cain.ulster.ac.uk/events/other/1974/faul76.htm CAIN: Events: Birmingham Six: Fr. Denis Faul and Fr. Raymond Murray. (1976) The Birmingham Framework: Six innocent men framed for the Birmingham Bombings<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Fourteen prison officers were charged with assault in June 1975, but were all acquitted at a trial presided over by Swanwick J. The six brought a civil claim for damages against the West Midlands police in 1977, which was struck out on 17 January 1980 by the Court of Appeal (Civil Division), constituted by the [[Master of the Rolls]], [[Lord Denning]], Goff LJ and Sir George Baker,<ref>McIlkenny -v- Chief Constable of the West Midlands [1980] QB 283</ref> under the principle of [[issue estoppel|estoppel]].<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjudgmt/jd050210/polan-3.htm Judgments – Polanski (Appellant) v. Conde Nast Publications Limited (Respondents)] UK Parliament publications Paragraph 86</ref>

During proceedings Prison Officers were blamed for the beatings and so were the police. A prisoner released from prison 2 weeks after they were admitted to the prison told of the beatings the six men had received.

===Appeals===
In March 1976 their first application for leave to appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, presided over by [[John Widgery, Baron Widgery|Lord Widgery]] [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|CJ]].<ref>''Miscarriages of Justice''; Bob Woffinden (1987)</ref> Journalist (later [[Minister (government)|Government minister]]) [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]] investigated the case for [[Granada Television|Granada TV]]'s ''[[World in Action]]'' series. In 1985, the first of several ''World in Action'' programmes casting doubt on the men's convictions was broadcast. In 1986, Mullin's book, ''Error of Judgment: The Truth About the Birmingham Pub Bombings'', set out a detailed case supporting the men's claims that they were innocent. It included his claim to have met some of those who were actually responsible for the bombings.

The Home Secretary, [[Douglas Hurd]] MP, referred the case back to the Court of Appeal. In January 1988, after a six week hearing (at that time the longest criminal appeal hearing ever held), the convictions were ruled to be safe and satisfactory. The Court of Appeal, presided over by the Lord Chief Justice [[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|Lord Lane]] dismissed the appeals. Over the next three years newspaper articles, television documentaries and books brought forward new evidence to question the safety of the convictions, while campaign groups calling for the men's release were formed in [[Great Britain|Britain]], Ireland, Europe and the US.{{cn|date=November 2011}}

Their second full appeal, in 1991, was allowed. Hunter was represented by [[Anthony Maurice Gifford, 6th Baron Gifford|Lord Gifford]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], others by human rights solicitor [[Gareth Peirce]]. New evidence of police fabrication and [[suppression of evidence]], the successful attacks on both the confessions and the 1975 forensic evidence caused the Crown to decide not to resist the appeals. The Court of Appeal, constituted by Lord Justices Lloyd, Mustill and Farquharson, stated of the forensic evidence that "Dr. Skuse's conclusion was wrong, and demonstrably wrong, judged even by the state of forensic science in 1974."<ref>R v McIlkenney (1991) 93 Cr.App.R. 53–54</ref> In 2001, a decade after their release, the six men were awarded compensation ranging from £840,000 to £1.2 million.

===Consequences===
The success of the appeals and other miscarriages of justice caused the [[Home Secretary]] to set up a [[Royal Commission on Criminal Justice]] in 1991. The commission reported in 1993 and led to the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 which established the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]] in 1997.  [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] George Reade and two other police officers were charged with [[perjury]] and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to [[perverting the course of justice|pervert the course of justice]] but were never prosecuted. Richard McIlkenny died of cancer in a Dublin hospital on 21 May 2006.

==Granada Television productions==
On 28 March 1990, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] broadcast the Granada Television [[docudrama|documentary drama]], ''Who Bombed Birmingham?'', which re-enacted the bombings and subsequent key events in [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]]'s campaign. Written by Rob Ritchie and directed by Mike Beckham, it starred [[John Hurt]] as Mullin, [[Martin Shaw]] as ''World in Action'' producer Ian McBride, and [[Patrick Malahide]] as [[Michael Mansfield]] (QC).<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/457900/index.html BFI Screenonline – World in Action]</ref><ref>Simon Coward, Richard Down & Christopher Perry ''The Kaleidoscope British Independent Television Drama Research Guide 1955–2010'', Kaleidoscope Publishing, 2nd edition, 2010, p.3304, ISBN 978-1-900203-33-3)</ref> It was repackaged for export as ''The Investigation – Inside a Terrorist Bombing'', and first shown on American television on 22 April 1990.<ref>[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/438102 – ''Who Bombed Birmingham?''] – British Film Institute</ref><ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099854/ – ''The Investigation: Inside a Terrorist Bombing''] – IMDB</ref> Granada's [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]-nominated<ref>[http://www.bafta.com/awards/television/nominations/?year=1991 – 1991 Awards] BAFTA</ref> follow-up documentary after the release of the Six, ''World in Action Special: The Birmingham Six – Their Own Story'', was transmitted on 18 March 1991.<ref>[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/456479 – ''World in Action Special: The Birmingham Six – Their Own Story''] British Film Institute</ref> It was released on DVD in 2007 in [[Network DVD]]'s first volume of ''World in Action'' productions.<ref>[http://www.networkdvd.net/product_info.php?products_id=551 – ''World in Action'' Volume 1] Network DVD</ref> In 1994 forensic scientist Frank Skuse brought libel proceedings against Granada, contending that ''World in Action'' had falsely portrayed him as negligent. His counsel asserted in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] that scientific tests performed in 1992, after the Crown's substantive concession of the accused men's third appeal, showed that traces of nitroglycerine were detected on swabs taken after the bombings from the hands of Gerry Hunter and Paddy Hill and on rail tickets handled by Richard McIlkenny and Billy Power. Granada maintained that there never were any traces of explosives on the six men.<ref>Heather Mills [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/scientist-in-birmingham-six-case-sues-tv-firm-for-libel-1440938.html "Scientist in Birmingham Six case sues TV firm for libel"], ''The Independent'', 5 October 1994</ref> However, Skuse abandoned the action.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/pub-blasts-scientist-drops-libel-action-1443550.html Pub blasts scientist drops libel action] ''The Independent'' 18 October 1994</ref>

==The Birmingham Six in popular culture==
The case of the Birmingham Six was referenced in the [[BBC]] TV show [[Bottom_(TV_series)|Bottom ]] during the episode 'Burglary', first aired in October 1992, as part of Series 2 of the show. The character Richie, played by [[Rik Mayall]], is seen in a clip saying "Well done on the Birmingham six, by the way" to two [[London Metropolitan Police]]men. The following audience laughter, whether [[canned laughter]] or real laughter, suggests that the writers were attempting to tap into a popular culture of criticism of the [[police]] over the Birmingham Six.  The [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Electronic body music|EBM]] group [[Birmingham 6 (band)|Birmingham 6]], formed in 1991, took their name from this group as well.

==Freedom of speech==
[[Channel 4]] was [[Injunction|enjoined]] in December 1987 by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] from re-enacting portions of a hearing in the court case because it was "likely to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice" if shown during their appeal, in violation of the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Restricted Subjects: Freedom of Expression in the United Kingdom|author1=[[Helsinki Watch]]|author2=Fund for Free Expression|year=1991|page=53|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sjvb0Y-iwqQC&pg=PA53|ref=harv}}</ref> The decision has been criticized for having a "[[Chilling effect (law)|chilling effect]]" on other programmes.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Three Pillars of Liberty: Political Rights and Freedoms in the United Kingdom|last=Klug|first=Francesca|year=1996|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=158-159|editor1-last=Starmer|editor1-first=Keir|editor2-last=Weir|editor2-first=Stuart|series=The Democratic Audit of the United Kingdom|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=G0UMoZMrQh0C&pg=PA159|isbn=978-041509642-3|ref=harv}}</ref>

The '''Saab 9000''' is a large executive car that was produced by the Swedish company [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] from 1984 to 1998. Representing the company's foray into the [[executive car]] scene, the 9000 remained in production until it was replaced by the [[Saab 9-5]] in late 1999.

Saab designed the 9000 as part of the [[Type Four platform]] in conjunction with the Italian automaker [[Fiat Automobiles]]. Fiat retailed similar derivative versions as the more basic [[Fiat Croma]], the luxury-themed [[Lancia Thema]], and the sports-oriented [[Alfa Romeo 164]]. Unlike the 164, which shares only the chassis, the Croma and Thema are outwardly similar to the 9000. As such, much of the bodywork appeared interchangeable between the 9000, Croma and Thema; for example, the doors. However, because Saab fitted heavier side impact protection they will not fit.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Only seven different parts are actually interchangeable.<ref name = "Automobil">{{cite journal | title = Klassiker: Saab 9000 Turbo 16 | url = http://www.klassiker.nu/sites/default/files/oldimages/klassiker/document/9000_the_story.pdf | first = Eric | last = Lund | journal = Automobil |date=January 2009 | location = Stockholm, Sweden | page = 77 }}</ref> The 9000's body was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and Saab designer [[Björn Envall]].

Despite being shorter overall than the [[Saab 900|900]], the 9000 had a longer [[wheelbase]] and greater interior space, and was the first Saab vehicle imported to the United States to be classed as a "large car" by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]].

The 9000 was launched in 1984 as a five-door [[liftback]] only sharing much of its appearance and bodywork with the [[Type Four platform]] relatives—the [[Fiat Croma]] and [[Lancia Thema]]. Later in 1988, Saab released a sedan variant of the 9000 known as the "CD". This was followed by the 1991 release of a partially redesigned five-door liftback, known as the "CS". At the release of the "CS", the original liftback variant was retrospectively designated "CC" to differentiate it from the newer version, which it continued to sell alongside in some markets as an entry-level model.

With the introduction of the "CD" in 1988, Saab took the opportunity to re-style the front-end for the sedan. This involved smoothing the edges of the headlamps and grille, and sloping the front outwards, marking a departure from the more upright front styling of the 1984 original. From late 1990, the "CC" liftback received this same front-end facelift.<ref name="BK91">{{cite book | title = BilKatalogen 1991 ''(Swedish edition of German'' Auto Katalog'')'' | language = Swedish | editor = Åhman, Michael | publisher = PM Press AB | location = Stockholm, Sweden | page = 33 | year = 1990}}</ref> A second facelift arrived in 1991 with the launch of the "CS" liftback. Fitted with a much narrower front profile, this facelift made its way to the "CD" sedan in 1994, albeit, with clear as opposed to the amber front turn signals fitted to the "CS". The "CS" was in turn facelifted in circa 1995 gaining these clear lenses that had earlier debuted on the sedan (CD). Therefore, while each body variant received one facelift, they were all applied at different times.

Unlike the [[Saab 900|900]], the 9000 kept the ignition switch in the more conventional steering column position rather than between the front seats. The inspiration for the seats was taken by [[Björn Envall]] from [[The Muppet Show]]'s ''[[Pigs in Space]]'',<ref name=klassikerrumpa/> a sketch by the late puppeteer [[Jim Henson]].

[[Saab Direct Ignition]] was fitted to the 9000 CD in 1988 on some models and expanded to all turbocharged 9000s in 1990. As early as 1989, the 9000 was equipped with the larger [[Saab H engine|B234]] 2.3-litre engine, providing {{convert|150|hp|abbr=on}} in the normally aspirated engine. From late 1990, the ''B234'' became available with a turbocharger, producing {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.<ref name="BK91"/>

[[File:1997 Saab 9000 Aero 2.3 Turbo hatchback (2012-09-01) 01.jpg|thumb|Facelift Saab 9000 CS Aero (Australia)]]

In 1993, the "Aero" was introduced, and was the most powerful Saab to date upon its introduction. The "Aero" was powered by a {{convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} version of Saab's 2.3-litre ''B234'' engine, with more power courtesy of a larger [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] ''TD04'' turbocharger. Automatic transmission-equipped "Aeros" were limited to {{convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} and kept the regular turbocharged models' [[Garrett AiResearch]] T25 turbocharger. Aeros were equipped with paint-matched body kit and spoiler, eight-way [[Recaro]]-designed heated sports seats, a sport suspension, and 16-inch Super Aero wheels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mysite.verizon.net/ralimi/aero/press_release_1996.html |title=SAAB 9000 AERO is The Ultimate Luxury SUV |publisher=Mysite.verizon.net |date= |accessdate=2009-05-27}}</ref> The Aero's in-gear acceleration was strongly emphasised; the Aero was capable of accelerating from {{convert|50|to|75|mph|km/h|abbr=on|disp=flip}} faster than a Porsche Carrera 4 or a Ferrari Testarossa. The Aero was discontinued after 1997.

An optional trip computer, the SCC, was introduced for the 1993 model year, and provided mileage, speed warning, and alarm functions.<ref>Saab 9000 owner's manual, model year 1997, pp 14,15.</ref> A new turbocharger management system, [[Trionic T5.5|Trionic 5]], was equipped from the 1993 model year onwards. The Trionic system used resistor spark plugs to detect for engine knock in place of the knock sensors incorporated into the engine block in the previous [[Automatic Performance Control|APC]] system.

From 1988, all 9000 variants were equipped with a [[Saab Information Display]] (SID) which showed fuel consumption, distance to an empty fuel tank, alternator output voltage, outside temperature, and lowest battery voltage during vehicle start.<ref>Saab 9000 Service manual, vol 3, pp 381-2 to 381-3.</ref> If the outside temperature fell to {{convert|-3|to|3|°C|°F}}, the temperature display is automatically selected to warn of possible "black ice" road conditions. A separate pictogram monitored door and hatch opening and exterior light bulb condition.<ref>Saab 9000 Service manual, model year 1997, p, 11.</ref>

In the United Kingdom, a limited run of 9000 "Carlsson" models were produced, with a paint-matched airflow body kit, spoiler, and specially tuned turbocharged engine producing {{convert|220|hp|abbr=on|disp=flip}} with a manual transmission or {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on|disp=flip}} with the automatic. A number of the Carlsson editions fitted with the ''B202'' turbocharged engine were sold into the Australian market.

A limited edition "Anniversary" model was introduced to mark Saab's 50th anniversary, featuring leather seats embossed with the classic, aircraft-inspired Saab logo and a colour-keyed body kit.

Only 1,400 9000s were produced for the 1998 model year, and of these only 400 were exported to the United States. In total, 503,087 Saab 9000s were manufactured.<ref name=Automobil2>{{cite web|url=http://www.klassiker.nu/sites/default/files/oldimages/klassiker/document/9000_the_story.pdf |title=Lund, p. 78 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref>

Originally known simply as the "9000", the original liftback variant was later given the "CC" identifier, standing for "combi coupe", to differentiate it from the CD sedan and CS liftback. While originally equipped with an upright front design, this was replaced by the sloped version in mid-1990—the design that had earlier debuted on the 9000 CD (sedan) in 1988.

The original 1984 model was powered by a water-cooled, [[turbocharger|turbocharged]], [[double overhead camshaft]], 16-valve [[inline-four engine]], providing {{convert|175|hp|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.<ref>Saab 9000 Service manual, vol 0, p 022-1.</ref> Earlier on in the development, the [[PRV engine]] had also been considered.<ref name = "klassikerrumpa">{{cite web|author=Skribent: Claes Johansson claes.johansson@klassiker.nu |url=http://www.klassiker.nu/zino.aspx?articleID=11764 |title=Klassiker: Saab utan svart rumpa |publisher=Klassiker.nu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> Both a five-speed manual and four-speed automatic transmissions were available. Later in 1984, a normally aspirated engine was introduced in the 9000 and 9000 S models, producing {{convert|130|hp|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.

At the [[Birmingham Motor Show]] in September 1988, Saab premiered the four-door sedan body style with a slightly more aerodynamic nose. Known as the "CD", this was originally available only with the turbocharged engine. In late 1989, the CD range in most of the world was expanded downward with the naturally aspirated 2.0-litre inline-four. This change did not happen until late in the 1990 model year for the US market, when Saab introduced the {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.3-litre ''B234'' normally aspirated engine.

The limited edition 9000 "CD Griffin" was available in 1991 for the 1992 model year in the United States and was highly appointed with luxury features including all available electric options, special eucalyptus green paint, a separate rear-seat air conditioning system, walnut trim and rear window blinds.

When Saab released the redesigned liftback model, designated CS in 1991, it debuted a slimmer front-end design characterised by a much smaller (thinner) grille and headlamps. As part of a 1994 facelift, Saab grafted this slimmer frontal styling to the CD as well. At the same time, the tail-lamps were refreshed, with extensions to either side of the license plate alcove and white turn signal lenses replacing the previous model's amber rear turn signals.

Saab presented an updated version of the liftback body variant in 1991 for the 1992 model year with the "CS". Featuring a lowered front fascia with new headlights, grille and a substantially redesigned rear-end. Both the "CS" and better-equipped "CSE" editions were available with a 2.3-litre inline-four—either turbocharged or in normally aspirated tune. The "CS Turbo" was equipped with a low-pressure turbocharger setup producing {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, while the "CSE Turbo" sported a full-pressure turbocharger with {{convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}}. Both systems used the same Garett ''T25'' turbocharger with a base boost pressure of {{convert|.4|bar|psi|0|abbr=on}} but the full pressure turbo is equipped with a boost control valve that is manipulated by the ECU. This allows the boost pressure to be increased as the ECU sees fit. Maximum stock boost on a full pressure turbo varies from {{convert|.7|to|1.02|bar|psi|0|abbr=on}} depending on the year and transmission.

[[File:Saab 9000 cabriolet prototype.jpg|thumb|140px|Saab 9000 convertible (prototype)]]

In European markets, a smaller 2.0-litre engine was offered in normally aspirated form {{convert|130|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, light-pressure turbo {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} or full-pressure turbo {{convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.swipnet.se/danny/9000engines.htm |title=ModelGuide_9000_engines |publisher=Home.swipnet.se |date= |accessdate=2009-05-27}}</ref> The "CDE" model was offered initially with only the {{convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} turbocharged engine, and later the 3.0-litre V6.

In 1995, a 3.0-litre ''[[GM 54-Degree V6 engine|B308]]'' V6 engine with {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} was introduced as standard for the "CDE" sedan and optional for the "CSE" liftback. The V6 was discontinued in the United States after one year along with the "CDE" model, but continued on in Europe until 1997. In some European markets, a high-spec "CDE Griffin" model was offered with numerous luxury appointments. After the 1995 model year, naturally aspirated four-cylinder engines were discontinued in the United States.

=== Convertible (prototype) ===
A convertible version was constructed by Finnish [[Valmet Automotive|Valmet]], the prototype version is currently on display at the [[Uusikaupunki]] car museum near the Valmet factory. Other experiments included fitting of the [[Yamaha]] developed [[Ford SHO V6 engine|V6 engine]] most famously fitted to the [[Ford Taurus SHO]].<ref name = "Automobil"/> This was vetoed by [[Scania]], Saab's owner at the time, as was the fitment of a [[VM Motori]] diesel engine which had been executed with the aim of increasing Saab's sales in central and southern Europe.<ref name = "Automobil2"/> A station wagon was never truly under consideration due to the expenses involved, not in the least out of concern for the often tiny Saab importers who were thereby saved the trouble of having to keep a larger inventory.<ref name = "Automobil3">{{cite web|url=http://www.klassiker.nu/sites/default/files/oldimages/klassiker/document/9000_the_story.pdf |title=Lund, p. 83 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref>{{-}}

=== Prometheus (prototype) ===
In 1993, Saab experimented with steer-by-wire technology as part of the pan-European programme "Prometheus" (Programme for European Traffic with Highest Efficiency and Unprecedented Safety). Their contribution to the programme consisted of a modified 9000 with the steering wheel replaced with a center-mounted joystick. This setup removed the risk of body and facial injury in the event of an accident. It also provided easier and cheaper airbag installation, as well as improved instrument panel visibility.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/motoring-will-the-joystick-take-the-joy-out-of-driving-roger-bell-surveys-an-initiative-designed-to-take-motoring-into-the-21st-century-1482588.html |title=Will the Joystick Take the Joy Out of Driving?

=== MPV (prototype) ===
At a visit to American Sunroof Company who helped design the Saab 900 convertible the engineers spotted the building of a minivan based on the Chrysler's K-car (later launched as [[Chrysler Voyager]]). Gunnar Larsson thought it was a neat idea and when he came home he asked the head of bodyworks Dick Ohlsson if they could do something like that based on the Saab 9000. "No problem", was the reply and a small team started working on it in secret. They used the 9000 platform but lengthened and with higher roof and room for seven persons (even if the rear seats was mostly suitable for children). The full scale model was finished in May 1985 two months after the first idea.<ref>[http://www.vibilagare.se/blogg/biltestarbloggen/avslojad-saabs-familjebuss-pa-9000-turbo-16 Vi Bilägare: Avslöjad!

'''Amorphis''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]<ref name="RD"/> band founded by Jan Rechberger, [[Tomi Koivusaari]], and [[Esa Holopainen]] in 1990. Initially, the band was a [[death metal]] act, but on later albums they evolved into playing other genres, including [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[progressive metal]], and [[folk metal]]. They frequently use the [[Kalevala]], the Epic Poem of Finland, as a source for their lyrics.

==History==

===Formation and early years===
In 1989, Jan Rechberger and [[Esa Holopainen]] played in a [[thrash metal]] band called Violent Solution, which [[Tomi Koivusaari]] had left the previous year to form the [[death metal]] band [[Abhorrence]]. Violent Solution slowly dissolved and Jan Rechberger and Esa Holopainen put together another death metal band. {{Clarify|date=August 2009}} In early 1990, Tomi Koivusaari became the vocalist and [[Olli-Pekka Laine|Oppu Laine]] became their bassist.

During that time, Tomi also performed rhythm guitar, leading to the band dumping all original compositions and starting over again. {{Why|date=August 2009}} Tomi's other band, Abhorrence, split up and he found himself with more time to put into Amorphis. A demo tape, ''Disment of Soul'', was recorded in 1991 by [[Timo Tolkki]] at TTT studios.

===''The Karelian Isthmus'' and ''Tales from the Thousand Lakes''===
[[Image:Amorphis1992.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Amorphis in 1992 with Jukka Kolehmainen of Abhorrence.]]
After the band recorded their first studio demo tape, [[Relapse Records]] offered Abhorrence a recording contract. Since Abhorrence was no longer active, they sent their own demo in the return mail and got signed to a worldwide recording deal.  Soon after getting signed they released their death metal debut, ''[[The Karelian Isthmus]]'' under the new name Amorphis and later released the ''[[Privilege of Evil]]'' EP. The EP featured Abhorrence's original vocalist, Jukka Kolehmainen, on vocals on the Abhorrence cover song "Vulgar Necrolatry".

In 1994, Amorphis released their second studio album, ''[[Tales from the Thousand Lakes]]'', a concept album based on the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala. This 1994 release, while still rooted in death metal, was their first step toward a new direction as melodic [[clean vocals]] were added, provided by Ville Tuomi. ''Tales from the Thousand Lakes'' won the band a fan base thanks to its innovative sound and fusion of death metal with traditional folk, psychedelia, and progressive elements.  This album went on to influence the signature Amorphis sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shop.relapse.com/info/about.aspx |title=Relapse Records |publisher=Shop.relapse.com |date=2001-06-01 |accessdate=2011-11-06}}</ref>

===''Elegy'' and ''Tuonela''===
During the subsequent tours Kasper (keyboards) left the band, to be replaced by Kim Rantala. Jan was replaced by Pekka Kasari (ex-[[Stone (band)|Stone]]), and a sixth member was recruited, singer [[Pasi Koskinen]]. The third album, ''[[Elegy (Amorphis album)|Elegy]]'' was released in 1996. Lyrics were again adapted from Finnish mythology, in this case, the Kanteletar, a collection of ancient folk poetry. Pasi and Tomi shared the vocals on an equal basis, with Pasi's providing only clean parts.

After a year and a half of touring following the release of ''Elegy'', the band members took a time-out. Their next offering, 1999's ''[[Tuonela (album)|Tuonela]]'' was a mellow guitar album, although toward the end of the studio sessions, Santeri Kallio of Kyyria was brought in to add some keyboard tracks to the songs. New instruments were introduced (Tomi playing sitar in the song "Greed", Sakari Kukko on saxophone and flute providing a foreign accent) and the death growls were reduced, as all vocals were performed by Pasi.<ref name="amorphis">{{cite web|url=http://www.amorphis.net/?page_id=2 |title=Band |publisher=Amorphis |date=2011-06-12 |accessdate=2011-11-06}}</ref>

The tenth-anniversary compilation ''[[Story (Amorphis album)|Story]]'' was produced, and the band experienced another line-up change. Following the breakup of Kyyria, Santeri joined Amorphis as a full-time member. Bassist Oppu was replaced by another ex-Kyyria member, Niclas Etelävuori, to tour with Amorphis on their third U.S. tour.<ref name="amorphis"/>

===''Am Universum'' and ''Far from the Sun''===
''[[Am Universum]]'' was released in 2001, which included more emphases to keyboards and saxophone work, the latter contributed by [[Sakari Kukko]]. It was an experimental album and Amorphis' most psychedelic to date.<ref name="amorphis"/> In 2002 the band contributed to the soundtrack for the movie [[Menolippu Mombasaan]]. The commissioned piece was a cover version of a 1976 Finnish pop hit "Kuusamo", it is currently the band's only song in their native language.<ref name="amorphis"/>

Amorphis' last album with Relapse Records was ''Far from the Sun''. In 2003, Relapse released the retrospective ''[[Chapters (Amorphis album)|Chapters]]'', which included a DVD featuring the band's videos from "Black Winter Day" to "Alone". ''[[Far from the Sun]]'' was produced by the band itself, which had been rejoined by original drummer Jan Rechberger after Pekka Kasari had quit to concentrate on family duties. Pasi left the band in 2004 after nine years.<ref name="amorphis"/>

===''Eclipse'' and ''Silent Waters''===
[[Image:Amorphis wiki.jpg|250px|thumb|Left-right: J. Rechberger, T. Joutsen, S. Kallio and E. Holopainen at [[Ruisrock]] 2006.]]
While searching for the new vocalist Amorphis received over a hundred demo tapes from prospective vocalists but none of them became the new frontman of the band. Eventually [[Tomi Joutsen]] got an audition through a word of mouth and he became their next singer in 2005.<ref name="amorphis"/> Joutsen, best known for his work with metal band Sinisthra,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinisthra.com/ |title=Sinisthra Biography Section |publisher=Sinisthra.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-06}}</ref> urged Amorphis to return to the use of contrasting vocal styles for their next album.<ref name="amorphis"/> His first album with the band, ''[[Eclipse (Amorphis album)|Eclipse]]'', was released in 2006.

On September 15, 2010, Amorphis released "[[Magic & Mayhem – Tales from the Early Years]]", a re-working of a dozen tracks from their first three albums with slightly different arrangements, better audio quality and featuring the band's current lineup, plus a cover of [[Light my Fire]] as a bonus track. During the tour that followed, the band briefly reunited with Pasi Koskinen and other past members (such as keyboard player Kim Rantala) on stage, to perform some of the older songs.

===''Circle'' and Present===

On August 21, 2012, Amorphis announced on their website that a new album was in the works.<ref>http://amorphis.net</ref> On January 17, 2013, the band announced the title and release date for their next record. [[Circle (Amorphis album)|Circle]] was released on April 19 in Europe and April 30th in North America.  [[Tomi Joutsen]] on the new album, "Circle represents integrity. Back in the days, when there was something special to talk about, wise men used to sit in circle. Not everyone was invited to join them. But in this story, the protagonist was invited among the wise men's circle.” <ref>https://www.facebook.com/notes/amorphis/amorphis-new-album-details-revealed/10151428886266125</ref> On September 16, 2013, [[Circle (Amorphis album)|Circle]] won [[Metal Hammer|Metal Hammer´s]] “The Album of The Year” award.   [[Esa Holopainen]] on the award, "For us, Album of the Year award is a great recognition for the work done so far. Especially when we got it from our 11th studioalbum."<ref>http://amorphis.net</ref>

On August 4, 2014, Amorphis announced on their website and through social media that they would be playing a number of special [[Tales from the Thousand Lakes]] 20th Anniversary shows where their 1994 album would be preformed in its entirety.   [[Tales from the Thousand Lakes]] 20th Anniversary shows included [[Wacken Open Air|Wacken Open Air 2014]], [[Maryland Deathfest|Maryland Deathfest 2014]], and 6 tour dates through central Europe.<ref>http://amorphis.net</ref>

The '''palatine bone''' ({{IPAc-en|?|p|æ|l|?|t|a?|n}}<ref>''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989.</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/palatine Entry "palatine"] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.</ref>) is a [[bone]] in many species of the animal kingdom, commonly termed the [[palatum]] (Latin ''palatum''; unrelated to ''palatium'' 'palace', from which other senses of [[palatine]] derive).

== Structure==
The palatine bones are paired bones of the skull that are situated at the back part of the [[nasal cavity]] between the [[maxilla]] and the pterygoid process of the [[Sphenoid bone|sphenoid]]. 

It contributes to the walls of three cavities: the floor and lateral wall of the nasal cavity, the roof of the mouth, and the floor of the orbit; it enters into the formation of two fossæ, the [[Pterygopalatine fossa|pterygopalatine]] and [[pterygoid fossa|pterygoid]] fossæ; and one fissure, the [[inferior orbital fissure]]. 

The palatine bone somewhat resembles the letter L, and consists of a [[Horizontal plate of palatine bone|horizontal plate]] and a [[Perpendicular plate of palatine bone|perpendicular plate]] and three outstanding processes—viz., the [[Pyramidal process of palatine bone|pyramidal process]], which is directed backward and lateral from the junction of the two parts, and the [[Orbital process of palatine bone|orbital]] and [[Sphenoidal process of palatine bone|sphenoidal processes]], which surmount the vertical part, and are separated by a deep notch, the sphenopalatine notch. The two plates form the posterior part of the hard palate and the floor of the nasal cavity; anteriorly, they join with the maxillae. The two horizontal plates articulate with each other at the posterior part of the median palatine suture and more anteriorly with the maxillae at the transverse palatine suture.<ref name=":0" /> 

The human palatine articulates with six bones: the [[Sphenoid bone|sphenoid]], [[ethmoid]], [[maxilla]], [[inferior nasal concha]], [[vomer]] and opposite palatine.

There are two important foramina in the palatine bones that transmit nerves and blood vessels to this region: the greater and lesser palatine). The larger greater palatine foramen is located in the posterolateral region of each of the palatine bones, usually at the apex of the maxillary third molar. The greater palatine foramen transmits the greater palatine nerve and blood vessels. A smaller opening nearby, the lesser palatine foramen, transmits the lesser palatine nerve and blood vessels to the soft palate and tonsils. Both foramina are openings of the pterygopalatine canal that carries the descending palatine nerves and blood vessels from the pterygopalatine fossa to the palate.<ref name=":0" />

==Function==
The sphenopalatine foramen is the opening between the sphenoid bone and orbital processes of the palatine bone; it opens into the nasal cavity and gives passage to branches from the pterygopalatine ganglion and the sphenopalatine artery from the maxillary artery.<ref name=":0">Illustrated Anatomy of the Head and Neck, Fehrenbach and Herring, Elsevier, 2012, page 55</ref>

==Other animals==
In [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]] the palatine bone consists of the perpendicular plate only, lying on the inner edge of the maxilla. The lower surface of the bone may bear several teeth, forming a second row behind those of the maxilla; in many cases, these are actually larger than the maxillary teeth. Although a similar pattern was present in primitive [[tetrapod]]s, the palatine bone is reduced in most living [[amphibian]]s, forming, in [[frog]]s and [[salamander]]s, only a narrow bar between the vomer and maxilla.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 220–243|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

Early fossil [[reptile]]s retained the arrangement seen in more primitive vertebrates, but in [[mammal]]s, the lower surface of the palatine became folded over during evolution, forming the horizontal plate, and meeting in the midline of the mouth. This forms the rear of the [[hard palate]], separating the oral and nasal cavities, and making it easier to breathe while eating. A [[parallel evolution|parallel]] development has occurred to varying degrees in many living reptiles, reaching its greatest extent in [[crocodilian]]s. In [[bird]]s, the palatine bones remain separate, long the sides of the rear part of the upper jaw, and typically have a mobile articulation with the [[cranium]].<ref name=VB/>

There are numerous variations amongst mammals, amphibians and other species. For example, the palatine bone in many amphibians such as the [[Rough-skinned Newt]] manifests as a distinct V-shaped structure.<ref>C. Michael Hogan (2008) ''Rough-skinned Newt (Taricha granulosa)'', Globaltwitcher, ed. N. Stromberg [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=43182]</ref> In the case of cat species, the horizontal and a vertical elements join at a forty five degree angle.<ref>Jacob Reighard and Herbert Spencer Jennings, ''Anatomy of the Cat''</ref>

Covering an area of {{convert|41556|km2|sqmi|adj=on}}, Gippsland lies to the east of the eastern suburbs of [[Melbourne|Greater Melbourne]], to the north of [[Bass Strait]], to the west of the [[Tasman Sea]], to the south of the [[Black-Allan Line]] that marks part of the Victorian/[[New South Wales]] border, and to the east and southeast of the [[Great Dividing Range]] that lies within the [[Hume (region)|Hume]] region and the [[Victorian Alps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rdv.vic.gov.au/victorian-regions/gippsland|title=Victoria's Gippsland Region|work=Regional Development Victoria|publisher=State Government of Victoria|date=3 June 2014|accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref> The region is best known for its primary production such as mining, power generation and farming as well as its tourist destinations&mdash; [[Phillip Island (Victoria)|Phillip Island]], [[Wilsons Promontory]], the [[Gippsland Lakes]], [[Walhalla, Victoria|Walhalla]], the [[Mount Baw Baw|Baw Baw Plateau]], and the [[Strzelecki Ranges]].

As at the [[Census in Australia#2011|2011 Australian census]], the Gippsland region had a population of {{formatnum:255718}}, that is generally broken down into the [[East Gippsland]], [[South Gippsland]], [[West Gippsland]], and the [[Latrobe Valley]] statistical divisions. The principal centres of the region, in descending order of population, are {{VICcity|Traralgon}}, {{VICcity|Moe}}, {{VICcity|Morwell}}, {{VICcity|Sale}}, {{VICcity|Drouin}}, {{VICcity|Warragul}}, [[Bairnsdale]], {{VICcity|Leongatha}}, and [[Phillip Island]].

==History==
The area was originally inhabited by [[Indigenous Australian]]s of the [[Gunai people|Gunai]] nation and parts of the [[Bunurong]] nation. Following European settlement, Samuel Anderson,<ref>The Andersons of Westernport "Horton and Morris"</ref> a Scottish immigrant and explorer, who had arrived in [[Hobart, Tasmania]] in 1830, established the third permanent settlement in Victoria at [[Bass, Victoria|Bass]] in Gippsland in 1835. His business partner Robert Massie joined him in 1837. Both had worked for the [[Van Diemen's Land Company]] at Circular Head Tasmania. Samuel's brothers Hugh and Thomas arrived at Bass shortly after. [[Seal hunting|Sealers]] and [[acacia|wattle]] bark gatherers had frequented the area earlier but had not settled.

Further European settlement began following two separate expeditions to the area.  [[Angus McMillan]] led the first European expedition through the area between 1839 and 1840, naming the area "Caledonia Australis".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020159b.htm|title=McMillan, Angus (1810-1865)|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, [[Australian National University]]|author=Webster, Theo|year=1967|accessdate=6 October 2007 }}</ref>  This was followed in March 1840 by Polish explorer [[Pawe? Edmund Strzelecki]], who unknowingly led his expedition across the same terrain already traversed by McMillan, and gave his own names to many natural landmarks and places.  Following these expeditions, the area was officially given the title of "Gippsland", a name chosen by Strzelecki in honour of the [[Governor of New South Wales|New South Wales Governor]], [[George Gipps]], his sponsor.<ref>Wells, J. (2003), "Colourful Tales of Old Gippsland", p. 92.</ref>

==Geography==
{{stack|{{Regions of Gippsland}}}}
[[Image:East Gippsland old growth 01 Pengo.jpg|thumb|upright|Old growth forests in [[East Gippsland]]]]
Gippsland is traditionally subdivided into four or five main sub{{endash}}regions or districts:
*[[West Gippsland]] (roughly equivalent to the Shires of Cardinia and Baw Baw)
*[[South Gippsland]] (Bass Coast and South Gippsland Shires)
*the [[Latrobe Valley]] (Latrobe City and areas of Baw Baw to the north)
*[[East Gippsland]] (Shires of Wellington and East Gippsland).
*Sometimes a fifth region, [[Central Gippsland]] (corresponding approximately to the Shire of Wellington), is added to refer to the drier zone between the [[Gippsland Lakes]] and [[Yarram]].

==Climate==
{{Refimprove|section|date=December 2007}}
[[File:VM 0267 Stratford - Avon River valley.jpg|thumb|On the [[Avon River (Gippsland, Victoria)|Avon River]] near [[Stratford, Victoria|Stratford]]]]
The climate of Gippsland is temperate and generally humid, except in the central region around [[Sale, Victoria|Sale]], where annual rainfall can be less than {{convert|600|mm|in}}. In the [[Strzelecki Ranges]] annual rainfall can be as high as {{convert|1500|mm|in}}, while on the high mountains of East Gippsland it probably reaches similar levels – much of it falling as [[snow]]. In lower levels east of the [[Snowy River]], mean annual rainfall is typically about {{convert|900|–|950|mm|in}} and less variable than in the coastal districts of New South Wales. Mean maximum temperatures in lower areas range from {{convert|24|°C|°F}} in January to {{convert|15|°C|°F}} in July. In the highlands of the [[Mount Baw Baw|Baw Baw Plateau]] and the remote [[Errinundra National Park|Errinundra Plateau]], temperatures range from a maximum of {{convert|18|°C|°F}} to a minimum of {{Convert|8|°C|°F}}. However, in winter, mean minima in these areas can be as low as {{convert|-4|°C|°F}}, leading to heavy snowfalls that often isolate the Errinundra Plateau between June and October.

[[Image:Potato field through fence - Thorpdale.JPG|thumb|Potato farming in the [[Thorpdale, Victoria|Thorpdale]] region]]
The soils in Gippsland are generally very infertile, being heavily deficient in [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]] and [[calcium]]. Apart from frequently [[flood]]ed areas, they are classed as [[Spodosols]], [[Psamment]]s and [[Ultisols]]. Consequently, heavy fertilisation is required for agriculture or pastoral development, but with this parts of Gippsland have become highly productive dairying and vegetable-growing regions: the region supplies Melbourne with most of its needs in these commodities. A few alluvial soils (chiefly near the Snowy) have much better native fertility, and these have always been intensively cultivated. In the extreme northeast is a small section of the [[Monaro Tableland]] used for grazing [[cattle|beef cattle]].

Gippsland possesses very few deposits of [[metal]]lic [[mineral]]s ([[gold]] rushes in the nineteenth century around [[Foster, Victoria|Foster]], [[Buchan, Victoria|Buchan]] petered out quickly). However, the deep underground gold mines operated at Walhalla for a fifty year period between 1863-1913. Gippsland has no deposits of major industrial nonmetallic minerals, but it does feature the world's largest [[brown coal]] deposits and, around Sale and offshore in the [[Bass Strait]], some of the largest deposits of [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] in Australia.

Like the rest of Australia, the seas around Gippsland are of very low productivity as there is no [[upwelling]] due to the warm currents in the [[Tasman Sea]]. Nonetheless, towns such as [[Marlo, Victoria|Marlo]] and [[Mallacoota]] depended for a long time on the fishing of [[abalone]], whose [[shell (animal)|shells]] could fetch very high prices because of their use for [[pearl]]s and pearl inlays.

'''Xhafer [[Bey|Bej]] Ypi''' ({{IPA-sq|?d?af?? ?b?j ?ypi}}; 1880, [[Starje]] - December 1940), a [[Bektashi]] [[Muslim]], was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[politician]]. 

Ypi's parents were Asilan (a landowner) and Zavalani.

He was educated at a university in [[Istanbul]]. 

In 1920-1921 he was [[Political minister|Minister]] of Internal Affairs and Minister of Justice. He also held the position of Minister of Public Instruction.  

As the leader of the Popular Party, in late December 1921 he formed a government where [[Fan S. Noli]] was the Minister of Foreign Affairs and [[Zog of Albania|Ahmed Zogu]] was the Minister of Internal Affairs. Until December 4, 1922, Ypi was Prime Minister, in 1922 after Noli's resignation he was also acting Minister of Foreign Affairs.

From December 2, 1922, to January 31, 1925, Ypi was a member of the High Council (the collegial Head of State, formally for [[William of Wied]]). In June 1924 he left Albania because of Noli's revolt, but he kept holding the post formally.

During Zog's Kingdom, Ypi was Chief Inspector of the Royal Court.

When the [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italian occupation]] began, Ypi saluted the Italians who had "liberated" Albania "from the heavy slavery of the sanguinary Zogu". After King Zog had fled, from April 9 to April 12 Ypi was Chairman and Plenipotentiary for Justice of the Provisional Administration Committee, and as such acting head of state. From April 12, he was the Minister of Justice in [[Shefqet Verlaci]]'s government. He was killed by an aerial bomb.

Of his encounters with the [[Bunurong people]], Wetherall told [[Ralph Darling|Darling]]:

The only reservation Wetherall had was on the Island's supply of water; he dug a 'tide-well' near the fort but assessed the source as 'not in sufficient quantities for the supply of shipping' and this problem would lead to the eventual move to [[Corinella|Settlement Point]] on the mainland coast.<ref name="wetherall"/><ref name="weathreports">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2187376 |title=Classified Advertising. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser|The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser (NSW : 1803 - 1842)]] |location=NSW |date=13 January 1827 |accessdate=19 September 2013 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> During the third voyage of [[HMS Beagle]], in 1839, water was 'found by digging in the centre of a clump of bushes on the outer part of the point at the N.E. extremity of the island, which at high water became an island, ''[and]'' occasionally made the water brackish' although it was noted 'better might have been found a short distance in shore, as there were abundance of shrubs and other indications of water in the neighbourhood'.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2547195 |title=Ship News. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser|The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser (NSW : 1803 - 1842)]] |location=NSW |date=16 March 1839 |accessdate=19 September 2013 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The water question was again addressed, by Captain Moore, who accompanied Surveyor [[Robert Hoddle]] in 1840, that 'water can be obtained on Phillip Island, near the best anchorage, off Sandy Point.'<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12861040 |title=PORT PHILLIP. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald|The Sydney Herald (NSW : 1831 - 1842)]] |location=NSW |date=27 January 1840 |accessdate=19 September 2013 |page=2 Supplement: Supplement to the Sydney Herald |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

==Environment==

===Wildlife===
[[File:The coast of Philip Island.jpg|thumb|left|The coast of Philip Island]]
The southern and western coasts of the island lie within the [[Phillip Island Important Bird Area]], so identified by [[BirdLife International]] because of its importance in supporting significant populations of Fairy Penguins, [[Short-tailed Shearwater]]s and [[Pacific Gull]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Phillip Island |accessdate=2011-09-17 |work= Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= }}</ref> In addition, there is a wildlife park where wallabies and kangaroos roam freely amongst the visitors and can be fed by hand.  Seal Rocks, at the western end of the island, hosts the largest colony of [[fur seal]]s in Australia (up to 16,000).<ref name="sealpop">[http://www.interislandferries.com.au/pi_about.php Inter Island Ferries] About Phillip Island</ref> In recent years, other than local population of critically endangered endemic [[Burrunan Dolphin]]s or migratory [[Killer Whale]]s, [[Southern Right Whale]]s and [[Humpback Whale]]s are starting to show recoveries in the area<ref>Phillip Island Winery. 2010.

===Climate===
Phillip Island experiences milder weather than [[Melbourne]] and is tempered by ocean breezes. The mean daily maximum temperature for February is 24.7°C (76.5°F), while for July it is 13.4°C (56.1°F). The mean annual rainfall is 782.3 millimetres (30.8&nbsp;in), with June being the wettest month (88.1&nbsp;mm/3.5 in). The prevailing wind for most of the year is a south-westerly which blows in off Bass Strait.

On 10 August 2005, snow was observed on the island.<ref name="aug05snow">[http://www.bom.gov.au/announcements/media_releases/vic/20050810.shtml Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology] Snow in Victoria</ref> This was a very unusual event.

==Tourism==
Phillip Island is a [[tourist destination]] visited by 3.5 million people annually.<ref name="theagegeodata" /> The Penguin Parade at [[Phillip Island Nature Park]], in which [[Little Penguin]]s come ashore in groups, attracts visitors from all over the world. They come to see one of the few areas where this species of penguin can be seen.

The island is recognised as having some of the most consistently reliable and varied surf conditions in the country. The island has hosted various surf events in the past, such as the [[Rip Curl]] Pro in 2005 and the Roxy Pro Women's Surfing Festival.

Other events include the Churchill Island Working Horse and Pioneer Festival.

===Motorsport===
[[Image:Phillip island grand prix circuit pano.jpg|thumb|right|Overview of the [[Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit]]]]
Phillip Island is steeped in the history of Australian motor racing. A circuit composed of the island's interior roads was used for the original [[Australian Grand Prix]] in [[1928 Australian Grand Prix|1928]] and continued to be used for the race up until [[1935 Australian Grand Prix|1935]]. In 1952 the Phillip Island Auto Racing Club was formed.  They commenced construction on the [[Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit]] which opened in 1956. In [[1960 Armstrong 500|1960]] the original [[Armstrong 500]] was held, although with the bridge to the mainland unable to support heavy hotmix bitumen equipment the track broke after the third running of the race in [[1962 Armstrong 500|1962]]. In [[1963 Armstrong 500|1963]] the race relocated to the [[Mount Panorama Circuit]] and over time evolved into the race known today as the [[Bathurst 1000]].

The circuit closed in the late 1970s but was redeveloped and re-opened in 1989 to host the first international version of the [[Australian motorcycle Grand Prix]]. It continues to host the race today and is also a venue for the [[Superbike World Championship]], [[V8 Supercars]] and the [[Australian Drivers' Championship]].

The '''frontal bone''' or '' '''os frontis''' ''is a [[bone]] in the [[human skull]]. The name comes from the Latin word ''frons'' (meaning "[[forehead]]").  The bone resembles a [[Cockle (bivalve)|cockleshell]] in form, and consists of three portions:<ref name="Gray's">''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'' (1918). (See infobox)</ref>

* a large vertical portion, the [[squama frontalis]], corresponding with the region of the [[forehead]].
* an orbital or horizontal portion, the [[pars orbitalis]], which enters into the formation of the roofs of the [[orbital cavity|orbital]] and [[nasal cavity|nasal cavities]].
* a nasal portion, it articulates with the nasal bones and the [[frontal process of maxilla|frontal process of the maxilla]] to form the root of the [[nose]].

==Structure==
===Borders===
The border of the squama frontalis is thick, strongly serrated, bevelled at the expense of the inner table above, where it rests upon the parietal bones, and at the expense of the outer table on either side, where it receives the lateral pressure of those bones; this border is continued below into a triangular, rough surface, which articulates with the great wing of the [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]]. The posterior borders of the orbital plates are thin and serrated, and articulate with the small wings of the sphenoid.

 File:SchaedelSeitlichSutur9.png|[[Frontomaxillary suture]] separates frontal bone and [[maxilla]].
</gallery>

===Development===
The frontal bone is presumed to be derived from [[neural crest cell]]s.<ref>Kirby, ML; Waldo, KL. ''Circulation'' (1990) 82:332-340.</ref>

[[File:Gray136.png|thumb|300px|Figure 3: Frontal bone at birth]] 
The [[frontal bone]] is '''[[ossified]]''' in membrane from two primary centers, one for each half, which appear toward the end of the second month of [[fetal]] life, one above each [[supraorbital margin]]. From each of these centers, ossification extends upward to form the corresponding half of the [[squama frontalis|squama]], and backward to form the orbital plate. The spine is ossified from a pair of secondary centers, on either side of the middle line; similar centers appear in the nasal part and zygomatic processes.

At birth the bone consists of two pieces, separated by the [[frontal suture]], which is usually obliterated, except at its lower part, by the eighth year, but occasionally persists throughout life. It is generally maintained that the development of the [[frontal sinuses]] begins at the end of the first or beginning of the second year, but may begin at birth. The sinuses are of considerable size by the seventh or eighth year, but do not attain their full proportions until after [[puberty]].

==In other animals==
In most vertebrates, the frontal bone is paired, rather than presenting the single, fused structure found in humans (see [[frontal suture]]). It typically lies on the upper part of the head, between the eyes, but in many non-[[mammal]]ian animals it does not form part of the orbital cavity. Instead, in [[reptile]]s, [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]] and [[amphibian]]s it is often separated from the orbits by one or two additional bones not found in mammals. These bones, the [[prefrontal bone|prefrontals]] and [[postfrontal]]s, together form the upper margin of the eye sockets, and lie to either side of the frontal bones.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 226–241|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

===In dinosaurs===
The frontal bone is one of the principal paired mid-line bones in dinosaur skulls.  This bone is part of the skull roof, which is a set of bones that cover the brain, eyes and nostrils.  The frontal makes contact with several other bones in the skull.  The anterior part of the bone articulates with the nasal bone and the [[Prefrontal bone#In dinosaurs|prefrontal]] bone.  The posterior part of the bone articulates with the postorbital bone and the parietal bone.  This bone defines all of part of the upper margin of the orbit.

The '''Flag of South Korea''', or '''Taegukgi''' (sometimes also romanized as ''Taegeukgi'') is the national flag for the [[Republic of Korea]]. It has three parts: a white background, a red and blue [[Taeguk]], which is a red and blue [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] [[Yinyang|yin- and yang-symbol]] in the center, and four black [[I Ching trigram|trigrams]], which are selected from the [[bagua|original eight]], on each corner of the [[flag]].

== Design ==
The [[white]] background is a traditional [[Culture of Korea|Korea]]n color. It represents [[peace]] and [[wikt:purity|purity]]. The circle in the middle is derived from the philosophy of [[yin and yang]] and represents the balance of the [[universe]]. The [[blue]] section represents the negative cosmic forces, and the [[red]] section represents the opposing positive cosmic forces. The [[Bagua|trigram]]s together represent the principle of movement and harmony. Each trigram (hangul: kwae) represents one of the four [[classical element]]s.<ref name="CIA Taegukgi">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ks.html |title= The World Factbook |publisher= Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate= November 4, 2013}}</ref>

The lack of the [[national flag]] only became an issue in 1876, in the [[Joseon]] Dynasty. Before 1876, a [[national flag]] did not exist and it was not considered important. The issue began during the negotiations for the [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1876]]. Although the [[delegate]] of the [[Empire of Japan]] had the [[flag of Japan|Japanese national flag]], [[Joseon]] Dynasty could not hang a corresponding flag. Thus, there were some proposals to create a flag, but the issue was considered unimportant by the government. At 1880, the proliferation of foreign negotiations led to a need for the [[national flag]].<ref name="Doopedia Taegukgi">{{cite web|url= http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&MAS_IDX=101013000722400#MGROUP_101220000156376| title= ????[Republic of Korea,????] |publisher= Doosan Corporation| accessdate= November 5, 2013| language=Korean}}</ref> The most major proposal was described in the ‘Korea Strategy’ papers written by the Chinese delegate [[Huang Zunxian]]. The proposal was to incorporate the [[Flag of the Qing Dynasty]] for the [[Joseon]] Dynasty. In response to the proposal, the government sent the delegate of Lee Young-Sook to explore the possibility of the issue through the politician [[Li Hongzhang]]. [[Li Hongzhang]] agreed with some parts of the proposal, but proposed that some other factors should be differed. The [[Qing Dynasty]] agreed with Hongzhang, but it is unknown how far the Joseon government explored this proposal.<ref name="EncyKorea Taegukgi">{{cite web|url= http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0058892| title= ???| publisher=[[Academy of Korean Studies]] |accessdate= November 5, 2013| language=Korean| trans_title= Taegukgi}}</ref>

The issue was then shelved, and reemerged with the ratification of the [[United States-Korea Treaty of 1882]]. The controversy arose after the delegate Lee Eung-Jun presented a flag similar to the [[flag of Japan]] to the Chinese official [[Ma Jianzhong]]. In response to the discussion, [[Ma Jianzhong]] argued against the proposed idea of using the [[Flag of the Qing Dynasty]] and proposed a flag with a white background, with a half-red and half-black circle in the center, with eight black bars around the flag.<ref name="EncyKorea Taegukgi" /> On August 22, 1882, [[Park Yeong-hyo]] created a [[scale model]] of the Taegukgi to the Joseon government.

'''Warragul''' is a town in Victoria, Australia, {{convert|104|km|mi|0}} east-southeast of [[Melbourne]]. As at the 2011 census, the town had a population of 14,074 people.<ref name="ABS">{{Census 2011 AUS|id=SSC21426|name=Warragul (State Suburb)|accessdate=2014-08-15|quick=on}}</ref> Warragul lies between the [[Strzelecki Ranges]] to the south and the [[Mount Baw Baw]] Plateau of the Great Dividing Range to the north. The town is named after an [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] word meaning "wild dog".<ref>The Age (2004), [http://www.theage.com.au/news/victoria/warragul/2005/02/17/1108500207564.html Warragul, Victoria], ''The Age'', 8 February 2004, viewed 4 May 2007.</ref>

Warragul is the main population and service centre of the [[Gippsland#West Gippsland|West Gippsland]] region and the [[Shire of Baw Baw]]. The surrounding area is noted for [[dairy farming]] and other niche [[agriculture]] and has long been producing gourmet foods.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=June 2007}}
Warragul was settled after the construction of the [[Traralgon V/Line rail service|Traralgon railway line]] in 1877, the Post Office opening on 16 March 1877.<ref name = "a">{{Citation
  | last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&country= | accessdate = 2008-04-11 }}</ref>

Existing roads were renamed [[Princes Highway]] after the visit to Australia in 1920 of the then Prince of Wales (the future King [[Edward VIII]]).  The highway was officially opened on 10 August 1920 at a ceremony in Warragul.

Warragul's [[Petersville]] Milk Products Factory in Queen Street supplied the famous [[Peters Ice Cream]] brand's factory in [[Mulgrave, Victoria|Mulgrave]] with all the dairy raw material (fresh cream and concentrated skim milk) for 35 years. The plant also manufactured skim milk powder under the famous Dutch Jug brand and butter under the Iceberg brand. It exported butter, butter oil and milk powders to Southeast Asia and the Middle East.

==Geography==
Warragul (along with [[Drouin, Victoria|Drouin]]), is located on a lobe of hills that extend north from the [[Strzelecki Ranges]] near [[Ellinbank, Victoria|Ellinbank]], joining the foothills of the [[Baw Baw National Park|Baw Baws]] in the Neerim District. This range is historically referred to as the Warragul Hills. The range effectively separates the flatlands of the Koo Wee Rup swamp (starting near [[Longwarry, Victoria|Longwarry]]) in the west and the Moe Swamp on the eastern side (starting near [[Darnum, Victoria|Darnum]]).

Warragul contains the Linear Park Arts Discovery Trail, a trail covering several adjacent parks in the town. It features painted bollards, mosaics and murals.<ref>http://www.bawbawshire.vic.gov.au/files/0818929c-adef-4634-a83e-9fcf0100b5a8/Warragul_Linear_Park_Arts_Discovery_Trail.pdf</ref> The trail joins up with the [[Drouin to Warragul Trail|Drouin to Warragul Two Towns Trail]].

==Events==
Warragul is the major township closest to Lardner, the home of the [[Gippsland]] Field Days. Three major events are held at Lardner Park each year - the Farm World agricultural show, Trucks In Action and the Harvest of Gippsland. The Farm World agricultural show is a major drawcard for the Warragul area. Every year in late March, Warragul plays host to these Field Days at Lardner Park. The Field Days are Australia's premier mixed farming Field Days and they include one of Australia's most diverse ranges of beef cattle, dairying and horticulture exhibits.

Warragul is also home to the annual [[Warragul Show]], which is held on the first Friday of March each year. It is traditionally a farming and livestock show, but includes rides, stalls, games, fireworks and showbags. It is held at the Warragul showgrounds.

==Education==
For a town of its size, Warragul has a large education industry with four primary schools, three secondary schools and two tertiary institutions.

'''OpenDX''' stands for '''Open Data Explorer''' and is [[IBM]]'s [[Scientific visualization|scientific data visualization]] [[software]]. <!-- OpenDX is a [[visualization (graphic)|visualization]] program for complex [[data]]. Complex meaning more than one [[dimension]]. --> It can handle complex domains (such as a mechanical [[gear]] or a human [[brain]]) along with [[measurement|measured]] or [[computer simulation|computed]] data. The data may be [[Scalar field|scalar]] (such as the concentration of a chemical agent in the brain), [[vector field|vector]] or [[tensor field|tensor]] fields (like the displacement or [[strain tensor]] fields when the gear is in action) at different points of the object. The points at which data is measured don't have to be equally spaced, and not need to be homogeneously spaced.  The project started in 1991 as ''Visualization Data Explorer''.

<!--
Many [[Computer program|programs]] make nice [[information graphic|graphs]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] like <math>y=f(x)</math>, or represent discrete points data <math>(x_i,y_i)</math> as a curve. [[OpenDx]] is oriented to more complex data is more complex data as a set of surface heights as a function of positions <math>z=f(x,y)</math> or arrays like <math>(x_i,y_i,z_i)</math>. -->

''OpenDX'' can produce 3D images with the quantities plotted as color or gray-scale coded, or as [[vector graphics|vectors]], [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]] and ribbons. It allows the object to be sliced to obtain a view of the internal structure, and then represent the data on this slice plane as a height-coded graph. It can rotate the object to provide a view of the data from any angle, and allows [[Computer animation|animations]] of this motion to be made.

== Graphical User Interface ==

''OpenDX'' is based on the [[Motif (software)|Motif]] widget toolkit on top of the [[X Window System]]. Its [[graphical user interface]] has a wide variety of [[InterActor|interactors]], both direct and indirect. Direct interactors allow the user to directly manipulate images (e.g. [[rotate]] or [[Page zooming|zoom]]). Indirect interactors ([[Rotary dial|dials]], [[Switch statement|switches]], [[Button (computing)|buttons]], sliders) enable the user to control various aspects of her visualization. Interactors are ''smarter'' because they are data-driven. Interactors are auto-ranging and self-limiting. They examine the data and, depending on its type, will determine the [[minimum]] and [[maximum]] of the data, or create a list for an option [[menu (computing)|menu]] based on the data. The user can even set the label of the interactor based on some aspect of the data (e.g., [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]]).

[[File:opendx-screenshot.jpg|frame|none|OpenDX screen shot showing the Visual Program Editor and several interactors]]

The data-driven concept is not simply for sliders, dials and option menus. It also applies to vector interactors. These will reconfigure themselves based on the dimensionality of the data. They will also auto-range themselves based on the maximum and minimum of each vector component.

== Design ==

Data Explorer is a system of tools and user interfaces for visualizing data. In general terms the visualization of data can be considered a 3-stage process:

* Describing and importing data
* Processing the data through a visualization program
* Presenting the resulting image.

The principal components of '''OpenDX''' are

; Data model:  This is the  set of definitions, rules, and conventions used to describe Data Explorer entities (including data fields, geometrical objects, and images).

; Data Prompter: A user interface for describing data to be imported into Data Explorer.

; Data Browser: A user interface for viewing a data file, determining the layout and organization of the data it contains, and transferring this information to the Data Prompter.

; Scripting Language: A high-level language for creating visualization programs. It can also be used directly in a command mode to perform various tasks. Visual programs—i.e., the visualization programs displayed in the Visual Program Editor window as ''networks'' of module icons—are also written in the scripting language. A visual program constructed in this window by the user is translated into the same language when it is saved to disk.

; Visual Program Editor (VPE): A graphical user interface for creating and modifying visual programs (networks). Programs created with this editor are translated into the scripting language by Data Explorer and are stored in that form.

; Modules: The ''building blocks'' (visualization ''tools'') that constitute a visual program network. They can be directly accessed and manipulated in the ''Visual Program Editor''.

; Module Builder: A user interface for creating customized modules to be used in visual programs.

; Image Window: An interactive window for viewing and modifying the presentation of the image produced by a visual program.

; Control Panels: A user interface for changing the parameter values used by a visual program.

== Screen shots ==

=== Visualization of a scalar field ===

[[File:opendx-screenshot2.jpg|frame|none|OpenDX screen-shot showing visualization of a scalar field.]]

In this example we show the visualization of the flow of a particulated material (dust) inside a building. In this case the quantity visualized is a scalar, namely the concentration of the particles. The concentration of particles at each point in space is represented using colors. The reader can deduce the concentration by comparing the colors with the ''colorbar'' at the right upper corner of the image. To improve the visualization the drawing is shadowed as if it had an elevation in the direction normal to the plane proportional to the concentration. In '''OpenDX''' this is called the ''rubber-sheet'' effect.

=== Visualization of vector fields ===

{|

|- 
| [[File:opendx-cubcav3.jpg|300px]] 
| [[File:opendx-cubcav4.jpg|300px]] 
|}

[[Vector fields]] are harder to visualize than scalar ones. Consider in this case
the flow in a cubic cavity (the 3D version of the well studied
[http://www.mathematik.uni-dortmund.de/~featflow/album/dc.html square cavity] benchmark. The use of [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]] helps in realizing the direction of the flow. The ''rockets'' (the big red arrows on the top of the cavity) represent the imposed flow.

<!--
To be short, OpenDX is one of the best visualisation programs out there, and it is free ! Twenty years ago, when IBM made the program, there were big computer centers on campuses and research centers who could afford to buy the product for a lot of money. Then PCs became available and powerful, capable of running such a heavy program ; IBM on the other judged probably that the cost of maintenance of the program was higher than the revenue from it, and decided to opensource it. 
The program was made by engineers for engineers, so it will seem a little heavy at the beginning. If however, you have complex data on a regular basis, it is definitively a good choice.

The '''Family Research Council''' ('''FRC''') is an American [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] group and lobbying organization formed in the United States in 1981 by [[James Dobson]]. It was incorporated in 1983.<ref name="FRCHistory">{{cite news|title=About FRC: History/Mission|newspaper=Family Research Council |date=2010-05-08 |url=http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?c=HISTORY_ABOUT 1|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070204154035/http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?c=HISTORY_ABOUT|archivedate=2007-02-04}}</ref> In the late 1980s, the FRC officially became a division of Dobson's main organization, [[Focus on the Family]], but after an administrative separation, the FRC became an independent entity in 1992. [[Tony Perkins (politician)|Tony Perkins]] is the current president.

The FRC promotes what it considers to be traditional [[family values]], by advocating and lobbying for [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] policies. It opposes and lobbies against [[LGBT rights]] (such as [[same-sex marriage]] and [[LGBT adoption]]), [[abortion]], [[divorce]], [[Stem cell controversy|embryonic stem-cell research]] and [[pornography]]. The FRC is affiliated with a [[501(c)|501(c)(4)]] lobbying [[Political action committee|PAC]] known as FRC Action.<ref>{{cite book|title=The interest group connection: electioneering, lobbying, and policymaking in Washington|year=2005|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=978-1-56802-922-1|page=410|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=m7LuAAAAMAAJ&q=%22frc+action%22&dq=%22frc+action%22|author=Paul S. Herrnson|author2=Ronald G. Shaiko |author3=Clyde Wilcox |accessdate=November 28, 2010}}</ref> In 2010, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) classified the FRC as an anti-gay [[hate group]], a designation which generated controversy. In 2012, a security guard working at the FRC headquarters was shot by a man who saw the organization listed on the SPLC's web site.

==History==
The Family Research Council was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 1983. [[James Dobson]], [[Armand Nicholi|Armand Nicholi, Jr.]] of [[Harvard University]], and [[George Rekers]] of the [[University of South Carolina]] were some of its founding board members.<ref name="FRCHistory"/> In 1988, following financial difficulties, the FRC was incorporated into [[Focus on the Family]], and [[Gary Bauer]] joined the organization as president.<ref name='cyc'>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of American religion and politics|year=2003|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-4582-2|page=512|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=frt7RDOT1PUC&pg=PA45&dq=%22family+research+council%22#v=onepage&q=%22family%20research%20council%22&f=false|author= Paul A.

It was announced June 18, 2013, that Josh Duggar of the television show ''[[19 Kids and Counting]]'' will serve as the [[executive director]] of FRC Action, the non-profit and tax-exempt legislative action arm of Family Research Council.<ref>{{cite web|title=Josh Duggar snags Family Research Council job in Washington, D.C. |url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Blog/2013/06/18/Josh-Duggar-snags-Family-Research-Council-job-in-Washington-DC/8331371603038/|publisher=UPI|accessdate=June 19, 2013}}</ref>

==Politics, policies and positions==
The Family Research Council opposes efforts to make a [[vaccine]] for [[human papilloma virus]] (HPV), a [[virus]] that causes [[cervical cancer]], mandatory for school attendance. It defends this on the basis of [[parental rights|rights of parents]] and because of its support for abstinence prior to marriage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clarification of 2005 Family Research Council Media Remarks on HPV Vaccine|url=http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=LH07B02|publisher=Family Research Council|accessdate=November 28, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070701172602/http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=LH07B02|archivedate=July 1, 2007}}</ref>

It supports a federal [[Conscience clause (medical)|conscience clause]], allowing medical workers to refuse to provide certain treatments to their patients, such as abortion, [[blood transfusion]] or [[birth control]]. It also advocates for [[abstinence-only sex education]], [[intelligent design]] and prayer in public schools, and the regulation of pornography and other "[[Obscenity|obscene]], [[indecency|indecent]], or [[Profanity|profane]] programming" on [[broadcast television|broadcast]]  and [[cable television|cable]] [[television]]. It opposed, but failed to defeat, the introduction of a [[.xxx]] [[domain name]], and it lobbied for an increase in indecency fines from the [[Federal Communications Commission]].

The FRC also holds that hotel pornography may be prosecutable under federal and state obscenity laws.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brynaert|first=Ron|title=Coalition of conservative groups believe hotel porn may be prosecutable|accessdate=November 28, 2010|newspaper=Raw Story|date=August 22, 2006|archivedate=October 15, 2007|url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/Coalition_of_conservative_groups_believe_hotel_0822.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071015151352/http://rawstory.com/news/2006/Coalition_of_conservative_groups_believe_hotel_0822.html}}</ref><ref name=Crary>{{cite news|last=Crary|first=David|title=Ad crusade targets hotel porn movies - Conservatives want feds to pull the plug|accessdate=August 19, 2012|newspaper=The Journal Gazette|date=August 23, 2006|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> It opposes the expansion of [[Civil and political rights|civil rights laws]] to include [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] as illegal bases for  [[discrimination]].<ref name="FRC.civ.rights">{{cite web|url=http://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF07K01.pdf|title=Homosexuality Is Not a Civil Right|publisher=Family Research Council}}</ref>

Permanently eliminating the [[marriage penalty]] and [[estate taxes]] are also issues FRC supports.<ref>[http://www.frc.org/onepagers/model-legislation-divorce-reform-for-families-with-children Model Legislation: Divorce Reform for Families With Children]</ref>

The Family Research Council opposes legalized abortion, [[stem-cell research]] which involves the destruction of human embryos  and funding thereof (instead advocating research using [[adult stem cells]]), legal recognition of same-sex [[domestic partnership]]s in the form of [[Same-sex marriage|marriage]] or [[Civil unions in the United States|civil unions]], and all forms of [[gambling]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Leonard|first=Andrew|title=Life, liberty and the right to play online poker|url=http://www.salon.com/technology/how_the_world_works/2007/11/15/online_internet_gambling|accessdate=November 29, 2010|newspaper=[[Salon.com|Salon]]|date=November 15, 2007}}</ref> The Family Research Council has questioned the idea that humans are mainly or completely responsible for [[climate change]], and has opposed other [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]] who have affirmed their belief in global warming.<ref>{{cite news|title=One-Size Politics Doesn't Fit All|newspaper=Christianity Today|date=April 27, 2007|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/may/10.22.html|accessdate=10 May 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Climate Change: An Evangelical Call to Action|url=http://christiansandclimate.org/statement/|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Global  warming gap among evangelicals widens|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2007-03-14/politics/evangelical.rift_1_global-warming-evangelicals-cizik?_s=PM:POLITICS|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 15, 2012|date=March 14, 2007}}</ref><ref name=Szobody group=http://www.greenvilleonline.com/article/20120718/NEWS/307180020/Young-conservatives-seek-fixes-climate-change?odyssey=mod|newswell|text|Politics|p>{{cite news|last=Szobody|first=Ben|title=Young conservatives seek fixes for climate change|accessdate=August 16, 2012|newspaper=Greenville Online|date=July 18, 2012}}</ref>

===Statements on homosexuality===
According to the Family Research Council, "homosexual conduct is harmful to the persons who engage in it and to society at large, and can never  be affirmed" and it is "by definition unnatural, and as such is associated with negative physical and  psychological health effects."<ref name=FRCwebsite>{{cite web|url=http://www.frc.org/human-sexuality#homosexuality|year=2012|publisher=Family Research Council|title=Human Sexuality Research Area|accessdate=December 27, 2012}}</ref> The Council also asserts that "there is no convincing evidence that a homosexual identity is ever something genetic or inborn".<ref name=FRCwebsite/> An [[amicus curiae|amicus brief]] was submitted by the Council jointly with [[Focus on the Family]] in the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Lawrence v.

In February 2010, the Family Research Council's Senior Researcher for Policy Studies, [[Peter Sprigg]], stated on NBC's ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]'' that gay behavior should be outlawed and that "criminal sanctions against homosexual behavior" should be enforced.<ref>"CHRIS MATTHEWS: Do you think we should outlaw gay behavior?
:PETER SPRIGG: Well, I think certainly-
:MATTHEWS: I’m just asking you, should we outlaw gay behavior?
:SPRIGG: I think that the Supreme Court decision in Lawrence v. Texas, which overturned the sodomy laws in this country, was wrongly decided. I think there would be a place for criminal sanctions against homosexual behavior.
:MATTHEWS: So we should outlaw gay behavior.

===Same-sex marriage cases===
Family Research Council on January 28, 2013 issued an amicus brief in support of [[Proposition 8]] case and [[Defense of Marriage Act|DOMA]] case before the Supreme Court arguing for the court to uphold DOMA banning federal recognition of same-sex unions and Proposition 8 banning gay marriage in California.<ref>http://www.frc.org/legalbrief/amicus-brief-hollingsworth-v-perry</ref><ref>http://www.frc.org/legalbrief/amicus-brief-us-v-windsor</ref>{{Better source|reason=Reliable secondary source is needed.|date=June 2013}}

==Publishing and lobbying activities==
In ''Funding the Culture Wars'', the [[National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy]] lists the Family Research Council as one of the leading organizations funding the activities of the [[conservatism|conservative movement]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Funding the Culture Wars: Philanthropy, Church and State|date=February 2005|publisher=National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy}}</ref> As a [[non-profit organization]], FRC is completely dependent on donations from supporters. FRC publishes frequent e-mail updates, usually in the form of short articles, which can also be viewed on their website. These articles typically take the form of advocacy for a conservative Christian perspective on current political and social issues.

Family Research Council is a member of [[ProtectMarriage.com]], a coalition formed to sponsor California [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] to restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples only, which passed in 2008 (but was [[Perry v. Schwarzenegger|struck down as unconstitutional by a federal court in California]], with the ruling stayed as the case is appealed).<ref>{{cite news |title=Coalition seeks male-female marriage definition/New ballot push for constitutional amendment|first=John M.|last=Hubbell|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=April 28, 2005|page=B3}}</ref>

===Justice Sunday===
{{main|Justice Sunday (conservative Christian event)}}
[[Justice Sunday (conservative Christian event)|Justice Sunday]] was the name for three religious conferences organized by the  FRC and [[Focus on the Family]] in 2005 and 2006. According to FRC, the purpose of the events was to "request an end to filibusters of judicial nominees that were based, at least in part, on the nominees' religious views or imputed inability to decide cases on the basis of the law regardless of their beliefs."<ref>[http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=PV05H01 Justice Sunday II: A Special Note From Executive Vice President of FRC, Chuck Donovan]</ref>

===Values Voter Summit===
{{Main|Values Voter Summit}}
Every fall, FRC Action (the political action group affiliated with FRC) holds an annual [[summit (meeting)|summit]] composed for conservative Christian activists and evangelical voters in [[Washington, D.C.]] In the past, the summit has been a place for social conservatives across the nation to hear Republican presidential hopefuls' platforms, and via a straw poll since 2007 also  a means of providing an early prediction of which candidate will win the endorsement of Christian conservatives.<ref>Michelle Vu, "[http://www.christianpost.com/article/20071020/29775_Presidential_Hopefuls_Highlight_'Values'_to_Christian_Conservatives.htm Presidential Hopefuls Highlight 'Values' to Christian Conservatives]", ''The Christian Post'', October 20, 2007</ref>

===Ugandan Resolution===
In 2010, the FRC paid $25,000 to congressional lobbyists for what they described as "Res.1064 Ugandan Resolution Pro-homosexual promotion" in a lobbying disclosure report.<ref name=disclosure>{{cite web|last=Tripodi|first=Paul|title=Lobbying Report|url=http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/pdfform.aspx?id=300256072|work=Lobbying Disclosure|publisher=US House of Representatives|accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref> The  [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] resolution condemned the [[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill]],<ref name=HR1064>{{cite web|title=H.Res.1064|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-hr1064/text|publisher=OpenCongress|accessdate=August 16, 2012|author=US House of Representatives|date=February 3, 2010|quote=Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the "Anti-Homosexuality Bill, 2009" under consideration by the Parliament of Uganda, that would impose long term imprisonment and the death penalty for certain acts, threatens the protection of fundamental human rights, and for other purposes.}}</ref> a bill which, among other things, would have imposed either the death penalty or life imprisonment for sexual relations between persons of the same sex.<ref>http://nationalpress.typepad.com/files/bill-no-18-anti-homosexuality-bill-2009.pdf</ref><ref name=Weigel>{{cite web|last=Weigel|first=David|title=Family Research Council explains: It lobbied for changes to Uganda resolution|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-now/2010/06/family_research_council_explai.html|work=Right Now|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=August 16, 2012|date=June 4, 2010}}</ref><ref name=McEwan>{{cite web|last=McEwan|first=Alvin|title=Family Research Council evades regarding Ugandan anti-gay bill lobbying efforts|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alvin-mcewen/family-research-council-e_b_602594.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=August 16, 2012|date=June 7, 2010}}</ref><ref name=Melloy>{{cite web|last=Melloy|first=Kilian|title=FRC Opposes U.S. Resolution Against Ugandan ’Kill Gays’ Law|url=http://www.edgeboston.com/index.php?ch=news&sc=&sc2=news&sc3=&id=106538|work=News|publisher=Edge - Boston, MA|accessdate=August 16, 2012|date=June 4, 2010}}</ref>

Following exposure of the lobbying contribution in June 2010, the FRC issued a statement denying that they were trying to kill the bill, but rather that they wanted to change the language of the bill "to remove sweeping and inaccurate assertions that homosexual conduct is internationally recognized as a fundamental human right." They further stated, "FRC does not support the Uganda bill, and does not support the death penalty for homosexuality - nor any other penalty which would have the effect of inhibiting compassionate pastoral, psychological, and medical care and treatment for those who experience same-sex attractions or who engage in homosexual conduct".<ref name=Montopoli>{{cite web|last=Montopoli|first=Brian|title=Family Research Council Lobbied Congress on Resolution Denouncing Ugandan Anti-Gay Bill|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20006856-503544.html|work=Political Hotsheet|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=August 16, 2012|date=June 4, 2010}}</ref> The Ugandan Resolution is being revived by Uganda's President Museveni in 2012.

==Listing as a hate group by SPLC==
The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] designated the FRC as a hate group in the Winter 2010 issue of its magazine, ''Intelligence Report''. Aside from statements made earlier in the year by Sprigg and Perkins (see [[Family Research Council#Statements on homosexuality|Statements on homosexuality]]), the SPLC described the FRC as a “font of anti-gay propaganda throughout its history”.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dutton|first=Nick|title=Shooting sparks controversy over 'hate' designation for conservative group|url=http://wtvr.com/2012/08/18/shooting-sparks-controversy-over-hate-designation-for-conservative-group|accessdate=August 18, 2012|newspaper=wtvr.com|date=August 18, 2012}}</ref><ref name=splcreport>{{cite web|title=18 Anti-Gay Groups and Their Propaganda|url=http://splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2010/winter/the-hard-liners|publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center|SPLC]]|accessdate=November 28, 2010|author=Evelyn Schlatter}}</ref> As evidence, the SPLC cited a 1999 publication by the FRC, ''Homosexual Activists Work to Normalize Sex With Boys'', which claimed: “one of the primary goals of the homosexual rights movement is to abolish all age of consent laws and to eventually recognize pedophiles as the ‘prophets’ of a new sexual order.”<ref name=splcreport/><ref>{{cite news|last=Ariosto|first=David|title=SPLC draws conservative ire|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/17/us/us-southern-poverty-law-center-profile/index.html|date=August 17, 2012|newspaper=CNN|accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref> The report said FRC senior research fellows Tim Dailey and Peter Sprigg (2001) had "pushed false accusations linking gay men to pedophilia".<ref name=SPLCdesignation>{{cite news|last=Lengell|first=Sean|title=Family Research Council labeled a ‘hate group’|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/nov/24/frc-labeled-a-hate-group|accessdate=August 19, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=splcreport/>

FRC President Tony Perkins called the “hate” designation a political attack on the FRC by a "liberal organization".<ref name="WaPo hate">{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Krissah|title='Hate group' designation angers same-sex marriage opponents|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/24/AR2010112405573.html|accessdate=November 25, 2010|newspaper=Washington Post|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref> On December 15, 2010 the FRC ran an open letter advertisement in two Washington, D.C. newspapers disputing the SPLC's action; in a press release, the FRC called the allegation "intolerance pure and simple" and said it was dedicated to upholding "Judeo-Christian moral views, including marriage as the union of a man and a woman."'<ref>{{cite web|title=FRC, Members of Congress, Governors, and Conservative Leaders Release Open Letter Calling for Civil Debate, End to Character Assassination|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/frc-members-of-congress-governors-and-conservative-leaders-release-open-letter-calling-for-civil-debate-end-to-character-assassination-111917234.html|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=August 17, 2012|date=December 15, 2010}}</ref> A section of the letter supporting the FRC and certain other organizations designated as hate groups by the SPLC had signers which included twenty members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (including then soon-to-be Speaker [[John Boehner]]), three [[U.S. Senate|U.S. Senators]], four state Governors, and one state Attorney General.<ref name="DailyCaller">{{cite news|url=http://dailycaller.com/2010/12/15/family-research-council-top-gop-lawmakers-fight-back-against-splc-hate-group-label|title=Family ResearchCouncil, top GOP lawmakers fight back against SPLC ‘hate group’ label|work=[[The Daily Caller]]|date=2010-12-15|first=Matthew|last=Boyle|accessdate=2010-12-24}}</ref><ref name=FRCAd>{{cite web|url=http://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF10L12.pdf|title=Start Debating, Stop Hating|publisher=Family Research Council|date=December 15, 2010|accessdate=December 24, 2010}}</ref> In response, [[Mark Potok]] (SPLC spokesman) emphasized the factual evidence upon which the SPLC had taken the step of making the designation.<ref name="splc_dec_2010">[http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2010/12/15/splc-responds-to-attack-by-frc-conservative-republicans "SPLC Responds to Attack by FRC, Conservative Republicans"], December 5, 2010</ref>

A shooting incident outside the FRC headquarters in 2012 (see below) prompted further comments on the SPLC's 'hate group'  listing. [[Dana Milbank]], columnist for the ''[[Washington Post]]'', referred to the incident as "a madman’s act" for which the SPLC should not be blamed, but called its classication of the FRC as a hate group "reckless" and said that "it's absurd to put  the group, as the law center does, in the same category as [[Aryan Nations]], [[Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]], [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] and the [[Westboro Baptist Church]]."<ref>http://www.advocate.com/crime/2012/08/17/washington-post-columnists-continue-blaming-hate-group-classification-frc-shooting</ref> [[Tufts University]] political science professor Jeffrey Berry described himself as "not comfortable" with the designation: "There's probably some things that have been said by one or two individuals that qualify as hate speech.

[[File:US Army spike strip.jpg|thumb|right|A [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] soldier deploying a spike strip at a vehicle checkpoint in [[Iraq]]]]
A '''spike strip''' (also known as '''traffic spikes''', '''tire shredders''', '''[[one-way traffic]] treadles''', '''stingers''', '''stop sticks''', a '''stinger''' in police slang, and formally known as a '''tire deflation device''') is a device used to impede or stop the movement of wheeled vehicles by puncturing their [[tire]]s. Generally, the strip is composed of a collection of 35 to 75&nbsp;mm (1.5 to 3 inches) long metal [[wikt:barb|barb]]s, teeth or spikes pointing upward. The barbs are designed to puncture and flatten tires when a vehicle is driven over them. The barbs may be hollow or solid. Hollow barbs are designed to become embedded in the tires and allow air to escape at a steady pace in an attempt to reduce the risk of the driver crashing into oncoming traffic or the surroundings. It was co-invented by Donald Kilgrow, a retired [[Utah Highway Patrol]] trooper, along with a design engineer.<ref>{{cite news|first= Jonathan|last=Beard|title=Technology: Spikes end chases with a hiss not a bang|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13117833.700-technology-spikes-end-chases-with-a-hiss-not-a-bang.html|newspaper=New scientist|publisher= |date=24 August 1991|issue=1783|accessdate=27 September 2009}}</ref>

In the United States, five officers were killed deploying spike strips in 2011 alone.

Remotely deployable spike strips have been invented to reduce the danger to police officers deploying them.<ref>http://www.dynaspike.com/</ref> Spike strips are also built into some parking barriers to control traffic flow.

Homemade spike strips, cheaply constructed using a [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|steel pipe]] and [[Nail (fastener)|household nails]], were banned in [[New South Wales]] in 2003 after being used against a police vehicle. [[John Watkins (Australian politician)|John Watkins]], a member of New South Wales Legislative Assembly, stated they would be added to the New South Wales prohibited weapons list.<ref name=banned>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/09/1070732212520.html?from=storyrhs Ban on home-made road spikes after car chase], The Sydney Morning Herald, December 10, 2003</ref>

The '''parietal bones''' {{IPAc-en|p|@|'|r|ai|i-|t|@|l}} are bones in the [[human]] [[Human skull|skull]] which, when joined together, form the sides and roof of the [[Human skull|cranium]]. Each bone is roughly quadrilateral in form, and has two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. It is named from the Latin ''paries'' (''-ietis''), wall.

== Surfaces ==
===External===
The external surface [Fig. 1] is convex, smooth, and marked near the center by an eminence, the [[parietal eminence]] (''tuber parietale''), which indicates the point where [[ossification]] commenced. 

Crossing the middle of the bone in an arched direction are two curved lines, the superior and inferior temporal lines; the former gives attachment to the temporal fascia, and the latter indicates the upper limit of the muscular origin of the [[temporalis]]. 

Above these lines the bone is covered by the [[galea aponeurotica]] (epicranial aponeurosis); below them it forms part of the temporal fossa, and affords attachment to the temporalis muscle. 

At the back part and close to the upper or sagittal border is the parietal foramen, which transmits a vein to the [[superior sagittal sinus]], and sometimes a small branch of the [[occipital artery]]; it is not constantly present, and its size varies considerably.

===Internal===
The internal surface [Fig. 2] is concave; it presents depressions corresponding to the cerebral convolutions, and numerous furrows (grooves) for the ramifications of the [[middle meningeal artery]]; the latter run upward and backward from the sphenoidal angle, and from the central and posterior part of the squamous border. 

Along the upper margin is a shallow groove, which, together with that on the opposite parietal, forms a channel, the [[sagittal sulcus]], for the [[superior sagittal sinus]]; the edges of the sulcus afford attachment to the [[falx cerebri]]. 

Near the groove are several depressions, best marked in the skulls of old persons, for the [[arachnoid granulations]] (Pacchionian bodies). 

In the groove is the internal opening of the parietal foramen when that aperture exists.

}}

== Borders ==
* The '''sagittal border''', the longest and thickest, is dentated (has toothlike projections) and articulates with its fellow of the opposite side, forming the [[sagittal suture]]. 

* The '''frontal border''' is deeply serrated, and bevelled at the expense of the outer surface above and of the inner below; it articulates with the [[frontal bone]], forming half of the [[coronal suture]]. The point where the coronal suture intersects with the sagittal suture forms a T-shape and is called the '''bregma'''.

* The '''squamous border''' is divided into three parts: of these:
** the ''anterior'' is thin and pointed, bevelled at the expense of the outer surface, and overlapped by the tip of the great wing of the sphenoid; 
** the ''middle portion'' is arched, bevelled at the expense of the outer surface, and overlapped by the squama of the temporal; 
** the ''posterior part'' is thick and serrated for articulation with the [[mastoid]] portion of the [[temporal bone|temporal]]. 

* The '''occipital border''', deeply denticulated (finely toothed), articulates with the [[occipital bone]], forming half of the [[lambdoid suture]]. That point where the sagittal suture intersects the lambdoid suture is called the '''[[lambda]]''', because of its resemblance to the Greek letter.

}}

== Angles ==
* The '''frontal angle''' is practically a right angle, and corresponds with the point of meeting of the sagittal and coronal sutures; this point is named the [[bregma]]; in the fetal skull and for about a year and a half after birth this region is membranous, and is called the [[anterior fontanelle]]. 

* The '''sphenoidal angle''', thin and acute, is received into the interval between the frontal bone and the great wing of the sphenoid. Its inner surface is marked by a deep groove, sometimes a canal, for the anterior divisions of the [[middle meningeal artery]]. 

* The '''occipital angle''' is rounded and corresponds with the point of meeting of the sagittal and lambdoidal sutures—a point which is termed the lambda; in the fetus this part of the skull is membranous, and is called the [[posterior fontanelle]]. 

* The '''mastoid angle''' is truncated; it articulates with the occipital bone and with the mastoid portion of the temporal, and presents on its inner surface a broad, shallow groove which lodges part of the transverse sinus. The point of meeting of this angle with the occipital and the mastoid part of the temporal is named the [[Asterion (anatomy)|asterion]].

== Ossification ==
The parietal bone is ossified in membrane from a single center, which appears at the parietal eminence about the eighth week of fetal life. 

Ossification gradually extends in a radial manner from the center toward the margins of the bone; the angles are consequently the parts last formed, and it is here that the fontanelles exist. 

Occasionally the parietal bone is divided into two parts, upper and lower, by an antero-posterior suture.

==In other animals==
In non-human vertebrates, the parietal bones typically form the rear or central part of the [[skull roof]], lying behind the frontal bones. In many non-mammalian [[tetrapod]]s, they are bordered to the rear by a pair of '''postparietal''' bones that may be solely in the roof of the skull, or slope downwards to contribute to the back of the skull, depending on the species. In the living [[tuatara]], and many fossil species, a small opening, the ''parietal foramen'', lies between the two parietal bones. This opening is the location of a [[Parietal eye|third eye]] in the midline of the skull, which is much smaller than the two main eyes.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 217–244|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

===In dinosaurs===
The parietal bone is usually present in the posterior end of the skull and is near the midline.  This bone is part of the skull roof, which is a set of bones that cover the brain, eyes and nostrils. The parietal bones make contact with several other bones in the skull.  The anterior part of the bone articulates with the [[frontal bone#In dinosaurs|frontal]] bone and the [[postorbital bone]].  The posterior part of the bone articulates with the [[Squamosal bone|squamosal]] bone, and less commonly the [[Occipital bone#In other animals|supraoccipital]] bone.  The bone-supported neck frills of ceratopsians were formed by extensions of the parietal bone.  These frills, which overhang the neck and extend past the rest of the skull is a diagnostic trait of ceratopsians.  The recognizable skull domes present in pachycephalosaurs were formed by the fusion of the frontal and parietal bones and the addition of thick deposits of bone to that unit.<ref>Martin, A.J. (2006).

'''Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark''' (11 September 1656 – 26 July 1693) was the [[Queen consort of Sweden]] as the spouse of King [[Charles XI of Sweden]].

The name ''Ulrike'' is a [[Danish language|Danish]] version of the name; in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] she is called ''Ulrika Eleonora den äldre'' (English: ''Ulrica Eleanor the Elder''), to distinguish her from her daughter, the future queen regnant.

==Life==

===Early life and marriage===
[[File:Ulrikaeleonoradanmarknorge.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Ulrika as princess of Denmark portrayed by [[Pierre Signac]]]]Ulrika was the daughter of King [[Frederick III of Denmark]] and his spouse Queen [[Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg]]. In 1675 she was betrothed to King [[Charles XI of Sweden]]. During the [[Scanian War]] between Denmark and Sweden in 1675–1679 she was encouraged to break the engagement: her brother the King broke it for her in 1676, but she herself continued to regard herself engaged. She was considered as a possible bride by the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]], but she refused a different match. During the war, she gained a reputation for loyalty to her future home country by exhibiting kindness to Swedish prisoners: she pawned her jewelry, even her engagement ring, to care for the Swedish prisoners of war. During the peace negotiations between Sweden and Denmark in 1679, the marriage between her and Charles XI was on the agenda, and ratified in 26 September 1679. The marriage contract was signed 6 February 1680, and when the Swedish representative [[Johan Göransson Gyllenstierna]] returned to Sweden, he brought her with him.

Ulrika Eleonora was popular in Denmark because of her charity, and when she left for Sweden, she thanked them with the words: "Thank you! By my heart I thank you! May I ever be remembered in Denmark with the same tenderness, and may God give me the grace to live such, that I by the separation can be followed by the love of my subjects!" <ref>Nanna Lundh-Eriksson (1947). ''Hedvig Eleonora.'' Stockholm: Wahlström & Widstrand. ISBN (Swedish)</ref>

===Life as queen===
[[File:Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden Ehrenstrahl 1686.jpg|thumb|250px||thumb|Ulrike Eleonora by [[David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl]] 1686]]
Ulrika Eleonora arrived to [[Helsingborg]] in Sweden 4 May 1680, and two days later, she married Charles in [[Skottorp]] Manor on 6 May 1680. The wedding was quite humble and hasty took place among but a small circle of courtiers, as the monarch was afraid of the great costs and wanted to avoid the presence of the French ambassador. The 25 November 1680, she was crowned Queen at [[Storkyrkan]] in Stockholm.

Initially, Charles XI was disappointed in her appearance, and asked Johan Gyllenstierna if he could not have been chosen a more beautiful consort, upon which he was given the reply: "Your Majesty will see, that within her there is an angel".<ref>Nanna Lundh-Eriksson (1947). ''Hedvig Eleonora.'' Stockholm: Wahlström & Widstrand. ISBN (Swedish)</ref>   Ulrika Eleonora was described as religious, patient, mild and charitable, moderately beautiful and with a simple dignity. She was received with enthusiasm among the public, because she was seen as a hope of lasting peace, and her popularity soon became personal because of her own qualities. She also impressed with her courage, when the boat upon which she was taken to Stockholm after her arrival to Sweden hit a rock and almost sunk. On this occasion, she calmed the panic by saying: "Be still, do not cry out so! If we shall die, it will be the will of God, and Gods will be done!" <ref>Nanna Lundh-Eriksson (1947). ''Hedvig Eleonora.'' Stockholm: Wahlström & Widstrand. ISBN (Swedish)</ref>

At the royal court, Ulrika Eleonora was placed in the shadow of her mother-in-law. Though her marriage are described as happy, Charles XI continued to always place his mother before his wife. It is noted that he always paid his respect to his mother first and his wife second. Above all, he was forever under the strong influence of his mother, [[Hedvig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp]], who never surrendered the position of queen to her daughter-in-law. While lingering distrust between Denmark and Sweden caused by the [[Scanian War]] remained, Hedvig Eleonora and the government of Sweden were never receptive to the son's idea to marry a Danish princess. The King always referred to Ulrika Eleonora as "My Wife" and to his mother as "The Queen". This created some tension between her and her mother-in-law, but there was never an open conflict. Mindful of this, the foreign ambassadors, always visited Hedwig Eleonora first, and then Ulrika Eleonora, when paying their respects to the royal family. Her consort was never unfaithful to her. After her death, he told his mother that he had not been happy since his wife died.

Her frail health and her many pregnancies often prevented her from participating in festivities and ceremonies, and she spent most of her time attending to her children and to charitable activities. Her private family life with her spouse and children were on the other hand said to be happy. She also enjoined the visits of her brother-in-law and sister [[Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp|the duke]] [[Princess Frederica Amalia of Denmark|and duchess]] of [[Holstein-Gottorp]]. At the summer residence [[Karlberg Palace]], she enjoyed a happy family life away from the court and developed an interest in painting. She was also interested in theater and dance and performed plays with the ladies at court. Among the nobles participating in her amateur performances were the famous [[Aurora Königsmarck]] with her sister [[Amalia Wilhelmina Königsmarck]]. Among her noted ladies-in-waitings were the sister-couple De la Gardie: the singer [[Ebba Maria De la Gardie|Ebba Maria]] and the poet [[Johanna Eleonora De la Gardie|Johanna Eleonora]], as well as [[Anna Maria Clodt]].

Ulrika Eleonora had no political influence over her spouse, who preferred to discuss the affairs of state with his mother rather than her. She once tried to exercise some political influence over Charles XI. During "The Great Reversion" to the crown of [[counties]], [[baronies]] and large [[lordship]]s from the nobility (most of them richly given away by [[Christina of Sweden|Queen Christina]]), she tried to speak on the behalf of the people whose property was confiscated by the crown. But the king simply told her that the reason he had married her was not because he wanted her political advice. Instead, she helped people whose property had been confiscated by secretly compensating them economically from her own budget. Charles XI:s confidence for her grew over time: in 1690, he named her future Regent, should his son succeed him being still a minor.

Ulrika Eleonora is most known for her great activity within charity. She founded a large number of charitable institutions. Her charitable work were administered by her Danish lady-in-waiting [[Anna Marschalk]], and she is known to occasionally have pawned her own possessions to finance her charity projects. Her best known projects were the [[tapestry]] school at Karlberg Palace in 1680, were poor girls were educated to tapestry manufacturing by three unmarried Finnish noblewomen; an orphanage at Karlberg; the Drottninghuset (The Queen's House), a home for poor widows in Stockholm founded in 1686, and a poor house at Kungsholmen. She supported a large number of people by regular allowances from her personal budget, such as invalid soldiers and their spouses and converts to Protestantism from Judaism, Islam and Catholicism, especially female converts: in 1693, 17.000 people were supported by her.

===Death===
[[File:UlrikaElDr1680Riddarh.jpg|thumb|230px|Ulrica Eleanor's coffin in [[Riddarholmen Church|Riddarholm Chrúrch]].]]

In 1690, weakened by childbirths, Ulrika Eleonora was affected by a non-diagnosed illness, which was deemed to be mortal and often confined her to weeks in bed from this point on. The doctors recommended her to travel to the hot baths in Germany, and monies were set aside for her, but she stated that she was as much in God's hand in Germany as in Sweden, and used the money for her charity instead. She died 26 July 1693, after having spent the winter of 1692-93 in bed. Upon her death bed, she asked her children not to be haughty but to consider their high position as a way of helping others; to avoid flattery and pride, never to listen to gossip and, should they hear it, call upon the slandered party, listen to their explanation and regard it to be the truth. She asked her spouse to show mercy to the victims of the reduction, to give her a simple funeral and to give the money set aside for it to the poor. At her death, Countess De la Gardie remarked: "I do not believe any royal to have been so mourned as Her Majesty. Here there are unanimous crying and wimping, and everyone dresses in mourning, so that in the entire city, there are no more black cloth to be bought".<ref>Nanna Lundh-Eriksson (1947). ''Hedvig Eleonora.'' Stockholm: Wahlström & Widstrand. ISBN (Swedish)</ref>     Ulrika Eleonora has in history been given a saintly reputation, exemplified by the words of Frans Ferdiand Carlson: "Seldom has a more lovable creature been placed upon a throne. She thought of everyone but herself".<ref>Nanna Lundh-Eriksson (1947). ''Hedvig Eleonora.'' Stockholm: Wahlström & Widstrand. ISBN (Swedish)</ref>

There is a well known old legend associated with her death. The legend states that while the queen lay dying at [[Karlberg Palace]], her favorite lady-in-waiting and Mistress of the Robes, Countess Maria Elisabeth Stenbock, lay sick in [[Stockholm]]. On the night the queen had died, Countess Stenbock visited Karlberg and was admitted alone to the room containing the remains of the queen. The officer in charge looked into the key hole and saw the countess and the queen speaking at the window of the room. He was so shocked by the sight that he started coughing blood. The countess, as well as the carriage she had arrived with, was gone the next moment. When the matter was investigated, it was made clear that the countess had been in bed, gravely ill that day and not left town. The officer died of the shock he received from the sight, and the countess died weeks later. The king gave the order that the affair was not to be mentioned further.<ref>Afzelius, Arvid August.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2010}}

In [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], and [[political science]] the '''common good''' or '''[[Commonwealth|common weal]]''' is a specific "[[Goodness and value theory|good]]" that is shared and beneficial for all or most members of a given [[community]]. 

The good that is common between person A and person B may not be the same as between person A and person C. Thus the common good can often change, although there are some things — such as the basic requirements for staying alive: food, water, and shelter — that are always good for all people.

==Other definitions==
===Utilitarianism===
The common good has sometimes been seen as a [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ideal, thus representing "the greatest possible good for the greatest possible number of individuals". The "greatest possible number of individuals" would mean ''all'' human beings. This definition of the common good presents it as a quality which is convertible, or reducible, to the sum total of all the private interests of the individual members of a [[society]] and interchangeable with them. But this is a narrow, and many would argue impoverished, view of what the common good might encompass, like the ubuntu allowed philosophy.

===Social===
Another definition of the common good, as the quintessential goal of [[State (polity)|the state]], requires an admission of the individual's basic right in society, which is, namely, the right of everyone to the opportunity to freely shape his life by responsible action, in pursuit of [[virtue]] and in accordance with the [[moral law]]. The common good, then, is the sum total of the conditions of social life which enable people the more easily and straightforwardly to do so. The object of State sovereignty is the free choice of means for creating these conditions. Others, in particular [[John Rawls]], make the distinction between the Good, that is actively creating a better world however that may be defined, and the [[justice|Just]], which creates a fair, [[Liberalism|liberal]] social infrastructure that allows the pursuit of virtue, but does not prescribe what the common good actually is.

Some assert that promoting the common good is the goal of [[democracy]] (in the sphere of [[political science|politics]]) and [[socialism]] (in the sphere of [[economics]]). One of such philosophers of modern days is Michael Sandel of Harvard University.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sandel|first=Michael|title=Justice (online course)|url=http://www.justiceharvard.org/}}</ref>

== Catholic social teaching ==
One of the earliest references in Christian literature to the concept of the common good is found in the ''[[Epistle of Barnabas]]'': "Do not live entirely isolated, having retreated into yourselves, as if you were already [fully] justified, but gather instead to seek together the common good."<ref>''[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/barnabas.html Epistle of Barnabas]'', 4, 10.</ref>

The concept is strongly present in [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''magnum opus''  ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]''.  Book XIX of this, the main locus of Augustine's normative political thought, is focused on the question, 'Is the good life social?' In other words, 'Is human wellbeing found in the good of the whole society, the common good?'  Chapters 5-17 of Book XIX address this question.  Augustine's emphatic answer is yes (see start of chap. 5).

Augustine's understanding was taken up and, under the influence of [[Aristotle]], developed by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Aquinas's conception of the common good became standard in Roman Catholic moral theology.

Against that background, the common good became a central concept in the modern tradition of [[Catholic social teaching]], beginning with the foundational document, ''[[Rerum Novarum]]'', a [[papal encyclical]] by [[Pope Leo XIII]], issued in 1891.  This addressed the crisis of the conditions of industrial workers in Europe and argued for a position different from both [[laissez-faire capitalism]] and [[socialism]].  In this letter, Pope Leo guarantees the right to [[private property]] while insisting on the role of the state to require a [[living wage]].

Contemporary Catholic social teaching on the common good is summarised in the 2004 ''Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church'', chapter 4, part II.<ref>Pontifical Council of Justice and Peace, [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/justpeace/documents/rc_pc_justpeace_doc_20060526_compendio-dott-soc_en.html Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church] (2004), Chapter 4, part II</ref>  Quoting the [[Second Vatican Council]] document, ''[[Gaudium et Spes]]'' (1965), this says, "According to its primary and broadly accepted sense, ''the common good'' indicates 'the sum total of social conditions which allow people, either as groups or as individuals, to reach their fulfilment more fully and more easily'" (#164, quoting ''Gaudium et Spes'', #26; italics original).

The ''Compendium'' later gives statements that communicate what can be seen as a partly different sense of the concept - as not only "social conditions" that enable persons to reach fulfilment, but as the ''end'' of ''goal'' of human life. "''[T]he common good [is] the good of all people and of the whole person…  The human person cannot find fulfilment in himself, that is, apart from the fact that he exists “with” others and “for” others''" (#165; italics original).  "The goal of life in society is in fact the historically attainable common good" (#168).

The Roman Catholic [[International Theological Commission]] drew attention to these two partly different understandings of the common good in its 2009 publication, ''In Search of a Universal Ethic: A New Look at the Natural Law''.  It referred to them as "two levels" of the common good.<ref>International Theological Commission, ''[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20090520_legge-naturale_en.html ''In Search of a Universal Ethic: A New Look at the Natural Law]'' (2009), #85</ref>

Another relevant document is ''[[Veritatis Splendor]]'', a papal encyclical by [[Pope John Paul II]], issued in 1993 to combat the relaxation of moral norms and the [[political corruption]] (see Paragraph 98) that affects millions of persons.  In this letter, Pope John Paul describes the characteristics and virtues that political [[leadership]] should require, which are [[truthfullness]], honesty, fairness, [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and [[solidarity]] (as described in paragraph 98 to 100), given that truth extends from honesty, good faith, and sincerity in general, to agreement with fact or reality in particular.

==Contemporary American usage==
As regards contemporary American politics, the language of the common good (sometimes referred to as "public wealth") is increasingly being adopted by political actors of the [[progressivism|progressive]] left to describe their values.  Jonathan Dolhenty argues that one should distinguish between the common good, which may "be shared wholly by each individual in the family without its becoming a private good for any individual family member", and the collective good, which, "though possessed by all as a group, is not really participated in by the members of a group. It is actually divided up into several private goods when apportioned to the different individual members."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalacademy.com/commongood.htm |title=Radical Academy|publisher=Radicalacademy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref> First described by [[Michael Tomasky]] in ''[[The American Prospect]]'' magazine<ref>[http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&name=ViewWeb&articleId=11424 ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> and John Halpin at the [[Center for American Progress]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2006/06/b1728259.html |title=Reclaiming the Common Good &#124; Center for American Progress |publisher=Americanprogress.org |date=2006-06-05 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref> the political understanding of the common good has grown. The Take Back America Conference, the liberal magazine ''[[The Nation]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060717/kvh |title=July 17, 2006 |publisher=The Nation |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref> and the [[Rockridge Institute]]<ref>[http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/thinkingpoints] {{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> have identified the common good as a salient political message for progressive candidates.<ref>[http://straighttalk.ourfuture.org/Straight-Talk-2006.pdf ]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> More recently, the common good rhetoric is being used by political actors in an explicitly religious context, such as [[Kansans for Faithful Citizenship]]. In addition, non-partisan advocacy groups like [[Common Good]], are also championing reform efforts to support the common good.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commongood-forum.org |title=Common Good Forum |publisher=Commongood-forum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref>

'''Marcus Aemilius Scaurus''' (born ca. 163 BC &ndash; died 89 BC) was a [[Roman consul]] in 115 BC and considered one of the most talented and influential politicians of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]].

Scaurus was born in a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] family, although impoverished. In order to maintain the family lifestyle, his father became a coal-dealer. However, Scaurus himself declined any commercial activities (forbidden for [[Roman senate|senators]]) and embarked on a political life.

Scaurus’ ''[[cursus honorum]]'' started when he became a [[tribune#Tribune of the soldiers|military tribune]] in the Hispania provinces. Then he became [[aedile|curule aedile]] in charge of the public games, and afterwards [[praetor]] in 120 BC. In the same year he was nominated ''[[princeps senatus]]'' and confirmed by the Senate, an office which he held until his death. He was elected [[consul]] in 115 BC with [[Marcus Caecilius Metellus II|Marcus Caecilius Metellus]] as his junior colleague.  

During the run-up to the [[Jugurthine War]] the historian [[Sallust]] wrote of the extensive bribery of [[Jugurtha]] in his attempts to persuade the Senate not to intervene on his brother's behalf. In describing the profligacy he commented on Scaurus' character: "A few, on the other hand, to whom right and justice were more precious than riches, recommended that aid be given to Adherbal and that the death of Hiempsal be severely punished. Conspicuous among these was Aemilius Scaurus, a noble full of energy, a partisan, greedy for power, fame, and riches, but clever in concealing his faults. As soon as this man saw the king's bribery, so notorious and so brazen, fearing the usual result in such cases, namely, that such gross corruption would arouse popular resentment, he curbed his habitual cupidity." (''Bellum Jugurthinum'', I. 15)

As leader of the [[Roman senate]] he was often sent abroad to settle disputes amongst foreign kings. In 109 BC, he was elected [[Censor (ancient Rome)|censor]] in partnership with [[Marcus Livius Drusus (censor)|Marcus Livius Drusus]], who died in the next year putting an end to the censorship. As censor, he ordered the construction of the ''[[Via Aemilia Scaura]]'' and restored several bridges. In 104 BC, he became responsible for [[Rome's grain supply]]. This was a very important office, given only to the most trustworthy persons, because the happiness of the population (and absence of mutinies) depended on it. Scaurus was throughout his political career the leader of the aristocratic conservative faction of the senate. 

His second wife was [[Caecilia Metella Dalmatica]] who was later the third wife of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]. From this marriage, he had two children: 
*[[Aemilia Scaura]], second wife of [[Pompey]]
*[[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (praetor 56 BC)]]

'''Kathryn ("Kathy") Ann Watt''' (born 11 September 1964) is an [[Australia]]n [[racing cyclist]] who won two medals at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona, Spain (gold in the road race, and silver in the pursuit).<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20091112025053/http://corporate.olympics.com.au/athlete/6775/Kathy+Watt Kathy Watt Cycling – Road Cycling – Track].

Retrieved on 2012-08-02.</ref>
She has won 24 national championships in road racing, track racing, and mountain bike, four [[Commonwealth Games]] gold medals, and came third in the world time trial championship. She was made a life member of [http://www.bbn.org.au Blackburn Cycling Club] in 1990. She was an [[Australian Institute of Sport]] scholarship holder.<ref>[http://www.ausport.gov.au/ais/history/achievements/olympics AIS Athletes at the Olympics]. Ausport.gov.au (2008-01-09). Retrieved on 2012-08-02.</ref>

The daughter of marathoner [[Geoff Watt]], Kathy Watt turned first to running, winning the national junior 3&nbsp;km championship. She began to train on a bike after [[achilles tendon]] problems. For a while, she competed in duathlon (running and cycling), but found she was a better cyclist than runner. 

In 1996, Watt was in a legal dispute with the [[Australian Cycling Federation]] over who would race the pursuit in the Olympic Games. Watt had been told that she would be <ref>not accurate--source needed</ref>but was replaced a few days before the event by [[Lucy Tyler-Sharman]]. Watt appealed to the International [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]], claiming a breach of contract. The court ordered Watt to be reinstated in the race.<ref>[http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/results/archives/jul96/court.html The Kathy Watt Saga Continued]. Autobus.cyclingnews.com. Retrieved on 2012-08-02.</ref>

In 2000, Watt again became involved in a controversy over a selection, but this time she was not successful in her appeal to the CAS. 

She retired after 2000 but came back three years later but was not successful in an attempt to qualify for the 2004 Olympics. After another retirement, Watt worked as a coach and personal trainer. However, she made another comeback to qualify for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Melbourne]], where she won a silver medal in the [[Cycling at the 2006 Commonwealth Games#Women's 25 km - 30 km Time Trial|time trial]]. In January 2006, she won the time trial section of the Australian open road championship in Buninyong, [[Ballarat]].<ref>[http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/watt-makes-comm-games-after-tt-win Watt makes Comm Games after TT win]. Cyclingnews.com. Retrieved on 2012-08-02.</ref>

Watt holds a Bachelor of Science degree from the [[University of Melbourne]], with a major in physiology and pathology. She studied nutrition, anatomy, and physiotherapy. She attended Tintern Church of England Girls' Grammar, now [[Tintern Schools]].

'''West Ealing''' is a [[railway station]] on the [[Great Western Main Line]] from [[Paddington railway station|London Paddington]]. It is on Drayton Green Road (B452).

The station is manned for part of the day. There is a passenger-operated ticket machine at this location and a [[Permit to travel|PERTIS]] passenger-operated ticket machine issuing 'permit to travel' tickets which are exchanged on-train or at manned stations for travel tickets. The ticket machines are located just inside the station entrance on the north side.

==History==
The station was opened in 1871 as '''Castle Hill and Ealing Dene''' on the [[Great Western Railway]], which was constructed from London Paddington through Ealing to [[Maidenhead]] in 1836–38.<ref>{{cite book| last = MacDermot| first = E T| title = History of the Great Western Railway |edition= 1|volume= 1 (1833-1863)| publisher = [[Great Western Railway]]| year = 1927| location = London}}</ref> From 1 March 1883, the station—then named '''Castle Hill (Ealing Dean)'''—was served by [[District Railway]] services running between {{LUL stations|station=Mansion House}} and [[Windsor & Eton Central railway station|Windsor]]. This service was discontinued as uneconomic after 30 September 1885.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Douglas |title=The London Underground: A Diagrammatic History |edition=8th |date=December 2007 |origyear=1980 |publisher=Capital Transport |location=Harrow Weald |isbn=978-1-85414-315-0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Day |first1=John R. |last2=Reed |first2=John |title=The Story of London's Underground |edition=10th |year=2008 |origyear=1963 |publisher=Capital Transport |location=Harrow |isbn=978-1-85414-316-7 |page=26 |ref=harv }}</ref> The station was located next to the [[London Co-operative Society|London Co-operative Societies]] main [[creamery]], and so was equipped with a dedicated [[British Railway Milk Tank Wagon|milk train]] platform.

Originally the station consisted of four platforms in a staggered layout: platform 1 and the island consisting of platforms 2 and 3 to the west of the Drayton Green Road bridge, and platform 4 on the east side. Platform 1 (along with a [[siding (rail)|siding]] leading up to it) was removed in 1973, followed by platform 2 being fenced off in 1991 as trains on the main line no longer serviced the station. Platform 4 was demolished and moved west of the bridge in 1990, partially covering the site of the then long-closed milk depot.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=V|last2=Smith|first2=K|title=Branch Lines of West London|year=2000|publisher=Middleton Press|location=Midhurst|isbn=978-1-901706-50-5|page=4}}</ref> The current station building was completed in early 1987, following the demolition of the previous one a year earlier.

==Services==
Presently there are four lines (two for fast services out of Paddington), but only platforms 3 and 4 exist. There are also the remains of another platform next to platform 4, the now long-closed LCS dedicated milk depot platform.

The station is served by local services operated by [[First Great Western]] from {{LUL stations|station=Paddington}} to {{LUL stations|station=Greenford}} and [[Heathrow Connect]] services from Paddington to [[Heathrow Airport]]. It is on the original line of the [[Great Western Railway]]. It is closed on Sundays. The restricted facilities are an intermittently open booking office and a ticket machine. The station is in [[Travelcard Zone 3]]. On weekdays and Saturdays West Ealing is served by eight trains an hour, four going to London Paddington and two going to Greenford and [[Heathrow Airport]] respectively.

Since October 2008, [[Oyster card|Oyster "pay as you go"]] can be used for journeys originating or ending at West Ealing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/london/OysterPAYG.pdf |work=National Rail Enquiries |title=Oyster PAYG on National Rail |date=20 October 2008}}</ref>

==Connections==
[[London Buses]] routes [[London Buses route E7|E7]] and [[London Buses route E11|E11]] serve the station.

==Future==
Plans are in hand to provide [[Crossrail]] services at the station. As part of this proposal, services from the [[Greenford Branch Line]] will terminate at West Ealing. [[Network Rail]] will create capacity for this by converting the former LCS milk train bay into an extra bay platform.<ref>[http://www.ealinggazette.co.uk/ealing-news/ealing-columnists/transport-watch/2009/06/12/transport-watch-tube-crime-down-for-third-consecutive-year-64767-23862823/ Transport Watch: 'Tube crime down for third consecutive year' - Ealing Gazette]</ref> 
[[File:West Ealing station 3.JPG|thumb|left|The area of the former milk train bay in May 2012. This will be converted into an extra bay platform for the Greenford branch, as part of the Crossrail project]]
In addition, various further alterations will be made by [[Network Rail]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crossrail.co.uk/news/press-releases/crossrail-station-design-contract-awarded-network-rail-release#.T7AJqsWaU08|accessdate=13 May 2012|date=17 May 2011|title=Crossrail Station Design Contract Awarded|publisher=Crossrail}}</ref>
*New station building with a larger ticket hall with level access from Manor Road (to the north of the station)
*Step-free access
*Platforms 3–4 extended to enable 10-car trains to stop
*Improved passenger facilities including increased lighting, a new canopy on platform 4, and information and security systems

In 1985, he was briefly the chairman of the ruling Military Council and ''de facto'' [[President of Uganda|head of state of Uganda]], and later, [[Lieutenant General]] and chief of the armed forces.

During the [[Ugandan Bush War|civil war in Uganda]] between the UNLA (which was now the national army) and [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s [[National Resistance Army]], president [[Milton Obote]] alienated much of the [[Acholi]]-dominated officer corps, including Olara-Okello and General [[Tito Okello]], by appointing his fellow ethnic [[Langi people|Lango]], Brigadier Smith Opon Acak, as army Chief of Staff. On 27 July 1985, an army brigade of the UNLA commanded by Olara-Okello, and composed mostly of [[Acholi]] troops, staged a [[coup d'état]] against [[Milton Obote]]'s government and seized power. The [[National Assembly of Uganda|National Assembly]] was dissolved and a Military Council was established. Between 27 and 29 July 1985, Olara-Okello was Chairman of the Military Council, and ''de facto'' head of state.

On 29 July, General [[Tito Okello]] replaced Olara-Okello as Chairman of the Military Council, and Olara-Okello was promoted from the rank of [[Brigadier]] to that of [[Lieutenant General]], and named chief of the armed forces. He commanded the army until [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s [[National Resistance Army]] seized power on 26 January 1986. Olara-Okello fled to exile in [[Sudan]], where he lived until he died in Ormduruman Hospital in [[Khartoum]] on 9 January 1990.

[[File:Vieux la Romaine Villa hypocauste.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Hypocaust under the floor in a [[Roman villa]] in Vieux-la-Romaine, near [[Caen]], [[France]]]]

A '''hypocaust''' (Latin ''hypocaustum'') was an [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] system of [[underfloor heating]], used to heat houses with hot air. The word derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''hypo'' meaning "under" and ''caust-'', meaning "burnt" (as in ''[[caustic (disambiguation)|caustic]]''). The Roman architect Vitruvius, writing about the end of the 1st century B.C., attributes their invention to [[Sergius Orata]].

==Roman operation==
[[Image:Villa Romana La Olmeda 030 Pedrosa De La Vega - Saldaña (Palencia).jpg|thumb|Ruins of the hypocaust under the floor of a Roman villa at [[La Olmeda]], [[Province of Palencia]] ([[Castile and León]], Spain).]]
 
Hypocausts were used for  heating hot baths ([[thermae]]), houses and other buildings, whether public or private. The floor was raised above the ground by pillars, called [[pilae stacks]], with a layer of tiles, then a layer of concrete then another of tiles on top; and spaces were left inside the walls so that hot air and smoke from the [[furnace]] would pass through these enclosed areas and out of flues in the roof, thereby heating but not polluting the interior of the room. Ceramic box tiles were placed inside the walls to both remove the hot burned air and to heat the walls.  Rooms requiring the most heat were placed closest to the furnace, whose heat could be increased by adding more wood to the fire. It was labour-intensive to run a hypocaust as it required constant attention to tend the fire, and expensive in fuel, so it was a feature of the [[villa]] and [[public baths]].

[[image:Caldarium.JPG|thumb|left|[[Caldarium]] from the [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Roman Baths]] at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], in Britain. The floor has been removed to reveal the empty spaces through which the hot air would flow.]]

[[Vitruvius]] describes their construction and operation in his work ''[[De architectura]]'' in about 15 BC, adding details about how fuel could be conserved by designing the hot room or [[caldarium]] for men and women to be built next to one another, adjacent to the [[tepidarium]] so as to run the public baths efficiently. He also describes a device for adjusting the heat by a [[bronze]] ventilator in the domed ceiling. 

Many remains of Roman hypocausts have survived throughout Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.  The hypocaust was an invention which improved the hygiene and living conditions of citizens, and was a forerunner of modern [[central heating]].

==Non-Roman analogs==
Excavations at [[Mohenjo-daro]] in what is now [[Pakistan]] have unearthed what is believed to be a hypocaust lined with bitumen-coated bricks. If it fulfilled a similar role, the structure would pre-date the earliest Roman hypocaust by as much as 2000 years.

In the Republic of Georgia, excavations in the ancient settlement of [[Dzalisa]] uncovered a large castle complex in 1984–1985 featuring a well-preserved hypocaust, built between 200–400 BC.  

Dating back to 1000 BC, Korean houses have traditionally used ''[[ondol]]'' to provide floor heating on similar principles as the hypocaust, drawing smoke from a wood fire typically used for cooking. Ondol heating was common in Korean homes until the 1960s, by which time dedicated ondol installations were typically used to warm the main room of the house, burning a variety of fuels such as coal and biomass.

==After the Romans==
[[File:2006 0814HistriaTerme20060371.jpg|Detail of flues in a Roman wall.|thumb|Wall flues for hot air circulation.]]
With the decline of the Roman Empire, the hypocaust fell into disuse, especially in western provinces.  In Britain, from c. 400 until c. 1900, central heating did not exist, and hot baths were rare.<ref>{{citation|last=[[Winston Churchill]]|title=[[A History of the English Speaking Peoples|A History of the English Speaking Peoples: The Birth of Britain]]|publisher=[[Dodd, Mead & Company]]|year=1956|page=35}}</ref>

In the [[Iberian Peninsula]] the Roman system was adopted for the heating of Hispano-Islamic ([[Al Andalus]]) baths (hammams).
A derivation of hypocaust, the [[Gloria (heating system)|gloria]], was in use in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] until the arrival of modern heating. After the fuel (mainly wood) was reduced to ashes, the air intake was closed to keep hot air inside and to slow [[combustion]].

'''''Spasim''''' (abbreviation of 'space simulation') was a 32-player 3D networked computer game by [[Jim Bowery]] involving 4 planetary systems with up to 8 players per planetary system, released in March 1, 1974. Jim Bowery claims that it is the very first 3D multiplayer game and has offered reward of US $500 to anyone who could document an example of a multiplayer 3D virtual reality game prior to ''Spasim''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/jim_bowery/spasim.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010410145350/http://www.geocities.com/jim_bowery/spasim.html |title=Spasim (1974) The First First-Person-Shooter 3D Multiplayer Networked Game |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2001-04-10 |accessdate=2011-06-08 |archivedate=2001-04-10}}</ref> In ''Spasim'' the players flew around in space and to each other they appeared as wire-frame space ships. Their positions were updated about every second.

The game was played on the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] computer system, and was heavily influenced by another PLATO space multiplayer game ''[[Empire (PLATO)|Empire]]''. Later 3D multiplayer games on the PLATO network included ''airace'' by [[Silas Warner]] that evolved into ''airfight'' (by [[Brand Fortner]]), and then spawned ''[[Panther (computer game)|Panther]]'' by [[John Edo Haefeli]] at NW University. [[Atari]], Inc had a PLATO account and ''Panther'' is said to be the origin of ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' while ''airfight'' led up to Sublogic's ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator]]''. Also, ''Panther'' was developed into the more sophisticated ''Panzer'' by the US Army.<ref>{{cite web|title=A History and Analysis of Level Design in 3D Computer Games|last=Shahrani| first=Sam| url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2674/educational_feature_a_history_and_.php}}</ref>

'''Princess Albertina''' is a [[genital piercing|female genital piercing]], where a ring enters the [[urethra]] and exits through the top of the [[vagina]].<ref name="solot2007">Solot, Dorian; Miller, Marshall (2007).

Random House, Inc., ISBN 978-1-58091-193-1</ref> Anne Greenblatt describes the Princess Albertina as another "relatively new and experimental piercing."<ref name="Featherstone">Featherstone, Mike; Burrows, Roger (1995). ''[Cyberspace/cyberbodies/cyberpunk: cultures of technological embodiment,]'' Sage, ISBN 978-0-7619-5084-4</ref> Its name comes from the fact that it is [[analogy|analogous]] to the male [[Prince Albert (genital piercing)|Prince Albert piercing]].

This is a relatively rare piercing, as placement is difficult and the potential for [[urinary tract infection]]s may be increased by this piercing. This piercing requires the bearer to have a large enough urethra for it to be viable. This piercing can be extremely [[sexually stimulating]], as its presence stimulates the nerves of the urethra during [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] or [[masturbation|masturbatory]] activities. It is an advanced piercing and many piercers may not be willing or able to perform it. As noted above, the primary concern with this piercing is that it can lead to an increase in urinary tract infections. While many male genital piercings are transurethral, the longer length of the male urethra reduces the risk of urinary tract infection due to transurethral piercings. In addition, the [[urethral sounding]] play often used to enlarge the urethra can be dangerous if done improperly. The presence of this piercing can alter or divert the flow of [[urine]] from the body and may require extra attention during and after urination.

'''Quinoline''' is a [[heterocyclic]] [[aromatic]] [[organic compound]] with the chemical formula C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>7</sub>N.  It is a colorless [[hygroscopic]] liquid with a strong odor. Aged samples, if exposed to light, become yellow and later brown.  Quinoline is only slightly soluble in cold water but dissolves readily in hot water and most organic solvents.  Quinoline itself has few applications, but many of its  [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] are useful in diverse applications.  A prominent example is [[quinine]], which is found naturally in plants as [[alkaloid]]s. [[4-Hydroxy-2-alkylquinoline]]s (HAQs) are involved in [[antibiotic resistance]].

== Occurrence and isolation ==
Quinoline was first extracted from [[coal tar]] in 1834 by [[Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1911 | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | title = Quinoline | url = http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Quinoline}}</ref> Coal tar remains the principal source of commercial quinoline.<ref name=Hoke/>

Like other nitrogen heterocyclic compounds, such as pyridine derivatives, quinoline is often reported as an environmental contaminant associated with facilities processing oil shale or coal, and has also been found at legacy wood treatment sites.  Owing to high water solubility quinoline has significant potential for mobility in the environment, which may promote water contamination.  Quinoline is readily degradable by certain microorganisms, such as ''Rhodococcus'' species Strain Q1, which was isolated from soil and paper mill sludge.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0964-8305(96)00032-7 | title = Isolation, characterization, and substrate utilization of a quinoline-degrading bacterium | year = 1996 | last1 = O'Loughlin | first1 = Edward J. | last2 = Kehrmeyer | first2 = Staci R. | last3 = Sims | first3 = Gerald K. | journal = International Biodeterioration & Biodegradation | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 107}}</ref>

Quinoline is present in small amounts in crude oil within the virgin [[diesel fuel|diesel]] fraction.  It can be removed by hydrotreating often with a nickel-molybdenum on alumina catalyst.

== Synthesis ==
Quinolines can be synthesized from simple anilines using a number of [[name reaction|named reactions]].
::[[File:Quinoline from aniline.png|400px]]
Going clockwise from top these are: 
* [[Combes quinoline synthesis]] using [[aniline]]s and ?-di[[ketone]]s.
* [[Conrad-Limpach synthesis]] using [[aniline]]s and ?-ketoesters.
* [[Doebner reaction]] using [[aniline]]s with an [[aldehyde]] and [[pyruvic acid]] to form quinoline-4-carboxylic acids
* [[Doebner-Miller reaction]] using [[aniline]]s and ?,?-unsaturated [[carbonyl]] compounds.
* [[Gould-Jacobs reaction]] starting from an aniline and ethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate
* [[Skraup synthesis]] using [[ferrous sulfate]], [[glycerol]], [[aniline]], [[nitrobenzene]], and [[sulfuric acid]].

A number of other processes exist, which require specifically substituted anilines or related compounds:
* [[Camps quinoline synthesis]] utilizing an ''o-acylaminoacetophenone'' and hydroxide
* [[Friedländer synthesis]] using 2-aminobenzaldehyde and [[acetaldehyde]].
* [[Knorr quinoline synthesis]], using a  ?-ketoanilide and sulfuric acid.
* [[Niementowski quinoline synthesis]], using anthranilic acid and ketones.
* [[Pfitzinger reaction]] using an [[isatin]] with base and a carbonyl compound to yield substituted quinoline-4-carboxylic acids
* [[Povarov reaction]] using an [[aniline]], a [[benzaldehyde]] and an activated [[alkene]].

== Applications ==
Quinoline is used in the manufacture of [[dye]]s, the preparation of [[hydroxyquinoline]] sulfate and [[niacin]]. It has also used as a solvent for [[resin]]s and [[terpene]]s.

Quinoline is mainly used as a feedstock in the production of other [[specialty chemicals]].  Approximately 4 [[tonne]]s are produced annually according to a report published in 2005.<ref name=Hoke/>  Its principal use is as a precursor to [[8-hydroxyquinoline]], which is a versatile chelating agent and precursor to pesticides.  Its [[quinaldine|2-]] and [[lepidine|4-methyl]] derivatives are precursors to [[cyanine dye]]s.  Oxidation of quinoline affords [[quinolinic acid]] (pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid), a precursor to the herbicide sold under the name "Assert".<ref name=Hoke>{{Ullmann | author1 = Gerd Collin | author2 = Hartmut Höke | title = Quinoline and Isoquinoline | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a22_465}}</ref>

By 2006, over 100,000 players had frequented the game, making it one of the largest text-based multiplayer games on the Internet. In the beginning of 2008, it had over 30,000 subscriptions. At the end of 2011, amount of subscriptions was similarly over 30,000 giving BatMUD a flat growth (amount of new players equal those who no longer frequent the game).

The game was initially set-up by a [[Wizard (MUD)|wizard]] who named himself Jaf, followed by many volunteer coders, all becoming [[Wizard (MUD)|wizards]] in the process.
The MUD's name comes from the name of the server the game was first hosted on, '''batman.cs.hut.fi'''.  Since then, BatMUD has relocated several times, at one point residing in Oulu, Finland.
As of November 2007, the main ''BatMUD'' servers are co-located in the two data centers of [http://www.nebula.fi/ Nebula] in Helsinki, Finland.

Despite its phenomenal age as an Internet community, the MUD is constantly evolving which makes it both challenging and entertaining to new and old players alike.
Due to the rich set of features, ''BatMUD'' may be a bit overwhelming for a newcomer,<ref name="netgames">{{cite book

}}</ref> but more experienced players often help if asked politely, and registered newbie helpers are available to guide fresh players.

Like most other active MUDs, ''BatMUD'' is also constantly developed.
Over the years there have been over 200 [[coder]]s contributing to the [[codebase]].
It is expected on ''BatMUD'' that a coder will actively work on development of the MUD, with newcomers who have not been productive enough to a level being periodically purged.
All coders agree to an intellectual property rights agreement in order to secure the legal-aspects of the modern day world, even though coding is done [[volunteer]]-based.

===Notable (external) events, timeline===
In September 1994, the organization Balanced Alternative Techniques ry was officially registered in the "Joint corporate information system of the National Board of Patents and Registration and the Tax Administration"<ref>The Joint corporate information system of the National Board of Patents and Registration and the Tax Administration, Finland [http://www.ytj.fi/english/]</ref> of Finland.
The game was also previewed in [[Pelit]]-magazine and was highly praised from its rich set of features while scoring over 90/100 points.<ref>Kaizu, "BatMUD", ''Pelit'', 1994/6</ref>

In 1996, ''BatMUD'' received the Finnish Oiva award, and the game has also been prominently featured in many mainstream computer gaming magazines, such as the [[Pelit]]-magazine.

B.A.T. ry received a Business ID from the Finnish tax authorities (by own request) and was entered into the tax prepayment register in May 2002.
This was preceded by a major overhaul (of 1999–2002), during which the B.A.T. ry slowly re-organized itself to become a more effective and productive organization - responding to the professionalism required in running the larger [[Legal personality|legal entity]] which B.A.T. ry had become.

Through the years, ''BatMUD'' has also been voted "Game of the month" by several Internet gaming-sites, such as MPOGD.com<ref>[http://www.mpogd.com/gotm/?Date=4/1/2003 BatMUD, MPOGD.com Game of the Month, April 2003]</ref> in April, 2003.

In 2004, B.A.T. ry applied for the ''BatMUD'' [[trademark]] and "BatMUD" was registered as a trademark by the United States Patent and Trademark Office<ref>[http://www.uspto.gov/ United States Patent and Trademark Office]</ref> on April 5, 2005.
Also, a 91-page Pro graduation [[thesis]] emerges from the [[University of Lapland]], themed "Artificial Intelligence in text-based computer games' dramaturgy.
Study subjects: [[NetHack|Nethack]] and BatMUD",<ref>Graduation thesis, "Artificial Intelligence in text-based computer games' dramaturgy. Study subjects: Nethack and BatMUD", Audiovisual Mediaculture, University of Lapland, written by Jussi Huhtala (in Finnish) [http://www.elisanet.fi/jotsio/tekstit/gradu/gradu_juhuhtal.pdf]</ref> Audiovisual Mediaculture written by Jussi Huhtala (in Finnish).

''BatMUD'' turned 15 in 2005, and an official birthday-gala was held at Kaivohuone (Helsinki, Finland).  More than three hundred guests from all over the world, all dressed in evening attire, joined the celebration of BatMUD's 15-year long journey.  The oldest Finnish newspaper, [[Keskisuomalainen]], wrote an article<ref>Article about the BatMUD 15-year gala, Keskisuomalainen 19.4.2005 (in Finnish) [http://www.bat.org/batfiles/11/keskisuomalainen_19042005.jpg]</ref> on the event.
During April, ''BatMUD''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Niklas Lindroos and Christopher Ragusa attended [[Notacon]] 2005 and held a presentation<ref>[http://www.notacon.org/archive/2005/speakers.html Notacon 2005, Speakers and Presenters]</ref> on "The BatMUD community - a biased study in running large global communities on the Internet".

In May 2006, B.A.T. ry published a press-release<ref>[http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/05/prweb383297.htm B.A.T. ry press release May 10, 2006 through PRWeb]</ref> regarding producing a new Client Platform for ''BatMUD''.  This effectively meant that ''BatMUD'' shifted towards tackling the onslaught of the [[MMORPG]].

In December 2006, ''BatMUD'' released the first version (v1.00) of the Official [[game client]].  What makes this Batclient significant is the many steps it takes towards the more modern, graphical gaming environments of more recently published games.  The game client is a lightweight, unique [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based [[desktop application]].  The development continues rapidly towards an even more competitive game [[GUI]], in order to overcome the [[MMOG]]-playing [[generation]]'s barriers of playing [[text-based]] games.  This game client is solely dedicated for playing and subscribing to ''BatMUD''.

In February 2007, a 100-page Pro graduation master's thesis with the topic "[[Virtual good|Virtual gift]] - Trading gifts in BatMUD virtual community"<ref>Masters Thesis, Cultural Anthropology: "Virtual gift - Trading gifts in BatMUD virtual community", University of Jyväskylä, written by Anu Ikonen (in Finnish) [http://thesis.jyu.fi/07/URN_NBN_fi_jyu-2007234.pdf]</ref> in [[cultural anthropology]] for the [[University of Jyväskylä]] was published, written by a non-player in Finnish.

''BatMUD'' made the news again in August, 2007, covered by sites such as Inside Mac Games<ref>[http://www.insidemacgames.com/news/story.php?ArticleID=15536 News blurb, InsideMacGames, August 2007]</ref> and several other gaming related news-sites.
Other on-line gaming sites, such as Massively<ref>[http://www.massively.com/2007/11/25/batmud-back-online-and-still-in-business/ News blurb, Massively.com, November 2007]</ref> have covered ''BatMUD'' since then, resulting in B.A.T. ry being acknowledged as a member of the on-line gaming industry.

In April 2010, BatMUD celebrated its [http://www.bat.org/node/104 20-year anniversary] at [http://www.kaivohuone.fi/ Restaurant Kaivohuone] (Helsinki, Finland). At this point, BatMUD had been online on the Internet and available for players already for over 20 years. The event had two parts, it began with a [[Wizard (MUD)|Wizard]]-only dinner (during which experiences of BatMUD were shared by the 45 attending coders, honouring game's past), after which the 340+ players who had signed for the free event were allowed entrance. Each celebrant was given a BatMUD badge with their character name printed out, to help people identify other players easier. During the revelries, after a free buffet and official speeches, the famous Finnish all-girl band [[Indica (Finnish band)|Indica]] threw a private gig for the fortunate audience, having most smitten by their performance. Cost of the event was reportedly 30.000,00 euros.

==Gameworld==
In ''BatMUD'', a player initially creates a fantasy [[player character|character]] by choosing a [[race (fantasy)|race]], background (civilized, magical, evil religious, good religious or nomadic), [[Alignment (role-playing games)|alignment]] and a name for the character.
As usual in [[role-playing game]]s, there is no specific goal in the game.
Players get [[experience points]] for various things their character does in the virtual environment of the MUD.
For example, player character gets experience points from finding new rooms.
''BatMUD'' has over 16,000 unique rooms, plus a moderately large "outerworld".<ref>2guysamacandawebsite.com "Welcome to BatMUD, Online Since 14th, April 1990!" [http://web.archive.org/web/20071010030556/2guysamacandawebsite.com/article.php?id=449] March 16, 2004</ref>

''BatMUD'' features a detailed combat system, player to player commerce, playerbuilt cities, seafaring vessels, mounts and hundreds of custom zones.

Today ''BatMUD'' has limited [[multiplaying|multiplaying.]] A player can have one two characters and the secondary character must be registered so that the primary and secondary characters are identified. 
Because ''BatMUD'' does not require a special client program beyond a [[Telnet]]-capable computer (although specialised [[MUD client]]s do exist), it would be relatively easy for a player to multiplay effectively (leading to experience/virtual currency [[inflation]]) compared to other types of modern [[Massively multiplayer online game|multiplayer online game]]s.

===The Realm===
''BatMUD: The Age of Exiles''<ref>[http://www.bat.org/news/view_post?postid=36006&page=3&group_name=inform BatMUD: Age of Exiles newspost]</ref> was introduced in late 2006. Effectively, for old players, this meant a reconfiguration of the known world and the learning of several new continents.<ref>[http://www.bat.org/help/maps BatMUD continent sketches]</ref>  The multitude of areas (or zones) were scattered across the globe.  A new storyline and capital cities were introduced.

It is said that the Realm map is best to be experienced through the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] based Batclient interactive map features or by viewing the Google maps hack<ref>[http://jeskko.pupunen.net/map/ Realm maps for 'BatMUD: The Age of Exiles', Google Maps hack]</ref> available for the web browsers.

===Races===
''BatMUD'' has a wide variety of [[race (fantasy)|race]]s.<ref name="netgames" />
There are 44 races in total: 31 immediately selectable, 10 available only to experienced players rebirthing, and 3 invitation-only player-run races.<ref>[http://www.bat.org/help/help?str=races Official BatMUD help file on 'races']</ref>
There are some extremely unusual races including [[Sprite (creature)|sprite]], merfolk, or [[barsoom]]ian (a kind of four armed ape capable to some extent of four hand wielding).<ref>[http://www.bat.org/help/races Official BatMUD website list of races]</ref>

If players wish to change their character's race, they can [[Remort|reincarnate]] and choose another race/background; they lose a relatively small percentage of their total experience and get to respend their experience in a new way from their previous incarnation.<ref>[http://www.bat.org/help/help?str=reincarnation Official BatMUD help file on 'reincarnation']</ref>  This means you can completely transform your character, whereas in many current MUDs and games such as [[World of Warcraft]], you are very much fixed into one race and class, and the investment of experience into the character is permanent.  The experience loss depends on the time since one's last reincarnation, as well as reincarnation method, and is between .5% to 10% of one's total experience.<ref>[http://www.bat.org/help/help?str=reincarnation_process Official BatMUD help file on 'reincarnation process']</ref>  Experienced players also have an option to rebirth their character, allowing them not only to choose a new race and background, but also to change their name.
After rebirthing they lose all of their current experience, but get some minor bonuses and a chance to re-experience the lower levels.<ref>[http://www.bat.org/help/help?str=rebirth Official BatMUD help file on 'rebirth']</ref>

===Player to player confrontations===
[[Player killing]] is lightly moderated in ''BatMUD''.<ref name="netgames" /> It is not forbidden if there exists a valid reason or the killer is registered playerkiller (which makes them open prey for anyone).<ref>[http://www.bat.org/help/help?str=player_killing Official BatMUD help file on 'player killing']</ref>  Registering as playerkiller has some possible benefits, such as eligibility for winner of the week, who gets a special bonus.<ref>[http://www.bat.org/help/help?str=player_killer Official BatMUD help file on 'player killer']</ref>  Complaining about player killing may result in harassment which can continue for as long as the complainers play the game, but repeated unwarranted player killing is looked down on.  In addition to random killings there is an [[assassination|assassin]] [[guild]], which for a fee will dispatch a group of players to kill another player.

An [[Wizard (MUD)|archwizard's]] comment about in-game [[player killing]] on a highbie-channel in Finnish, regarding a player's question on the view of the administration: ''"Kill anyone you please, just not too much!"''
<blockquote>Amarth <fin>: tapa ketä vaa missä vaa päi battia kunhan et liikaa!</blockquote>

===Hardcore version===
In 2000, a separate [http://www.bat.org/hcbat/ version] of ''BatMUD'' was launched using a hardcore or [[permadeath]] ruleset.  Though less populous than the normal (often referred to as "flower ''BatMUD''") it remains a unique and challenging game world.  Several attempts to raise the playerbase, draw more interest from the [[Wizard (MUD)|Archwizards]] or synchronize both games has yet to be achieved.

===Subscribing===
The subscription for the game is free, as is playing without any limitations. The official client, Batclient, is also free of charge.

As said, the game can be played enjoyably for no cost, but donations of money are rewarded with in-game benefits which allows the donator to have a character with enhanced characteristics (the pay-for-perks model).
Money raised from donations is spent on improving and maintaining the game.
These benefits can also be gained by completing in-game tasks, but donations are the easiest way.

==Virtual community and Playerbase==
It is arguable that ''BatMUD'' formed one of the earliest virtual communities of gamers on the Internet.
What marks the community significant, is the active operation and participation of the individuals within the [[virtual community]].<ref>[http://www.massively.com/2007/11/25/batmud-back-online-and-still-in-business/ BatMUD: back online and still in business by Jonathan Northwood]</ref>  Several conventions and events are being held across the world, with one of the most notable probably being the Indiana, U.S. based Campcon,<ref>[http://www.campcon.org/ Campcon 11 website, Clay City, Indiana, USA]</ref> being held for the 11th consecutive year in June, 2009 &mdash; a [[real life]] gathering of active participants of the ''BatMUD'' community.  Similar events are held in Europe and [[Scandinavia]] every year.

''BatMUD'' provides a range of interplayer communication methods, allowing the players to talk and chat.  Though the majority (about 2/3) of the players reside in Finland, the game itself is wholly in English, enabling it to host a large player base from several countries, including many European countries, the United States, Canada and Australia.  Together with [[Role-playing game|roleplay]] not being strictly enforced, the common language of English allows debates to flourish.

With several hundred players simultaneously online,<ref>'Average online players' user graph on the official web site of BatMUD, checked on 2009-02-26 [http://www.bat.org/help/who]</ref> it is also one of the largest traditional MUDs.  However with the rise of [[massively multiplayer online game]]s its popularity has fallen off in recent years with fewer new players joining.  Aggressive efforts have been made to make the MUD more newbie friendly<ref name="carton">{{cite book

}}</ref> but most players continue to be well established players who have invested months or years into the game.  As with many other popular online games, [[Behavioral addiction|addiction]] is not unknown.

''BatMUD'' employs a [[virtual economy]],<ref>Masters Thesis about "Virtual gift - Trading gifts in BatMUD virtual community" [http://thesis.jyu.fi/07/URN_NBN_fi_jyu-2007234.pdf] (in finnish)</ref> with players selling rare items and favours to each other in the game's internal currency.  Sale of characters or equipment for real life money is forbidden.<ref>[http://www.bat.org/help/help?htype=extra&str=trading Official BatMUD help file on 'trading']</ref>  If it has occurred, it has not been a major problem.

The '''Rank Organisation''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[entertainment]] conglomerate founded by industrialist [[J. Arthur Rank, 1st Baron Rank|J. Arthur Rank]] in 1937. It quickly became the largest and most [[vertical integration|vertically integrated]] film company in Britain, owning production, distribution and exhibition facilities. It also diversified into the manufacture of radios, TVs and photocopiers (as one of the owners of [[Rank Xerox]]). The company name lasted until 1996 when the name and some of the remaining assets were taken over by the gaming company [[The Rank Group|the Rank Group Plc]]. 

The company logo, the [[Gongman]], first used in 1935 by the group's distribution company [[General Film Distributors]]<ref name="Independent">[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-sir-john-woolf-1103490.html The Independent 1 July 1999: Obituary: Sir John Woolf] Retrieved 2011-09-02</ref> and seen in the opening titles of the films, became an iconic film emblem.

== Origin ==
[[J. Arthur Rank, 1st Baron Rank|J. Arthur Rank]] was already a wealthy industrialist through his father's [[flour]] [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] business, [[Rank Hovis McDougall|Joseph Rank Ltd]], when he made his somewhat unlikely start in film-making, financing short religious subjects in line with his [[Methodist]] beliefs. From these modest origins, the British film company emerged in 1937 as Rank sought to consolidate his film-making interests.

== Growth ==
The company grew quickly, largely through acquisition. Significant developments included:
* 1938 - [[Odeon Cinemas]] was purchased
* 1939 - [[Denham Film Studios]] were merged with the facilities at [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]] and the [[Amalgamated Studios]] in [[Borehamwood]] were acquired, but not used for making films.
* 1941 - Purchase of the [[Gaumont British|Gaumont-British Picture Corporation]], which also owned [[Gainsborough Pictures]], 251 cinemas and the [[Lime Grove Studios]].
* 1942 - UK sites of [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Cinemas]] purchased
* Late 1940s - A majority shareholding in Allied Cinemas and Irish Cinemas Ltd was gained, becoming the largest exhibition circuit in Ireland (a position maintained until the early 1980s)

By the late 1940s J Arthur Rank (or the Rank Organisation as it was now called), owned:
* Five major film studio complexes, Pinewood Film Studios, [[Denham Film Studios]], [[Ealing Studios]], [[Lime Grove Studios]] and [[Gainsborough Pictures|Islington Studios]]. (The studios at Lime Grove were sold to the [[BBC Television|BBC]] in 1949.)
* 650 UK cinemas (Odeon, Gaumont and Paramount chains) plus various international holdings, including subsidiaries in Canada and The Netherlands
* [[General Film Distributors]] (later Rank Film Distributors), including the UK distribution rights to [[Universal Pictures]]
* Rank Screen Advertising
* DeLuxe Laboratories
* 1966 - [[Rank Xerox]] - Joint venture entered into with Haloid Photographic (Xerox Corporation) of America, to manufacture and promote its range of plain paper photocopying equipment. Many of the waning film company assets were hastily converted and pressed into 'Rank Xerox' service. This venture was a huge gamble but ultimately the company's saving grace, until, once more in financial difficulties, it signed off increasing percentages of its holdings, to the parent company, finally becoming fully integrated into [[Xerox]] in the late 1990s.

== Film making  in the 1940s ==
A loose collective of film makers was established under the banner of Independent Producers Ltd., employing some of Britain's greatest directors, such as [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]] (''[[Black Narcissus]]'', ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'', ''[[I Know Where I'm Going!]]''), [[David Lean]] (''[[Brief Encounter]]'', ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]''), [[Frank Launder]] and [[Sidney Gilliat]] (''[[I See a Dark Stranger]]'', ''[[The Happiest Days of Your Life]]''), [[Ken Annakin]] (''Holiday Camp'') and [[Muriel Box]] (''[[The Seventh Veil]]'').

[[The Company of Youth]], the Rank Organisation acting school often referred to as "The Charm School", was founded in 1945. It launched several careers including those of [[Donald Sinden]], [[Dirk Bogarde]], [[Diana Dors]] and [[Christopher Lee]]. Although she was not a member of the school, [[Petula Clark]] was under contract to Rank for a period of time and starred in a number of films released by the studio, including ''[[London Town (film)|London Town]]'' (1946), one of the costliest flops in British film history. Also under contract to Rank was the Canadian actor [[Philip Gilbert]].

== Crisis and diversification ==
Despite backing some excellent films, Rank was in crisis by 1949, having built up a debt of £16 million.<ref name="Warren">Patricia Warren ''British Fiklm Studios: An Illusrtrated History'', London: B. T. Batsford, 2001, p.120</ref> and reported an annual loss of £3.5 million,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18474161 |title=Film Industry Slipping Out Of The Big Money. |newspaper=[[The Sun-Herald|The Sunday Herald (Sydney, NSW : 1949 - 1953)]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=1 January 1950 |accessdate=7 July 2012 |page=7 Supplement: Features |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Managing Director [[John Davis (British businessman)|John Davis]] cut staff, reduced budgets and concentrated film production at Pinewood. Other studio facilities (in [[Gainsborough Pictures|Islington]]) were closed, sold (Lime Grove Studios) or leased (Denham).<ref name="Warren"/> The Rank Organisation closed Independent Producers Ltd. The policies of Davis alienated many in the industry, in particular they led film director [[David Lean]], responsible for some of Rank's most critically and financial successful films, to look elsewhere for backing.<ref>Brian McFarlane [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/455111/index.html "Davis, John (1906-1993)"], BFI screenonline; McFarlane (ed.) ''Encyclopedia of British Film'', London: Methuen/BFI, 2003, p.164</ref>

In 1949, the company bought the [[Bush (company)|Bush Radio]] manufacturing facility and began to diversify its interests. In the early 1960s Rank took over [[Murphy Radio]] to form the '''Rank Bush Murphy Group''' (which was eventually sold to Great Universal Stores in 1978). In 1956 Rank began a partnership with the Haloid Corporation to form [[Rank Xerox]].<ref name="Clement">John Clement [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-john-davis-1482174.html Obituary: Sir John Davis], ''The Independent'', 1 July 1993</ref> Rank was also a significant shareholder in the consortium which became [[Southern Television]], the first [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television contract holder for the [[south of England]]. In the late 1950s, Rank set up '''Rank Records Ltd.''' (the record label was named '''Top Rank''') and '''Jaro Records''' (a jazz subsidiary). In 1961, Top Rank was taken over by [[EMI]], and in 1962 they replaced it with [[Stateside Records]]. Top Rank artists included [[Gary U.S. Bonds]], [[the Shirelles]], [[B. Bumble and the Stingers]], [[Wilbert Harrison]], [[Skip & Flip]], [[Craig Douglas]] and [[John Leyton]].

'''Rank Audio Visual''' was created in 1960, bringing together Rank's acquisitions in multimedia, including [[Bell and Howell]] (acquired with Gaumont British in 1941), Andrew Smith Harkness Ltd (1952) and [[Wharfedale (company)|Wharfedale Ltd]] (1958). Subsequent acquisitions included Strand Electric Holdings (1968) and [[LEAK|H.J. Leak & Co.]] (1969). In the mid and late 1970s Rank Audio Visual made a 3-in-1 stereo music centre, as well as TV sets in conjunction with [[NEC]] of Japan. The production of the "classic" Rank TV ran in the mid to late 70s, some interim models appeared and the "modern" Rank TV appeared in the early 80s. The [[NEC]] [[badge]] did not appear in the [[PAL]]/ 220/ 240 volt countries until the mid-1980s.

J. Arthur Rank had stepped down as [[Managing Director]] of the Rank Organisation in 1952, but remained as Chairman until 1962.

== Declining involvement in the film industry ==

From the 1950s fewer adventurous films were attempted and solidly commercial ventures, largely aimed at the family market, were made instead.  These include the popular [[Norman Wisdom]] comedies, the [[Doctor (film series)|Doctor]] films series and later on, Rank took on  the [[Carry On (film series)|Carry On]] film series.  However some films of note were produced during this era including ''[[Carve Her Name with Pride]]'', ''[[Sapphire (film)|Sapphire]]'' and ''[[Victim (1961 film)|Victim]]'', as well as a clutch of prestige topics such as the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] and filmed performances by the [[Royal Ballet]].

During the 1950s the British photographer [[Cornel Lucas]] set up the Pool Studio at Pinewood where he photographed many of the movie stars of this era of cinema, such as [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[David Niven]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellucascollection.com |title=Cornel Lucas Collection website |publisher=Cornellucascollection.com |date=1920-09-12 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> 

In 1960 John Davis announced that Rank would concentrate on bigger budgeted, internationally focused productions.<ref>Powell, Dilys. "Bigger Films to Come." Sunday Times [London, England] 10 Jan. 1960: 15. The Sunday Times Digital Archive. Web. 18 Apr. 2014.</ref> In 1961 they announced a production slate of a dozen films worth ?7 million.<ref>BRITAIN'S SCREEN SCENE: Encouraging Survey, Rank's Dossier -- Footnotes on Three Luminaries
By STEPHEN WATTS. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 23 Apr 1961: 129. </ref>

From 1959 to 1969: the company made over 500 weekly short cinema films in a series entitled ''[[Look at Life(series)|Look At Life]]'', each film depicting an area of British life.

==1970s==
From 1971 to 1976 Rank only invested around £1.5 million a year in film production. According to executive Tony Williams "the two main streams that they were down to was Carry On pictures and horror films made by Kevin Francis".<ref name="tony">[http://michaelklingerpapers.uwe.ac.uk/williams11.htm ony Williams Interviewed by Andrew Spicer, London, 18th March 2011, ''Michael Klinger Papers''] accessed 16 April 2014</ref> 

However in 1976  enjoyed a success with ''[[Bugsy Malone]]'' which encouraged them to re-enter film production.
===Temporary revival and final cessation of production===
In 1977 Rank appointed [[Tony Williams (film executive)|Tony Williams]] head of production<ref>Can Rank say they 'proudly' present this film?
Barker, Dennis. The Guardian (1959-2003) [London (UK)] 26 Nov 1977: 17. </ref> and over two years Rank made eight films worth £10 million, including ''[[Eagle's Wing]]'', ''[[The Shout]]'', ''[[The Thirty Nine Steps (1978 film)|The Thirty Nine Steps]]'', ''[[Riddle of the Sands]]'' an ''[[Silver Dream Racer]]''.<ref>FILM CLIPS: Harvey: Movies Back to Back
KILDAY, GREEGG. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 12 Apr 1978: f8.</ref> 

Many of these stories were set in the past. "You have to go back in time to tell a story that doesn't have to face seventies problems," said Williams in 1978. "What people are nostalgic for isn't necessarily any particular period, but the happier values that are missing today."<ref>The lucrative case for believing in yesterday
The Guardian (1959-2003) [London (UK)] 18 Dec 1978: 11. </ref>

Few of these new Rank films performed well at the box office, losing £1.6 million over all. (The company's pre tax profit was £131 million.) 

At the Cannes Film Festival in 1980 Ed Chilton of Rank announced a £12 million slate of projects. However by June they withdrew from production once again.<ref name="walker">Alexander Walker, ''National Heroes: British Cinema in the Seventies and Eighties'', Harrap, 1985 p 207-208</ref><ref name="john">John Huxley.

</ref><ref>"Would You Believe an Industry Could Die?" Sunday Times [London, England] 15 June 1980: 63. The Sunday Times Digital Archive. Web. 16 Apr. 2014.</ref> 

"The decision was made to plunge on in and then it was pulled back," said Williams.<ref name="tony"/> The Rank films that had been announced for production - including an adaptation of ''[[HMS Ulysses (novel)|HMS Ulysses]]'', ''The Rocking Horse Winner'' and a film version of ''[[To the Manor Born]]'' - were cancelled.<ref name="john"/><ref>Rank to Quit Film Production, Halting Work on 8 Features: Major British Film Maker Duty on U.S. Films
By JOHN HOLUSHA. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 07 June 1980: 27.</ref>

The following year Rank reported a record pre-tax profit of £102 million.<ref name="icon">Alexander Walker, ''Icons in the Fire: The Rise and Fall of Practically Everyone in the British Film Industry 1984-2000'', Orion Books, 2005 p4</ref>

According to Tony Williams:
<blockquote>After a time Rank Film Distributors was in trouble because they hadn’t got any new product. So Rank Film Distributors was then given chunks of money to go and buy into pictures because they made a blunder. And they carried on, on that basis, not directly making them and they had no direct control over what they made at all, no influence. They just bought into pictures. They did an output deal with Orion and that carried on until - until they sold the shooting match. Then the decision was made to get out of film, so RFD was closed down, Rank Film Advertising was sold off, eventually the laboratories went. Cinemas was the last one to go.<ref name="tony"/></blockquote>
In 1995, [[the Rank Group]] acquired all the outstanding shares of the Rank Organisation.

'''Butlins''' (also '''Butlin's''') is a chain of large [[holiday camp]]s in the United Kingdom. Butlins was founded by [[Billy Butlin]] to provide affordable holidays for ordinary British families.

Between 1936 and 1966, ten camps were built, including one in [[Ireland]] and one in the [[Bahamas]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, Butlins also operated numerous large hotels, including one in Spain, a number of smaller holiday parks in England and France, and a revolving restaurant in the [[BT Tower|Post Office Tower]] in London.<ref name="butlins.com">[http://www.butlins.com/about-butlins/history-of-butlins/index.aspx/ Summary of Butlins history on Butlins website]. Butlins (15 April 2011). Retrieved on 13 July 2011.</ref>

Tough competition from overseas package holiday operators, rising operational costs, and rapidly changing demand, forced many of the Butlins operations to close in the 1980s and 1990s. Three of the original camps remain open under the Butlins brand in [[Bognor Regis]], [[Minehead]], and [[Skegness]]. They are now owned and run by '''Butlins Skyline Ltd''' a subsidiary company of [[Bourne Leisure|Bourne Leisure Ltd]], which also operates other leisure brands in the British Isles, including [[Warner Leisure Hotels]] and [[Haven Holidays]].

Butlins runs a variety of "family fun activities" and entertainments, many of which are included in the price of a holiday. [[Redcoats (Butlins)|Redcoats]] provide entertainment, organise activities, and act as hosts.

==History==
[[File:Billy Butlin at Filey.jpg|right|thumb|Billy Butlin receiving Filey camp back from the [[RAF]] who ran it as ''RAF Hunmanby Moor'' during the Second World War]]
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}<!-- reference given does not support rest of section -->
Billy Butlin's inspiration for his holiday camp empire came from an unhappy holiday on [[Barry Island]] in his youth, when he had been locked out of his [[bed and breakfast]] accommodation all day by his [[landlord|landlady]], which was normal practice at the time.<ref name="butlins 1">{{cite web

The first of the Butlins holiday camps was opened by Billy Butlin in 1936 in [[Skegness]], following his success in developing amusement parks. A second camp quickly followed in [[Clacton]] (1938), and construction [[Filey Holiday Camp]] began in 1939. With the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], building at Filey was postponed, and the camps at Skegness and Clacton were given over for military use. Wartime use of Butlins camps continued, with resorts at [[Ayr]], Filey, and [[Pwllheli]] being completed and opened as military camps. This camp was later renamed ''Wonderwest World'', and is now owned and run by [[Haven Holidays|Haven]], part of [[Bourne Leisure]], who own both brands.

In 1945, with the war over, Filey was re-opened as a holiday camp. The camps at Skegness & Clacton opened in 1946, Ayr and Pwllheli in 1947 and [[Mosney]] on the east coast of Ireland in 1948. Butlins became popular in post-war Britain, with family entertainment and activities available for the equivalent of a week's pay.

In 1948 Billy Butlin acquired two hotels in the Bahamas, and in the 1950s Butlins began opening hotels in England and Wales: [[Saltdean]], [[Brighton]] (1953), [[Blackpool]] (1955) and five in [[Cliftonville]] (1955–1956). Further post-war camps were opened in the 1960s at [[Bognor Regis]] (1960), [[Minehead]] (1962) and [[Barry Island]] (1966).

The camps at Ayr and Skegness also had separate self-contained hotels within their grounds. In later years, they were joined by further hotels in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] (1978), [[Llandudno]] (1981), London (1993), a sixth hotel at Cliftonville and one in Spain (1983). In the 1960s and 1970s, the company also operated the ''Top of the Tower'' revolving restaurant at the then-named [[BT Tower|Post Office Tower]] in London.   
 
In 1968 Billy Butlin's son Bobby took over the management of Butlins, and in 1972 the business was sold to the [[Rank Organisation]] for £43&nbsp;million. The number of camps peaked at ten between 1966 and 1980, but the business experienced the problems of the British seaside holiday industry in general, with the introduction of cheap [[package holiday]]s to [[Mediterranean]] [[resort]]s from the 1960s onwards. It also had a specific image problem of being seen as providing regimented holidays, which caused it to all but abandon the Butlins name at its remaining resorts between 1987 and 1990.

The camps at Clacton and Filey closed in 1983, and the camp at Barry was sold in 1986 (eventually closing in 1996). The lease on the ''Top of the Tower'' restaurant expired in 1980. In 1998 the camps at Ayr and Pwllheli were re-branded as Haven Park. All the Butlins hotels of the 1950s to 1990s were sold in 1998, but most are still open today under different ownership. The [[art deco]] style Ocean Hotel at Saltdean has been redeveloped into apartments, and the hotels at Cliftonville have both been demolished.

In April 1998 the "Holiday Worlds" branding was dropped for the remaining resorts in favour of returning the emphasis to the core Butlins name. Subsequently in September 2000,<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/rank-says-goodbye-to-redcoats-in-pound700m-sale-700020.html</ref> the resorts and brand were sold to Bourne Leisure. A new Butlins logo was also introduced in mid-1998, which has subsequently undergone several modifications and was used until 2011, when Butlins introduced a design similar to their original logo. The new logo was originally supposed to be only used temporarily to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Butlins, but its use continued into 2012 and 2013 and is now the official logo.

In 2005, the new £10&nbsp;million Shoreline hotel was unveiled at the Bognor Regis resort to expand on the existing variety of apartments on the site. The hotel, styled with an [[Art Deco]] theme, aimed to offer luxury accommodation in conjunction with the entertainment and facilities at the resort. Each of the 160 rooms features floor-to-ceiling windows, twin or king-size beds, leatherette chairs, televisions, [[DVD player]]s and [[En-suite|en-suite facilities]]. Some have sea views.  A second hotel, called "Ocean Hotel" opened at Bognor in 2009 styled to a high contemporary standard.

In addition to these main locations known at various times as "Holiday Camps", "Holiday Centres", "Holiday Villages", "Holiday Worlds" and more recently as "Resorts", Butlins also operated numerous smaller holiday parks in England and France for several years during the late 1970s. These were known as "Freshfields holidays" and were more basic parks with far fewer facilities and little or no entertainment. They were aimed at those wanting a quieter, more relaxed holiday.<ref>[http://www.butlinsmemories.com/brochuresimages/summer1978/id63.htm Information on Butlins smaller parks from 1978 brochure]</ref>

==Facilities==

===Accommodation===
[[File:Blue Skies.jpg|left|thumb|Blue Skies Apartments in Minehead]]

Butlins resorts offer various accommodation options to cater for different tastes and budgets. These range from "Standard" rooms and apartments to "Silver", "Gold", and "Deluxe" rooms and apartments for higher levels of luxury. There are also "BlueSkies" apartments available at Minehead, and 3 luxury hotels at Butlin's Bognor.

Butlins is widely known for its iconic "chalet" accommodation, which was originally the only form of accommodation and consisted of many long lines of single bedrooms in blocks known as "chalet lines". These were arranged so that each line of chalets faced another line, with a grassed area in the middle. Originally there were no toilets in individual chalets (campers had to use communal toilet blocks located in the middle of every few chalet lines) and the furnishings were very basic. Many of these chalet lines are still in use today, but have been enlarged and significantly upgraded to modern standards. All chalets now have en-suite bathroom facilities.

One of the very first chalets is still standing at the Skegness resort, and is now heritage listed and a historical display only.<ref>[http://www.butlins.com/accommodation// Accommodation information on Butlins website]. Butlins (17 May 2011). Retrieved on 13 July 2011.</ref>

===Skyline Pavilion===
[[File:Skyline Pavilion, Minehead, Somerset (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|Skyline Pavilion in Minehead]]

The "Skyline Pavilion" is a large area within each resort that is enclosed under a white tensile fabric canopy. These were created in 1998 by linking together several pre-existing buildings so that space within those buildings could be used to provide all-weather facilities within the Skyline Pavilions.

Each Skyline Pavilion contains a stage (used mainly for daytime children's shows), a cafe and associated seating, a bar (known as Bar Rosso or The Jellyfish Lounge), restaurants such as [[Burger King]], an amusement arcade, an information counter (termed "infunmation point"), and various shops selling novelties, souvenirs, and groceries. Many of the other venues and attractions in the resort can be accessed directly from within the Skyline Pavilion also.

===Splash Waterworld===
Each resort features a large indoor waterpark known as Splash Waterworld. These contain several waterslides, spas, a wave pool, and a lazy river. There is also a shallow pool area for young children, and sometimes an area for "serious" swimming. Skegness and Minehead also have an outdoor toddlers pool that is open in the summer months. Guests and day visitors can use these facilities at no additional cost. Skegness resort has recently opened a £16&nbsp;million redevelopment of the Splash Waterworld that features 2 new octane flumes (Jet Stream and Vortex, which has a space-bowl) a new dinghy ride (The Riptide), a rope-walk challenge (Captain's Challenge) a lazy river, a poolside cafe and DJ. It also has a new outdoor fountain area that replaced the outdoor pool, the fountains go along with music (every hour) and lights.

===Entertainment===
[[File:Crazy Horse Bar.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Crazy Horse cabaret bar]]
There are various entertainment venues within the resorts including two large showbars known as "Centre Stage" and "Reds". Additionally there are [[Associated British Cinemas|ABC cinemas]], "Jaks" (a nightclub), "Crazy Horse" (an older style cabaret bar), "Hotshots" 10-pin bowling centre with bar and snooker tables, "Green Baize" snooker hall (originally at all camps but now at Skegness only), and several additional bars, pubs, and cafes which vary from one Butlins resort to another. Nearly all entertainment is included in the cost of the holiday or day visitor entry. Most recently, in May 2013 was the opening of the character theater in Bognor which is in the place of the cinema.

===Sports and recreation===
Butlins resorts offer a variety of sports sessions and coaching, for example archery, fencing, tennis (Skegness only), table tennis, and soccer. Most of these sessions are included in the cost of holiday or day visitor entry price.

For general recreation, facilities include multi-sports courts, adventure golf, adventure playgrounds, water zorbing, high ropes courses, funfair, inflatable castles / pillows, and go-karts.  Minehead resort also offers bumper boats, donkey rides, use of the adjacent golf course, and "Exmoore Adventures" country leisure pursuits. An additional charge usually applies for most of these activities, although the funfair is free.

Skegness and Bognor resorts each have a spa complex for massage, swimming, facials and other popular spa treatments.

===Children's activities===
There are a number of attractions and facilities at each resort provided especially for younger children. These include playgrounds, a supervised arts & crafts room, "[[Bob the Builder|Bob's Yard]]" (miniature funfair), a "Junior driving school" with small go-karts for children, and a nursery which can care for children and keep them entertained whilst parents enjoy other activities in the resort.

==Minehead==
[[File:Butlins Minehead Resort October 2010 typical scene.JPG|right|thumb|A typical scene at Butlins Minehead, October 2010]]
{{main|Minehead (holiday camp)}}
Butlins [[Minehead]] was opened to the public on 26 May 1962. It underwent substantial renovation in the 1980s, being renamed ''Somerwest World''. In 1998 it was renovated again with the construction of a Skyline Pavilion. Since 1999 the Minehead resort has undergone further aesthetic upgrades. However, most of the original buildings remain, including almost all the original chalets. As such Minehead is now the last remaining Butlins camp that is still largely as Sir Billy designed it.

==Mosney==
[[File:Irl Butlins Mosney.jpg|right|thumb|Butlins [[Mosney]], [[County Meath]], Ireland was the first camp to be built outside Great Britain. It was sold in 1982.]]
{{main|Butlin's Mosney}}
Mosney was the first Butlins camp outside the UK. The camp opened in 1948, occupying some 200 acres (0.81 km2) of a former country estate. In 1982, Butlins sold the camp, which was renamed ''Mosney Holiday Centre''. The camp continued without substantive changes, however the last season for Mosney was 2000. Dwindling visitor numbers and problems finding staff for the short 12-week season eventually led to the camp's closure. In December 2000 a five-year deal was signed with the government to turn Mosney into a refugee centre. Mosney is now home to 700 refugees from over 20 different countries. Like Minehead, most of the original buildings remain, including all the original chalets. Mosney is the only camp that has changed little since it was opened.

Butlins [[Skegness]] was the first of Billy Butlin's holiday camps. The camp opened in 1936 but was taken over for military use in 1939, and known as [[HMS Royal Arthur (shore establishment)|HMS Royal Arthur]]. The camp reopened to holidaymakers in 1946. In 1987 the site underwent renovation with the construction of a modern fun pool and modernised accommodation, at this time the site was renamed ''Funcoast World''. In 1998 it was renovated again with the construction of a Skyline Pavilion and since that time has undergone further improvements and maintenance in 2011 the resort underwent more development with the introduction of a new guest catering restaurant called the deck, a new Italian styled restaurant called ludo's (named after the dinosaur that appeared in the 2010/11 TV adverts) in 2013 the new splash waterworld opened adding a new 16million state of the art pool area to the resort and plans have recently been submitted to modernise the resort once again with further investment into new restaurants and stores.

==Special events==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}

==Music weekends==
Butlins music weekends are over 18s only and are offered regularly across all of the three resorts. Each weekend has a different musical theme, including soul music, alternative, folk, disco, and rock and blues. They also have decade themed weekends from 60s to 00s. 
Butlins Music Weekends have played host to big name acts such as Beverley Knight, Brand New Heavies, Toyah, The Buzzcocks, Rick Astley, David Gest & Friends and many more. Madness have also held three weekends in Minehead on their House of Fun tour, taking over the whole resort for the weekend.

===Spring Harvest===
{{Main |Spring Harvest}}
The largest Christian conference in Europe takes place at the Minehead and Skegness sites every Easter. The event attracts some 55,000 Christians from a range of denominations and plays host to many preachers, Christian musicians and dramatic artists. In previous years, the event has also been hosted at the Ayr and Pwllheli camps.

===All Tomorrow's Parties===
{{main |All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)}}
'''All Tomorrow's Parties''' is a music festival which takes place at Minehead.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/dec/11/popandrock.festivals "ATP: The Nightmare Before Christmas"] The Guardian, 12 December 2007</ref> Named after the song "[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]" by [[the Velvet Underground]], it is an alternative to larger mainstream festivals and is presented in a more intimate environment than a giant stadium or huge country field. ''All Tomorrow's Parties'' is a sponsorship-free festival where the organisers and artists stay in the same accommodation as the fans.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/arts/music/03parties.html ".Flouting the Mainstream, Forgoing a Corporate Stamp"] The New York Times, 9 February 2010</ref>

===Bloc Weekend===
{{main |Bloc Weekend}}
'''Bloc Weekend''' is an annual music festival, devoted to [[electronic music]] of several genres, and incorporates both DJ sets and live shows. The first two Bloc events took place at [[Pontin's]] holiday camp in [[Norfolk]]. The 2009 event, which took place during 13–15 March, was moved to the larger Minehead resort. The 5,000 capacity event still sold out before the festival began. In 2010 and 2011, Bloc returned to Minehead for another sold-out show.

==Butlins and Dodgem Cars==
Dodgem Cars, a brand of [[bumper cars]], were manufactured in the USA by Dodgem Cars Ltd. Billy Butlin saw them and obtained the UK [[Franchising|franchise]]. As a result, a Skegness funfair owned by Billy Butlin saw the first Dodgems cars in the UK in 1923.

==Butlins Beaver Club on the radio==
In 1956 '''Butlins Beaver Club''' – ''with Uncle Eric Winstrone'' was heard in the United Kingdom and much of continental Europe on Sunday nights at 6:00&nbsp;pm over the 208&nbsp;m wavelength of [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]].

==Reds TV==
The origins of the in-house TV system began in 1995 when Butlins decided to make use of the then 'empty' fifth channel (Channel 5 was still two years away from its launch). A teletext system was installed, together with a backing of incidental music, overseen by Redcoat/Stage Manager [[Tony Filer]] – and piped through to the guests' chalets to provide first an alternative, then an accompaniment to the printed programme of events. Filer (now a successful radio producer) installed a video camera in the new 'studio' to enable visiting celebrity interviews and 'Know your Redcoats' discussions to be shown. The Butlins 'Channel 5' name was changed to 'BTV' a year before the new fifth terrestrial TV channel emerged – and later became known as 'Reds TV'.

==Publicity==

===Butlins Badges===
[[File:butlins skegness 1938.jpg|thumb|right|Butlins Badge Skegness 1938]]
[[File:butlins filey 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Butlins Badge Filey 1945]]
[[File:butlins blackpool 1961.jpg|thumb|right|Butlins Badge Blackpool 1961]]
When booking in on arrival at Butlins (camp or hotel) each camper was issued with an enamel badge to wear for the duration of their holiday. The badge granted the camper readmission to the site should they take a trip out during their stay. Badges were worn with pride. Campers kept badges from previous holidays and wore them all on a ribbon.

Each year a different badge was produced for each camp with the name of the camp and the year forming part of the design.

The badges were made of [[die (manufacturing)|die]]-stamped metal (usually [[brass]]), highly polished or [[chrome plating|chrome plated]] with the brightly coloured design made of [[vitreous enamel]] using a process similar to [[Champlevé]] but the troughs being stamped in rather than carved.

Each camp had at least one badge each year, with most of the larger camps having several colour variations throughout the season for improved security. Occasionally, two different designs would be used in one season.

Each badge was handmade by jewellery manufacturers in London, Dublin or in Birmingham's 'Jewellery Quarter'. The quality and beauty of the badges has ensured that many survive as heirlooms and are very collectable.

A collection of one badge per camp per year would total 192 badges. However, the myriad colour variations and additional 'special' badges would take the collection to over 1200 badges (although there is no definitive list of all variations).

Additional badges included 'Second Week' badges, Staff badges, 'Concessionaire' badges (for visiting tradesmen – these badges are distinguished by the absence of enamel), Committee badges, Christmas badges, Beaver Club badges, Reunion badges and many others.
Badges were not issued during [[Second World War]] years of 1940 to 1945 as the camps were taken over by the government and used as accommodation for war service personnel.

Notable badges include 'Skegness 1936' (the first badge issued) and 'Filey 1945', which features the 'V for Victory' in its design and is an exception to gap of the war years as the camp was the first to reopen after the war just in time for the end of the season in August 1945.

Barry Island 1965 is the 'Holy Grail' of Butlins badges: the camp didn't open that year as planned. The badges were manufactured but never issued; some examples survive.

The original badges were issued every year from 1936 until 1967. In recent years Butlins has again begun selling similar style badges in their on-resort souvenir shops. Some of these are of a more modern design, whilst some are close or exact replicas of badges from Butlins earlier days. The current badges however serve no purpose in identifying guests and are available purely as nostalgic souvenirs. Many regular guests like to swap badges with Butlins staff, who often have special badges to swap which are not otherwise available to guests. The badge collection ribbons are also sold in Butlins shops and may be used to pin multiple badges to.

Members of the Premier Club (Butlins loyalty club for regular guests) receive a free badge each time they visit, with a new design given each year.<ref>[http://www.butlins.com/premier-club/offers-and-benefits/benefits.aspx#tabnav/ Premier Club Benefits on Butlins website]. Butlins. Retrieved on 13 July 2011.</ref>

===Slogans===
[[File:Butlins 1960 Poster.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A Butlins advertisement from 1960]]
Throughout most of its history, Butlins has regularly advertised using various media. Examples of slogans include:
*2014 to present'' Butlins by the sea'' same as the 1960s slogan
* 2012 to 2014 "Our True Intent Is All For Your Delight" (a return to the very first, William Shakespeare-inspired slogan used by Sir Billy Butlin)

* 2010 "Isn't it time you came round to Butlins?"
* 2007–2009 "Altogether More Fun"

* Early 1980s "A little bit of this, and quite a lot of that"
* 1970s "Butlinland is Freedomland" and "A holiday that's out of this world" (well known campaign that featured two blue-skinned alien characters called Toot and Ploot in various Butlin's locations).
* 1960s "You'll have a really wonderful time at Butlins by the sea"
* Early slogans from the 1930s to 1950s included "Our True Intent Is All For Your Delight", "A weeks holiday for a weeks pay", "Holidays are Jollidays" and "Holidays with pay. Holidays with play!"

==Butlins in popular culture==
Due to its immense popularity and cultural significance as a major force in improving the standard of holidays for the British public, Butlins has appeared in popular culture too many times to list here. However, below are a few notable examples.

The 1947 film ''[[Holiday Camp (film)|Holiday Camp]]'' was filmed mainly on location at [[Butlins Filey]], although the [[establishing shot]] was of Butlins Skegness.

On the show ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'' (Season 3, Episode #1 - first aired September 27, 1973) there was a sketch parodying the BBC war drama [[Colditz (TV series)|''Colditz'']]. The two main characters finally escape over the wall of the infamous POW camp, only to wake up in a worse one - a dreary place called "Butlitz" (a spoof of Butlins, where the German guards are dressed like [[Butlins Redcoats|Redcoats]]).

During the 1980s the [[BBC]] produced a [[satire|satirical]] sitcom called ''[[Hi-de-Hi!]]'' set in "Maplin's", a farcical holiday camp loosely styled on Butlins in its early days. Its producers and writers (Jimmy Perry and David Croft) had themselves been redcoats at Butlins. More recently a documentary series called ''[[Redcoats (Butlins)#Redcoats TV series|Redcoats]]'' followed Redcoats through their seasons at Butlins.

In the film version of The Who's ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'' (1975) there is a 'Bernie's Holiday Camp' where Tommy's mother meets her new husband.

In the television show ''[[Greatest Hits (Lost)|Lost]]'' the character of [[Charlie Pace]] learns to swim with his father at a Butlins camp.

The 1987 Doctor Who TV serial ''[[Delta and the Bannermen]]'' was filmed mainly at the Butlins Holiday camp on Barry Island, Wales. The camp is referred to as the 'Shangri-La' holiday camp, run by 'Burton'.

Many books have been written about Butlins and its history, and about the life of Sir Billy Butlin. Some of the best known of these are:

There have also been a number of children's fiction books which include Butlins as a location or an integral part of the story. For example:

'''Mount Eccles''' is an [[inactive volcano]] in southwestern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] near [[Macarthur, Victoria|Macarthur]]. The [[Gunditjmara]] name for the mountain is [[Budj Bim]] meaning ''High Head''. The roughly conical shaped peak rises {{convert|178|m|ft|0}}.<ref name="noex">{{Citation |last=Eussen |first=Dick |title=Northern Extravaganza |newspaper=On the Road |page=64 |date=March 2011}}</ref>  The peak is a scoria hill that was thrown up beside a group of three overlapping [[volcano|volcanic]] craters that now contain Lake Surprise. A line of smaller craters and scoria cones runs to the southeast.  Lava flows extend to form a [[shield volcano]] and are fed by several [[lava channel]]s, or "lava canals" as they are known locally.

Initial estimates of the age of the eruption were all "minimum ages" from swamps that formed some time after the eruption and ranged from 6000 to 27,000 years,<ref name="kg-age">{{cite web |url=http://www.hamilton-field-naturalists-club-victoria.org.au/images/pdf/D/VolcAgesKG.pdf |title=The Ages of Our Volcanoes |accessdate=2014-08-05 |first=Ken |last=Grimes |year=2013}}</ref> but the latest evidence suggests that the eruption was at least 30,000 years ago (using dated sediments in the floor of the Lake Surprise crater<ref name="kg-age"/>) and could have been as old as 40,000 for the Tyrendarra lava flow.<ref name="kg-age"/>

The mountain was named Mount Eeles in 1836 by Major [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] after William Eeles of the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|95th Regiment of Foot]] who fought with Mitchell in the [[Peninsular War]].

[[Mount Eccles National Park]] at Lake Surprise encompasses {{convert|61.2|km2|sqmi|0}} and includes many interesting geologic features such as lava flows, lava caves, scoria cones and crater lakes. The park has a campground and the base of the vents supports Lake Surprise, a popular swimming hole in summer.

'''Beanie Babies''' are a line of popular [[Stuffed toy|stuffed animal]]s, made by [[Ty Warner|Ty Warner Inc.]], which was later renamed as [[Ty Inc.]] in late 1993. Each toy has an inner "posable lining"{{clarify|date=April 2014}} and is stuffed with plastic pellets (or "beans") rather than conventional stuffing (see [[polyvinylchloride|PVC]] and [[polyethylene|PE]]), giving Beanie Babies a flexible feel. In a rare interview Warner said "The whole idea was it looked real because it moved.”<ref name=Chicago/>

==History==
Nine original Beanie Babies were launched in 1993: Legs the Frog, Squealer the Pig, Spot the Dog, Flash the Dolphin, Splash the Whale, Chocolate the Moose, Patti the Platypus, Brownie the Bear (later renamed "Cubbie"), and Pinchers the Lobster (with some tag errors with "Punchers") .<ref>{{Cite news | title = Those Beanies are still hot, and there's no sign of the crazNe slowing down | author = Amy Carr | date = August 14, 1997 | publisher = [[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]] | quote = Punchers the red lobster. Originally introduced in 1993, Punchers was redesigned in 1994 and renamed Pinchers. | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=ADHB&p_theme=adhb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0ED02839938D2BE6&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM }}</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=qcp5t41rfMYC&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=%22original+nine%22+%22beanie+babies%22&source=web&ots=GgKfYQerAE&sig=QV2Fy7YyeuHXYkIsKU6EYUwDvno&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=10&ct=result The Perfect Store: Inside eBay] via Google Books</ref>

In 1996, Ty Inc. released a new product called [[Teenie Beanies]], a miniature offshoot of the original Beanie Babies line. They were sold alongside [[McDonalds]] [[Happy Meal]]s to celebrate that product's 25th anniversary.<ref name=Chicago/>

Ty, Inc. stopped producing the product in 1999, but consumer demand led them to reconsider.<ref name=Chicago>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Bryan|title=Behind the Beanie Babies: The Secret Life of Ty Warner|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/May-2014/Ty-Warner/|accessdate=April 26, 2014|newspaper=Chicago Magazine|date=May 2014}}</ref> Production restarted in 2000 with a Beanie Baby named "The Beginning."

In early 2008, Ty released a new version of Beanie Babies was called [[Beanie Babies 2.0]]. The purchase of a Beanie Baby 2.0 provided its owner with a code to access a Beanie Babies interactive website.

==Collectibility==
Beanie Babies began to emerge as popular [[Collecting|collectibles]] in late 1995, and became a [[fad|hot toy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboutbeanies.com/news/1996/article.cgi?article=1996_05_31_Beanie_Babies_Take_Their_Place_In_Must_Have_Spotlight.txt |title=Ty Beanie Baby Beanies News |publisher=Aboutbeanies.com |accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref> The company's strategy of deliberate scarcity, producing each new design in limited quantity, restricting individual store shipments to limited numbers of each design and regularly retiring designs, created a huge secondary market for the toys and increased their popularity and value as a collectible.<ref name=Chicago/>

Ty systematically [[Retirement (Beanie Babies)|retired]] various designs, and many people assumed that all "retired" designs would rise in value the way that early retirees had. The craze lasted through 1999 and slowly declined after the Ty company announced that they would no longer be making Beanie Babies and made a bear called "The End".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboutbeanies.com/news/1999/article.cgi?article=1999_09_01_Beanie_Babies_is_the_Party_Over.txt |title=Ty Beanie Baby Beanies News |publisher=Aboutbeanies.com |accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref> Some time after the original announcement that the company would stop production, Ty asked the public to vote on whether the product should continue; fans and collectors voted "overwhelmingly" to keep the toys on the market.<ref name=Chicago/>

==Design==
Since the beginning, Beanie Babies have included two tags for identification: a heart-shaped "swing tag" at the top, and a fabric "tush tag" at the bottom. Both tags have been redesigned completely over time. Between 1994 and 1996, the swing tags had "To" and "From" blanks in them for use as gifts. Starting in early 1996, the tags include four-line poems related to the Beanie Baby, and a date of birth for the toy.  The poem and birthday concept was created by Lina Trivedi who is credited as authoring the poems on the first 136 poems that were introduced to the marketplace.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wolkoff|first=Melanie|date=December 2000|title=The Girl With The Midas Touch, What Lina Trivedi Touches Turns to Gold – Just Ask Ty Warner|journal=[[Mary Beth's Bean Bag World]]|publisher=H&S Media Incorporated|volume=4|issue=3|pages=56–59|issn=1520-7005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Van West|first=Patricia E.|date=September 1999|title=Lina Trivedi – The First Beanie Poet & Webmaster|journal=Becky and Becky's Beanie Mania|publisher=Beanie Mania LLC|volume=2|issue=1|pages=42–43|issn=1099-4874}}</ref>

It was not uncommon for Beanie Babies to be accidentally shipped out with incorrect or misspelled tags, which sometimes increased the toy's value. On occasion, the poems, birth dates and even the names have been changed on certain Beanie Babies.<ref name="tag">{{cite journal|last=Dunne|first=Claudia|author2=Sara Nelson|date=September 1998|title=Tag Training 101|journal=[[Mary Beth's Bean Bag World]]|publisher=H&S Media Incorporated|volume=1|issue=7|pages=20–28|issn=1097-0444}}</ref>

==Notable Beanie Babies==
{{main|List of Beanie Babies}}

===Garcia the bear===
'''Garcia''' the bear was released in January 1996 and retired in May 1997. He is a [[tie-dye]]d bear that seems to be a tribute to [[Jerry Garcia]] of [[The Grateful Dead]], designed by Nicholas Scarborough. A group of differently colored dancing bears, originally artwork from the back of an album cover, was one of the band's many iconic images. The guitarist and the bear share a birthday, but the bear was supposedly "born" the year that Jerry died (Aug 9, 1995). The fast retirement for this Beanie Baby was due to an alleged lawsuit that the Garcia family filed against the Ty company, claiming that the name "Garcia" was used without permission from the family. In cooperation with the lawsuit, Garcia was retired and a similar bear named '''Peace''' was released.

The bright colors on Garcia the bear made him one of the most popular Beanie Baby styles.<ref>[http://magazine.peacebears.com/ Peace Mania Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Princess the bear===

[[Diana, Princess of Wales]] died on August 31, 1997. Warner announced the Beanie Baby Princess on October 29, 1997 in honor of Princess Diana.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/05/magazine/sunday-july-5-1998-crime-a-world-gone-beanie-mad.html?scp=2&sq=beanie%20bears&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1998: CRIME; A World Gone Beanie Mad! | date=1998-07-05}}</ref> Warner said that all proceeds would be donated to the Diana, [[Princess of Wales Memorial Fund]]. The Princess Diana Beanie Baby was sent to vendors to distribute in the second week of December 1997. Some vendors had to wait until February 1998. Only 12 Beanie Baby Princesses were released to each vendor initially, but this changed due to strong demand.

===Decade the bear===
''Decade'' the bear was made in honor of Beanie Babies' tenth anniversary. Decade bears were made in white, royal blue, red, purple, orange, hot pink, green, gold, brown, and light blue. Most ''Decade'' bears have silver sparkles on their bodies.

===Tabasco the bull===

Named after [[tabasco sauce]]. The name was changed to "Snort" to avoid trademark infringement.

==Counterfeit Beanie Babies==
Counterfeit Beanie Babies began to surface in 1997. Early on, cheap knock-offs and fakes of commons were widely available at discount prices.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB42371A5477CDA&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | title=Chicago Sun-Times:: Search | first=SUSAN DODGE | last=Date | date=1998-01-09 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref>

===Cases===
Authorities cracked down on counterfeit Beanie Babies in the late 1990s with some prosecuted for involvement in their commerce. In 1998, [[England|English]] authorities seized more than 6000 [[Princess (Beanie Baby)|Princesses]] and Britannias.<ref>http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19416915.html</ref> In 1999, a Minnesota man was imprisoned, fined, and put on probation for involvement in smuggling counterfeit beanies.<ref>http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62458632.html</ref>

==Media==
During the wake of Beanie Babies' success, Beanie Baby-centric publications were issued. One of the largest was ''[[Mary Beth's Bean Bag World]]'', a monthly magazine dedicated to Beanie Babies and competing plush toys. This magazine ran from 1997 to 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-58151402.html|title=Want The 'Scoop' On The Beanie Industry For The Millennium? |date=1999-12-10|work=PR Newswire|accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref>

==Competitors==
Other plush toy lines were made in competition with Beanie Babies, including [[Puffkins]]. Another toy line, [[Meanies]], was created as a satirical counterpart.

==Licensed Beanies==
In the late 2000s, Beanie Babies modeled after characters from popular children's franchises by [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]], [[DreamWorks]] and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] began appearing. These included characters from [[cartoons]] on the Nickelodeon television channel such as ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'', as well as characters from [[DreamWorks Animation]] movies such as ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and 20th Century Fox's [[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]. Beanie Babies have also been produced for characters from the Legend of the Guardians 2010 film and Guardians of Ga'Hoole book series. Recently Beanie Babies modified after Disney characters have been created, including characters from the [[Disney Junior]] TV series [[Doc McStuffins]].

The '''Jæren Line''' ({{lang-no|Jærbanen}}) {{convert|74.7|km|sp=us|adj=on}} long [[railway]] line between [[Stavanger]] and [[Egersund]] in [[Jæren]], [[Norway]]. The name is longer in official use and the section is regarded as the  westernmost part of the [[Sørlandet Line]]. Owned by the [[Norwegian National Rail Administration]], the line has [[double track]] from [[Stavanger Station]] to [[Sandnes Station]], and [[single track (rail)|single track]] from Sandnes to [[Egersund Station]]. The line is [[railway electrification system|electrified]] at {{15 kV AC}} and equipped with [[centralized traffic control]] and [[GSM-R]]. The line is served by the [[Jæren Commuter Rail]] and intercity trains along the Sørlandet Line, both operated by the [[Norwegian State Railways]]. [[CargoNet]] runs container freight trains on the line, which terminate at [[Ganddal Freight Terminal]].

The line opened as a {{RailGauge|1067mm}} [[narrow gauge]] stand-alone line on 27 February 1878. The railway was extended from Egersund to [[Flekkefjord]] as the [[Flekkefjord Line]] in 1904. The Jæren Line's only branch, the [[Ålgård Line]] from [[Ganddal]] to [[Ålgård]], opened in 1924. In 1944, the Sørlandet Line was extended to [[Sira, Norway|Sira]] on the Flekkefjord Line, and the Jæren Line was integrated in the main railway network. Because of this, the line was converted to [[standard gauge]].

==History==
[[File:Railway and windmill at Nærbø.jpg|thumb|left|The narrow-gauged Jæren Line and a windmill at Hå in 1912]]

===Construction===
During the 19th century, transport along the Jæren coast was dominated by ship. Some simple roads had been built, but these were insufficient for quick and efficient transport. In the mid-19th century, the roads were improved, and ideas were launched to start a [[traction engine]] service along the coast. At an 1866 meeting at the sheriff's office in, Forest Manager [[Andreas Tanberg Gløersen]] launched the first idea of building a railway to connect Stavanger and Egersund. Gløersen had been to the Netherlands where he had taken and observed train operations. Later the same year, a meeting was held with representatives from the municipalities of Hå, Klepp and Time.<ref>Jubileumskomitéen Sørlandsbanen Vest (1994): 6</ref>

The meeting concluded that a railway should be built, and the responsibility for the preparatory work was given to [[County governor (Norway)|County Governor]] [[Vilhelm Ludvig Herman von Munthe af Morgenstierne]]. He started by conducting traffic counting throughout the district. This resulted in an estimate for a revenue of NOK&nbsp;215,000 and a cost of NOK&nbsp;153,000 per year.<ref name=jsv7>Jubileumskomitéen Sørlandsbanen Vest (1994): 7</ref> Originally the proposal was to connect the various villages in Jæren together. But during planning, national authorities stated that the line would be part of a trans-national railway that would connect Rogaland to [[Eastern Norway]]. This resulted in the railway being planned with a straighter profile and running via fewer communities.<ref name=jsv7 /><ref name=jsv8>Jubileumskomitéen Sørlandsbanen Vest (1994): 8</ref>

[[File:Jærbanen gjennom Hå 3.jpg|thumb|left|The narrow-gauged Jæren Line near [[Ogna]] in 1908]]
The proposal was sent to the [[Ministry of the Interior (Norway)|Ministry of the Interior]], who recommended the line and presented it to [[Parliament of Norway|Parliament]] on 6 May 1874.<ref>Bergsgård (1964): 208</ref> Parliament passed legislation to build the line on 3 June 1874.<ref name=b194 /> During the celebrations in Stavanger that evening, a gunner lost his hand following the explosion of a cannon.<ref name=jsv7 /> Particularly in Sandnes the choice of route resulted in much debate. Parliament had in its proposal for the line stipulated that the railway should have good port access in Sandnes.<ref name=e28>Eggebø (1996): 28</ref> The "Blue Line" proposal ran along the waterfront, but would require two different stations in Sandnes. The "Red Line" proposal ran midway through the town center, splitting it in two. However, it gave only a single station, and was eventually chosen, after the municipal council initially had supported the Blue Line.<ref name=e29>Eggebø (1996): 29</ref>

Construction started in October 1874 on the section between Forus and Gausel. Tracks were shipped to [[Norestraen]], which was the southern-most docks which were sufficiently deep to allow the ships.<ref name=e28 /> When the railway was passed, the country was experiencing good times, but through the 1870s, the country fell into harder times. This caused a reduction in spending on the line, which was particularly in investments in stations. A standardized, small station building was chosen and in Egersund an existing house was bought.<ref>Hartmann (1997): 54</ref> The line opened on 27 February 1878,<ref name=jsv8/> and was at the time of opening {{convert|76.3|km|sp=us}} long.<ref name=b194 /> When the line opened, it had no tunnels and only twelve stations.<ref name=b201 /><ref name=b200 /> Already the following year, additional stations were opened in Sirevåg, Brusand,<ref name=b200 /> and Hognestad. Hillevåg opened in 1880 and Mariero opened in the 1880s.<ref name=b201 />

===Branches and gauge conversion===
[[File:Btd brueland.jpg|thumb|left|The yard at Brueland]]
On 5 February 1875, the parliamentary [[Standing Committee on Railways]] published a report recommending that there be built four trans-national railways to connect western and central Norway to eastern Norway. The Sørlandet Line was part of this plan, and was scheduled to be built between 1876 and 1888.<ref>Jubileumskomitéen Sørlandsbanen Vest (1994): 9</ref> The line was proposed to be built via the [[Vestfold Line]] to [[Skien]] and onwards along the [[Southern Norway|south coast]] before connecting with the Jæren Line at Egersund. However, Norway was hit by the [[Depression of 1882–85]], which reduced railway construction to a minimum. In addition, controversy arose over which route should be chosen through [[Agder]]: along the populated coast or through the sparsely populated interior. This issue kept the line at bay, and not until 1908 was a decision made in favor of the interior route.<ref>Jubileumskomitéen Sørlandsbanen Vest (1994): 10</ref>

In 1894, the Railway Committee recommended parliament to prioritize three new lines, the [[Bergen Line]], the [[Rauma Line]] and the [[Gjøvik Line]]. However, this met protests from representatives from Agder, and it became clear that there would not be a majority to build the Bergen Line unless part of the Sørlandet Line was built. [[Jørgen Løvland]] proposed a compromise in which the Flekkefjord Line be built from Egersund to Flekkefjord, as the first part of the Sørlandet Line, as well as the [[Treungen Line]]. The Flekkefjord Line opened on 31 October 1904.<ref>Jubileumskomitéen Sørlandsbanen Vest (1994): 11</ref> The same year, stations were opened at Forus and Gausel.<ref name=b201 />

The Ålgård Line was originally launched as an alternative route for the Sørlandet Line. In 1910, a committee was appointed to conduct preliminary planning. Although NSB's board supported the line, construction was placed on hold. In 1919, local politicians proposed that the line be built administratively as part of the Jæren Line, but this was rejected by the government.<ref>Thime (1999): 8</ref> Instead, the ministry wanted to again consider the Ålgård Line as part of the Sørlandet Line, and proposed that the Ålgård Line be built with standard gauge—which would be used for the Sørlandet Line—instead of the narrow gauge used by the Jæren Line. However, there would be no need for standard gauge until the Sørlandet Line was extended to Rogaland, so the line was planned to be built with narrow gauge track, but all other installations would be prepared for standard gauge.<ref>Thime (1999): 9</ref> The first train to operate on the line went from Stavanger on 20 December 1924,<ref name=t13>Thime (1999): 13</ref> and the Ålgård Line became the last state-owned railway in Norway to be opened with narrow gauge.<ref name=a227>Aspenberg (1994): 227</ref> Not until 1930 was a branch built from the railway station in Sandnes to the port.<ref name=e29 />

The Sørlandet Line was being built in standard gauge, and when the line was to connect to the Flekkefjord Line at [[Moi Station]], the Jæren Line would have to be rebuilt to standard gauge to avoid a [[break-of-gauge]]. Preliminary work to ease the conversion was done during the 1920s.<ref name=jsv46>Jubileumskomitéen Sørlandsbanen Vest (1994): 46</ref> The conversion itself took only two days, during which the line was closed. On 29 April 1944, a test train was run from [[Sira, Norway|Sira]] to Stavanger. The upgrade was officially opened on 1 May, after which the Jæren Line was connected to Oslo, and considered part of the Sørlandet Line.<ref>Jubileumskomitéen Sørlandsbanen Vest (1994): 47</ref> When the Jæren Line was built, the station in Egersund was located in the city center. With the opening of the Sørlandet Line, a new station was built {{convert|1|km|sp=us|adj=on}} north of the city center.<ref name=jsv46/><ref name=j61>Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009a): 61</ref> The old station remained in use, despite being located on a dead-end track, as it was served by trains terminating in Egersund. However, this section of line was not converted to standard gauge until 1948. Passenger traffic was terminated from 25 September 1952, although the spur remained in use as a port line until 1986.<ref name=b195 />

With the change of gauge, NSB took the opportunity to change the route several places.<ref name=h94>Hartmann (1997): 94</ref> After these changes, including the move of the station in Egersund, the Jæren Line was reduced to a length of {{convert|73.1|km|sp=us}}.<ref name=b195 /> The changes included building twelve new tunnels on the section between Brusand and Egersund, of which nine were between Hellvik and Egersund.<ref name=b200 /> Another tunnel was built at Lurahammer in Sandnes.<ref name=b201 /> The tunnels opened between 1947 and 1950.<ref name=b201 /><ref name=b200 />

[[Sandnes]] became the third-largest intermediate stop on the Sørlandet Line, after [[Drammen Station]] and [[Kristiansand Station]]. To better the facilities for serving Sandnes, the track through the city center was rebuilt to an [[elevated railway]]. Given the unofficial name The High Line ({{lang-no|Høybanen}}), the new [[Sandnes Station]] was located further south of the center of Sandnes, at [[Skeiene]]. The new station and the elevated section opened on 1 October 1955.<ref name=hoybane /> Also a number of other stations were rebuilt, in part because they had become too small and in part because they needed to be moved because of line realignments during the gauge conversion. New station buildings were opened at Vigrestad in 1954, at Nærbø in 1955, at Sirevåg in 1956, at Bryne in 1958 and at Klepp and Varhaug in 1959.<ref name=h94 /> The 1950s also saw the establishment of a new depot at Kvaleberget.<ref name=h207>Hartmann (1997): 207</ref> New stations were established at Varden and Vardheia in 1956,<ref name=b200 /> Lyngnes in 1957 and Luravika in 1959. Tumarki Station was closed in 1957.<ref name=b201 />

In 1955, passenger traffic on the Ålgård Line was terminated, although sporadic freight traffic remained until 1988.<ref>Aspenberg (1994): 230</ref>  On 3 June 1956, the Jæren Line received electric traction.<ref>Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009b): 34</ref> With electrification, NSB introduced three weekly services with the [[NSB Class 66|Class 66]] multiple units, which were capable of {{convert|120|km/h|sp=us}}, but the service did not generate sufficient patronage and was terminated in 1958.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Snøggtogett type 66 |author=Fjeldstad, Odd T. |journal=[[På Sporet]] |year=1996 |volume=87 |pages=36–42}}</ref> The remaining long-haul trains were hauled using [[NSB El 11|El&nbsp;11]] locomotives.<ref>Aspenberg (2001): 82</ref> They were from the 1960s supplemented with [[NSB El 13|El&nbsp;13]] locomotives.<ref>Aspenberg (2001): 98</ref> The electrification also saw the introduction of [[electric multiple unit]]s for local trains. Originally this consisted of [[NSB Class 65|Class 65]]<ref>Aspenberg (2001): 139</ref> and five [[NSB Class 67|Class 67]]. In 1960, the Class 67 units were swapped with [[NSB Class 68|Class 68]] units.<ref>Aspenberg (2001): 157</ref>

After the [[Ofoten Line]], the Jæren Line was the first line in Norway to receive [[centralized traffic control]], which was taken into use on 20 March 1964. The section from Sandnes to Egersund followed suit on 7 July.<ref name=ctc /> In 1966, 18 stations were closed, consisting of Maurholen, Vatnanot, Stokkaland, Hogstad, Stavnheim, Odland, Dysjaland, Kvia, Tårland,<ref name=b200 /> Gjerdo, Vardheia, Laland, Engjelsvåg, Orstad, Skjæveland, Lura, Luravika and Vaulen.<ref name=b201 /> During the 1970s, [[NSB El 14|El&nbsp;14]] locomotives were gradually introduced on both freight and passenger trains.<ref>Aspenberg (2001): 105</ref>

===Commuter rail and double track===
[[File:Hellvik stasjon.jpg|thumb|[[Hellvik Station]]]]
The commuter rail system was introduced from 1 January 1992, after an agreement between NSB, [[Rogaland County Municipality]] and the six municipalities along the line. NSB introduced new [[NSB Class 69|Class 69]] multiple units, while the county municipality introduced a fare coordination with the corresponding bus services.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bedre togtilbud i Rogaland |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=31 August 1990 |page=11 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The increase in service involved 15 departures per direction per day, and the travel time from Stavanger to Egersund was reduced from 80 to 55 minutes.<ref name=nye>{{cite news |title=Nye Jærbanen |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=27 January 1992 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In addition, NSB introduced a half-hour [[headway]] between Stavanger and Sandnes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nytt opplegg for NSBs lokaltrafikk på Jæren |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=2 January 1992 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The stations were upgraded, including new sheds.<ref name=byggpris>{{cite news |title=Byggeskikkprisen til NSB: Reise i god form |last=Stafne |first=Anne Lise |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=17 November 1993 |page=11 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> A new station, Sandnes Sentrum, was opened in the city center of Sandnes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forsk.njk.no/stdb/index.php?mod=st&aut=&detaljert=1&baneID=166&Stnr=5108,02&sid=1897 |title=Sandnes sentrum |publisher=[[Norwegian Railway Club]] |accessdate=7 November 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> At the same time, the stations with the least patronage, Hognestad and Lyngnes, were closed.<ref name=b201 /> NSB stated that the goal was to increase the daily ridership from 2,900 to 5,000 passengers by 1994.<ref name=nye />

The commuter service was a success, with NSB experiencing a 112 percent increase in ridership the first year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Trønderbanen skal gi NSB stor trafikkøkning  |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=1 September 1993 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 1993, NSB won [[Statens Byggeskikkpris]], among other things for the new sheds on the Jæren Line.<ref name=byggpris /> By 1995, ridership was up 150 percent from before the commuter rail started.<ref>{{cite news |title=Toget går fra statsbanene |last=Width |first=Henrik |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=6 October 1995 |page=23 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 1997, NSB announced that they would order 36 new electric multiple units, which would among other things replace the aging trains on the Jæren Line.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bortkasted opprusting  |last=Thompson |first=Svein |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |date=9 January 1997 |page=8 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The new [[NSB Class 72|Class 72]] trains were put into service on 8 August 2002, several years after schedule.<ref>{{cite news |title=To års ventetid over – nye pendlertog på vei til Oslo |last=Bø |first=Trond |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=9 August 2002 |page=3 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In April 2004, the rail administration opened [[Jåttå Station]], which was located close to [[Viking Stadion]], the new home ground of the [[Norwegian Premier League]] side [[Viking FK]].<ref name=jatta /> The train transported generated a market share of one sixth of the spectators.<ref>{{cite news |title=1 av 6 tar toget til stadion  |work=[[Stavanger Aftenblad]] |last=Lode |first=Asgeir |date=4 June 2004 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> On 2 January 2007, the Scanet train radio system was replaced with [[GSM-R]].<ref name=gsmr />

To further increase capacity and regularity, the Norwegian National Rail Administration decided to rebuild the section from Stavanger to Sandnes to double track. The upgrade involved closing Hillevåg Station, and building three new stations: Paradis, Jåttåvågen and Gausel. Construction was estimated to cost 2.2 billion [[Norwegian krone]].<ref name=tospor>{{cite web |url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/PageFiles/1679/To_spor_Sandnes_-__1619932a.pdf |title=To spor Sandnes – Stavanger |publisher=[[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] |date=October 2006 |language=Norwegian |format=PDF |accessdate=7 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5u4FHxfry |archivedate=7 November 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref> The primary goal of the project was to increase capacity and build stations in areas with [[transit-oriented development]]. Travel time between Stavanger and Sandnes was only reduced with four minutes. Construction was done by adding another tack adjacent to the existing one, rather than building a new right-of-way. The upgrades included the construction of {{convert|6.3|km|sp=us}} of low [[noise barrier]]s and {{convert|3.5|km|sp=us|adj=on}} of conventional high noise barriers. The upgrades were made in such a way that a future [[tram-train]] can run on the route. All intermediate stations were built in such a way that they later could be adapted to also serve the [[light rail]] service. The route is built to allow the light rail service to enter and leave the Jæren Line at Lura, Gausel, Hinna and Stavager.<ref name=fourmin />

[[File:Jåttåvågen holdeplass.JPG|thumb|left|[[Jåttåvågen Station]] opened in 2008]]
Construction of the {{convert|14.5|km|sp=us|adj=on}} long section was split into four contracts: Stavanger–Hinna, Jåttåvågen, Jåttåvågen–Lurahammaren and Lurahammaren–Sandnes. The section past Jåttåvågen was the first to commence, in October 2006.<ref name=fourmin /> The original plans called for this section to be built last, but [[Stavanger Municipality]] wanted to prioritize transit-oriented development in conjunction with new major building projects, and therefore the municipality advanced NOK&nbsp;90 million for the station.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/nyheter/lokalt/Farlig-flaskehals-p-Jtt-forsvinner-i-hst-2618258.html#.TzzvUfItFmI |title=Farlig flaskehals på Jåttå forsvinner i høst |last=Fremo |first=Anja Wendelborg |date=9 December 2005 |work=[[Stavanger Aftenblad]] |language=Norwegian |archivedate=16 February 2012 |accessdate=16 February 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65VNynUFK |deadurl=no}}</ref> In addition to Jåttåvågen Station, a number of bridges were built. The area is a growth area for Stavanger, with the station being located next to Viking Stadion, [[Jåttå Upper Secondary School]] and several large workplaces. Jåttåvågen Station opened on 6 January 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/article573940.ece |title=Jåttåvågen holdeplass åpnet |last=Veland |first=Bernhard |work=[[Stavanger Aftenblad]] |date=6 January 2008 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uBPlWcPc |archivedate=12 November 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

Construction of the section from Jåttåvågen to Lurahammaren started in March 2007, while the section from Lurahammaren to Sandnes started in September 2007. The latter is the narrowest part of the line and required the construction of several new bridges. Lurahammaren Tunnel was widened to allow double track, a new bridge was built over the intersection og Langgaten–Strandgaten, a new bridge was built over [[Norwegian County Road 44|County Road 44]] at Lura, the technical facilities at Sandnes Station were upgraded, and the tracks to the port in Sandnes were removed. Construction on the section between Stavanger and Hinna started in April 2008. As there was already a double track between Kvaleberg and Stavanger Station, only the southern part of the route received new track. However, the existing part was subject to technical upgrades and a new station was built at Paradis to serve the southern part the downtown area.<ref name=fourmin /> From April to November 2009, the section from Ganddal to Stavanger was closed while the last part of the upgrade was completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/PageFiles/1679/To_spor_Sandnes_-__1619932a.pdf |title=Offisiell åpning Sandnes-Stavanger 14. desember |publisher=[[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] |date=October 2006 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=7 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5u4FiUBIt |archivedate=7 November 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref> The new line was opened on 16 November 2009 and from 14 December, the 15-minute headway was introduced between Stavanger and Sandnes.<ref name="helskap"/>

Construction of a new freight terminal at Ganddal started in 2005. The terminal cost NOK&nbsp;500 million and replaced the terminal at Stavanger Station. Construction 0was completed in 2007 and the terminal opened on 21 January 2008<ref name=ganddalopen /> Both the terminal and the double track were to use the newly developed signaling system [[Merkur (interlocking)|Merkur]], but the [[Norwegian Railway Inspectorate]] would not give permission for the system to be installed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sjt.no/Nyhetsarkiv/Avslag-Merkur/ |title=Avslag på søknad om godkjenning av Merkur signalanlegg |publisher=[[Norwegian Railway Inspectorate]] |date=24 November 2008 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uBJIKYzR |archivedate=12 November 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/article582098.ece |title=Skaper uro for dobbeltsporet |last=Birkevold |first=Harald |work=[[Stavanger Aftenblad]] |date=21 January 2008 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uBJUrLbp |archivedate=12 November 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Because of this, the signaling system at the terminal is operated manually and therefore cannot be used with full capacity.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/article582098.ece |title=Hypermoderne anlegg må vrakes |last=Birkevold |first=Harald |work=[[Stavanger Aftenblad]] |date=26 November 2008 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uBJbykQW |archivedate=12 November 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

==Service==
[[File:Sandnes stasjon.jpg|thumb|Two [[NSB Class 72|Class 72]] trains of the [[Jæren Commuter Rail]] at [[Sandnes Sentrum Station]]]]
The [[Jæren Commuter Rail]] is a local services operated by NSB between Stavanger and Egersund. The service between Stavanger and Sandnes operate with a fixed schedule every 15 minutes. Of the trains to Sandnes, half continue onwards to Nærbø, giving a 30-minute headway. One train per hour operate all the way to Egersund. On weekends and late evenings, there is a reduced service. Travel time from Stavanger to Sandnes is 19 minutes, from Stavanger to Nærbø is 37 minutes, and from Stavanger to Egersund is 1-hour and 7 minutes.<ref name=comschedule>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsb.no/getfile.php/www.nsb.no/nsb.no/Bilder/Rutetabeller/PDF-059-Stavanger-Egersund-16-08_11-12-10-stor%282%29.pdf |title=Egersund–Stavanger S |publisher=[[Norwegian State Railways]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=8 November 2010}}</ref> The operating deficits are covered through subsidies by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/dep/sd/tema/jernbane_og_jernbanetransport/kjop-av-persontransporttjenester.html?id=449035 |title=Kjøp av persontransporttjeneter |publisher=[[Government.no]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=27 December 2009|deadurl=no}}</ref> NSB uses four-car [[NSB Class 72]] electric multiple units on the service.<ref name=class72>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nsb.no/lokaltog/type-72-vaart-nyeste-lokaltog-article24518-3489.html |title=Type 72 |publisher=[[Norwegian State Railways]] |accessdate=7 May 2010 |language=Norwegian |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5pXwtgryV |archivedate=7 May 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref> As of 2011, the service has a weekly ridership of 74,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rogalandsavis.no/nyheter/article5874334.ece |title=74.000 ukentlige passasjerer på Jærbanen |work=[[Stavanger Aftenblad]] |language=Norwegian |last=Waage |first=Thor Erik |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=17 February 2012 |archivedate=17 February 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65WIMeZ4e |deadurl=no}}</ref>

NSB also operates up to eight daily intercity services to [[Kristiansand]]. Up to five of these services continue onwards to [[Oslo]]. Travel time from Stavanger to Kristiansand is 3 hours, while travel time all the way to Oslo is seven and a half hours. One of the services to Oslo is a [[NSB Night Train|night train]]. Intercity trains along the Jæren Line only call at Egersund, Bryne, Sandnes Sentrum and Stavanger, with travel time from Stavanger to Egersund being slightly less than an hour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsb.no/getfile.php/www.nsb.no/nsb.no/Bilder/Rutetabeller/PDF-51-Kristiansand-Stavanger%20S-2011.pdf |title=Kristiansand–Stavanger S |publisher=[[Norwegian State Railways]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=11 November 2010}}</ref> [[CargoNet]] operates up to five container freight trains from Oslo per day and one from Drammen per day to Ganddal Freight Terminal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cargonet.no/epibrowser/Dokument/Norge-dok/laste-%20og%20lossetider/2010/S%C3%B8rlandsbanen_f.o.m.13.%20juni2010.pdf |title=Sørlandsbanen |publisher=[[CargoNet]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=11 November 2010}}</ref>

==Future==
Plans have been made which call for either doubling or tripling the frequency on all the services on the existing commuter rail network. However, increased frequency south of Sandnes will require double track. Should the frequency be doubled, double track would have to be built to where the current service to Nærbø terminates. Plans call for these trains to possibly be extended to either Varhaug or Vigrestad. Should the frequency be tripled, double track would be needed all the way to Egersund. Parts of the Jæren Line is straight enough to permit speeds between {{convert|200|and|250|km/h|sp=us}}. However, several shorter parts need to be rebuilt to allow this, particularly between Egersund and Ogna, and from Bryne to Ganddal. In particular, the section from Ogna to Egersund would probably have to follow an all-new route, should it be rebuilt to double track. The effect of higher maximum speeds is greatest for intercity trains, as the commuter trains have so frequent stops they spend little time at maxiumum speed.<ref name=j3135 />

Egersund Station has been proposed moved back to its old location for the commuter rail, giving Egersund two stations: one for commuter trains and one for regional trains. The right-of-way still exists for this route, making construction easy. A new Sørlandet Line has also been proposed, which would run south instead of north from Egersund. This would mean that a city center location for Egersund Station would be better for intercity trains as well.<ref name=j61 />

[[File:Btd ganddal gods lr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ganddal Freight Terminal]] during construction]]
Reopening the Ålgård Line as part of the commuter rail service has also been proposed. The first {{convert|3|km|sp=us}} of the line remains in use, allowing freight trains access to a cement factory. The line has officially been closed, but has not been abandoned. The National Rail Administration retains ownership and can in the future renovate the line for operation.<ref name=onhold>{{cite news |title=Jernbaneverket vil beholde Ålgårdbanen |work=[[Stavanger Aftenblad]] |last=Ådnøy |first=Åsmund |date=30 July 2008 |page=3 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The annual traffic potential for the Ålgård Line is 600,000 passengers. Plans call for stations at [[Vagle]], [[Figgjo]], [[Kongeparken]] and [[Ålgård]]. It is possible to continue the trains that currently terminate at Sandnes to Ålgård without new infrastructure investments to the Sørlandet Line. However, the Ålgård Line would need a full upgrade, including new tracks, electric system and signaling. Ålgård is also a good location for a [[park and ride]] for [[European route E39|European Road E39]].<ref>Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009a): 52–56</ref>

A branch to Sola has been considered to allow the trains to operate to [[Sola]] and [[Stavanger Airport, Sola]]. The line would branch from the Sørlandet Line south of Gausel, and be built so trains from the branch could run both northwards and southwards. Proposed stations include the airport, [[Solakrossen]], [[Forus]] West, [[Statoil]]'s head office and possibly the shopping center [[Kvadrat (shopping centre)|Kvadrat]]. This would give a travel time of 17 minutes from the airport to the city center, and 10 minutes from the airport to Sandnes. This route has, however, also been proposed as part of the light rail system. It is estimated to generate 2.5 million passengers annually.<ref>Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009a): 57–58</ref>

Rogaland County Municipality is planning a light rail for Greater Stavanger. The initial plans call for a Y-shaped service which could be operational by 2018, with possibilities for further expansion. As of 2010, the plans call for a {{convert|16.2|km|sp=us|adj=on}} line from Stavanger to Sandnes, and a {{convert|7.7|or|8.8|km|sp=us|adj=on}} branch to the airport. The travel time from Sandnes to Stavanger would be 29 minutes, and is therefore a supplement to the commuter rail. The light rail would have interchange with the Jæren Line at Stavanger, Paradis, Jåttåvågen, Gausel and Sandnes Sentrum. Several new branches of the light rail have been proposed for later construction.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tu.no/bygg/article238998.ece |title=Milliardbanen Kleppa kan stoppe |last=Tunmo |first=Truls |work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]]|date=15 March 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=8 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5u5TecZqT |archivedate=8 November 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

{{Merge to|Rank Organisation|date=March 2012}}
[[File:rank organisation green logo.jpeg|thumb|The trademark version of the man with the gong, used by the Rank Organisation until the 1990s.]]
The '''Gongman''' (also known as the "man-with-the-gong") is a company trademark for the [[Rank Organisation]]. It was used as the introduction to all Rank films, many of which were created at their [[Pinewood Studios]]. The Gongman logo was first used on films distributed by [[General Film Distributors]], which was established in 1935 by the British producer [[C. M. Woolf]] and [[J. Arthur Rank]]; it was C.M. Woolf's secretary who devised the man-with-a-gong trademark.<ref name="Independent">[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-sir-john-woolf-1103490.html The Independent 1 July 1999: Obituary: Sir John Woolf] Retrieved 2011-09-02</ref> When the Rank Organisation was established in 1937, with General Film Distributors as one of its cornerstones, that logo was adopted for the whole organisation. 

The Gongman film logo sequence depicts a man striking a huge gong with a deep resonant sound. The gongs used in the films were props made of plaster or [[papier-mâché]], with the sound of the [[gong]] done by [[James Blades]] on a Chinese instrument called a [[gong|tam tam]]. During the sequence, the text "General Film Distributors", " J. Arthur Rank Film Distributors", "J. Arthur Rank presents" or "'The Rank Organisation" appeared over the gong.

Athletes who played the Gongman in the film sequence over the years, included boxer [[Bombardier Billy Wells]] and wrestler [[Ken Richmond]]. Also, George Francis Moss Snr played the Gongman.
 <!--
FIXME: Should add dates for these, but can't quite be sure of them from the Independent article linked below.  It suggests that Carl Dane was gongman from 1932-1948 and that Richmond was gongman from 1955 up to the end of the gongman role, but that'd only just leave room for the "seven years" of Phil Nieman, and no room for Billy Wells at all.
-->
In 2012, to celebrate the Gongman's 75th anniversary, [[The Rank Group]], the gaming company that in 1996 acquired the remaining business interests of Rank Organisation as well as the rights to its logo and name, announced a nationwide competition to find a new Gongman or woman for the 21st century.

==Parodies==
The Gongman was often parodied over the years. In ''[[Carry On up the Khyber]]'', [[Kenneth Williams]]' character refers to an over-enthusiastic gongman's attitude as "rank stupidity". In addition, the opening to the [[ATV Thursday Picture Show]] used an animated version. According to Sub-TV, who has a video of the opening, "the gong-smasher here is a non-muscley man in an old-fashioned swimming costume and a cloth cap!" The man whacks an [[Associated TeleVision|ATV]] logo, not a gong, and the logo smashes into pieces when it gets whacked.

In the ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' spoof ''El E.T.E. y el OTO'', there is a logo at the beginning and end of the film for the company "Manuel Esteba P.C." that shows a muscular man donning red briefs hitting a gong that immediately breaks as he does so. At the end, he is shown trying to fix the gong, but he fails at doing so and he cries in frustration.

The now defunct Swedish film distributor Triangelfilm had a similar vignette with an animated man hitting a triangle.

In the American television series ''[[Foul-Ups, Bleeps & Blunders]]'', the production company that produced the show had two men that were about ready to strike a gong (a la the "Gongman"), with the man on the right (holding the gong mallet) [[groin attack|striking the man on the left in the groin]] region and leaving him in agony (this was followed by a gong sound).  

In the closing seconds of the video to [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]'', percussionist [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]] mimics the Rank gongman by striking a large [[tam tam]] whilst stripped to the waist.

During the ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' episode in which the castaways produce a film explaining their situation to any potential viewer, Gilligan performs their own version of the Rank logo sequence.  Unfortunately, when he strikes the gong, he shakes uncontrollably at the vibrations created in doing that.

The Hungarian animated movie ''[[Macskafogó]]'' opens with a round cat face into which a mouse strikes as to a gong.

The title sequence of the [[Mickey Mouse Club]] TV show's original run ended with [[Donald Duck]] striking a gong, with varying results.

On ''The Muppets Go to the Movies'', the [[Muppets]] parody the Gongman with "J. Arthur Link", showing Muppet pig [[Link Hogthrob]] in the nude, swinging at the gong, missing, spinning around losing his balance, and hitting the gong with his head.  ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' opening, with [[The Great Gonzo|Gonzo]] swinging at the "O" in ''Muppet Show'', and having bad things happen (i.e. breaking the "O" or the gong-beater exploding) might also be a parody.

In the [[Terry Pratchett]]'s Discworld series novel [[Moving Pictures (novel)|Moving Pictures]] the gong exists in a temple which is a portal to the [[Dungeon Dimensions]].  Standing in for the gongman is a suitably proportioned [[troll]] made of living rock.<ref>"Moving Pictures", Terry Pratchett, HarperTorch; Reissue edition (February 5, 2002) ISBN 978-0061020636</ref>

In the ''Pasadena Jones'' segment of the [[Tiny Toons Adventures]] episode ''Cinemaniacs'' on the opening after the prelude shows [[Hamton J. Pig]] swinging at the gong and ringing it.

'''Terry Wallace''' (born 13 December 1958) is a former professional [[Australian rules football]] player and coach.  

As a player, his career spanned three [[VFL/AFL]] clubs; most notably [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] where he played in three premierships as well as achieving All-Australian selection honours on three separate occasions, two with [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and the other with [[Footscray Football Club]], where he also amassed two Best and Fairest awards. Wallace still holds the record for [[VFL/AFL]] most kicks in a single season at 599 in 1983.

As coach, he took the [[Western Bulldogs]] from 15th in 1996 to 3rd when he featured in the documentary ''[[Year of the Dogs]]'' a position in which the club held in 1997 and 1998 during which he was named coach of the All-Australian team.  Wallace's coaching style is considered to be innovative and he is credited with having started the modern practice of sides warming up the side on the field before a match.   However Wallace's coaching career at [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] between 2005 and 2009 was not so successful and he stepped down from coaching on 1 June 2009. This was partly an aftermath from drafting Richard Tambling over Lance 'Buddy' Franklin in the 2004 national draft.{{according to whom|date=August 2014}} His last game as coach of the Richmond Tigers was against the Western Bulldogs on 5 June. It was later announced that [[Jade Rawlings]] would be the caretaker coach for the remainder of the 2009 season.<ref>[http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=822605 Ninemsn.com.au: Tigers name Jade Rawlings new coach]</ref>

==Playing career==
Wallce was Hawthorn's centreman from the late 1970s through the 1980s.  Recruited from VFA club [[Camberwell Football Club|Camberwell]], he was a member of Hawthorn's 1978 premiership side in what was his debut season.  Nicknamed 'Plough' for his knack of crashing through packs, Wallace was Hawthorn's best and fairest winner in 1981 and 1983, the latter in another premiership year.  He played in one further premiership side at Hawthorn in 1986.  Often polling well in the Brownlow Medal counts, Wallace finished equal third in 1982 and equal sixth in 1983.

After a contractual dispute with Hawthorn, Wallace received a clearance to Richmond but struggled in his only season with the club, eventually ending the year prematurely with a back injury. He finished his playing career with four seasons at Footscray which yielded back to back [[Charles Sutton Medal]]s in 1988 and 1989.

==Coaching career==
===Western Bulldogs===
In the middle of the [[1996 AFL season]] he took over as the Western Bulldogs coach following the sacking of incumbent coach [[Alan Joyce]].  At the end of the [[1996 AFL season|1996 season]] they finished 15th.  In the 1997 season Wallace quickly rebuilt the side, finishing third at the end of the season.  In the first qualifying final they defeated [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]] but then lost in the preliminary finals to [[Adelaide Crows|Adelaide]].  In [[1998 AFL season|1998]] the Bulldogs finished second at the end of the season.  In the qualifying finals they defeated the [[West Coast Eagles]] but lost in the preliminary finals to Adelaide for the second year in a row. 

In the [[1999 AFL season]] Wallace led the Bulldogs to fourth at the end of the season but in the qualifying finals they lost to [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]] then in the semi finals they lost to the [[Brisbane Lions]].  In the [[2000 AFL season]] the Bulldogs finished seventh but in the elimination finals they were knocked out by the Brisbane Lions.  During this season the Bulldogs were the only team to defeat [[Essendon Bombers|Essendon]] as Wallace employed "keepings off" tactics.  In the [[2001 AFL season]] the Bulldogs struggled and finished tenth and then kept struggling in the next season.  Wallace resigned as Bulldogs coach at the end of the 2002 season with one match left to go, which [[Peter Rohde]] coached and was eventually employed full-time.

Wallace was linked to the [[Sydney Swans]] job in mid-2002 when [[Rodney Eade]] was sacked following a narrow round 12 loss to [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]. It was rumoured that there was a verbal agreement that the Swans would appoint him as their senior coach for the 2003 season.<ref>Hinds, Richard (29 August 2002) [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/08/28/1030508073420.html Roos v Wallace puts Swans in choice dilemma]</ref>  But Wallace was not given the Swans job and it went to then-interim coach [[Paul Roos (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Roos]], despite Wallace resigning as coach of the [[Western Bulldogs|Bulldogs]] with one match remaining in the season.

During the period that Wallace was not [[Coach (sport)|coach]]ing he became a prominent [[media personality]], with roles on the now defunct [[Fox Footy]] channel and as a columnist in [[Melbourne]] newspaper the [[Herald Sun]], which he still maintains.

=== Richmond ===

In August 2004 he was appointed the senior coach of [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] for five seasons from 2005, replacing [[Danny Frawley]].

His first year at Richmond was unsuccessful as they finished twelfth at the end of the 2005 season despite spending most of the first half of the season in the top eight, mostly in the top four. A shocking moment occurred in Round 10, 2005, when the Tigers, who were 2nd behind the [[West Coast Eagles]] leading into its match against {{AFL Mel}} at [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]], lost forward [[Nathan G. Brown]] (who had previously played under Wallace at the [[Western Bulldogs]]) to a gruesome leg injury late in the match. His absence was felt in the second half of the season, with the Tigers tumbling out of the top eight altogether by seasons end.

The Tigers had a terrible start to 2006 and were written off early in the season with three straight crushing defeats, placing them at the bottom of the ladder.  But Wallace then turned the team around, winning five out of the next seven games, including a win against the [[Adelaide Crows]], who were on top of the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] ladder at the time, but they did not make the finals, just missing out and finishing ninth at the end of the 2006 season.

The [[2007 AFL Season]] proved to be Wallace's worst at any club.<ref>[http://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/cp-terry-wallace--12 Coaching Statistics]</ref>  Richmond won only three games to finish sixteenth (last) and winning the [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]].  The Tigers lost the first five games of the season by less than 25 points and maintained leads in many of those games going into the final quarter.  However in Round 6 the [[Richmond Football Club|Tigers]] were soundly defeated by the eventual premiers, [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], at the [[Telstra Dome]] by a record margin of 157 points.  This subsequently led to the board and management formally apologizing to supporters at Wallace's "Tuesdays with Terry" press conference.<ref>Mike Sheahan with Scott Gullan (8 May 2007) [http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,21690365-23211,00.html Tortured Tigers say sorry to fans]</ref>  Wallace was under serious pressure as he took the reins of a last placed (wooden spoon) side and coached them to another last place in the third year of his "five year plan".<ref>Lienert, Sam (25 December 2007) [http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/sport/afl-in-2007-even-cats-finish-with-questions/2007/12/25/1198345000431.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 AFL in 2007: Even Cats finish with questions]</ref>

The 2008 season was a vital year for Wallace in relation to his future at the club.<ref>Robinson, Mark (20 March 2008) [http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/sport/afl/story/0,26576,23405698-19771,00.html Terry Wallace feels the heat]</ref>  [[Brett Deledio]] said that the club had to make the top eight at all costs in order to repay the faith shown by supporters.<ref>Reed, David (9 December 2007) [http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/sport/afl/story/0,,22892825-19742,00.html Tiger finals vow]</ref>  The season was a big improvement with Richmond starting off with a win over Carlton in Round 1.  But the team did not make the finals with Richmond finishing ninth at the end of the 2008 season with eleven wins, ten losses and one draw. 

Mounting speculation and reports of a rift with Richmond president Gary March were reported at the conclusion of the home and away season, mainly due to conflicting assessments of the sides performance between coach and president. These issues were denied by the club and coach.<ref>
Robinson, Mark (1 September 2008) [http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,24279157-5016212,00.html Gary March denies reports of rift with Terry Wallace]</ref>  The appointment of Kevin Sheedy to a marketing role at Richmond following Sheedy's resignation as Essendon coach also resulted in more pressure on Wallace to deliver the Tigers a much overdue finals appearance in 2009.<ref>Robinson, Mark (22 October 2008) [http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,,24534544-23211,00.html Sheedy keeps pressure on Wallace]</ref>

At the start of the 2009 season Wallace was still under pressure after Richmond's 83 point loss against Carlton in Round 1 and further losses to Geelong, the Western Bulldogs and cellar-dwellars [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]].  Despite controversial media reports describing Wallace as a 'dead man walking',<ref>Sheahan, Mike (14 April 2009) [http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,25331609-23211,00.html Dead man walking: time running out for Richmond coach Terry Wallace]</ref> he told a packed media conference after the Round 4 loss to Melbourne that he would not be resigning and would coach out the 2009 season at Richmond, the final year of his five year contract.<ref>Lane, Samantha (20 April 2009) [http://www.watoday.com.au/news/rfnews/i-wont-resign-says-wallace/2009/04/19/1240079539507.html I won't resign, says Wallace]</ref> A subsequent Richmond Football Club board meeting gave Wallace a reprieve until mid-season before deciding his fate.<ref>Robinson, Mark (21 April 2009) [http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/sport/afl/story/0,26576,25367887-19742,00.html Tiger board gives coach Terry Wallace mid-season deadline]</ref> On 29 April 2009 Wallace confirmed that he would not be coaching at any extent in 2010 and announced that he would resign as Richmond coach on 1 June 2009 but would coach one more game. Public scrutiny aimed towards Wallace is a main factor contributing to his resignation.<ref>Wilson, Caroline (2 June 2009) [http://www.theage.com.au/news/rfnews/friendly-fire-as-wallace-resigns-as-tiger-coach/2009/06/01/1243708405711.html Friendly fire as Wallace resigns as Tiger coach]</ref>

Wallace's last game as coach of the Richmond Tigers resulted in a loss against the Western Bulldogs. Finals scores were Richmond 14.5 (89) and Western Bulldogs 24.13 (157). Ironically the majority of the senior players on this Western Bulldogs team saw their debut and early development under the coaching of Wallace while he was with the Bulldogs.

[[Cornish Language Partnership]].</ref> is a [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] and village in [[Cornwall]], England, United Kingdom. It is between the towns of [[Bodmin]] and [[Liskeard]]. 

The parish is named after the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] [[monk]], [[Saint Neot]] (who also gives his name to [[St Neots]] in [[Cambridgeshire]], whence his alleged bones were taken in the early Middle Ages), and means<ref>[BibleHub.com's translation http://biblehub.com/strongs/hebrew/4999.htm] (see "transliteration" of "naah" to "neot").

See also ['''affirming biblehub's above translation:''' a search of the Hebrew Bible by mechon-mamre.org, by inputting "??????," shows it refers to a pleasant or productive "pasture" or sometimes a "habitation" (but often either word could make sense) http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0.htm] and 'beautiful' instead of 'pleasant' both in [http://andreaslloyd.dk/2011/05/welcome-to-neot-semadar] & the Grafted In Fellowship link, above.</ref> "pleasant (or beautiful) pasture (or habitation)" in [[Hebrew]]. On the northern side the parish includes part of [[Bodmin Moor]] and hamlets in the parish include Draynes, Ley and Pantersbridge.

==History==
During the [[English Civil War]] St Neot was staunchly [[Cavalier|Royalist]]. To commemorate this, each year on [[Oak Apple Day]] (29 May), an oak branch is mounted on the top of the church tower to symbolise the historical allegiance.<ref name="Thompson">{{Cite book | last = Thompson | first = E. V. | authorlink =  | title = 100 years on Bodmin Moor | publisher = Bossiney Books | year = 1984 | location = St Teath | pages = | isbn = 0-906456-90-8}}</ref>

[[John Anstis]], born and buried at St Neot, was an English officer of arms and antiquarian who rose to the highest heraldic office in England and became [[Garter King of Arms]] in 1718. [[Henry Dangar]] (1796–1861) was a native of St Neot who became a surveyor and explorer of Australia.

==Parish Church of St Neot==

[[File:St Neot Church.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Church of St Neot, famous for its late medieval [[stained glass]].]]
The original dedication may have been to 'St Anietus', with whom the Saxon Neot has been confused. In the 11th century a small monastery existed here; the early medieval church building (of which the tower remains) must have been smaller than the one in existence today. Rebuilding in granite was undertaken in the 15th century and the fine stained glass windows are from about 1500.<ref>Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford</ref>
The stained glass is partly original and partly from a restoration done by John Hedgeland, ca. 1830<ref>Pevsner, N. Cornwall, 2nd ed. Penguin Books</ref>

Nearby is the holy well of St Neot. Legend tells that the well contained 3 fish, and an angel told St Neot that as long as he ate no more than one fish a day, their number would never decrease. At a time St Neot fell ill, and his servant went and cooked 2 of the fish; upon finding this, St Neot prayed for forgiveness and ordered that the fish be returned to the well. As they entered the water, both were miraculously returned to life.<ref name="Thompson" />

==Transport and Village Award==
No railway was ever built to the village, despite pressure from local people and mine owners in the 1860s and 1870s. Instead, [[Doublebois railway station]] was opened on 1 June 1860 about two miles south of St Neot on the [[Cornwall Railway]] main line.

In 2004 and 2006, the village of St Neot won the National [[Calor Village of the Year]] award. St Neot also won the Calor Gas Village of the Decade award, which celebrated 10 years of the competition

The nearby [[Carnglaze Caverns]], a former slate quarry, forms an unusual music venue.

==Other notable buildings==
Two 15th-century bridges are at Pantersbridge and Treverbyn (crossing the Warleggan and [[River Fowey|Fowey rivers]]). Lewarne is a neo-Tudor country house built for the Grylls family in 1869. [[Treverbyn Vean]] is a Victorian mansion designed for Colonel Charles Sommers Cocks by two of the greatest Victorian architects, [[George Gilbert Scott]] and [[William Burges]].  Langdon (1896) records six stone crosses in the parish, of which three are at the vicarage.

Depending on the nature of the process, the free energy is determined differently. For example, the [[Gibbs free energy]] is used when considering processes that occur under constant pressure and temperature conditions whereas the [[Helmholtz free energy]] is used when considering processes that occur under constant volume and temperature conditions.

A spontaneous process is capable of proceeding in a given direction, as written or described, without needing to be driven by an outside source of energy. The term is used to refer to macro processes in which [[entropy]] increases; such as a smell diffusing in a room, ice melting in lukewarm water, salt dissolving in water, and iron rusting.

The [[laws of thermodynamics]] govern the direction of a spontaneous process, ensuring that if a sufficiently large number of individual interactions (like [[atom]]s colliding) are involved then the direction will [[Almost surely|always]] be in the direction of increased entropy (since entropy increase is a [[statistical]] phenomenon).

==Overview==
For a reaction at constant temperature and pressure, ?''G'' in the [[Gibbs free energy]] is:

:<math>\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S \,</math>

The sign of ?''G'' depends on the signs of the changes in [[enthalpy]] (?''H'') and [[entropy]] (?''S''), as well as on the [[absolute temperature]] (''T'', in [[kelvin]]). ?''G'' changes from positive to negative (or vice versa) where
''T'' = ?''H''/?''S''.

For heterogeneous systems where all of the species of the reaction are in different phases and can be mechanically separated, the following is true.

'''When ?''G'' is negative, a process or chemical reaction proceeds spontaneously in the forward direction.'''

'''When ?''G'' is positive, the process proceeds spontaneously in reverse.'''

'''When ?''G'' is zero, the process is already in equilibrium, with no net change taking place over time.'''

We can further distinguish four cases within the above rule just by examining the signs of the two terms on the right side of the equation.

<blockquote>
When ?''S'' is positive and ?''H'' is negative, a process is always spontaneous

When ?''S'' is positive and ?''H'' is positive, a process is spontaneous at high temperatures, where [[exothermic]]ity plays a small role in the balance.

When ?''S'' is negative and ?''H'' is negative, a process is spontaneous at low temperatures, where exothermicity ''is'' important.

When ?''S'' is negative and ?''H'' is positive, a process is not spontaneous at any temperature, but the reverse process is spontaneous.
</blockquote>

For Homogeneous systems where all of the species of the reaction are in the same phase, ?''G'' cannot accurately predict reaction spontaneity.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that for any spontaneous process the overall ?''S'' must be greater than or equal to zero, yet a spontaneous chemical reaction can result in a negative change in entropy. This does not contradict the second law, however, since such a reaction must have a sufficiently large negative change in enthalpy (heat energy) that the increase in temperature of the reaction surroundings (considered to be part of the system in thermodynamic terms) results in a sufficiently large increase in entropy that overall the change in entropy is positive. That is, the ?''S'' of the ''surroundings'' increases enough because of the exothermicity of the reaction that it overcompensates for the negative ?''S'' of the system, and since the overall ?''S'' = ?''S''<sub>surroundings</sub> + ?''S''<sub>system</sub>, the overall change in entropy is still positive.

Another way to view the fact that some spontaneous chemical reactions can lead to products with lower entropy is to realize that the second law states that entropy of an '''isolated''' system must increase (or remain constant). Since a negative enthalpy change in a reaction means that energy is being released to the surroundings, then the 'isolated' system includes the chemical reaction plus its surroundings. This means that the heat release of the chemical reaction sufficiently increases the entropy of the surroundings such that the overall entropy of the isolated system increases in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics.

Spontaneity does not imply that the reaction proceeds with great speed. For example, the decay of diamonds into graphite is a spontaneous process that occurs very slowly, taking millions of years. The ''rate'' of a reaction is independent of its spontaneity, and instead depends on the [[chemical kinetics]] of the reaction. Every reactant in a spontaneous process has a tendency to form the corresponding product. This tendency is related to stability. Stability is gained by a substance if it is in a minimum energy state or is in maximum randomness. Only one of these can be applied at a time. e.g. Water converting to ice is a spontaneous process because ice is more stable since it is of lower energy. However, the formation of water is also a spontaneous process as water is the more random state.

[[File:Canada04.PNG|right|thumb|Map of Canada, showing the results of the 2004 election by riding.]]
[[File:Elec2004.PNG|right|thumb|The House of Commons after the 2004 election]]
The '''Canadian federal election, 2004''' (more formally, the '''38th General Election'''), was held on June 28, 2004 to elect members of the [[Canadian House of Commons]] of the [[38th Canadian Parliament|38th Parliament]] of [[Canada]]. The [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Martin]] lost its majority, but was able to form a minority government after the elections. The main opposition party, the newly amalgamated [[Conservative Party of Canada]], improved its position but with a showing below its expectations.

On May 23, 2004, [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]], on the advice of Martin, ordered the dissolution of the House of Commons. Following a 36-day campaign, voters elected 308 Members of the House of Commons.

All three major national parties had changed their leaders since the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 elections]]. Earlier the election was widely expected to be a relatively easy romp for Martin to a fourth consecutive Liberal majority government, but early in 2004 Liberal popularity fell sharply due to the [[Liberal Party of Canada sponsorship scandal|sponsorship scandal]]. Polls started to indicate the possibility of a [[minority government]] for the Liberals, or even a minority Conservative government, fuelling speculation of [[coalition government|coalitions]] with the other parties. In the end, the Liberals fared better than the final opinion polls had led them to fear, but well short of a majority.

On election day, polling times were arranged to allow results from most provinces to be announced more or less simultaneously, with the exception of [[Atlantic Canada]], whose results were known before the close of polling in other provinces due to the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[R. v. Bryan]]''.
{{further|Results of the Canadian federal election, 2004|Timeline of the Canadian federal election, 2004}}

==National results==
{{main|Results of the Canadian federal election, 2004}}
A Canadian party must hold 155 seats to form a majority government. The Liberals came short of this number, winning 135. Until extremely close ridings were decided on the west coast, it appeared as though the Liberals' seat total, if combined with that of the left-wing [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP), would be sufficient to hold a majority in the House of Commons. In the end, the Conservatives won Vancouver Island North, West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, and New Westminster-Coquitlam, after trailing in all three ridings, as sub-totals were announced through the evening.

As a result, the combined seat count of the Liberals and the NDP was 154, while the other 154 seats belonged to the Conservatives, Bloquistes, and one independent [[Chuck Cadman]] (previously a Conservative). Rather than forming a coalition with the NDP, the Liberal party led a minority government, obtaining majorities for its legislation on an ad hoc basis.  Nevertheless, as the showdown on [[Canadian federal budget, 2005|Bill C-48]], a matter of confidence, loomed in the spring of 2005, the Liberals and NDP, who wanted to continue the Parliament, found themselves matched against the Conservatives and the Bloc, who were registering no confidence. The bill just barely passed with support from the Liberals, the NDP, and the independent members of the Commons.

Voter turnout nationwide was 60.9%, the lowest in Canadian history at that time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=pas&document=turnout&lang=e&textonly=false |title=Elections Canada Online &#124; Voter Turnout at Federal Elections and Referendums, 1867-2008 |publisher=Elections.ca |accessdate=2011-02-24}}</ref> with 13,683,570 out of 22,466,621 registered voters casting their ballots.

===Liberal Party of Canada===

Until the [[Liberal Party of Canada sponsorship scandal|sponsorship scandal]], most pundits were predicting that new [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Martin]] would lead the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] to a fourth [[majority government]], possibly setting a record for number of seats won.

However, polls released immediately after the scandal broke showed Liberal support down as much as 10% nationwide, with greater declines in its heartland of [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]]. Although there was some recovery in Ontario and [[Atlantic Canada]], Liberal hopes of making unprecedented gains in the west faded. The unpopularity of some provincial Liberal parties may also have had an effect on federal Liberal fortunes. In Ontario, for instance, the [[Ontario Liberal Party|provincial Liberal]] government introduced an unpopular budget the week of the expected election call, and their federal counterparts then fell into a statistical dead heat with the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] in polls there. The Liberals were also harmed by high profile [[2004 Liberal Party of Canada infighting|party infighting]] that had been plaguing the party since Martin's earlier ejection from Cabinet by now-former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien.

The campaign was criticized openly by Liberal candidates, one incumbent Liberal comparing it to the [[Keystone Kops]].

===Conservative Party of Canada===<!-- This section is linked from [[Stephen Harper]] -->

In the final months of 2003, the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]] and the [[Canadian Alliance]] were running a distant third and fourth, respectively, in public opinion polls.

Many pundits predicted that the combination of the popular and fiscally conservative Martin, along with continued vote-splitting on the right, could have led to the almost total annihilation of the Progressive Conservatives and Canadian Alliance. This fear prompted those two parties to form a united [[Conservative Party of Canada]], which was approved by the members of the Canadian Alliance on December 5, 2003 and controversially by the delegates of the Progressive Conservatives on December 6, 2003.

The new Conservative Party pulled well ahead of the NDP in the polls just before the election, although its support remained below the combined support that the Progressive Conservatives and the Alliance had as separate parties. On March 20, the Conservatives elected [[Stephen Harper]] as their new leader.

The Conservatives gained more ground in polls after Harper became leader, and the poll results in the weeks before the election had them within one to two points of the Liberals, sometimes ahead, sometimes behind them. Party supporters hoped that the voters would react negatively to the Liberal attacks on what they called Harper's "hidden agenda," and that anger over the sponsorship scandal and other Liberal failures would translate to success at the polls.

Late in the campaign, the Conservatives began to lose some momentum, in part due to remarks made by MPs and candidates regarding [[homosexuality]], [[Bilingualism in Canada|official bilingualism]] and [[abortion]]. Additionally, the Liberal Party began airing controversial TV ads.  Harper was also criticized for his position supporting the American-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].  The term "hidden agenda", used commonly in the 2000 election to refer to Stockwell Day, began surfacing with increasing regularity with regard to Harper's history of supporting privatized health care. Further damaging the Conservative campaign was a press release from Conservative headquarters that suggested that Paul Martin supported [[child pornography]].  The momentum began to swing against his party, although some polls suggested it was neck and neck right up until election day.

Although on the eve of the election the party was polling slightly ahead of the Liberals everywhere west of Quebec, it had dropped in support, polling behind or on par with Liberals everywhere except the West (Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba), where it held onto its traditional support.

All together the new Conservatives fell from the combined Canadian Alliance-Progressive Conservative vote in 2000 of 37%, to only 29% of the vote, yet still gained 21 extra seats, finishing in second-place with 99 seats.

===New Democratic Party===

Before the announcement of the union of the right-of-centre parties, some were predicting that the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)]] would form the [[Official Opposition (Canada)|official opposition]] because the NDP was polling ahead of both right-of-centre parties.  A new leader ([[Jack Layton]]) and clear [[social democracy|social democratic]] policies helped revitalize the NDP. Polls suggested that the NDP had returned to the 18% to 20% level of support it enjoyed in the [[Canadian federal election, 1984|1984 election]] and [[Canadian federal election, 1988|1988 election]]. Layton suggested that the NDP would break their previous record of 43 seats won under former leader [[Ed Broadbent]].

The NDP focused the campaign on winning ridings in Canada's urban centres, hoping especially to win seats in central [[Toronto]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]]. The party's platform was built to cater to these regions and much of Layton's time was spent in these areas.

The campaign stumbled early when Layton blamed the deaths of homeless people on Paul Martin, prompting the Liberals to accuse the NDP of negative campaigning. The NDP benefited from the decline in Liberal support, but not to the same extent as the Conservatives. There was an increasing prospect that NDP voters would switch to the Liberals to block a Conservative government. This concern did not manifest itself in the polls, however, and the NDP remained at somewhat below 20 percent mark in the polls for most of the campaign.

The NDP achieved 15% of the popular vote, its highest in 16 years. However, it only won 19 seats in the House of Commons, two less than the 21 won in 1997, and far short of the 40 predicted. There was criticism that Layton's focus on urban issues and gay rights marginalized the party's traditional emphasis on the poor, the working class, and rural Canadians. Long-time MP [[Lorne Nystrom]] and several other incumbents from the Prairie provinces were defeated, with the NDP being shut out of [[Saskatchewan]] for the first time since [[Canadian federal election, 1965|1965]]. Layton won his own seat in a tight race, while Broadbent was returned to Parliament after many years of absence.

===Bloc Québécois===
The [[Bloc Québécois]] (BQ) had managed their best showing back in 1993, but they lost seats to the Liberals in 1997 and 2000, prompting pundits to suggest a decline in support for Quebec sovereignty. The Bloc continued to slide in the polls in most of 2003 after the election of the federalist [[Quebec Liberal Party]] at the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] under [[Jean Charest]], and during the long run-up to Paul Martin becoming leader of the federal Liberals.

However, things progressively changed during 2003, partly because of the decline in popularity of the [[Liberal Party of Quebec]] government of [[Jean Charest]], and partly because support for [[Quebec sovereignty movement|independence in Quebec]] rose again (49% in March).{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} The tide took its sharp turn when, in February 2004, the sponsorship scandal (uncovered in considerable part by the Bloc) hit the Liberal federal government.

These events led to a resurgence of the BQ, putting it ahead of the pack once again: according to an [[Ipsos-Reid]] poll carried out for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] between the 4th and the 8th of June, 50% of Quebecers intended to vote for the BQ against 24% for the Liberals.

Speculation was ongoing about the possibility of the Bloc forming alliances with other opposition parties or with an eventual minority government to promote its goals of [[social democracy]] and respect of the autonomy of provinces. Leader Gilles Duceppe stated that the Bloc, as before, would co-operate with other opposition parties or with the government when interests were found to be in common, but that the Bloc would not participate in a coalition government.

===Green Party of Canada===
The [[Green Party of Canada|Greens]] ran candidates in all 308 ridings for the first time in its history. The party won twice as many votes in this election than it had over the previous 21 years of its history combined, although it failed to win a seat. It also spent more money than in the previous 21 years, and although much of this money was borrowed, the Greens' share of the popular vote enabled them to receive federal funding.

==Issues==
Important issues in the election:
*[[Liberal Party of Canada sponsorship scandal|Sponsorship scandal]]: badly hurt the Liberals in the polls and the theme of widespread corruption was used by all opposition parties, especially the Bloc.
*[[Medicare (Canada)|Health care]]: all parties support Canada's government-administered health care system but acknowledge that improvements must be made to meet new demographic challenges and to reduce long wait times. Transfer payments to the provinces have been cut substantially to 16% by the federal Liberal government and it was difficult for Paul Martin to reconcile these cuts with his plan to improve the system.
*[[Fiscal imbalance]]: all major parties except the Liberals claimed that there was a monetary imbalance between Ottawa and the provinces and spoke of plans to reduce it, the Bloc Québécois probably being the strongest denouncer of the situation.
*[[Taxation]]: for the Conservatives, significantly lowering taxes, to stimulate the economy, was a central issue. The Conservatives also promised to end "corporate welfare" and replace it with tax cuts for all businesses. The Liberals, Communist Party and NDP opposed large tax cuts and argued that money should instead be spent to improve social programs.
*[[Child care]]: The Liberals and NDP promised national child care programs.
*[[Parliament of Canada|Parliamentary reform]]: The Conservatives accused the Liberals of perpetuating "undemocratic practices" in Parliament, by limiting the powers of MPs. Martin called for some reform, but not to the satisfaction of the Conservatives. The Conservatives promised an elected Senate and standing committee and provincial review of judicial appointments. The NDP spoke of abolishing the Senate.
*[[Electoral reform]]: Conservatives promised fixed election dates. The NDP, Green Party, Communist Party and the CHP promoted the idea of [[proportional representation]] voting.
*[[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Same-sex marriage]]: The Bloc Québécois and the NDP strongly favoured same sex marriage. The NDP considers it a human rights issue, and requires its MPs to either support legislation favouring same-sex marriage or abstain on such questions. The Bloc, on the other hand, treats it as a matter of conscience, allowing its members free votes on the issue. The Liberals sent the issue to be ruled upon by the Supreme Court, and the Liberal caucus was publicly divided on the issue. The majority of Conservative candidates opposed it; the Conservative party's official stance was for the issue to be resolved by a free vote in the Commons.
*[[National Missile Defence]]: the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration in the U.S. wanted Canada to join the missile shield. The Conservatives strongly supported such a plan while the Bloc and the NDP opposed it. Although the Liberals reiterated past opposition to the weaponization of space, they did not have an expressed opinion on the shield.
*[[2003 invasion of Iraq]]: the Conservatives supported the United States over Iraq, while the other parties generally opposed it.
*[[Canadian gun registry|Gun registry]]: The Conservatives strongly opposed the gun registry while the other parties support it.
*[[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]: The Liberals have introduced measures to decriminalize possession of small quantities of marijuana, a move generally supported by the other opposition parties. The Conservative Party opposes such legislation. The Bloc Québécois is more explicit in its support for decriminalization, while the NDP wishes to study the issue and consider going beyond mere decriminalization.
*[[Abortion]]: This was not a significant issue in this election. Abortion is legal in Canada after Parliament's failure to pass legislation to replace previous restrictions ruled illegal by the courts. Many Conservatives and a few Liberals oppose abortion. The Liberals tried to use it as a wedge issue after comments from pro-life Conservatives, but it didn't change the outcome.
*[[Dalton McGuinty|Ontario budget]]: The introduction by the [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal]] government of [[Dalton McGuinty]] of "Ontario Health Premiums" was very unpopular, despite Mr. McGuinty's claim that this new tax was necessary because of the budgetary deficit left by the previous [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party|Progressive Conservative]] government. The Conservatives and the NDP capitalized on this and other unpopular fiscal and tax-related policy to attack the Liberals at the federal level.

==Accusations of Stephen Harper trying to form a coalition government==
On March 26, 2011, [[Gilles Duceppe]] stated that Harper had tried to form a [[coalition government]] with the Bloc and NDP two months after this election in 2004. He was responding to Harper's warnings in 2011 that the Liberals  might form a coalition with the Bloc and the NDP.<ref>{{cite news|last=Payton|first=Laura|title=Harper wanted 2004 coalition: Duceppe|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadavotes2011/story/2011/03/26/cv-kickoff-bloc.html|accessdate=March 26, 2011|newspaper=CBC News|date=March 26, 2011}}</ref>
