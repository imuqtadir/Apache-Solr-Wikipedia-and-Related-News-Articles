North Carolina is known particularly for its tradition of [[old-time music]], and many recordings were made in the early 20th century by folk song collector [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]]. Most influentially, [[North Carolina]] [[country music]]ians like the [[North Carolina Ramblers]] helped solidify the sound of country music in the late 1920s, while influential [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] musicians such as [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Doc Watson]] and [[Del McCoury]] came from North Carolina. [[Arthur "Guitar Boogie" Smith|Arthur Smith]] is the most notable North Carolina musician/entertainer who had the first nationally syndicated television program which featured [[country music]]. [[Arthur "Guitar Boogie" Smith|Arthur Smith]] composed [[Guitar Boogie]] the all time best selling guitar instrumental and [[Dueling Banjos]] the all time best selling banjo composition. Both North and South Carolina are a hotbed for traditional rural [[blues]], especially the style known as the [[Piedmont blues]]. [[Elizabeth Cotten]], from Chapel Hill, was active in the [[American folk music revival]]. 

As a college region, the [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]-[[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]-[[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] area (collectively known as [[Research Triangle|the Triangle]]) has long been a well-known center for [[indie rock]], [[metal music|metal]], [[punk rock|punk]] and [[hip-hop]]. Bands from this popular music scene include [[The Avett Brothers]], [[Flat Duo Jets]], [[Corrosion of Conformity]], [[Superchunk]], [[Archers of Loaf]], [[The Rosebuds]], [[Love Language]], [[Tift Merritt]], [[Ben Folds Five]], [[Squirrel Nut Zippers]], [[Carolina Chocolate Drops]], [[Lords of the Underground]], [[The Apple Juice Kid]],  [[Between the Buried and Me]], [[The Foreign Exchange|Foreign Exchange]], [[Justus League|The Justus League]], the Spider Bags, and [[Little Brother (group)|Little Brother]].

==Early Black string band music==

Slave musicians in North Carolina and throughout the country were often responsible for providing the dance music for both white and African American social gatherings. If a slave was trained as a musician, their value as property went up for their masters. [[String band]]s were formed to accompany the social dancing.  After slaves were given their freedom, small communities of blacks began to form in the North Carolina [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region. One of these communities outside of Statesville, North Carolina had enough of a fiddler population to support a fiddler’s convention.  Joe Thompson, an African American fiddler who died in 2012,<ref>{{cite web|title=Joe Thompson Dies at 93|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/arts/music/joe-thompson-dies-at-93-fiddler-of-string-band-legacy.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> is from the Cedar Grove community in North Carolina.  The banjo was another popular instrument for African Americans to play in a string band.  The banjo is an instrument adapted from its African relative the [[akonting]], and younger black musicians often learned to play from older community members. One black musician, Joe Fulp, from the Walnut Cove community used the banjo to help pass the time while waiting for tobacco to cure.  String Bands of the North Carolina Piedmont region had their own sound consisting of long bow fiddle playing, flowing banjo lines, and a prominent bass line provided by the guitar, an instrument added to the ensemble in the early 20th century.  The style of Piedmont string bands was influenced by the dance tune melodies of Europe and the rhythmic complexity of African banjo playing.<ref>{{cite book | last = Carlin | first = Bob | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Sting Bands in the North Carolina Piedmont | publisher = McFarland & Company, Inc. | year = 2004 | location = Jefferson, NC | pages = | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=2xfOMgDFHNwC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=preston+sylvester+fulp&source=bl&ots=kqTdfMKHQA&sig=KS4uw5GvdsnTchyLLZ0q3-FyKuo&hl=en&ei=U5JtS7zXM8mk8Ab5wNCOBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CBUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=preston%20sylvester%20fulp&f=false| doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref>

==Gospel Music==

North Carolina is also considered{{By whom|date=May 2011}} a cradle of Gospel music. The [[Moravians]] who established the town of [[Winston-Salem]] had published Europe's first hymnal in the 1400s, and had brought from the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Saxony]] many instruments including skills to build [[pipe organs]]. Music was an integral part of community life. Everyone participated in brass bands and knew the songs which told of births, deaths and other events. The [[Moravian Music Foundation]] in [[Old Salem]] NC contains the archive of these materials. 

In the days of slavery, spirituals played a huge role in the lives of the slaves of North Carolina elite, and after emancipation, this stayed true. During the 1940s and 50s, North Carolina was a favorite place to visit of Gospel singers for many reasons, among which was North Carolina's less rigorous Jim Crow laws. North Carolina is also home to many famous Gospel singers, the most famous being [[Shirley Caesar]], known as the "First Lady Of Gospel". Caesar got her start when the group [[The Caravans]] came through [[Wilson, North Carolina]] in 1958. North Carolina is also famous for its abundance of family Gospel groups which thrive all throughout the state. Award-winning vocal group [[The Kingsmen Quartet|The Kingsmen]] originate in Asheville, North Carolina.

==Piedmont blues==

The [[Piedmont blues]] is a type of blues music characterized by a unique fingerpicking method on the [[guitar]] in which a regular, alternating-thumb bass pattern supports a melody using treble strings. [[Blind Boy Fuller]] (b. Fulton Allen, Wadesboro, NC, July, 1907) was a popular Piedmont blues guitarist, who played for tips outside tobacco warehouses in Durham during the 1930s. Fuller recorded more than 120 sides during the second half of the 1930s. South Carolina-born Piedmont blues musician [[Rev. Gary Davis]] also played in Durham in the 1930s when the city had a thriving black business community and an emerging [[black middle class]].

==Jazz musicians==

Several notable jazz musicians were originally from North Carolina.<ref>[http://toto.lib.unca.edu/sounds/ncjazza-e.html North Carolina Jazz Musicians]</ref> In the case of [[Thelonious Monk]], (b. Rocky Mount, NC, October 10, 1917) the North Carolina connection is slight, as Monk's family moved to Manhattan when Monk was four. [[John Coltrane]] (b. Hamlet, NC, September 23, 1926) spent most of his childhood in High Point, NC, before moving to Philadelphia when he was sixteen. Bebop pioneer [[Max Roach]] was born in Newland, North Carolina, but like Monk, moved with his family to New York City when he was four. Other jazz musicians from North Carolina include guitarist [[Tal Farlow]] (b. Greensboro, NC, 6/7/21), considered one of the top players during the 1950s. Hard-bop saxophonists [[Lou Donaldson]] (b. Badin, NC, 11/1/26) and [[Tina Brooks]] (b. Fayetteville, NC, 6/7/32) were originally North Carolinians. Hard-bop trumpeter [[Woody Shaw]] (b. Laurinburg, NC, 12/24/44), pianist [[Billy Taylor]] (b. Greenville, NC, 7/24/21), pianist and singer dubbed the "High Priestess of Soul" Dr.[[Nina Simone]] (b.Tryon, NC, 2/21/33) and bassist [[Percy Heath]] (b. Wilmington, NC, 4/30/23) were born in the state as well. South Carolinian [[Dizzy Gillespie]] grew up just over the state line and attended school at the Laurinburg Institute in North Carolina. Jazz composer and arranger [[Billy Strayhorn]] spent some of his summers in Hillsborough, NC with his grandparents.

==Chapel Hill rock==
[[Image:James Taylor Bridge 080526.JPG|thumb|right|270px|James Taylor Bridge, Chapel Hill]]

Chapel Hill's music scene dates back to the 1950s, and really began to take off in the 60s, when the Cat's Cradle Coffeehouse nurtured local folk activity.  One of the first local legends, The Corsayers (later The Fabulous Corsairs) - featuring [[Alex Taylor (musician)|Alex Taylor]] and younger brother [[James Taylor|James]] - could be heard around town. Later, [[Arrogance (band)|Arrogance]] became a major part of the folk scene.  James Taylor would go on to a very successful career as a [[singer-songwriter]], and his "[[Carolina in My Mind]]" would become an unofficial anthem for the state.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XuYGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6TsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3430,2859475&dq=carolina-in-my-mind+anthem | title=Hey, James Taylor – You've got a ... bridge? | publisher=''[[Rome News-Tribune]]'' | date=May 21, 2002 | accessdate=June 28, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name="nando100206">{{cite news | url=http://www.newsobserver.com/161/story/493529.html | title=You must forgive him if he's ... | author=Hoppenjans, Lisa | publisher=''[[The News & Observer]]'' | date=October 2, 2006 | accessdate=June 28, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/2008-10-17-2062938384_x.htm | title=James Taylor to play 5 free NC concerts for Obama | author=Waggoner, Martha | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' | date=October 17, 2008 | accessdate=June 28, 2009}}</ref>  The [[Chapel Hill Museum]] opened a permanent exhibit dedicated to Taylor; at the same occasion the [[U.S. Route 15|US-15]]-[[U.S. Route 501|501]] highway bridge over Morgan Creek, near the site of the Taylor family home and mentioned in Taylor's song "Copperline", was dedicated to Taylor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chapelhillmuseum.org/Exhibits/Ongoing/JamesTaylorExhibit/ | title=Carolina in My Mind: The James Taylor Story | publisher=The Chapel Hill Museum | accessdate=June 28, 2009}}</ref>

The [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] music scene began to pick up steam in the 1980s when bands like The Pressure Boys, The Connells, [[Flat Duo Jets]], [[Southern Culture on the Skids]] A Number of Things, Fetchin' Bones and  Snatches of Pink began releasing their own records or signing to independent record labels. In the late 80's, thru the mid 90's the Chapel Hill scene reached its peak as bands such as [[Superchunk]], [[Polvo]], [[Archers of Loaf]], Small, Zen Frisbee, Dillon Fence, Sex Police, Pipe, The Veldt, Metal Flake Mother and many other bands were signed to local and national labels. The Young Rock wave of music was filling the college radio airwaves.

In the late 90's, gold record and platinum success came to several Chapel Hill bands  [[Squirrel Nut Zippers]], and the piano pop trio [[Ben Folds Five]].

==Punk rock and metal==
[[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]-[[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]-[[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] was a regional center for [[punk rock]] in the late 70s, due to its large number of college students. The first wave of bands were more power-pop than punk, and included [[Peter Holsapple]] & the H-Bombs, Sneakers, and [[Chris Stamey]] and [[the dBs]]. The punks arrived shortly after with 'th Cigaretz, The Dads, the Bad Checks, the Fabulous Knobs, Butchwax, The X-Teens, Human Furniture, and the Junkie Sluts. Later [[hardcore punk]] bands included [[Corrosion of Conformity]], No Labels, Colcor, [[UNICEF (band)|UNICEF]], Stillborn Christians,<ref>[http://www.furious.com/perfect/nc-punk.html How North Carolina Got its Punk Attitude], March 1998</ref> DAMM, Bloodmobile, Subculture, Ugly Americans, 30 Foot Beast, Mission DC, the Celibate Commandos, Rights Reserved,DLW, Creeping Flesh, Time Bomb, Stations of the Cross,  A Number of Things, and Oral Fixation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blush|first=Steven|title=American Hardcore: A Tribal History|publisher=Feral House|year=2001|isbn=0-922915-71-7}}</ref> Some other notable [[Heavy metal music|Heavy Metal]] acts to come from North Carolina are [[Alesana]], [[Weedeater (band)]], [[Buzzoven]], [[Against Their Will (band)]], [[Daylight Dies]], [[Between the Buried and Me]], and [[Confessor]].

At the same time, Charlotte had its own punk rock scene, with bands like [[Antiseen]], [[Judas Bullethead]], Social Savagery, and Influential Habits from Charlotte, and bands so did chapelhill,with remington brown the indie rock singer from hillsborogh NC from the local area, such as NRG from Hickory, and Bloodmobile from Statesville, to name a few. The Milestone was the main club for a good period of time, until a boycott began against the club, and its owner.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} During this time, shows moved around the Charlotte region, at times at the Yellow Rose, a club off South Boulevard. Christian-based pop punk band [[Philmont (band)|Philmont]] also originate from Charlotte.

==Hip-hop==
[[Research Triangle|The Triangle]] [[metropolitan area]] also boasts a long-standing and diverse hip-hop scene.

The lyrics to Miami bass were often sexually explicit, and when 2 Live Crew began to achieve national attention, the words to their songs caused a controversy after several stores were prosecuted under [[obscenity]] laws for selling the disc, and members of 2 Live Crew were arrested for performing songs from the album ''[[Nasty As They Wanna Be]]''.<ref name="richie"/>

[[Slim Whitman]] was born in Tampa and once played minor league baseball for the Plant City Berries.

[[The Bellamy Brothers]], a duet act that hit number one on the country charts several times before topping the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Pop chart with their cross-over hit "Let Your Love Flow" in 1976, also hail from Darby.  Close friend [[Bobby Braddock]], a member of the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] with multiple number ones to his credit, was born in [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]], in [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County]], and grew up in nearby Auburndale.

The still-influential Parsons was born in [[Winter Haven, Florida|Winter Haven]] and attended exclusive [[The Bolles School]] in [[Jacksonville]].  He had a central role in the legendary [[rock-and-roll]] scene of the 1960s, being friends or collaborating on projects with notables from [[Mick Jagger]] to [[Linda Ronstadt]] to [[Johnny "Guitar" Watson]] to the [[Kingston Trio]].  He famously tried to rescue [[Michelle Phillips]] by helicopter from the mayhem at the notorious [[Altamont Music Festival]] in 1969.  One of his songs is included in [[Gimme Shelter]], a documentary about the events at Altamont.  Parsons was a member of the legendary band [[The Byrds]], and was also part of [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]].

He had his own television show, "The Jim Stafford Show" in 1975, as well as co-hosting [[Those Amazing Animals]] with [[Burgess Meredith]] and [[Priscilla Presley]], and making regular guest appearances on [[The Tonight Show]] and other programs.

==Punk==
Florida has experienced periods in which [[punk rock]] flourished. Based in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], Fort Lauderdale/Miami, [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and other cities, [[hardcore punk]] gained a widespread following. One of the first bands in this style is believed to be [[Roach Motel (band)|Roach Motel]] of Gainesville, but [[The Eat (band)|The Eat]], from [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]], had formed around 1978-79. Miami also was home to one of the first American punk bands to release an indy single, the Sex Pistols' influenced Critical Mass' Silver Screen in 1978 that's still in demand by collectors today. [[Rat Cafeteria]] (Tampa), [[Sector 4 (band)|Sector 4]], [[Hated Youth]], and Paisley Death Camp (all from [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]]), [[No Fraud]] (Venice), [[F (metal band)|F]] (Fort Lauderdale), [[Morbid Opera]] ([[Miami]]) and [[Crucial Truth]] ([[Pompano Beach, Florida|Pompano Beach]]) also gained an audience and some had songs compiled on the album ''We Can't Help It If We're From Florida.''  The band F continues to play and release new material today (www.foff.net) and The Eat occasionally play shows in South Florida. A short-lived project that garnered a bit of national attention in the late 1990s was the Infamous Plastic People (featuring Mikee Plastik), that formed out of Brandon, FL. Newer bands like Mosquito Teeth from St. Petersburg, FL are keeping the local punk scene thriving with their silly antics and high energy performances.

Hardcore bands from Orlando 1983-1989 included: [[Dissent]], Damage (U.S.), Zyklon-B (U.S.), The Bully Boys, Florida's Unwanted Children, Sewer Side Rouges, Declared Ungovernable, The Damn Maniacs, and [[The Genitorturers]].

==EDM==
[[Electronic Dance Music]] (EDM) is embedded in the culture of the state, especially in South Florida. Starting in the 1970s with acts like [[Jimmy Bo Horne]] and [[KC and The Sunshine Band]], dance music coming out of Florida could be heard all over the world. With the demographics of South Florida being made up of Cuban, Haitian, and many other Afro-Caribbean cultures, Dance Music became very popular adopting a lot of the grooves and percussion from those cultures. Early on the dance scene in South Florida was mostly playing the EDM sub genres Disco, House, and [[Freestyle music|Freestyle]]. 

During the 1980s in Miami, particularly [[Miami Beach]], the combination of clubs stay open till 5 AM and the glut of easily available drugs resulted in its dance scene beginning to get noticed internationally. In 1985 the [[Winter Music Conference]], a yearly, week long dance music festival started in South Florida. The event has happened in Miami every since. Widely known as WMC, the festival coincides with [[Ultra Music Festival]], another popular showcase of EDM music. 

By the 1990s many local DJs and producers where getting noticed. Acts like [[Murk (band)|Murk]], aka Funky Green Dogs, [[Planet Soul]], and DJs like [[Robbie Rivera]], were all getting air play -- not just in Florida, but around the world. Other cities in Florida such as Tampa, Orlando, and Gainesville, also experienced a popularity in their own dance music. For example, Tampa and Orlando became known for its [[Breakbeat]] dance music, which is a sub genre of EDM. 

Miami would wind up allowing its night clubs to stay open 24 hours on the weekend, thus increasing the demand for EDM. Clubs would regularly have internationally known DJs as well as local acts such as Ivano Belllini, Patrick M, and long list of others spin into the next day. Currently the EDM sub genres popular in South Florida in particular are Deep House, Tech House and Techno.

==Indie rock==
Indie bands [[Mortimer Nova]], [[Surfer Blood]], [[Iron & Wine]], [[Copeland (band)|Copeland]], [[The Drums]], and [[Two Years Till Tomorrow]] are from Florida, as well as [[Fake Problems]] from Naples. In addition to the nationally recognized talent this area has produced, an indie/americana scene is also popular in and around the Central Florida area. Another Indie Florida band was [[The Generators]] from Orlando, active from 1985 to 1992. The Generators were included on [[Breakout USA]] a Best Unsigned Band C.D. issues by the Westwood Radio Network in 1990. The Generators went on to work with [[Chris Wardman]] (producer) and [[Swell Entertainment]] of Canada. They recorded and released one album for Capitol/EMI Canada titled "Now Available in Paperback". In the mid-2000s [[Electric President]] and [[Black Kids]] emerged from the [[Jacksonville Beach]] indie scene. Florida progressive rock/indie rock band [[Tides of Man]] have produced two albums and are currently signed to [[Rise Records]] from Portland, Oregon.
Indie Band Food of the Future is from the Tampa area and was founded in 2010.

==Heavy metal==
Tampa has produced [[death metal]] artists such as [[Morbid Angel]], [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]], [[Hate Eternal]], [[Monstrosity (band)|Monstrosity]], [[Assück]], [[Nocturnus]], [[Atheist (band)|Atheist]], [[Kamelot]], [[Iced Earth]], and [[Acheron (band)|Acheron]].

[[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] is also home to the infamous Morrisound Studios. Records such as [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]]'s debut album, ''[[Deicide (album)|Deicide]]''; [[Morbid Angel]]'s debut album ''[[Altars of Madness]]'', ''[[Scream Bloody Gore]]'' from [[Death (metal band)|Death]], as well as many other death metal albums.

Ft. Lauderdale has produced a few metal bands as well, such as [[Monstrosity (band)|Monstrosity]] and [[Kult ov Azazel]]

Progressive death metal act [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]], come from Miami as well as [[Hibernus Mortis]].

Orlando is notable for producing [[Death (metal band)|Death]], one of the most definitive death metal acts in the scene. [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]] is also from Orlando.

Also the metal band [[Savatage]] hails from the city of [[Tarpon Springs, Florida|Tarpon Springs]]. Having produced many albums back in the early 1980s up to the death of co-founder and guitarist [[Criss Oliva]] in 1993, Savatage was one of the most successful underground bands to come out of Florida. Singer [[Jon Oliva]] went on to create the highly successful [[Trans-Siberian Orchestra]].

[[Nu metal]] act [[Nonpoint]] is from [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] and [[Limp Bizkit]] from [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]]. [[Skrape]] came from Orlando.

[[Image:MARPOL 73-78 signatories.png|thumb|MARPOL 73/78 ratifying states]]
'''Marpol 73/78''' is the '''International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships, 1973 as modified by the Protocol of 1978'''.
("Marpol" is short for marine pollution and 73/78 short for the years 1973 and 1978.)

Marpol 73/78 is one of the most important international marine [[international environmental law|environmental convention]]s.  It was designed to minimize pollution of the seas, including [[marine debris|dumping]], oil and exhaust pollution. Its stated object is to preserve the marine environment through the complete elimination of pollution by oil and other harmful substances and the minimization of accidental discharge of such substances.

The original MARPOL was signed on 17 February 1973, but did not come into force due to lack of ratifications. The current convention is a combination of 1973 Convention and the 1978 Protocol. It entered into force on 2 October 1983. As of May 2013, 152 states, representing 99.2 per cent of the world's shipping tonnage, are parties to the convention.<ref>http://www.imo.org/About/Conventions/StatusOfConventions/Documents/status-x.xls</ref>

All ships flagged under countries that are signatories to MARPOL are subject to its requirements, regardless of where they sail and member nations are responsible for vessels registered under their respective nationalities.<ref name=crs>Copeland, Claudia. [http://www.earth-forum.com/NLE/CRSreports/08Jun/RL32450.pdf "Cruise Ship Pollution: Background, Laws and Regulations, and Key Issues"] (Order Code RL32450).

==Amendments==

Marpol Annex VI amendments according with [http://www.imo.org/includes/blastDataOnly.asp/data_id%3D23760/176%2858%29.pdf MEPC 176(58)] came into force 1 July 2010.

Amended [http://www.ancomaritime.com/files/Ozone_Depleting_Substances_Marpol_Regulation_12.html Regulations 12] concerns control and record keeping of Ozone Depleting Substances.

Amended [http://www.ancomaritime.com/files/Fuel_Oil_Change_over_procedures%20.html Regulation 14] concerns mandatory fuel oil change over procedures for vessels entering or leaving [[Sulphur Emission Control Area|SECA]] areas and FO sulphur limits.

==Implementation and enforcement==
In order for [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]] standards to be binding, they must first be ratified by a total number of member countries whose combined [[gross tonnage]] represents at least 50% of the world's gross tonnage, a process that can be lengthy.  A system of tacit acceptance has therefore been put into place, whereby if no objections are heard from a member state after a certain period has elapsed, it is assumed they have assented to the treaty.

All six Annexes have been ratified by the requisite number of nations; the most recent is Annex VI, which took effect in May 2005. The country where a ship is registered ([[Flag State]]) is responsible for certifying the ship's compliance with MARPOL's [[pollution prevention]] standards. Each signatory nation is responsible for enacting [[municipal law|domestic law]]s to implement the convention and effectively pledges to comply with the convention, annexes, and related laws of other nations.  In the United States, for example, the relevant implementation legislation is the [[Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships]].<ref name=crs/>

One of the difficulties in implementing MARPOL arises from the very international nature of maritime shipping. The country that the ship visits can conduct its own examination to verify a ship's compliance with [[international standard]]s and can detain the ship if it finds significant [[regulatory compliance|noncompliance]]. When incidents occur outside such country's jurisdiction or jurisdiction cannot be determined, the country refers cases to flag states, in accordance with MARPOL. A 2000 [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] report documented that even when referrals have been made, the response rate from flag states has been poor.<ref name=crs/>

In Europe, 1st January 2015 Maritime shipping levels is to become legally subject to new MARPOL directives because the SECA (Sulphur Emission Controlled Areas) zone is due to increase in size. This larger SECA zone will include the North Sea, Scandinavia, and parts of the English Channel. This area is set to include all of the Republic of Ireland's international waters in 2020 culminating in all of Western Europe's subjection to the MARPOL directive. This has proven controversial for shipping and ferry operators across Europe. 

Concerns have been raised about the environmental damage moving back to the roads by some of the larger ferry operators that ship substantial amounts of freight and passenger traffic via these routes affected by IMO standards. They claim that MARPOL will drive up ferry costs for the consumer and freight forwarding companies pushing them back onto the European roadways as a financially more cost effective measure compared to increased ferry costs, thereby defeating the object of reducing water pollution.<ref name="Freightlink">[https://www.freightlink.co.uk/knowledge/articles/what-marpol-and-its-impact-freight-market What is MARPOL and its impact to the freight market?], www.freightlink.co.uk</ref>

==Philosophy==

===Guidelines===

The Revolutionary Cells guidelines was posted on the ''[[Bite Back]]'' website after the second bombing:<ref name=rc1 />

{{Quotation|
* To take strategic direct action (be it non-violent or not) against the oppressive institutions that permeate the world.
* Make every effort to minimize non-target casualties, be they human or non-human.
* Respect a diversity of tactics, whether they be non-violent or not.
* Any underground activist fighting for the liberation of the human, earth or animal nations may consider themselves a Revolutionary Cells volunteer. }}

===Who are RCALB?===
{{Further|Anarchism and animal liberation|Animal liberation movement}}
The ''Bite Back'' communique also explained who the Revolutionary Cells were and why they exist:<ref name=rc1 />

{{quotation|The revolutionary cells exists as a front group for militants across the liberationary movement spectrum. We are [[Anarchism|anarchists]], [[Communism|communists]], [[anti-racist]]s, animal liberationists, [[Earth liberation|earth liberatio]]nists, [[luddites]], [[feminists]], [[gay liberation|queer liberationists]], and many more things across various other fronts. Where ever there is oppression there are those unwilling to idly stand by and let it occur, and those people make up the nucleus of the revolutionary cells.}}

===Structure and aims===

The group formed the same leaderless-resistance model as the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF), which consists of small, autonomous, covert terror cells acting independently. A cell may consist of just one person.

According to the [[Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism]], the [[Front organization|Front]] describes itself as ''"an international coalition fighting injustice"''. The [[MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base|Institute's knowledge Base]] describes it as an ''"unusually violent animal-rights terrorist movement...with a penchant for hyperbole and casting about pretensions of power and importance."''<ref name=MIT>[http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=4234 Revolutionary Cells Animal Liberation Brigade Group Profile], ''MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base'', retrieved, 17 August 2007.</ref> Oren Segal, co-director of [[Anti-Defamation League|Anti-Defamation League's]] Center on Extremism, believes the group consists of the same few ''"lone wolves"'' that carry out actions in the name of the ALF and Earth Liberation Front (ELF), ''"the names are interchangeable...they’re going to rename themselves depending on what actions they’re doing."''<ref name=LA>Range McDonald, Patrick, [http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/monkey-madness-at-ucla/16986/?page=1 Monkey madness at UCLA], ''LA Weekly'', August 8, 2007.</ref>

The existence of activists calling themselves the Revolutionary Cells or Animal Rights Militia (ARM), another name used to inflict violence, reflects a struggle within the Animal Liberation Front and the animal rights movement in general, between those who believe violence and terror tactics are justified, and those who insist the movement should reject it in favor of non-violent resistance.<ref name=Lee>[[Ronnie Lee|Lee, Ronnie]]. [http://www.nocompromise.org/issues/23controversial.html Controversial Actions], ''[[No Compromise (magazine)]]'', issue #23.</ref>

===Extensional self-defense===
[[Steven Best]] has coined the term "extensional self-defense" to describe actions carried out in defense of animals by human beings acting as "proxy agents."<ref name=sb1>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]]. [http://www.drstevebest.com/Essays/GapsInLogic.htm "Gaps in Logic, Lapses in Politics: Rights and Abolitionism in Joan Dunayer's Speciesism"], ''drstevebest.org''.</ref>  He argues that, in carrying out acts of extensional self-defense, activists have the moral right to engage in acts of sabotage or even violence.<ref name="sb1"/> Extensional self-defense is justified, he writes, because animals are "so vulnerable and oppressed they cannot fight back to attack or kill their oppressors."<ref name=alpo>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]]. [http://www.animalliberationpressoffice.org/Writings_Speeches/whos_afraid_of_jerry_vlasak.html "Who's Afraid of Jerry Vlasak?"], ''[[Animal Liberation Press Office]]''.</ref>  Best argues that the principle of extensional self-defense mirrors the penal code statues known as the "[[necessity defense]]," which can be invoked when a defendant believes that the illegal act was necessary to avoid imminent and great harm.<ref name="alpo"/>  In testimony to the Senate in 2005, [[Jerry Vlasak]] stated that he regarded violence against Huntingdon Life Sciences as an example of extensional self-defense.<ref>Miller, John J. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_12_58/ai_n16740562/pg_1 "In the name of the animals: America faces a new kind of terrorism"], ''[[National Review]]'', July 3, 2006.</ref>

==Actions==

===Pipe bombs===
The RCALB took credit for its first action on August 27, 2003, when two "[[pipe bombs]] filled with an [[ammonium nitrate]]" were placed at Chiron Corporation's offices in [[Emeryville, California]]. Both devices were packed with nails to act as shrapnel. Chiron was targeted because of a contract with [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]], a [[New Jersey]]-based animal testing contractor.<ref name=chiron>[http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/local/6639289.htm Mercury News]</ref> A group calling itself ''Revolutionary Cells of the Animal Liberation Brigade'' e-mailed a statement to reporters taking credit for the bombing which was also sent to the ''[[Bite Back]]'' website.<ref name="rc2">[http://www.directaction.info/news_aug29_03.htm Chiron Blast Claimed by the Animal Liberation Brigade], ''Bite Back'', 29th August 2007</ref> One of the bombs exploded an hour after the first, although no casualties resulted from the second blast, as the second device was discovered and the area cleared before the explosion.<ref name="sandiego" />

===Office bombing===
In September 2003, the RCALB took responsibility for another bombing, this time at the offices of Shaklee Inc. in [[Pleasanton, California]]. Shaklee was targeted because its parent company, [[Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical]], does business with HLS.<ref name=adl.org>[http://www.adl.org/Learn/Ext_US/Ecoterrorism.asp The Law Enforcement Agency Rescource Network]</ref> The attackers are said to be linked to [[Daniel Andreas San Diego]], who was featured on ''America's Most Wanted'' and has been placed on the [[FBI]]'s most wanted terrorists list.<ref name="sandiego" /><ref name="FBI"/> A statement was again released from the group to ''Bite Back'' this time also including their manifesto.<ref name=rc1 /><ref>[http://www.drstevebest.org/Essays/ItsWar.htm It's War! The Escalating Battle between Activists and the Corporate-State Complex], ''[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]]'', Essays.</ref> It was thought the bomb was this intended to cause harm, as nails flew out ''"at a speed of 100 miles an hour"'', although again no one was harmed.<ref name="sandiego" />

===Incendiary device===
On June 24, 2007, an explosive device was placed under a car belonging to Arthur Rosenbaum, a pediatric [[ophthalmologist]] who carries out animal experimentation with cats and rhesus monkeys at the [[Jules Stein Eye Institute]] at UCLA. The device failed to explode because of a faulty fuse, but was still claimed by the Animal Liberation Brigade who called for ''"an end to systematic violence and oppression"''.<ref name="arthur">[http://www.directaction.info/news_jun28_07.htm anonymous communique], ''[[Bite Back]]'', June 28th 2007.</ref> UCLA offered a reward for information leading to the arrest of the bomber. Then acting Chancellor, [[Norman Abrams]], said the university "remains steadfast in its commitment to the lawful use of laboratory animals in research for the benefit of society."<ref>"Monkey Madness at UCLA", ''LA Weekly'', August 8th 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.adl.org/learn/extremism_in_america_updates/movements/ecoterrorism/alb_la.htm "Animal Liberation Brigade Claims Attempted Firebombing in Los Angeles"], June 29th 2007.</ref>

===Letter bombs===
Although no suspicious packages have yet been found, RCALB claimed in January 2009 to ''[[Indybay]]''<ref name="news10">[http://www.news10.net/news/story.aspx?storyid=53165&catid=2 UC Davis Receives Mail Bomb Threat], ''[[News10]]'', January 12th 2009.</ref> that they sent two [[UC Davis]] animal researchers [[letter bombs]] because of their work at the [[California National Primate Research Center]]. One of the researchers targeted said, ''"It worries me a little bit... I mean, anytime someone threatens you physically I think it causes worry."'' The Animal Liberation Brigade said in a communique re-released by the [[North American Animal Liberation Press Office|Animal Liberation Press Office]] that the act was not a hoax, with officials at the primate center claiming threats and protests have happened before and were unacceptable.<ref name="news10" /><ref name="ucdavis">[http://www.animalliberationpressoffice.org/communiques/2009-01-10_ucdavis.htm Communiqué from the Revolutionary Cells, Animal Liberation Brigade ], [[North American Animal Liberation Press Office|Animal Liberation Press Office]], ''January 10th 2009''.</ref><ref>[http://cbs5.com/local/researchers.death.threats.2.906090.html 2 UC Davis Researchers Receive Bomb Threats], ''[[KPIX-TV|CBS 5]]'', January 12th 2009''.</ref>

===Vehicle firebombed===
In the early hours of March 7, 2009, the Animal Liberation Brigade once again targeted UCLA. This time setting ablaze and destroying a car belonging to a researcher. The UCLA Chancellor described the latest attack as "reprehensible", with the University raising the reward for information leading to the arrest of the activists to nearly $500,000.<ref name=ucla2>[http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=6701570 Activists destroy UCLA researcher's car], ''[[KABC-TV|ABC7]]'', March 10th 2009.</ref>

The story of [[Tennessee]]'s contribution to American music is essentially the story of three cities: [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], and [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]].  While Nashville is most famous for its status as the long-time capital of [[country music]], Bristol is recognized as the "Birthplace of Country Music". Memphis musicians have had an enormous influence on [[blues music|blues]], early [[rock and roll]], and [[soul music]].

Bristol is best known for being the site of the first commercial recordings of [[country music]], showcasing [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and the [[Carter Family]], and later a favorite venue of mountain musician [[Uncle Charlie Osborne]]. Bristol is also the birthplace of [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]].

In 1927, [[Ralph Peer]] of Victor Records began recording local musicians in Bristol to capture the local sound of traditional 'folk' music of the region. One of these local sounds was created by the [[Carter Family]]. The Carter Family got their start on July 31, 1927, when A.P. Carter and his family journeyed from [[Maces Spring, Virginia]], to [[Bristol, Tennessee]], to audition for record producer [[Ralph Peer]] who was seeking new talent for the relatively embryonic recording industry. They received $50 for each song they recorded.

The [[U.S. Congress]] recognized Bristol as the "Birthplace of Country Music" in 1998 for its contributions to early country music recordings and ongoing influence.<ref>http://www.americaslibrary.gov/es/tn/es_tn_bristol_1.html</ref>

==Nashville: "Music City, U.S.A."==
Nashville, the most populous [[metropolitan area]] in the state, is home to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]], and bears the nickname "Music City, U.S.A.". By the 1950s, the city's [[record label]]s dominated the genre with slick pop-country (''[[Nashville sound]]''). Performers reacting against the Nashville sound formed their own scenes in [[Lubbock, Texas]] and [[Bakersfield, California]], the latter of which (''[[Bakersfield sound]]'') became the most popular type of country by the late 1960s, led by [[Merle Haggard]]. Nashville's predominance in county music was regained by the early 1980s, when [[Dwight Yoakam]] and other neo-traditionalists entered the charts. 

Today, there is still a thriving country music scene, however there are other scenes and genres gaining in outside attention, such as indie, rock, and metalcore.  [[Infinity Cat Recordings]], home of [[Jeff the Brotherhood]] and [[Be Your Own Pet]] is a prime example. [[Third Man Records]] is also based in Nashville.

[[Exit/In]] is a long-time Nashville rock club, having played host to many legends and locals including [[Jason & the Scorchers]].

Nashville underground greats include [[Lambchop (band)]], [[R. Stevie Moore]], and [[Dave Cloud]].

==Memphis: "Birthplace of the Blues"==
Memphis' most significant musical claims to fame are as the apparent "Birthplace of the [[blues music|Blues]]" and "Birthplace of [[Rock and Roll]]". Famed [[African-American]] [[composer]] [[W.C. Handy]] is said to have written the first commercially successful blues song "[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]" in a bar on [[Beale Street]] in 1912, and Memphis was a center of [[blues music]] for much of the 20th century (see [[Memphis blues]]). Later during the 1940s, Memphis was the home of blues guitar legend [[B.B. King]].  

In 1952, [[Sam Phillips]] started [[Sun Records]], a seminal early rock and roll and electric blues label. Among the artists who made their first recordings on Sun were [[Elvis Presley]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Ike Turner]], [[Carl Perkins]], and [[Charlie Rich]].  

==Memphis Soul==
In the 1960s and 1970s, the city was home to [[Hi Records|Hi]] and [[Stax Records]], [[soul music]] [[record labels]]. Stax put out funky, distinctly Southern records by artists like [[Otis Redding]], [[Sam & Dave]], and [[Wilson Pickett]] that stood in sharp contrast to the smoother, more [[pop music|pop]] records coming out of [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]'s [[Motown Records|Motown]] (see [[Memphis soul]]).

==Murfreesboro==
Murfreesboro hosts several music-oriented events annually, such as the Main Street Jazzfest presented by MTSU's School of Music and the Main Street Association each May.<ref name="Littman2013">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ueryAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA272&lpg=PA272 |title=Tennessee |series=Moon Handbooks |publisher=Avalon Travel |first=Margaret |last=Littman |pages=271–272 |year=2013 |isbn=1612381502}}</ref><ref name="southern20140310">{{cite news |url=http://southernmanners.com/mainstreet-murfreesboro-releases-lineup-jazzfest/2534 |title=Main Street Murfreesboro releases lineup for JazzFest |work=Southern Manners |date=March 10, 2014 |accessdate=March 26, 2014}}</ref> For over 30 years, Uncle Dave Macon Days has celebrated the [[Old-time music|musical tradition]] of [[Uncle Dave Macon]]. This annual July event includes national competitions for old-time music and dancing.<ref name="Littman2013"/><ref name="boropost20130626">{{cite news |url=http://www.murfreesboropost.com/uncle-dave-macon-days-celebrates-36-years-cms-36003 |title=Uncle Dave Macon Days celebrates 36 years |work=Murfreesboro Post |date=June 26, 2013 |accessdate=March 26, 2014}}</ref>

Because of [[Middle Tennessee State University]]'s large recording industry program, the city has fostered a number of bands and songwriters, including: [[The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza]], [[A Plea for Purging]], [[Self (band)|Self]], [[Fluid Ounces]], [[The Katies]], [[Count Bass D]], [[Destroy Destroy Destroy]], [[De Novo Dahl]], and [[The Features]].

[[Wayne White (artist)]], from Chattanooga, received a BFA from MTSU in 1979.  

[[Spongebath Records]] was a key force in the Murfreesboro indie music scene in the late 1990s.

==Punk rock==
[[Punk rock]] has had active scenes in Tennessee, such as the scenes in Nashville, Knoxville, and Memphis's River City Hardcore scene in the 1980s and 1990s. A few [[hardcore punk]] bands gained a following, including [[His Hero Is Gone]] ([[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]), [[Love Is Red]] ([[Nashville, TN]]), [[Committee for Public Safety]] ([[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]), [[From Ashes Rise]] (Nashville), and bands like [[Johnny Fives (band)|Johnny Fives]], [[The Malignmen (band)|The Malignmen]] and [[STD (band)|STD]] ([[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]). 

Knoxville's punk scene began in the late 1970s with Terry Hill's Balboa, and took off around 1981-83 with the more notable early bands including the Five Twins, The Real Hostages, Candy Creme and the Wet Dream, and the hardcore bands [[Koro (band)|Koro]] and UXB.  During that era the scene was based in a series of short-lived nightclubs such as The Place, Hobos, Uncle Sams and Bundulees.  Later in the 1980s several Knoxville bands such as the [[Judybats]] and Smokin' Dave and the Premo Dopes emerged to wider acclaim not limited to the local Knoxville scene.  The scene again reached a peak during the mid-1990s, at that time tied closely to The Mercury Theatre, a popular all-ages venue where many Knoxville bands, such as [[Superdrag]], got their start. After the close of the Mercury, another venue The Neptune opened for a short time under the same management. In 2006, punk began to resurface across the state. Bands [[Stuck Lucky (band)|Stuck Lucky]] and [[The Pigs (band)|The Pigs]] are actively playing shows.
Most bands associated with punk rock in Tennessee drew upon the state's musical heritage as an additional influence to some extent.

The early 1970s power pop band [[Big Star (band)|Big Star]], cited as a primary influence by many grunge and alternative rock groups since, was from Memphis.

Memphis is home of [[Goner Records]].

==Hip-hop==
Much like punk rock, the hip-hop scene in Tennessee has been very active across the state, with some notable artists.  [[Academy Award]]-winning rap group [[Three 6 Mafia]] was formed in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. Other notable Memphis rappers include [[Project Pat]], Playa Fly, the duo of [[Eightball & MJG]], and [[Yo Gotti]].  [[Young Buck]] and [[All Star Cashville Prince]] are from Nashville. [[Mr. Mack]], are based out of [[Knoxville]]. Holy Hip Hop group [[GRITS]] is from [[Nashville]].<ref>http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/artists/grits/grits.html</ref>

==Southern rock==
The [[Charlie Daniels Band]] is closely associated with Tennessee's contributions to the [[southern rock]] genre, and with the [[Volunteer Jam]], an annual rock festival first held in Nashville in 1974.

Other notable musicians include Knoxville's [[Jerry Riggs]], Nashville's [[Barefoot Jerry]], and the Nashville band [[Area Code 615 (band)|Area Code 615]].
Kings of Leon were formed in Tennessee in 1999. Their early music was closely associated with this genre.

==Gospel and Christian music==
Tennessee's location in the [[Bible Belt]] has led to an active [[southern Gospel]] music scene with such groups as [[The LeFevres]], as well as being the origin of some notable [[Christian rock]] bands such as Memphis's [[DeGarmo and Key]].  The country group the [[Oak Ridge Boys]] started in 1945 as the Oak Ridge Quartet, a Southern Gospel group based in Knoxville who performed for workers at the nearby Oak Ridge facilities during [[World War II]]. An [[African American]] [[a cappella]] ensemble, the [[Fisk Jubilee Singers]], consisting of students at [[Fisk University]] in Nashville have been performing since 1871.

==Old-Time music==
The state of Tennessee once had a strong [[Old-time music]] tradition. In its earliest days the [[Grand Ole Opry]] featured banjo players, fiddle players, and [[string band]]s from [[Middle Tennessee]] such as [[Uncle Dave Macon]], [[Fiddlin' Arthur Smith]], the [[McGee Brothers]], [[Humphrey Bate]] and his Possum Hunters, the [[The Gully Jumpers|Gully Jumpers]], the Fruit Jar Drinkers, and The Crook Brothers String Band.

==Classical music==
Tennessee cities are home to several symphony orchestras:
*[[Bryan Symphony Orchestra]], [[Cookeville, Tennessee]]<ref>[http://www.bryansymphony.org/ Bryan Symphony Orchestra].</ref>
*[[Chattanooga Symphony Orchestra]]<ref name=TNenc/>

*[[Symphony of the Mountains]], Kingsport, Tennessee<ref name=TNenc/>
Each summer, [[the University of the South]] campus in [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] hosts the [[Sewanee Summer Music Festival]], including classes for some 200 advanced music students and a series of concerts by well-known guest artists. While classical music predominates, bluegrass and other musical styles also are featured.<ref>[http://www2.sewanee.edu/ssmf Sewanee Summer Music Festival website], accessed December 11, 2010</ref>

'''Manuel Blum''' ([[Caracas]], 26 April 1938) is a Venezuelan [[computer scientist]] who received the [[Turing Award]] in 1995 "In recognition of his contributions to the foundations of [[computational complexity theory]] and its application to [[cryptography]] and program checking".<ref>[http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=4659082&srt=all&aw=140&ao=AMTURING&yr=1995 ACM Turing Award Citation], retrieved 2010-01-24.</ref><ref name="dblp">{{DBLP|id=Blum:Manuel}}</ref><ref name="microsoft">{{AcademicSearch|648415}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1137/0213053}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0022-0000(73)80033-9}}</ref><ref name="doi10.1145/321386.321395">{{cite doi|10.1145/321386.321395}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1137/0215025}}</ref>

==Education==
Born to [[Jewish]] parents,<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10 Jewish Computer Scientists|url=http://topyaps.com/top-10-jewish-computer-scientists/|accessdate=29 September 2013}}</ref> Blum was educated at [[MIT]], where he received his [[bachelor's degree]] and his [[master's degree]] in EECS in 1959 and 1961 respectively, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Mathematics]] in 1964 supervised by [[Marvin Minsky]].<ref name="mathgene">{{mathgenealogy|name=Manuel Blum|id=13373}}.</ref><ref name="doi10.1145/321386.321395"/>

==Career==
He worked as a professor of computer science at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] until 1999.<ref name="trib">[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_71679.html Honored professor stumps computers], Jonathan Potts, [[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]], May 16, 2002.</ref> In 2002 he was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]].<ref name="trib"/>

He is currently the Bruce Nelson Professor of Computer Science at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], where his wife, [[Lenore Blum]],<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0019-9958(75)90261-2}}</ref> and son, [[Avrim Blum]], are also professors of Computer Science.

==Research==

In the 60s he developed an axiomatic complexity theory which was independent of concrete machine models. The theory is based on [[Gödel numbering]]s and the [[Blum axioms]]. Even though the theory is not based on any machine model it yields concrete results like the [[compression theorem]], the [[gap theorem]], the honesty theorem and the [[Blum speedup theorem]].

Some of his other work includes a protocol for [[Commitment scheme#Coin flipping|flipping a coin over a telephone]], [[median of medians]] (a linear time [[selection algorithm]]), the [[Blum Blum Shub]] pseudorandom number generator, the [[Blum-Goldwasser cryptosystem]], and more recently [[captcha|CAPTCHA]]s.<ref name="captcha">{{cite doi|10.1007/3-540-39200-9_18}}</ref>

Among his PhD students are [[Leonard Adleman]], [[Shafi Goldwasser]], [[Russell Impagliazzo]], [[Silvio Micali]], [[Gary Miller (professor)|Gary Miller]], [[Moni Naor]], [[Steven Rudich]], [[Michael Sipser]], [[Umesh Vazirani]] and [[Vijay Vazirani]], [[Ronitt Rubinfeld]], [[Luis von Ahn]], Nicholas Hopper, and [[Ryan Williams (computer scientist)|Ryan Williams]].<ref name="mathgene"/>

The '''Howard Families''' are a fictional group created by the author [[Robert A. Heinlein]]. 

According to Heinlein, the Howard Foundation was started in the 19th century by Ira Howard, a millionaire dying of old age in his forties, for the purpose of extending human lifespans. Howard himself did not live to see the outcome; he simply endowed the experiment with his own fortune, and the trustees of the Howard Foundation used the limited scientific knowledge of the time to create a selective breeding human program to encourage, financially, people of long-lived ancestry to have children together.  The Howard Foundation is greatly enriched during the [[Great Depression]] by knowledge gained through time travel so that they get out of the stock market before the crash and invest in gold rather than cash and are able to reinvest in stocks that rebound after the crash.<ref>''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]''</ref>

The novel ''[[Methuselah's Children]]'' is focused on the Howard Families and their quest for acceptance on [[Earth]] and other planets.  According to ''Methuselah's Children'', envy of the Howard Families and the false belief that they have some artificial secret to long life eventually leads the "short-lifers" to develop a therapy for "rejuvenation."  Initially, the therapy consists simply of blood replacement (using new blood grown ''[[in vitro]]''), but according to ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'', this single therapy was eventually expanded to include the gradual replacement of nearly all body parts as well as emotional therapy.  Members of the Howard Families generally opt to undergo rejuvenation, thereby extending their already-long lifespans practically indefinitely.

The books ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'' and ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'' tell the stories of two famous Howard Family members: [[Lazarus Long]] and his mother, [[Maureen Johnson (Heinlein character)|Maureen Johnson]].  Lazarus Long also appears in ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]''.

McCarthy was one of the founders of the discipline of artificial intelligence.<ref>[http://www.intuition.org/txt/mccarthy.htm Conversations On the Leading Edge of Knowledge and Discovery], with Jeffrey Mishlove</ref> He coined the term "[[artificial intelligence]]" (AI), developed the [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] programming language family, significantly influenced the design of the [[ALGOL]] programming language, popularized [[timesharing]], and was very influential in the early development of AI.

McCarthy received many accolades and honors, such as the [[Turing Award]] for his contributions to the topic of AI, the United States [[National Medal of Science]], and the [[Kyoto Prize]].<!-- Best-known accomplishments, then a few topmost honors, with details in body, per suggestions at [[MOS:LEAD]].

== Personal life and education ==
John McCarthy was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] on September 4, 1927 to an [[Ireland|Irish]] immigrant father and a [[Lithuanian Jewish]] immigrant mother,<ref>{{cite book |last=Shasha |first= Dennis |last2= Lazere |first2=Cathy |year=1998 |title=Out of Their Minds: The Lives and Discoveries of 15 Great Computer Scientists |publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer]] |page=23 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-0tDZX3z-8UC&pg=PA23#v=onepage&f=false }}</ref> John Patrick and Ida Glatt McCarthy. The family was obliged to relocate frequently during the [[Great Depression]], until McCarthy's father found work as an organizer for the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].

McCarthy was exceptionally intelligent, and graduated from [[Belmont High School (Los Angeles)|Belmont High School]] two years early.<ref name="LATObit">Woo, Elaine (October 28, 2011). [http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-john-mccarthy-20111027,0,7137805.story John McCarthy dies at 84; the father of artificial intelligence]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> He showed an early aptitude for [[mathematics]]; during his teens he taught himself college mathematics by studying the textbooks used at the nearby [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech). As a result, when McCarthy was accepted into Caltech in 1944, he was able to skip the first two years of mathematics.<ref name="HayesMorgenstern">{{cite journal

McCarthy was suspended from Caltech for failure to attend [[physical education]] courses; he then served in the [[US Army]] and was readmitted, receiving a B.S. in Mathematics in 1948.<ref name = ACM>{{cite web | url = http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/mccarthy_0239596.cfm | title = A.

McCarthy initially continued his studies at Caltech. He received a Ph.D. in Mathematics from [[Princeton University]] in 1951 as a student of [[Solomon Lefschetz]].

McCarthy was married three times. His second wife was Vera Watson, a programmer and [[mountaineering|mountaineer]] who died in 1978 attempting to scale [[Annapurna I]] as part of an all-women [[Arlene Blum#Major climbs|expedition organised by Arlene Blum]]. He later married [[Carolyn Talcott]], a computer scientist at Stanford and later [[SRI International]].<ref>{{cite news |title=John McCarthy, 84, Dies; Computer Design Pioneer |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/science/26mccarthy.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 25, 2011 |first=John |last=Markoff }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Biography of Carolyn Talcott |url=http://blackforest.stanford.edu/clt/bio.html |publisher=[[Stanford University]] }}</ref> McCarthy considered himself an atheist.<ref>{{cite web |title = About John McCarthy |url = http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/personal.html |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate = February 1, 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131004213309/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/personal.html |archivedate=October 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=McCarthy |first=John |title=Commentary on World, US, and scientific affairs |url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/commentary.html |publisher=Stanford University |date=March 7, 2003  |quote=By the way I'm an atheist. |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131004213311/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/commentary.html |archivedate=October 4, 2013 |accessdate=February 1, 2013}}</ref>

== Career in computer science ==
After short-term appointments at Princeton, [[Stanford University]], [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], and [[MIT]], he became a full [[professor]] at Stanford in 1962, where he remained until his retirement at the end of 2000. By the end of his early days at MIT he was already affectionately referred to as "Uncle John" by his students.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=36095&pageno=34 |title=Hackers, Heroes of the Computer Revolution |author=Steven Levy |page=34 |publisher=Gutenberg.org }}</ref>

McCarthy championed [[mathematical logic]] for artificial intelligence. In 1956, he organized the first international conference to emphasize artificial intelligence. One of the attendees was [[Marvin Minsky]], who later became one of the main AI theorists and joined McCarthy at MIT in 1959.<ref name="LATObit" /> During the autumn of 1956, McCarthy won an MIT research [[fellow]]ship. He served on the committee that designed [[ALGOL]], which became a very influential programming language by introducing many new constructs now in common use. In 1958, he proposed the [[advice taker]], which inspired later work on question-answering and [[logic programming]]. Around 1959, he invented so-called "[[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]]" methods to solve problems in Lisp.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=367177.367199 |title=Recursive functions of symbolic expressions and their computation by machine |date=April 1960 |publisher=Communications of the ACM |volume=3 |issue=4 |accessdate=March 29, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.html |title=Recursive functions of symbolic expressions and their computation by machine, Part I |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131004215327/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.html |archivedate=October 4, 2013 |accessdate=November 24, 2013 }}</ref> Based on the [[lambda calculus]], Lisp soon became the programming language of choice for AI applications after its publication in 1960.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine |last=McCarthy |first=John |journal=CACM |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=184–195 |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=367199 |doi=10.1145/367177.367199 |year=1960 }}</ref> He helped to motivate the creation of [[Project MAC]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], but left MIT for [[Stanford University]] in 1962, where he helped establish the [[Stanford AI Laboratory]], for many years a friendly rival to Project MAC.

In 1961, he was the first to suggest publicly (in a speech given to celebrate MIT's centennial) that computer [[time-sharing]] technology might result in a future in which computing power and even specific applications could be sold through the [[utility]] business model (like [[water]] or [[electricity]]). This idea of a computer or information utility was very popular during the late 1960s, but faded by the mid-1990s. However, since 2000, the idea has resurfaced in new forms (see [[application service provider]], [[grid computing]], and [[cloud computing]]).

In 1966, McCarthy and his team at Stanford wrote a computer program used to play a series of [[chess]] games with counterparts in the [[Soviet Union]]; McCarthy's team lost two games and [[draw (chess)|drew]] two games (see [[Kotok-McCarthy]]).

From 1978 to 1986, McCarthy developed the [[Circumscription (logic)|circumscription]] method of [[non-monotonic reasoning]].

McCarthy is also credited with developing an early form of time-sharing. His colleague [[Lester Earnest]] told the Los Angeles Times: "The Internet would not have happened nearly as soon as it did except for the fact that John initiated the development of time-sharing systems. We keep inventing new names for time-sharing. It came to be called servers.... Now we call it cloud computing. That is still just time-sharing. John started it."<ref name="LATObit" />

In 1982 he seems to have originated the idea of the "[[space fountain]]", a type of tower extending into space and kept vertical by the outward force of a stream of pellets propelled from Earth along a sort of conveyor belt which returns the pellets to Earth (payloads would ride the conveyor belt upward).<ref>McCarthy, John (August 1, 1994). [http://groups.google.com/group/sci.space.tech/browse_thread/thread/9715c3e26c2e2bd1/917e03ffc93a3ce0?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&q=John+McCarthy+space+fountain&pli=1 "Re: SPACE BRIDGE SHORT"]. Posting in [[Usenet newsgroup]]: sci.space.tech.</ref>

McCarthy often commented on world affairs on the [[Usenet]] forums. Some of his ideas can be found in his sustainability Web page,<ref>{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=John |date=February 4, 1995|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/ |title=Progress and its sustainability|publisher=formal.stanford.edu|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131004221812/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/ |archivedate=October 4, 2013|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}</ref> which is "aimed at showing that human material progress is desirable and sustainable". McCarthy was a serious book reader, an optimist, and a staunch supporter of free speech. His best Usenet interaction is visible in rec.arts.books archives. And John actively attended SF Bay Area dinners in [[Palo Alto]] of r.a.b. readers called rab-fests. John went on to defend free speech criticism involving European ethnic jokes at Stanford.

McCarthy saw the importance of mathematics and mathematics education.  His [[Usenet]] [[.sig]] for years was, "He who refuses to do arithmetic is doomed to talk nonsense"; his license plate cover read, similarly, "Do the arithmetic or be doomed to talk nonsense."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!search/%22He$20who$20refuses$20to$20do$20arithmetic$20is$20doomed$20to$20talk$20nonsense%22 |title=He who refuses to do arithmetic is doomed to talk nonsense |type=Usenet newsgroup sci.environment search}}</ref><ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/science/26mccarthy.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0</ref> He advised 30 PhD graduates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/voy/museum/jmctree.html |date=April 21, 2012|title=Tree of John McCarthy students for the Computer History Exhibits |publisher=infolab.Stanford.edu |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131209261800/http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/voy/museum/jmctree.html |archivedate=December 9, 2013 |accessdate=November 24, 2013}}</ref>

[[Image:Woody Guthrie NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Woody Guthrie]] wrote several songs about the Northwest under the commission of the [[Bonneville Power Administration]].]]

The '''music of Oregon''' reflects the diverse array of styles present in the [[music of the United States]], from [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] music to the contemporary genres of [[rock and roll]], [[country music|country]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[jazz]], [[pop music|pop]], [[electronic music]], and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. However, throughout most of its history, the state has been relatively isolated from the cultural forces shaping American music. Much of modern [[popular music]] traces its roots to the emergence in the late 19th century of [[African American music|African American]] [[blues]] and the growth of [[gospel music]] in the 1920s. African American musicians borrowed elements of European and indigenous musics to create new American forms. As Oregon's population was more homogeneous and more white than the United States as a whole, the state did not play a significant role in this history.

The state's main contributions to American popular music began in the 1960s, when [[The Kingsmen]] and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] established Oregon as a minor center of [[frat rock]] and [[garage rock]]. This led in one direction to the [[blues-rock]] tradition of the [[Robert Cray Band]] and [[Curtis Salgado]], and in another direction to the [[hardcore punk]] scene of the early 1980s [[Pacific Northwest]], led by the [[Wipers]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and like-minded bands in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] and [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC]]. Over the next twenty years, [[punk rock]] evolved into [[grunge]], [[riot grrrl]], [[alternative rock]], and, eventually, [[indie rock]]. In the last decade, Oregon has made a unique contribution to American [[independent music]], with a strong [[indie music scene]] developing in Portland. The city's reputation as a [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] mecca has paralleled the rise of local indie musicians such as [[The Decemberists]], [[Gossip (band)|Gossip]], [[The Dandy Warhols]], [[M. Ward]], and the late [[Elliott Smith]]. [[Floater (band)|Floater]] is Portland's leading example of an indie band. They have remained unsigned to a major label for over 20 years and have managed to be voted the best band of Portland for 2009 in addition to frequently selling out major venues like the [[Crystal Ballroom (Portland, Oregon)|Crystal Ballroom]] and the [[Aladdin Theater (Portland, Oregon)|Aladdin Theater]].<ref name="Jarman">{{Cite news

The state also has a unique rural-urban dynamic, which has influenced the development of local [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[alternative country]] music. [[Jam bands]] have a strong presence in the state, dating back to [[Grateful Dead]] performances at the [[Oregon Country Fair]], and outdoor [[music festival]]s continue to be popular. Portland's [[Waterfront Blues Festival]] is the second largest blues festival in the country. Prominent cultural institutions include the [[Oregon Bach Festival]], [[Oregon Festival of American Music]], [[Oregon Symphony]], and [[Mt. Hood Jazz Festival]].

==Portland==
[[The Kingsmen]], best known for their 1960s rock classic "[[Louie, Louie]]", were originally from Portland, and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] gained popularity in Portland after relocating there from [[Idaho]].

Seafood Mama was a 1970s jazz band, with singer Rindy Ross, with a substantial local following that tried for national success as [[Quarterflash]]. The band was unable to find much success after its first album.

Portland is also home of the world's first and only all-Asian American dance rock band, [[The Slants]], another independent act who has been made international headlines, both for their public battle with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as well as their active involvement in the [[anime]] industry.<ref>http://www.marylhurst.edu/about-marylhurst/media-resources/news/20131023-simon-tam-makes-headlines-internationally.html</ref>

===Punk rock===
[[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] had one of the most vibrant [[hardcore punk]] scenes in the early 1980s [[Pacific Northwest]], rivaled only by [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] and [[Vancouver]]<!--Canada, I take it??? Katr. 5-29-08-->.  The [[Wipers]] and [[Poison Idea]] are the best known representatives of the scene, especially The Wipers, a major [[grunge]] influence.  These bands played at The Met (now [[Dante's]]) and [[Satyricon nightclub|The Satyricon]].  Other hardcore bands in the 1980s included [[Lockjaw (band)|Lockjaw]], [[Final Warning]], and [[The Rats (American band)|The Rats]]. [[Hole (band)|Hole]] frontwoman [[Courtney Love]] spent time in Portland, and was active in the city's punk scene at the time.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brite, Poppy Z.|title=Courtney Love: The Real Story|year=1997|publisher=Simon & Schuster|pages=44–46|isbn=0-7528-1337-4}}</ref> She initially met [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] at the Satyricon club in 1989.

In the 1990 bands such as Defiance, Resist, [[Bugskull]], Detestation, and Tragedy rose in popularity. An important cult band from Portland was the [[Exploding Hearts]] of the early 2000s. [[Dead Moon]] developed a cult worldwide following with their garage-country punk, starting from the early 1990s.

===Bluegrass and old-time===
Portland is home to a thriving [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]] and [[old-time music]] scene. Popular Portland bands include [[Foghorn Stringband]], and [[The Water Tower Bucket Boys]]. Banjo player [[Tony Furtado]], who has branched out from traditional bluegrass music into [[progressive bluegrass]], jazz, and other genres, currently lives in Portland.  The [[Portland Old-Time Music Gathering]] takes place in mid-January each year, with a variety of Northwest musicians, jamming, and square dancing.  This event attracts a more diverse audience than is found at Old-Time events in the rest of the state.

===World and world fusion===
Portland is home to a thriving world music and international folk dancing scene.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}  including the acclaimed [[Al andalus ensemble]].

For most people, the music in [[Nevada]] is probably most closely associated with the [[Rat Pack]] and [[lounge music|lounge]] singers like [[Wayne Newton]] playing in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]] and other cities. However, Nevada has had several other notable and innovative musical communities.

== Indie ==
As a result of the downtown Las Vegas restoration that began in 2006, mainly that of the [[Fremont East]] district, which spurred the opening of several new bars and clubs, a new music scene began sprouting up in Las Vegas. With the support of local press, [[Independent music|independent]] musical artists such as the bands [[Black Camaro]], [[The Big Friendly Corporation]], [[Ryan Pardey#Halloween Town|Halloween Town]], and [[A Crowd of Small Adventures]] grew large fan bases quickly in Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2011/mar/30/whats-new-local-music/|title=What's new in:local music|publisher= Las Vegas Weekly |date=2011-03-23 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2012/jan/25/vegas-big-friendly-corporation-releases-third-albu/|title=Las Vegas' Big Friendly Corporation releases its third album|publisher= Las Vegas Weekly |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/sep/19/cd-review-crowd-small-adventures/|title=CD review: A Crowd of Small Adventures ‘A Decade in X-Rays’|publisher= Las Vegas Sun |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>

The Las Vegas indie music community would soon form its own music festival to parallel that of the [[SXSW]] festival in [[Austin, TX]]. Founded by Thirry Harlin, James Woodbridge, and Jason Aragon, the music festival, known as [[Neon Reverb]], which consisted of both national and local indie acts, experimented with genres such as Hip-Hop and punk rock as well as other culture related segments such as film and visual art that compliment the music portion of the festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lvrj.com/neon/neon-reverb-a-labor-of-love-59603187.html|title=Neon Reverb a labor of love|publisher= Las Vegas Review-Journal |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/sep/16/las-vegas-guide-neon-reverb/|title=Las Vegas guide to Neon Reverb|publisher= Las Vegas Sun |date= |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref> The festival has grown to include a radio segment of the same name, founded by Donald Hickey and [[The Killers]] bassist, [[Mark Stoermer]] that broadcasts from 91.5 [[KUNV]] in Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lvartsandculture.blogspot.com/2010/04/neon-reverb-radio-live-on-kunv.html|title=Las Vegas Arts and Culture: Neon Reverb Radio LIVE on KUNV|publisher= LV Arts nd Culture |date=2010-04-08 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.desertcompanion.com/article.cfm?articleID=196|title=Music: Radio Reverb|publisher= Desert Companion |date=2011-09-08 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>

As a result of the continuing revitalization of downtown Las Vegas, a second wave of indie acts have grown prominent in the local music scene. In December 2011, songwriter [[Zach Ryan]] premiered his new band Zach Ryan and the Rouge, which has since been renamed Zach Ryan and the Renegades. Other second wave  Las Vegas Indie acts include Restless Suns, and Alaska, who both arrived in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegascitylife.com/articles/2011/12/10/music/fear_and_lounging/iq_49384205.txt|title=Getting personal: Zach Ryan, new band in tow, gets to the heart of the matter -- his heart|publisher= Las Vegas CityLife |date=2011-12-08 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2012/may/30/new-bands-worth-scouting-local-music-scene/|title=New bands worth scouting on the local music scene|publisher= Las Vegas Weekly |date=2011-05-30 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}</ref> In October 2012, Las Vegas based band Bear With Me finished tracking an EP at [[Brian Garth#Chrome Werewolf|Chrome Werewolf]], a Las Vegas studio opened in 2011 by Black Camaro's [[Brian Garth]].

Turing Award Winner|year=1998|publisher=ACM|url=http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/gray_3649936.cfm}}</ref>  in 1998 "for seminal contributions to [[database]] and [[transaction processing]] research and technical leadership in system implementation."

==Early years==
Gray was born in [[San Francisco, California]], the second child of a mother who was a teacher and a father in the U.S. Army; the family moved to [[Rome]] where Gray spent most of the first three years of his life, learning to speak Italian before English.<ref name="oralhist"/>  The family then moved to [[Virginia]], spending about four years there, until Gray's parents divorced, after which he returned to San Francisco with his mother.<ref name="oralhist"/>  His father, an amateur inventor, patented a design for a ribbon cartridge for [[typewriter]]s that earned him a substantial royalty stream.<ref name="oralhist"/>

After being turned down for the [[Air Force Academy]] he entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]] as a freshman in 1961, paying $67 per semester.<ref name="oralhist"/>  To help pay for college he worked as a [[Cooperative education|co-op]] for [[General Dynamics]], where he learned to use a [[Monroe calculator]].  Discouraged by his chemistry grades, he left Berkeley for six months, returning after an experience in industry he later described as "dreadful."<ref name="oralhist"/>  Gray earned his [[B.S.]] in Engineering Mathematics (Math and Statistics) in 1966.<ref>{{cite web| title= A Biography of Jim Gray: Contributions to Transaction Processing Systems| url= http://www.faircom.com/ace/enl_29_jimgray_t.php| publisher= Faircom | accessdate=2015-09-16}}</ref>

After marrying, Gray moved with his wife Loretta to [[New Jersey]], his wife's home state; she got a job as a teacher and he got one at [[Bell Labs]] working on a digital simulation that was to be part of [[Multics]].  At Bell, he worked three days a week and spent two days as a Master's student at [[Courant Institute]]. The couple planned to work for a year, making "enough money so that we could take off five years and go travel around the world."<ref name="oralhist"/> Before commencing their travel plans, they returned to Berkeley for three months. After about two months travelling, they returned again to Berkeley, their [[Wanderlust|interest in travelling]] satisfied.<ref name="oralhist"/>  Gray entered graduate school with Michael Harrison as his advisor.  Gray got his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1969, in [[programming language]]s, which was followed by two years of post-doctoral work for IBM.<ref name="oralhist"/>

==Research==
Gray pursued his career primarily working as a researcher and [[software design]]er at a number of industrial companies, including [[IBM]], [[Tandem Computers]], and [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]. He joined [[Microsoft]] in 1995 and was a Technical Fellow for the company when he was lost at sea.<ref name="wisc"/><ref>''Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques'' (with Andreas Reuter) (1993).

Gray contributed to several major database and transaction processing systems. [[IBM System R|IBM's System R]] was the precursor of the SQL relational databases that have become a standard throughout the world. For Microsoft, he worked on [[TerraServer-USA]] and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey#Data access|Skyserver]].

Among his best known achievements are:
*[[Multiple granularity locking|granular database locking]]<ref>{{cite doi|10.1145/360363.360369|noedit}}</ref>
*two-tier transaction [[Commit (data management)|commit]] semantics
*the "[[five-minute rule]]" for allocating storage
*the [[OLAP cube|data cube]] operator for data warehousing applications
*describing the requirements for reliable transaction processing (memorably called the [[ACID]] test) and implementing them in software.

==Disappearance==
[[File:Jim Gray on Tenacious 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Jim Gray on the ''Tenacious'' in January 2006]]
On Sunday, January 28, 2007, during a short solo [[sailing]] trip to the [[Farallon Islands]] near [[San Francisco]] to scatter his mother's ashes, Gray and his 40-foot yacht, ''Tenacious'', were reported missing by his wife, Donna Carnes.  The [[Coast Guard]] searched for four days using a [[C-130 Hercules|C-130]] plane, helicopters, and patrol boats but found no sign of the vessel.<ref name="sfgate">{{cite news | date = January 29, 2007 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/29/BAGB5NR0GL6.DTL | title = Coast Guard searches for missing SF boater: 63-year-old man failed to return from trip to Farallon Islands | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}</ref><ref name="sfgate2">{{cite news | date = January 30, 2007 | url = http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/01/30/BAGGTNR93G1.DTL&type=printable | title = Sea search for missing Microsoft scientist:  No sign of S.F. man who set out alone for Farallon Islands in 40-foot sailboat | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | first=Jim | last=Doyle}}</ref><ref name="sfgate4">{{cite news | date = January 31, 2007 | url = http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/01/31/BAGTONS9084.DTL&type=printable | title = Search for missing sailor extends to Humboldt | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | first1=Tanya | last1=Schevitz | first2=Steve | last2=Rubenstein}}</ref><ref name="sfgate5">{{cite news | date = January 31, 2007 | url = http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/01/31/MNGPMNRVD137.DTL&type=printable | title = Vast search off coast for data wizard | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | first1=Meredith | last1=May | first2=Jim | last2=Doyle}}</ref>

Gray's boat was equipped with an automatically deployable EPIRB ([[Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon]]), which should have deployed and begun transmitting the instant his vessel sank. The area around the Farallon Islands where Gray was sailing is well north of the East-West ship channel used by freighters entering and leaving [[San Francisco Bay]]. The weather was clear that day and no ships reported striking his boat, nor were any distress radio transmissions reported.

On February 1, 2007, the [[DigitalGlobe]] satellite did a scan of the area, generating thousands of images.<ref name="nythafner">{{cite news | date = February 3, 2007 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/03/technology/03search.html?ex=1328158800&en=e58764b50c8a4508&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss | title = Silicon Valley's High-Tech Hunt for Colleague | work = [[New York Times]] | first=Katie | last=Hafner | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}</ref>  The images were posted to [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] in order to distribute the work of searching through them, in hopes of spotting his boat.

In the immediate aftermath of the disappearance, many theories were put forward on how Gray disappeared.<ref>{{cite news|last=Doyle|first=Jim|title=FARALLON ISLANDS / Missing sailor mystery / Boaters' speculations range from orcas to margarita escape|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/FARALLON-ISLANDS-Missing-sailor-mystery-2652293.php|work=www.sfgate.com|accessdate=19 October 2012|date=February 3, 2007}}</ref>

On February 16, 2007, the family and Friends of Jim Gray Group suspended their search,<ref>{{cite news | date = February 16, 2007 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/02/16/state/n181516S21.DTL&hw=jim+gray&sn=001&sc=1000

==Personal life==
While at Berkeley, Gray and his first wife Loretta had a daughter; the couple later divorced.<ref name="oralhist"/> He is survived by his wife, Donna Carnes, his daughter, three grandchildren, and his sister Gail.

The [[University of California, Berkeley]] and Gray's family hosted a tribute to him on May 31, 2008.

'''Mycroft Holmes''' is a [[fictional character]] in the stories written by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]. He is the elder brother (by seven years) of the famous detective [[Sherlock Holmes]].

== Profile ==
Possessing deductive powers exceeding even those of his younger brother, Mycroft is nevertheless incapable of performing detective work similar to that of Sherlock as he is unwilling to put in the physical effort necessary to bring cases to their conclusions.

{{Quote|...he has no ambition and no energy. He will not even go out of his way to verify his own solutions, and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right. Again and again I have taken a problem to him, and have received an explanation which has afterwards proved to be the correct one. And yet he was absolutely incapable of working out the practical points...|Sherlock Holmes, speaking of his brother in "[[The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter]]"}}

Though Sherlock initially tells [[Dr. Watson|Watson]] that Mycroft audits books for some government departments, he later reveals that Mycroft's true role is more substantial. While Conan Doyle's stories leave unclear what Mycroft Holmes' exact position is in the British government, Sherlock Holmes says that "Occasionally he ''is'' the British government [...] the most indispensable man in the country." He apparently serves as a sort of human computer:

{{Quote|The conclusions of every department are passed to him, and he is the central exchange, the clearinghouse, which makes out the balance. All other men are specialists, but his specialism is omniscience.|"[[The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans|The Bruce-Partington Plans]]"}}

Mycroft has appeared or been mentioned in four stories by Doyle: "[[The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter|The Greek Interpreter]]", "[[The Final Problem]]", "[[The Adventure of the Empty House|The Empty House]]" and "[[The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans|The Bruce-Partington Plans]]". While he does occasionally exert himself in these stories on behalf of his brother, he on the whole remains a sedentary problem-solver, providing solutions based on seemingly no evidence and trusting Sherlock to handle any of the practical details. In fact, Mycroft's own lack of practicality is a severe handicap despite his inductive talents: in "The Greek Interpreter", his blundering approach to the case nearly costs the client his life.

Mycroft resembles Sherlock, but is described in "The Greek Interpreter" as being "a much larger and stouter man". In "The Bruce-Partington Plans", the following description is given:

{{Quote|Heavily built and massive, there was a suggestion of uncouth physical inertia in the figure, but above this unwieldy frame there was perched a head so masterful in its brow, so alert in its steel-gray, deep-set eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its play of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross body and remembered only the dominant mind.}}

Mycroft spends most of his time at the [[Diogenes Club]], which he co-founded. Sherlock's birth date is given as 1854 in "[[His Last Bow]]", and if Mycroft was "seven years his (Sherlock's) senior", then Mycroft would have been born in 1847.

== In other media ==

Mycroft Holmes has been portrayed many times in film, television, and radio adaptations of the Holmes stories.

=== Radio ===
* In the 1950s radio series starring [[John Gielgud]] as Sherlock Holmes, Gielgud's own brother, [[Val Gielgud]], played the part.
* In the BBC radio dramatisations with [[Carleton Hobbs]] and [[Norman Shelley]], Mycroft was played at various times by Malcolm Graeme, Keith Williams, Felix Felton and – in "The Empty House" – by Carleton Hobbs himself.
* John Hartley played Mycroft in "The Greek Interpreter" on October 21, 1992, "The Bruce-Partington Plans" on January 24, 1994 and "The Retired Colourman" on March 29, 1995 in the [[BBC Radio]] broadcasts starring [[Clive Merrison]] as Sherlock and [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]] as Watson.

=== Film and television ===
* The first film appearance of Mycroft Holmes was in the 1922 film ''The Bruce Partington Plans'', where he was played by [[Lewis Gilbert (actor)|Lewis Gilbert]].
* The [[BBC]] broadcast [[Sherlock Holmes (1965 TV series)|two ''Sherlock Holmes'' series in 1965 and 1968]] which starred [[Douglas Wilmer]] (1965) and [[Peter Cushing]] (1968) as Sherlock and [[Nigel Stock (actor)|Nigel Stock]] as Watson.  Mycroft appeared twice, once in 1965 in ''The Bruce-Partington Plans'' and played by [[Derek Francis]] and in 1968 in ''The Greek Interpreter'' and played by [[Ronald Adam (actor)|Ronald Adam]].
* In the 1965 film ''[[A Study in Terror]]'', Mycroft is played by [[Robert Morley]].
* In the [[Billy Wilder]]-directed film ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1970), which starred [[Robert Stephens]] as Sherlock, Mycroft was played by [[Christopher Lee]] (who also played Sherlock Holmes in other productions before and since). In this film, which purports to show the 'real' people behind Watson's dramatised accounts, Mycroft is nearly unrecognisable: whippet-thin and not notably indolent. He is also depicted as either the head or at least a senior operative of the British [[secret service]], for which the Diogenes Club is a front.
* [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]] assumed the character in both the 1976 film ''[[The Seven-Per-Cent Solution]]'' and four episodes of [[Granada Television]]'s ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1984 TV series)|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' series in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Gray's first two television appearances were adaptations of the two stories in which Mycroft actually appears (''The Greek Interpreter'' and ''The Bruce-Partington Plans''). In the two other appearances, the character was used to replace another for various reasons:
**''The Golden Pince-Nez'' – Mycroft was used in place of Watson due to [[Edward Hardwicke]] being unavailable.
**''The Mazarin Stone'' – Mycroft was used in place of Sherlock owing to [[Jeremy Brett]]'s ill health.
* The 1975 film ''[[The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother]]'', starring [[Gene Wilder]] as Holmes' ''younger'' brother "Sigerson Holmes," was inspired by Mycroft (he is mentioned, but doesn't appear).
* Boris Klyuyev played Mycroft Holmes in ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson]]'', a Soviet TV series. Klyuyev was nine years younger than [[Vasily Livanov]], who played Sherlock Holmes. According to Sherlock, Mycroft is married and has a son.
* He is also briefly mentioned in the 1985 film, ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes]]''; when Sherlock is expelled from boarding school, he tells Watson that he plans to stay at his brother Mycroft's for a few days.
* [[Peter Jeffrey]] played Mycroft in the 1990 film ''Hands of a Murderer'' which starred [[Edward Woodward]] as Sherlock, [[John Hillerman]] as Watson and [[Anthony Andrews]] as [[Professor Moriarty]].
* [[Jerome Willis]] played Mycroft in ''[[Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady (1992 TV film)|Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady]]'', a 1992 made-for-TV film which starred Christopher Lee as Holmes and [[Patrick Macnee]] as Watson.
* [[R. H. Thomson]] played Mycroft in the 2001 made-for-TV film ''[[The Royal Scandal]]'' opposite [[Matt Frewer]]'s Sherlock.
* [[Richard E. Grant]] played him as a semi-crippled young man – following a bad trip after he was injected with drugs by Moriarty – in ''[[Sherlock: Case of Evil]]'' (2002).
* In the 2010 BBC television series ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', series co-creator [[Mark Gatiss]] plays Mycroft. In this modernized version, Sherlock and Mycroft exhibit smouldering animosity toward each other (which Dr. Watson characterizes as "sibling rivalry" and Mycroft himself refers to as a "childish feud"). Mycroft, however, bears Sherlock's insults with aplomb (including references to his weight, such as queries about how his diet is going) and beyond the competitive friction he is deeply concerned about his brother and tracks him constantly. When Mycroft tells Watson he holds a minor position in the British government, Sherlock interjects: "He ''is'' the British government, when he's not too busy being the British secret service or the [[CIA]] on a freelance basis." In the episode "[[The Reichenbach Fall]]", Mycroft is seemingly tricked by [[Professor Moriarty#Television|Jim Moriarty]] into providing information about Sherlock's past – thus allowing Moriarty to create the deception that Sherlock is a fraud. In "[[The Empty Hearse]]", it is revealed that Mycroft is, in fact, smarter than Sherlock, and that, until meeting other children, they both believed Sherlock to be stupid. It is also revealed that the divulge of Sherlock's past was part of Mycroft and Sherlock's plan to take down Moriarty.
* [[Stephen Fry]] played Mycroft in the [[Guy Ritchie]]-directed ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]'', released in December 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title= Stephen Fry to play Sherlock Holmes' brother on film|work= BBC|date=September 27, 2010|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11417860|accessdate=2010-09-27}}</ref>
*Mycroft was played by [[Rhys Ifans]] in the season 2 premiere of ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]''.<ref>http://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-entertainment/releases/view?id=35946</ref>  For the series, Mycroft is a highly successful London [[restaurateur]]. There's a large degree of animosity between the two, as Mycroft reveals that Sherlock seduced Mycroft's fiancee to prove that she was only after the family fortune. He's also the recent recipient of a [[bone marrow transplant]], as Watson deduces from the scars on Mycroft's wrists. Mycroft returns in episode 7 of the same season, seeking his brother's help with a case, and in another episode is shown trying to coerce Sherlock to return to England. Later, it is revealed that Mycroft has been an [[MI6]] asset for several years, a fact that Sherlock knew nothing about.
* In a two-part episode of [[BraveStarr]], after falling through a time warp at [[Reichenbach Falls]], Holmes is introduced to his great- great-grandniece, the lovely and capable Scotland Yard agent Mycroft Holmes.
* In the [[Sherlock Holmes (2013 TV series)|Russian TV adaptation]] from 2013, [[Igor Petrenko]] played Mycroft Holmes, as a twin brother of Sherlock, who is serving [[Queen Victoria|The Queen]].

=== Novels and short stories ===
The character has been used many times in works that are not adaptations of Holmes stories:

* In [[Jasper Fforde]]'s series of books about [[Thursday Next]], Mycroft is revealed to be Thursday's uncle, having escaped into fiction and taken up residence in the Sherlock Holmes series to escape the evil Goliath Corporation.
* He was the main character in a series of mystery novels by the author [[Quinn Fawcett]].
* He is a recurring character in the [[Mary Russell (fictional)|Mary Russell]] mystery series by [[Laurie R. King]], which feature a retired Sherlock Holmes as a major character. Mycroft is portrayed as a senior figure in the British Secret Service, who occasionally calls on Russell and Holmes for assistance in specific cases.
* A young Mycroft Holmes is the protagonist of a mystery-adventure "edited" by [[Michael P. Hodel]] and Sean M. Wright, ''Enter the Lion: A Posthumous Memoir of Mycroft Holmes'' (published in hardcover by Hawthorn Books in 1979 in the U.S. and by JM Dent & Sons Ltd. in 1980 in London (ISBN 0-460-04483-4) and in paperback by Playboy Press in 1980).  The action takes place in 1875, ten years after the end of the [[American Civil War]], at the time when Mycroft Holmes was a minor official in the [[Foreign Office]]. Mycroft is aided by his younger brother Sherlock, Victor Trevor (who appears in Doyle's tale "[[The Adventure of the Gloria Scott]]"), and an adventurer known as "Captain Jericho", a mysterious former slave. They band together in an effort to prevent an attempt by former Confederate officers to involve the British government in a scheme to overthrow the United States government. The story also provides an explanation as to the antagonism between Sherlock Holmes and [[Professor Moriarty]].
* Mycroft has a small but extremely important role in Ray Walsh's novel ''The Mycroft Memoranda'', published in London by Andre Deutsch, 1984 (ISBN 0-233-97582-9), in which Sherlock Holmes, at the request of Major Henry Smith, Acting Commissioner for the City of London, becomes involved in the hunt for [[Jack the Ripper]].
* Mycroft and the Diogenes Club play an important part in [[Kim Newman]]'s novel ''[[Anno Dracula series#Anno Dracula|Anno Dracula]]''.
* The ''[[Doctor Who]]'' novel ''[[All-Consuming Fire]]'' featured Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes, as well as the apocryphal [[Sherrinford Holmes|Sherringford Holmes]]. The Doctor's [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Bernice Summerfield]] was then reunited with Mycroft in the 2008 audio play ''[[The Adventure of the Diogenes Damsel]]'' where he was voiced by [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]].
* The novel ''Oscar Wilde and the Candlelight Murders'' by [[Gyles Brandreth]] suggests that [[Oscar Wilde]]'s friendship with [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] led Doyle to create Mycroft as a caricature of Wilde: mentally brilliant, but indolent and lazy.
* The award-winning short story by [[Robert J. Sawyer]], "You See But You Do Not Observe", portrays Mycroft Holmes' namesake involved in pulling Sherlock and Watson into the year 2096 to solve a scientific mystery.
* He appears in the novel ''[[The Italian Secretary]]'' (2005) by [[Caleb Carr]].
* In the ''[[Enola Holmes]]'' series, Mycroft is the official legal guardian of their much younger sister, Enola, after the mysterious departure of their mother on her daughter's 14th birthday.  Rather than submit to his wish for her to be sent to [[boarding school]] to conform to contemporary feminine social mores, Enola instead runs away to secretly become a [[private detective]] in London while eluding her brothers.  Through the series, Mycroft is steadfastly determined to capture her while Sherlock gradually grows to respect her considerable talents and begins to understand her reasons for her defiance. However, it is Mycroft who suspects that Enola may well be determined to become an adult colleague in his brother's profession, a notion Sherlock finds difficult to accept.
* The ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes (books)|Young Sherlock Holmes]]'' series by [[Andy Lane|Andrew Lane]] features Mycroft Holmes.
* In the story "Whitechapel Rose", by [[Lorelei Shannon]], in [[Jordan K. Weisman]]'s anthology of short stories set in the Shadowrun Universe Into the Shadows, Mycroft is revealed to be legendary among deckers (an in game term for futuristic hackers).
* He is a recurring character in the ''Amelia Watson'' series of novels and short stories by [[Michael Mallory]], which recast him as a close confidant of King Edward VII and the head of England's fledgling secret service bureau.

=== Comics ===
* Mycroft is depicted as a violent [[psychopath]] in ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' (''[[Canon Fodder]]'', issues #861–867) by [[Mark Millar]] and [[Chris Weston]].
* In Issue #6, Volume 1 of [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', Mycroft Holmes becomes the leader of British intelligence and uses the code-name "M" – a nod to the [[M (James Bond)|fictional head of MI6]] in [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] novels. It is hinted that he and his brother are not on the best of terms as a mention of Sherlock sending his regards are met by Mycroft with laughter and regarded as a joke. (Mycroft also appears as the Bond M in ''Son of Holmes'' and ''[[Anno Dracula (novel)|Anno Dracula]]'').
* Mycroft Holmes is the head of "The Committee" in the comic book [[limited series|miniseries]], ''[[Predator (comics)|Predator: Nemesis]]'', by [[Gordon Rennie]] and [[Colin MacNeil]] and published by [[Dark Horse Comics]]. He hires the main character, Captain Edward Soames, to hunt down [[Spring-Heeled Jack]], a [[Predator (alien)|predator]] hunting in the East End.
* Mycroft Holmes appears at least twice in the [[Italian comics|Italian comic book]] ''[[Martin Mystère]]'' and spin-off series ''Storie di Altrove/Stories from Elsewhere''.<ref>[http://www-en.sergiobonellieditore.it/auto/scheda_speciale?collana=13&numero=168 ''Martin Mystère: The Return of Jack'']</ref><ref>[http://www-en.sergiobonellieditore.it/auto/scheda_speciale?collana=30&numero=2&subnum= ''Stories from Elsewhere: The creature from the fog'']</ref>
* The comic book series ''[[The Muppet Show (comics)#Fairy Tale Issues|Muppet Sherlock Holmes]]'' features [[Rowlf the Dog]] as Mycroft Holmes.
* In the popular manga ''[[History's Strongest Disciple]]'', Mycroft is a fictional martial artist who has worked with Sakaki Shio and Christopher Eclair.

=== PC games ===
* Mycroft has a minor role in the 1987 [[Infocom]] game [[Sherlock: The Riddle of the Crown Jewels]]
* He plays a central role as the victim of an assassination attempt in the PC game ''[[The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes]]: The Case of the Rose Tattoo''.
* In the 2009 PC game ''[[Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper]]'', the younger Holmes receives assistance on a case from his brother.

== References in popular culture ==
Mycroft is also sometimes referred to less directly in popular culture:
* A parallel can be observed in the TV series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' in the connection between fictional [[obsessive-compulsive]] detective [[Adrian Monk]] and his more intelligent, though more neurotic and [[agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] brother [[Ambrose Monk|Ambrose]]. Like Mycroft, Ambrose is more intelligent than his brother but is less willing to investigate (though this is because he is agoraphobic). Ambrose, however, does not need to see a crime scene as Adrian does.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}{{OR|date=February 2014}}
* Mycroft was parodied in the ''[[Solar Pons]]'' series with a character named Bancroft Stoneham Pons, who was also seven years older than the leading protagonist.
* Mycroft Holmes was the inspiration for the name of the silent assistant quiz master of BBC Radio 4's programme ''[[Brain of Britain]]''. The phrase "Mycroft is shaking his head" became well known to listeners. [[Ian Gillies]] (who was known as Mycroft) died in 2002 and was replaced by a character known as "Jorkins".
* Mycroft was the inspiration for the name of a character in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]'': [[Mycroft Holmes (computer)|"Mycroft" a.k.a. Mike]], a H.O.L.M.E.S. (''"High-Optional, Logical, Multi-Evaluating Supervisor"'') Mark 4, a sentient computer.  At one point in the story, Mike indicates Sherlock is indeed his brother.
* The character of the Marquis of London in [[Randall Garrett]]'s ''[[Lord Darcy (fiction)|Lord Darcy]]'' stories, while mostly based on Nero Wolfe, also has elements of Mycroft, in that he is a government official related to the detective and, while just as intelligent as his relative, has little interest in using his intellect to solve crimes.
* First series of ''[[seaQuest DSV]]'', in the episode "Photon Bullet", a reformed computer hacker used the [[user (computing)|handle]] "Mycroft" while at an underwater telecommunications node.
* British writer Colin Dexter, author of the Inspector Morse series of books, wrote a Sherlock Holmes short story "A Case of Mis-Identity", part of a collection of short stories published under the title "Morse's Greatest Mystery", in which Watson's practical knowledge of the circumstances of a case outwits both Sherlock and Mycroft.
* [[Agatha Christie]] in ''[[The Big Four (novel)|The Big Four]]'' introduced "Achille Poirot, the brother of [[Hercule Poirot]]". This is considered a deliberate [[parody]] of Mycroft Holmes. (In one passage, Hercule Poirot actually says: "Don't you know that every detective has a brother who is smarter but less practical than himself?") Later in the book, Christie gives the impression that in fact "Achille" was Poirot himself in disguise. The Holmes brothers are mentioned again in ''The Labors of Hercules'', in which one of Poirot's friends teases him about his unusual Christian name. He jokes that Mrs. Poirot and Mrs. Holmes must have collaborated when naming their sons.
* In [[John Dickson Carr]]'s "[[Sir Henry Merrivale]]" novels, the brilliant, overweight Military Intelligence chief is compared to Mycroft Holmes, much to his annoyance.
* A resemblance has been noted between Mycroft Holmes and Rex Stout's [[Nero Wolfe]]; it has been suggested that they may have been related. There no evidence that Stout himself intended this to be the case. The best-known form of this hypothesis — popularised by [[William S. Baring-Gould]], who wrote "biographies" of both Sherlock Holmes and Nero Wolfe — holds that Wolfe is the offspring of Sherlock and [[Irene Adler]].
* At one point it was planned for [[Gregory House]] (who is based on Sherlock Holmes and also lives at 221B) to have an elder brother who was based on Mycroft. [[Stephen Fry]] (who was the comedic partner of [[Hugh Laurie]]) was to play him but was unable, due to other commitments.  Fry would later go on to portray Mycroft in the 2011 film "[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]"
* In the TV series ''[[Numb3rs (TV series)|Numb3rs]]'' episode "[[Angels and Devils (Numbers)|Angels and Devils]]", [[Larry Fleinhardt]], played by [[Peter MacNicol]], says: "I have rather always fancied myself more as a Mycroft than a Dr. Watson." He expands upon this reference in the series finale when he assumes the role of math/science expert for the FBI in place of [[Charlie Eppes]] saying, "...like Sherlock's brother Mycroft Holmes, I prefer to do the conceptualizing, leaving the grunt work to others."
* In [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]]'s manga series ''[[Embalming (manga)|Embalming -The Another Tale of Frankenstein-]]'', Asuhit Richter goes to the [[Diogenes Club]] in London to meet one of the club's founders and his client "Mike Roft", a play on Mycroft, who is also a high-standing government official. Mike remarks that "if you are looking for someone, my younger brother is quite good at that type of thing" and has him locate Dr. Peabody and Fury Flatliner. Only the younger brother's silhouette is shown, but it is obviously that of Sherlock Holmes.
* In the [[Honor Harrington]] novel ''[[A Rising Thunder]]'', the name Mycroft is used as the code designation for a new Manticoran missile fire control system to be deployed for system defense, based somewhat upon the Havenites' 'Moriarty' system (the name of which is a reference to [[Professor Moriarty]]).

The '''Manx shearwater''' (''Puffinus puffinus'') is a medium-sized [[shearwater]] in the [[seabird]] family [[Procellariidae]]. The scientific name of this [[species]] records a name shift: ''Manx shearwaters'' were called ''Manks puffins'' in the 17th century. Puffin is an [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] word ([[Middle English]] ''pophyn'') for the cured carcasses of nestling shearwaters. The [[Atlantic puffin]] acquired the name much later, possibly because of its similar nesting habits.<ref name = leehaney1996>Lee & Haney (1996)</ref>

==Description==
[[File:Puffinus puffinus -Iceland -flying-6.jpg|left|thumb|Flying in Iceland]]
This [[bird]] is 30–38&nbsp;cm long, with a 76–89&nbsp;cm wingspan. It has the typically "shearing" flight of the genus, dipping from side to side on stiff wings with few wingbeats, the wingtips almost touching the water. This bird looks like a flying cross, with its wing held at right angles to the body, and it changes from black to white as the black upperparts and white undersides are alternately exposed as it travels low over the sea.

==Taxonomy==
At some time or another, every living one of the middle-sized species of ''Puffinus'' has been considered a subspecies of ''P. puffinus''. The extant [[yelkouan shearwater]] and [[Balearic shearwater]] (Sangster ''et al.'' 2002), [[Hutton's shearwater]],{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[black-vented shearwater]],{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[Townsend's shearwater]],{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} the [[Hawaiian shearwater]],{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the [[fluttering shearwater]]{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} are now considered good species. Of these, only the Hawaiian and possibly Townsend's shearwaters seem to be somewhat closely related to the Manx shearwater (Austin 1996); the former ''Puffinus puffinus'' "[[superspecies]]" has turned out to be a number of more or less distantly related lineages. However, including the extinct forms listed below, at least the Mediterranean taxa do apparently constitute a superspecies in their own right, and maybe the New Zealand ones also.

Also belonging to this complex seem to be several [[extinct]] species:
* [[Lava shearwater]] or Olson's shearwater, ''Puffinus olsoni'' from the [[Canary Islands]], as was
* [[Hole's shearwater]], ''Puffinus holeae'', which also occurred on the western coasts of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], and
* [[Scarlett's shearwater]], ''Puffinus spelaeus'' of South Island, New Zealand;
Undescribed remains found on [[Menorca]] may belong to an already-named or a new taxon; they are not from the Balearic shearwater (Alcover 2001) which is possibly closer to ''P. holeae'' than to any other known species, living or extinct.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} There also existed a Late [[Pliocene]]/Early [[Pleistocene]] species known from [[Ibiza]], ''[[Puffinus nestori]]'', which may have been the direct ancestor of the [[Mediterranean shearwater]] (Heidrich ''et al.'' 1998).

The [[Atlantic]] forms are [[parapatric]] whereas the [[Pacific]] forms are [[sympatric]] or were not too long ago (Holdaway ''et al.'' 2001) and are [[reproductive isolation|reproductively isolated]] by a different [[wikt:circannual|circannual]] rhythm.

==Range and habitat==
The prefix ''Manx'', meaning from the [[Isle of Man]], originated owing to the once large colony of Manx shearwaters found on the [[Calf of Man]] (a small island just south of the Isle of Man). The species became extinct as a breeding bird there owing to the accidental introduction of rats from a shipwreck in the late 18th century; however a recent control program has resulted in Manx shearwaters returning to breed in small numbers.

[[File:800,Manx shearwater.jpg|thumb|left|Manx shearwater]]

==Behaviour==
Manx shearwaters are long-lived birds. A Manx shearwater breeding on [[Copeland Island]], [[Northern Ireland]], was as of 2003/04 the oldest known living wild bird in the world: [[bird ringing|ringed]] as an adult (at least 5 years old) in July 1953, it was retrapped in July 2003, at least 55 years old.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}

This is a gregarious species, which can be seen in large numbers from boats or headlands, especially on [[bird migration|migration]] in autumn. It is silent at sea, but at night the breeding colonies are alive with raucous cackling calls.

===Food and feeding===
The Manx shearwater feeds on small [[fish]] (particularly [[herring]], [[sprat]] and [[sardine]]s), [[crustacean]]s, [[cephalopod]]s and surface [[offal]]. The bird forages individually or in small flocks, and it makes use of feeding [[marine mammal]]s and schools of predatory fish, which push prey species up to the surface. It does not follow boats.

===Breeding===
This species breeds in the North Atlantic, with major colonies on islands and coastal cliffs around Great Britain and Ireland. Manx shearwaters have nested along the Atlantic coast of northeastern North America since the 1970s and have expanded their breeding range southward into the [[Gulf of Maine]], with a pair confirmed as nesting at [[Matinicus Rock Light|Matinicus Rock]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/fieldnotes/regmap.cfm?arskey=26734 |title=Manx Shearwaters Decide National Wildlife Refuge is Perfect Place to Raise a Chick |date=8 September 2009 | publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref> They nest in [[Burrow nest|burrows]], laying one white egg which they visit only at night to avoid predation by large [[gull]]s. The islands are usually free of mammalian predators (but on the island of [[Rùm]], about 4&nbsp;percent of the chicks are preyed on by [[red deer]] that need extra calcium.<ref>

===Migration===
Manx shearwaters [[bird migration|migrate]] over 10,000&nbsp;km to [[South America]] in winter, using waters off southern [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]],<ref>

==Folklore==
In the 19th-century Manx novel ''[[The Manxman (novel)|The Manxman]]'' by [[Sir Hall Caine]], a reference is made to the satanic folklore surrounding the Manx shearwater, apparently due to its unusual call and dark appearance.

'''The [[music]] of [[Arizona]]''' originally was influenced by [[Native American music]].  In the 20th century,  [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[immigration|immigrants]].  [[Banda music|Banda]], [[corridos]], [[mariachi]] and [[conjunto]] became popular in Arizona, and the music has been influenced by immigrant communities in the state.

Other major influences come from styles popular throughout the rest of the [[United States]].

==Flagstaff==

[[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] has a community (non-professional) orchestra, the Flagstaff Symphony Orchestra. The FSO includes both townspeople and faculty and students from [[Northern Arizona University]]. The [[Orpheum Theater (Flagstaff)|Orpheum Theater]] is the largest performing venue in northern Arizona.{{citation needed|date= October 2014}}  The city hosts two [[music festival]]s, the [[Flagstaff Folk Festival]] and the [[Flagstaff Music Festival]].

Native American flautist [[R. Carlos Nakai]] was born in Flagstaff.

==Phoenix==
{{Refimprove section|date= October 2014}}
[[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] has been called a "rock mecca" by Jim Adkins of the Phoenix rock band [[Jimmy Eat World]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jimmy Eat World Interview |url=http://music.ign.com/articles/569/569227p1.html |work= |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=2004-11-29 |accessdate= November 11, 2009 }}</ref>  [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] (home of [[Arizona State University]]) and [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]] also coexist with Phoenix as part of the Arizona musical scene. Other Phoenix bands include the [[Meat Puppets]], [[Gin Blossoms]], [[Phunk Junkeez]], [[Dead Hot Workshop]], [[Opiate for the Masses]], [[The Jetzons]],  [[Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers]].

In the 1960s, rock and R&B bands inspired by [[British Invasion]] groups like [[The Beatles]] appeared in Phoenix.  Musicians to emerge from this era include [[Alice Cooper]], and [[Bill Spooner]] of [[The Tubes]].  The group [[Pages (band)|Pages]] was formed by Phoenix residents [[Richard Page (musician)|Richard Page]] and [[Steve George (keyboardist)|Steve George]], who later formed the nucleus of the pop-rock group [[Mr. Mister]].  [[Dolan Ellis]] has lived in Phoenix most of his adult life.  He moved to LA in the early 1960s, where he was an original member of the Grammy-winning folk group [[The New Christy Minstrels]].  Dolan returned to Phoenix while the group was still at its peak.  In February 1966, Governor Sam Goddard appointed Dolan as Arizona's Official State Balladeer, which was renewed under ten governors consecutively.  He was selected as the first [[Arizona Culture Keeper]], and Senator [[John McCain]] read his accomplishments into the U.S. [[Congressional Record]].  Dolan spent a few years away from Phoenix from about 1993 through 2003, to found the Arizona Folklore Preserve in Ramsey Canyon.

[[Lalo Guerrero]], known as the "Father of Chicano Music" and a recipient of the [[National Medal of Arts]], was born in Tucson, where he lived until his early 20s.  He died on March 17, 2005, at the age of 89, and was one of the first inductees to the [[Arizona Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame]].

[[Travis Edmonson]] was named Tucson's "Singing Ambassador of Goodwill" in 1975, a mayoral appointment that still stands today.

'''Simon Maccabeus''' also referred to as '''Simon Thassi''' (died 135 BCE) was the second son of [[Mattathias Maccabaeus|Mattathias]] and thus a member of the [[Hasmonean]] family. The name "Thassi" has an uncertain meaning ("the Director", "the Guide", "the Man of Counsel", and "the Zealous" are all possible meanings of the term<ref>http://net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=Thassi</ref>)

He took a prominent part in the [[Jew]]ish revolt against the [[Seleucid Empire]] led by his brothers, [[Judas Maccabaeus]] and [[Jonathan Maccabaeus]]. The successes of the Jews rendered it expedient for the pretenders to the throne of Syria to show them special favor, and therefore Antiochus VI. appointed Simon strategus, or military commander, of the coast region from the Ladder of Tyre to Egypt. As strategus Simon conquered the cities of Beth-zur and Joppa, garrisoning them with Jewish troops, and built the fortress of Adida in the plain<ref name=je>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13746-simon-maccabeus "Simon Maccabeus", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']</ref> 

After the capture of Jonathan, Simon was elected leader by the people, assembled at Jerusalem; he at once completed the fortification of the capital, and made Joppa secure by expelling its Gentile inhabitants and filling it with Jews (I Macc. xiii. 8, 10, 11; "Ant." xiii. 6, § 4). At Hadid he blocked the advance of the treacherous Trypho, who was attempting to enter the country and seize the throne of Syria. Since Trypho could gain nothing by force, he demanded a ransom for Jonathan and the surrender of Jonathan's sons as hostages. Although Simon was fully aware that Trypho would deceive him, he acceded to both demands, so that the people might see that he had done everything possible for his brother. Jonathan was nevertheless treacherously assassinated, and the hostages were not returned. Simon thus became the sole leader of the people.<ref name=je/>

As the opponent of Trypho, Simon had every reason to side with Demetrius II., to whom he sent a deputation requesting freedom from taxation for the country. The fact that his request was granted implied the recognition of the political independence of Judea.<ref name=je/>

He became the first prince of the [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] [[Hasmonean|Hasmonean Dynasty]]. He reigned from [[142 BCE|142]] to 135 BCE. 

The Hasmonean Dynasty was founded by a resolution, adopted in 141 BCE, at a large assembly "of the priests and the people and of the elders of the land, to the effect that Simon should be their leader and high priest forever, until there should arise a faithful prophet" ([[1 Maccabees]] 14:41). 

Recognition of the new dynasty by the [[Roman Republic]] was accorded by the Senate about 139 BCE, when the delegation of Simon was in [[Rome]]. Simon made the Jewish people semi-independent of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. 

In February 135 BCE, he was assassinated at the instigation of his son-in-law [[Ptolemy (son of Abubus)|Ptolemy, son of Abubus]]. Simon was followed by his third son, [[John Hyrcanus]], whose two elder brothers, Mattathias and Judah, had been murdered, together with their father.

[[Music of Vienna|Vienna]] has  been an important center of musical innovation.  18th- and 19th-century composers were drawn to the city due to the patronage of the [[Habsburg]]s, and made Vienna the European capital of [[Classical period (music)|classical music]].  [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert]] and [[Johann Strauss II]], among others, were associated with the city, with Schubert being born in Vienna.  During the [[Baroque]] period, [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Magyars|Hungarian]] [[folk music|folk]] forms influenced Austrian music.  Vienna's status began its rise as a cultural center in the early 16th century, and was focused around instruments including the [[lute]].

==Yodel==
{{details|Yodeling}}

Yodeling, a form of singing that involves rapid and repeated changes of register, was developed in the Alps. What Austria called it was "juchizn"
.

==Rock and Pop music==

[[Falco (musician)|Falco]] was the most popular Austrian solo artist throughout the 1980s. His song "[[Rock Me Amadeus]]" reached the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1986. His sudden death in 1998 in the [[Dominican Republic]] catapulted his music from the 1980s once again into the spotlight.

Although Austria is not exactly the biggest exporter of international [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Pop music|pop]]-bands, there are a few notable musicians and bands.

[[Opus (Austrian band)|Opus]] also made it in the charts worldwide as well. In the last few years, several music groups toured Europe and had commercial success in the international charts. The most prominent being [[Christina Stürmer]], who is successful in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. [[SheSays]], who supported [[Bryan Adams]] on his European tour and some other bands like [[Album Oriented Rock|AOR]], and [[Cornerstone (Austrian Band)|Cornerstone]], are notable for their recent contributions.

Blackened [[death metal]] trio [[Belphegor (band)|Belphegor]] currently leads the Austrian metal scene, which also includes [[Hollenthon]], [[Pungent Stench]], [[Abigor]], [[Disharmonic Orchestra]], [[Visions of Atlantis]], [[Dornenreich]], [[Summoning (band)|Summoning]] and [[Estatic Fear]].

[[Christian Fennesz]] is an Austrian electronic musician who has attained worldwide prominence. Other electronic musicians who call Austria home include [[Der Blutharsch]], active in the [[Neofolk]] scene, as are [[Sturmpercht]].

Drummer [[Thomas Lang]] was born in Vienna in 1967 and is now world renowned for his technical abilities, having played with artists such as [[Robert Fripp]], [[Geri Halliwell]] and [[Robbie Williams]].

There is not a big [[indie rock]] scene in Austria. One of the few international touring bands is [[Killed By 9V Batteries]] from Vienna.

Yearly the [[Waves Vienna]] Music Festival & Conference takes place in October. This festival is a showcase festival for European pop music acts. The [[Donau Festival]] takes place in the spring each year and has a focus on [[experimental rock]], [[avant garde music]] and other progressive genres of [[alternative music]].

==Contemporary classical music==

The [[Vienna Philharmonic]] is a world-renowned classical music ensemble and tours throughout the year all over the world.  Their [[Vienna New Year's Concert|New Year's Day concert]] held in [[Vienna]] every year in the [[Musikverein]] is one of Europe's most important classical concerts during the year.

==Electronic music==

There are some small electronic music groups and artists from Austria, such as [[A.G.Trio]] and [Kruder and Dorfmeister]. [[Drum 'n' Bass]] also has a healthy scene in Austria, with internationally successful Artists like [[Camo & Krooked]],  Disaszt, [[Ill.Skillz]] and Mefjus.

==Neue Deutsche Härte==

[[Neue Deutsche Härte]] (New German Hardness) is most popular in Austria and the rest of [[German-speaking Europe]]. Notable bands include [[Stahlhammer]] and [[L'Âme Immortelle]], both of which have had some international success. The German band [[Samsas Traum]] is now based in Austria as well.

[[Image:Levellers declaration and standard.gif|thumb|300px|Woodcut from a Diggers document by [[William Everard (Digger)|William Everard]]]]

The '''Diggers''' were a group of [[Protestant]] English [[Agrarian socialism|agrarian socialists]],{{sfn|Campbell|2009|p=129}}<ref name="true_levellers">E.g. "That we may work in righteousness, and lay the Foundation of making the Earth a Common Treasury for All, both Rich and Poor, That every one that is born in the Land, may be fed by the Earth his Mother that brought him forth, according to the Reason that rules in the Creation. Not Inclosing any part into any particular hand, but all as one man, working together, and feeding together as Sons of one Father, members of one Family; not one Lording over another, but all looking upon each other, as equals in the Creation;" in [http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/Renascence_Editions/digger.html The True Levellers Standard A D V A N C E D: or, The State of Community opened, and Presented to the Sons of Men]</ref> begun by [[Gerrard Winstanley]] as ''True Levellers'' in 1649, who became known as ''Diggers,'' because of their attempts to farm on common land.

Their original name came from their belief in economic equality based upon a specific passage in the [[Book of Acts]].<ref>Acts 4:32, Today's English Version: "The group of believers was one in mind and heart. No one said that any of his belongings was his own, but they all shared with one another everything they had."</ref><ref>The "[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/Renascence_Editions/digger.html The True Levellers Standard A D V A N C E D]" specifically mentions Acts 4.32</ref> The Diggers tried (by "leveling" [[real property]]) to reform the existing [[social order]] with an agrarian lifestyle based on their ideas for the creation of small [[egalitarian]] rural communities. They were one of a number of [[nonconformist]] [[English Dissenters|dissenting groups]] that emerged around this time.

==Historical background==
The year 1649 was a time of great social unrest in [[England]]. The [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] had won the [[English Civil War#The First English Civil War|First English Civil War]] but failed to negotiate a constitutional settlement with the defeated King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. When members of Parliament and the [[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandees]] in the [[New Model Army]] were faced with Charles' perceived duplicity, they tried and executed him.

Government through the King's [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] was replaced with a new body called the [[English Council of State|Council of State]], which due to fundamental disagreements within a weakened Parliament was dominated by the Army. Many people were active in politics, suggesting alternative forms of government to replace the old order. Royalists wished to place King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] on the throne; men like [[Oliver Cromwell]] wished to govern with a [[plutocratic]] Parliament voted in by an electorate based on [[property]], similar to that which was enfranchised before the civil war; agitators called [[Levellers]], influenced by the writings of [[John Lilburne]],  wanted parliamentary government based on an electorate of every male head of a household; [[Fifth Monarchy Men]] advocated a [[theocracy]]; and the Diggers, led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]], advocated a more radical solution.

==Theory==
In 1649 [[Gerrard Winstanley]] and 14 others published a pamphlet<ref name="true_levellers">[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/Renascence_Editions/digger.html ''The True Levellers Standard A D V A N C E D: or, The State of Community opened, and Presented to the Sons of Men'']
</ref> in which they called themselves the "True Levellers" to distinguish their ideas from those of the [[Levellers]]. Once they put their idea into practice and started to cultivate common land, both opponents and supporters began to call them "Diggers". The Diggers' beliefs were informed by Winstanley's writings which envisioned an ecological interrelationship between humans and nature, acknowledging the inherent connections between people and their surroundings.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} [[Gerrard Winstanley|Winstanley]] declared that "true freedom lies where a man receives his nourishment and preservation, and that is in the use of the earth".<ref>Grant, Neil. ''Hamlyn Children's History of Britain: From the Stone Age to the Present Day'', 2nd Rev edition (Dean, 1992), p.144</ref>

An undercurrent of political thought which has run through English society for many generations and resurfaced from time to time (for example, in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381) was present in some of the political factions of the 17th century, including those who formed the Diggers. It involved the common belief that England had become subjugated by the "[[Norman Yoke]]". This legend offered an explanation that at one time a [[Golden age (metaphor)|''golden Era'']] had existed in England before the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066. From the Conquest on, the Diggers argued, the "common people of England" had been robbed of their birthrights and exploited by a foreign ruling-class.

==Practice==

===St George's Hill, Weybridge, Surrey===
The Council of State received a letter in April 1649 reporting that several individuals had begun to plant vegetables in common land on [[St George's Hill]], [[Weybridge]] near [[Cobham, Surrey]] at a time when food prices reached an all-time high. Sanders reported that they had invited "all to come in and help them, and promise them meat, drink, and clothes." They intended to pull down all [[enclosure]]s and cause the local populace to come and work with them. They claimed that their number would be several thousand within ten days. "It is feared they have some design in hand." In the same month, the Diggers issued their most famous pamphlet and manifesto, called "The True Levellers Standard Advanced".<ref name="true_levellers" />

At the behest of the local landowners, the commander of the New Model Army, Sir [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Baron Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]], duly arrived with his troops and interviewed Winstanley and another prominent member of the Diggers, [[William Everard (Digger)|William Everard]]. Everard suspected that the Diggers were in serious trouble and soon left the group. Fairfax, meanwhile, having concluded that Diggers were doing no harm,  advised the local landowners to use the courts.

Winstanley remained and continued to write about the treatment they received. The harassment from the [[Lord of the Manor]], Francis Drake (not the famous [[Francis Drake]], who had died more than 50 years before), was both deliberate and systematic: he organised gangs in an attack on the Diggers, including numerous beatings and an [[arson]] attack on one of the communal houses. Following a court case, in which the Diggers were forbidden to speak in their own defence, they were found guilty of being [[Ranters]], a radical sect associated with liberal sexuality (though in fact [[Gerrard Winstanley|Winstanley]] had reprimanded Ranter [[Laurence Clarkson]] for his sexual practices).{{sfn|Laurence|1980|p=57}}{{sfn|Vann|1965|p=133}} Having lost the court case, if they had not left the land, then the army could have been used to enforce the law and evict them; so they abandoned Saint George's Hill in August 1649, much to the relief of the local [[Fee simple|freeholders]].

===Little Heath near Cobham===
Some of the evicted Diggers moved a short distance to [[Little Heath, Surrey|Little Heath]] in [[Surrey]]. {{Convert|11|acre|ha|sigfig=2}} were cultivated, six houses built, winter crops harvested, and several pamphlets published. After initially expressing some sympathy for them, the local lord of the manor of [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham]], Parson [[John Platt (parson)|John Platt]], became their chief enemy. He used his power to stop local people helping them and he organised attacks on the Diggers and their property. By April 1650, Platt and other local landowners succeeded in driving the Diggers from Little Heath.

===Wellingborough, Northamptonshire===
There was another community of Diggers close to [[Wellingborough]] in [[Northamptonshire]]. In 1650, the community published a declaration which started:
:A Declaration of the Grounds and Reasons why we the Poor Inhabitants of the Town of Wellingborrow, in the County of Northampton, have begun and give consent to dig up, manure and sow Corn upon the Common, and waste ground, called Bareshanke belonging to the Inhabitants of Wellinborrow, by those that have Subscribed and hundreds more that give Consent....<ref name="declaration">[http://www.rogerlovejoy.co.uk/philosophy/diggers/diggers3.htm A Declaration by the Diggers of Wellingborough – 1650]</ref>

This colony was probably founded as a result of contact with the Surrey Diggers. In late March 1650, four emissaries from the Surrey colony were arrested in Buckinghamshire bearing a letter signed by the Surrey Diggers including Gerrard Winstanley and Robert Coster inciting people to start Digger colonies and to provide money for the Surrey Diggers.  According to the newspaper ''A Perfect Diurnall'' the emissaries had travelled a circuit through the counties of [[Surrey]], [[Middlesex]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[Bedfordshire]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[Berkshire]], [[Huntingdonshire]] and [[Northamptonshire]] before being apprehended.<ref>[[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]], 'Another Digger Broadside' Past and Present No.42, (1969) pp. 57–6.)</ref>

On April 15, 1650, the Council of State ordered Mr Pentlow, a [[justice of the peace]] for Northamptonshire to proceed against 'the Levellers in those parts' and to have them tried at the next Quarter Session.<ref>Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, 1650 (London, 1876) p. 106.</ref>  The [[#Iver, Buckinghamshire|Iver Diggers]] recorded that, nine of the Wellingborough Diggers were arrested and imprisoned in Northampton jail and although no charges could be proved against them the justice refused to release them.

Captain [[William Thompson (Leveller)|William Thompson]], the leader of the failed "[[Banbury mutiny]]," was killed in a skirmish close to the community by soldiers loyal to Oliver Cromwell in May 1649.

===Iver, Buckinghamshire===
Another colony of Diggers connected to the Surrey and Wellingborough colony was set up in [[Iver]], [[Buckinghamshire]] about {{Convert|14|mi|km}} from the Surrey Diggers colony at St George's Hill (see Keith Thomas, 'Another Digger Broadside' Past and Present No.42, (1969) pp.&nbsp;57–68).  The Iver Diggers "''Declaration of the grounds and Reasons, why we the poor Inhabitants of the Parrish of Iver in Buckinghamshire ...''"<ref>[http://phoenixandturtle.net/excerptmill/hopton.htm#iver A Declaration of the Grounds and Reasons (Iver)] from Hopton, Andrew, ed. Digger Tracts, 1649–50.  London: Aporia, 1989. (transcribed by Clifford Stetner)</ref> revealed that there were further Digger colonies in Barnet in Hertfordshire, Enfield in Middlesex, Dunstable in Bedfordshire, Bosworth in Gloucestershire and a further colony in Nottinghamshire. It also revealed that after the failure of the Surrey colony, the Diggers had left their children to be cared for by parish funds.

==Influence==

===The San Francisco Diggers===
{{main|Diggers (theater)}}
During the middle and late 1960s, the [[Diggers (theater)|San Francisco Diggers]] (who took their name from the original English Diggers) opened stores which simply gave away their stock; provided free food, medical care, transport and temporary housing; they also organized free music concerts and works of political art. Some of their happenings included the Death of Money Parade, Intersection Game, Invisible Circus, and Death of Hippie/Birth of Free.

The Diggers were a [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[Community organizing|community-action group]] of community [[activists]] and [[Improvisational theatre|Improv]] actors operating from 1966–68, based in the [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood of [[San Francisco]]. Their politics were such that they have sometimes been categorized as "[[left-wing]]". More precisely, they were "community [[anarchists]]" who blended a desire for freedom with a consciousness of the community in which they lived. They were closely associated with and shared a number of members with a [[guerilla theater]] group named the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]]. Like the English Diggers, they envisioned a society free from [[private property]], and all forms of [[Commercialism|buying and selling]]. Actor [[Peter Coyote]] was a founding member of the Diggers.

===Other===
The American Diggers were echoed in the 1960s in the UK (see [[Alternative Society]] and [[Sid Rawle]]). Since the revival of [[anarchism]] in the British [[Road protest in the United Kingdom|anti-roads movement]], the Diggers have been celebrated as precursors of land squatting and communalism. In 2011, an annual festival began in [[Wigan]] to celebrate the Diggers. In 2012, the second annual festival proved a great success, and in [[Wellingborough]], a festival has also been held annually since 2011.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

'''The Diggers''' were a radical community-action group of activists and [[Improvisational theater|Improvisational]] actors operating from 1967 to 1968, based in the [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood of [[San Francisco]]. Their politics have been categorized as "left-wing"; more accurately, they were "community [[anarchists]]" who blended a desire for freedom with a consciousness of the community in which they lived.<ref name=gale>''Contemporary Authors Online'' (2002) Gale, Detroit</ref> They were closely associated and shared a number of members with the [[guerrilla theater]] group [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]].

Actor [[Peter Coyote]] was a founding member of the Diggers.

== Origins ==
The Diggers took their name from the original [[Diggers|English Diggers]] (1649–50) who had promulgated a vision of society free from buying, selling, and private property.<ref name="Digger Archives" /> During the mid- and late 1960s, the San Francisco Diggers organized free music concerts and works of political art, provided free food, medical care, transport, and temporary housing and opened stores that gave away stock. Some of their [[happening]]s included the Death of Money Parade, Intersection Game, Invisible Circus, and Death of Hippie/Birth of Free.<ref name="Digger Chronology" />

The group was founded by [[Emmett Grogan]], [[Peter Coyote]], Peter Berg (later director of Planet Drum),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.planetdrum.org |title=Welcome to Planet Drum Foundation |author= |date= |work=Planet Drum Foundation website |accessdate=October 28, 2010}}</ref> and other members of the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]] including [[Billy Murcott]], [[Roberto La Morticella]], and [[Brooks Bucher]].<ref name="Digger Chronology">{{cite web |url=http://www.diggers.org/chrono_diggers.asp |title=The Chronology of Digger History |accessdate=2007-06-17 |work=The Digger Archives }}</ref>

== Activities ==
The group sought to create a mini-society free of money and [[capitalism]].<ref name="American Experience doc">{{cite video

</ref> The Diggers provided a free food service in the Panhandle of [[Golden Gate Park]] in [[Haight-Ashbury]] every day at four o'clock, generally feeding over 200 people with a stew from donated meat and vegetables that was served from behind a giant yellow picture frame, called the Free Frame of Reference. On one occasion, at a free concert in the park, people who came for the food were given a two-inch-by-two-inch frame to hang about their necks, called the portable Free Frame of Reference. The Diggers also popularized [[whole wheat bread]] with their Digger Bread, baked in coffee cans at the Free Bakery in the basement of [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] All Saints Church on 1350 Waller Street.<ref name="Digger Archives">{{cite web |url=http://www.diggers.org/overview.htm |title= Overview: who were (are) the Diggers? |accessdate=2007-06-17 | work=The Digger Archives}}</ref> In cooperation with All Saints Church and later via the [[Haight Ashbury Switchboard]] at 1830 Fell Street, they arranged free “crashpads” for homeless youth drawn to the Haight-Ashbury area.

They opened numerous [[Free store|Free Store]]s in Haight-Ashbury, in which all items were free for the taking or giving. The stores offered discarded items that were still in usable condition.  The first Free Store, in a six-car garage on Page Street that they found filled with empty frames that they tacked up on the side of the building, was called the Free Frame of Reference and was later superseded by the Trip Without a Ticket on Frederick Street. It was unclear how the stores were funded. The 1% Free poster, showing two Chinese [[Tong (organization)|Tong]] assassins under the Chinese character for revolution, was thought to be demanding a 1% tithe from merchants, but that was not the case. The poster was a challenge, implicitly suggesting that 'free' people were the minority, and inciting others to step up. They also opened a Free Medical Clinic, initially by inviting volunteers from the University of California, San Francisco medical school up the hill from the neighborhood.

They threw free parties with music provided by the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and other bands. They also staged street theater events such as driving a truck of semi-naked belly dancers through the Financial District, inviting brokers to climb on board and forget their work. On December 17, 1966, the Diggers held a happening called “The Death of Money” in which they dressed in animal masks and carried a large coffin full of fake money down Haight Street, singing “Get out my life, why don’t you babe?” to the tune of Chopin’s “Death March.”<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/love/sfeature/timeline.html |title=The Year of the Hippie |accessdate=2014-03-05 |work=PBS American Experience documentary companion website}}</ref> This was a precursor to the happening “The Death of Hippie,” staged in October 1967. In “The Death of Hippie,” also staged in the Haight Ashby neighborhood, masked participants carried a coffin with the words "Hippie--Son of Media" on the side. This event was meant to mark the end of the era of Haight-Ashbury. The event was staged in such a way that any media outlet that simply described the happening would unknowingly transmit the Diggers' message that Hippies were a media invention. This was called "creating the condition you describe".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.diggers.org/oralhistory/peter_interview.html |title= Peter Coyote: Interview by Etan Ben-Ami Mill Valley, California January 12, 1989 |accessdate=2014-03-10 |work=The Digger Archives}}</ref> The Diggers skillfully used this technique for media relations. Their own publications, notably [[the Digger Papers]], are the origin of such phrases as "Do your own  thing" and "Today is the first day of the rest of your life." The Diggers fostered and inspired later groups like the [[Yippies]].

Contrary to popular opinion, the Diggers did not fall apart but evolved into the larger and more complex Free Family.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} While the Free Food and Medical Clinics were responses to necessary conditions caused by the enormous influx of young people during the heyday of the hippie scene, conditions that the San Francisco government was ignoring, the Diggers' central tenet was to be "authentic".  Running soup kitchens and medical clinics was not the authentic, long-term concern of the Diggers' founders. After passing those institutions on to a local Church and Dr. David Smith to continue, the Diggers moved out of the City, creating various land bases in Forest Knolls, Olema, Covelo, Salmon River, Trinidad, and Black Bear California. In those places they integrated with other groups: The Free Bakery, the [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]], and the Gypsy Truckers, creating The Free Family. That larger group still exists informally, and many of the Diggers' children and grandchildren remain close and in contact with one another, and many (children included) are still involved with progressive causes.

Various alternative communities like those the Diggers founded were covered in a documentary film made by [[Will Vinton]], who later went on to fame for his ClayMation clay-animation studio in Portland, Oregon,  His 1970-ish documentary feature-length film was titled "Gone for  A Better Deal," which, so far, has never been released to any video format.

Haight-Ashbury Golden-Gate park poet [[Ashleigh Brilliant]], later known for his series of epigrams on cards and in books called "pot-Shots," has recently released a CD  of his songs, parodies of old movie and show tunes about "life in the Haight."  The album includes two songs about the Diggers.

The '''Balearic shearwater''' (''Puffinus mauretanicus'') is a medium-sized [[shearwater]] in the [[seabird]] family ''Procellariidae''. It was long regarded a [[subspecies]] of the [[Manx shearwater]] (see there for more on the ''Puffinus puffinus'' [[superspecies]]); following an initial split it was held to be a subspecies of the "Mediterranean shearwater" (Sibley & Monroe 1990<ref>[[Charles Sibley|'''Sibley''', Charles Gald]] & '''Monroe''', Burt L. Jr. (1990): ''Distribution and taxonomy of the birds of the world''. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT. ISBN 0-300-04969-2</ref>) for nearly ten more years, until it was resolved to be a distinct [[species]], separate from the [[yelkouan shearwater]] (Wink ''et al.'' 1993,<ref>'''Wink''', Michael; Heidrich, Petra & Ristow, D. (1993): Genetic evidence for speciation of the Manx shearwater (''Puffinus puffinus'') and the Mediterranean Shearwater (''P. yelkouan''). ''Die Vogelwelt'' '''114'''(6): 226-232. [Article in English with German abstract] [http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/institute/fak14/ipmb/phazb/pubwink/1993/23.%201993.pdf PDF fulltext]</ref> Heidrich ''et al.'' 1998,<ref name="Heidrich">'''Heidrich''', Petra; Amengual, José F. & Wink, Michael (1998): Phylogenetic relationships in Mediterranean and North Atlantic shearwaters (Aves: Procellariidae) based on nucleotide sequences of mtDNA.

It is the last [[taxon]] of the ''puffinus'' complex that was recognized as a separate entity.

It appears to belong to a group of Mediterranean and adjacent [[Atlantic]] species which includes the [[yelkouan shearwater]] (Austin 1996<ref>'''Austin''', Jeremy J. (1996): Molecular Phylogenetics of ''Puffinus'' Shearwaters: Preliminary Evidence from Mitochondrial Cytochrome ''b'' Gene Sequences. ''Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution'' '''6'''(1): 77–88. {{DOI|10.1006/mpev.1996.0060}} (HTML abstract)</ref>) and one to three [[prehistory|prehistorically]] [[extinct]] taxa, [[Hole's shearwater|Hole's]] and possibly also [[Olson's shearwater]] and an undescribed form of unclear distinctness from [[Menorca]] (Alcover 2001<ref>'''Alcover''', Josep Antoni (2001): Nous avenços en el coneixement dels ocells fòssils de les Balears. ''Anuari Ornitològic de les Balears'' '''16''': 3-13. [Article in Catalan, English abstract] [http://www.gobmallorca.com/ornit/anuari/anuari2001/fossils.pdf PDF fulltext]</ref>). Hole's shearwater may be the closest known relative of ''P. mauretanicus''{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. The two living Mediterranean lineages had probably separated before the end of the [[Pliocene]] (c. 2 [[mya (unit)|mya]]), as indicated by molecular differences and the [[Ibiza]]n fossil ''[[Puffinus nestori]]'' from the Late Pliocene or Early [[Pleistocene]], which may have been the direct ancestor of the present species (Heidrich ''et al.'' 1998<ref name="Heidrich"/>).

This species breeds on islands and coastal cliffs in the [[Balearic islands]]. Most winter in that sea, but some [[bird migration|enter]] the Atlantic in late summer, reaching north to [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]].

This species nests in [[Burrow nest|burrows]] which are visited only at night to avoid predation by large [[gull]]s.

This bird is approximately 33&nbsp;cm long, with an 85–90&nbsp;cm wingspan. It has the typically "shearing" flight of the genus, dipping from side to side on stiff wings with few wingbeats, the wingtips almost touching the water. This bird looks like a flying cross, with its wing held at right angles to the body, and it changes from dark brown to dirty white as the dark upperparts and paler undersides are alternately exposed as it travels low over the sea.

Apart from the less contrasted [[Feather|plumage]], this species is very similar to the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] Manx shearwater and the yelkouan shearwater found elsewhere in the [[Mediterranean]]. There exists at least one mixed breeding colony of Balearic and yelkouan shearwaters, on [[Minorca]], and the species' winter ranges overlap in the Central Mediterranean; for scientific purposes at least, a combination of [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics and [[DNA sequence]] data is suggested to identify the species (Genovart ''et al.'' 2005).

It is under severe threat from the development of holiday resorts near its breeding sites, and also from animals such as [[Feral cat|cat]]s and [[rat]]s. The discovery of yelkouan shearwaters in the Minorcan colony suggests that [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] may also pose a problem (Genovart ''et al.'' 2005<ref>'''Genovart''', Meritxell; Juste, Javier & Oro, Daniel (2005): Two sibling species sympatrically breeding: a new conservation concern for the critically endangered Balearic shearwater. ''Conservation Genetics'' '''6'''(4): 601–606. {{DOI|10.1007/s10592-005-9010-z}} (HTML abstract)</ref>); the Balearic shearwater is considered [[critically endangered]] with extinction by the [[IUCN]]. Recent models estimate a mean decrease of 7.4% per year and a mean extinction time of 40.4 years. This equates to an ongoing decline of more than 80% over the next three generations (54 years).

This is a gregarious species, which can been seen in large numbers from boats or headlands, especially on in autumn.

It is silent at sea, but at night the breeding colonies are alive with raucous cackling calls, higher pitched than the Manx shearwater's.

The Balearic shearwater feeds on [[fish]] and [[mollusc]]s. It does not follow [[boat]]s.

''' France Gall''' (born '''Isabelle Geneviève Marie Anne Gall''' on 9 October 1947) is a popular French [[yé-yé]] singer.

Gall was married to, and had a successful singing career in partnership with, French singer-songwriter Michel Hamburger, whose stage name is [[Michel Berger]].

==Early years==
Gall was born in Paris.  Her father was lyricist [[Robert Gall]], and her mother, [[Cécile Berthier]], was the daughter of [[Paul Berthier]], co-founder of [[Petits Chanteurs à la Croix de Bois]].  (This made her cousin to guitarist [[Denys Lable]] and composer [[Vincent Berthier de Lioncourt]], as well as niece to [[Jacques Berthier]].) The sole daughter of her family, she had two brothers, Patrice and Claude.

In spring 1963, Robert Gall encouraged his daughter to record songs and send the demos to music publisher [[Denis Bourgeois]]. That July, she auditioned for Bourgeois at the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] in Paris, after which Bourgeois wanted to sign her immediately. France was subsequently signed to [[Philips Records|Philips]].

At the time, Bourgeois was working for the label as [[Artistic Director]] for [[Serge Gainsbourg]] and assumed this role for Gall as well. He encouraged her to record four tracks with French [[jazz]] musician, arranger and composer [[Alain Goraguer]].

==Early career==
The first [[Airplay (radio)|airplay]] of France's first single "Ne sois pas si bête" ("Don't Be So Stupid"), occurred on her 16th birthday. It was released in November and became a hit, selling 200,000 copies.<ref>{{cite book| last = | first =| title =Made In France: France Gall's Baby Pop  | publisher = RPM International| year = 2012  | page = 1 | isbn =}}</ref> [[Serge Gainsbourg]], who had released several albums and written songs for singers including [[Michèle Arnaud]] and [[Juliette Gréco]], was asked by Bourgeois to write songs for Gall. Gainsbourg's "N'écoute pas les idoles" ("Don't listen to the idols") became Gall's second single; it reached the top of the French charts in March 1964 and stayed there for three weeks.

At the same time, Gall made her live debut, opening for [[Sacha Distel]] in Belgium. She teamed up with Distel's business manager, [[Maurice Tézé]], who was also a lyricist. This allowed her to create an original repertoire, unlike the majority of her contemporaries ("[[Yé-yé|yéyés]]") who sang adaptations of Anglophone hits. However, under the influence from this team of music veterans, Gall struggled to defend her personal choice of material.

In addition to songs written by her father, Gall's success in the 1960s was built on songs written by some of the biggest names among French composers and lyricists: [[Gérard Bourgeois]], [[Jean-Pierre Bourtayre]], [[Vline Buggy]] [[Pierre Cour]], [[Joe Dassin]], [[Jacques Datin]], [[Pierre Delanoë]], [[Jean Dréjac]], [[Alain Goraguer]], [[Hubert Giraud]], [[Georges Liferman]], [[Guy Magenta]], [[Eddy Marnay]], [[Jean-Michel Rivat]], [[Jean-Max Rivière]], Frank Thomas, [[Maurice Vidalin]], [[André Popp]], [[Gilles Thibaut]], and [[Jean Wiener]].

Gall's songs often featured lyrics based on a stereotypical view of the teenage mind. Elaborate orchestrations by [[Alain Goraguer]] blended styles, permitting her to navigate between [[jazz]], [[children's songs]], and anything in between. Examples of this mixed-genre style included "Jazz à gogo" (lyrics by [[Robert Gall]] and music by [[Alain Goraguer|Goraguer]]) and "Mes premières vraies vacances" (by [[Jacques Datin|Datin]]-[[Maurice Vidalin|Vidalin]]).

Gall and Gainsbourg's association produced many popular singles, continuing through the summer of 1964 with the hit song "[[Laisse tomber les filles]]" ("Never Mind the Girls") followed by "Christiansen" by Datin-Vidalin. Gainsbourg also secretly recorded Gall's laughter to use on ''[[Pauvre Lola]]'', a track on his 1964 album ''Gainsbourg Percussions''. Her laughter is not credited. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Regarding her association with Gainsbourg at this time, Gall said, "This is someone I had the pleasure to see because I admired him and liked what he wrote. And I liked his shyness, his elegance and his education. It was a very pleasant relationship. . . . I was very impressed that this man worked for me and cared about me . . . "<ref name="ReferenceA">''France Gall par France Gall'', autoportrait télévisé ([[France 3]], [[2001 à la télévision|2001]]), quoted in the [[:fr:France Gall|French Wikipedia article about France Gall]]. Original quote: « C’est quelqu’un que j’avais du plaisir à voir parce que je l’admirais et j’aimais ce qu’il écrivait. Et j’aimais bien sa timidité, son élégance et son éducation. C’était très agréable comme relation. […] J’étais très impressionnée que cet homme travaille pour moi et s’intéresse à moi… »</ref>

===1965===
Having previously resisted, Gall gave in to her managers at the end of 1964 and recorded a single intended for children. The song "[[Sacré Charlemagne]]," written by her father, and set to the music of [[George Liferman]], was a hit in 1965, selling 2&nbsp;million copies and peaking at number one.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=lygEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=Billboard+Hits+France+Gall&source=bl&ots=z4eb4nOFL0&sig=ggIbQ20PFTJlEBq8yEVljP1hup0&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=4whNUMaWDYSo0AXQ2oDIAw&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&q=Billboard%20Hits%20France%20Gall&f=false|title=Billboard Magazine, March 1965 |accessdate=2012-09-09 }}</ref>

[[Sylvie Simmons]], in her biography of Gainsbourg, wrote that on the surface, the song appears to be nothing but catchy Eurovision fodder, but "closer examination revealed perspicacious lyrics about the ironies and incongruities inherent in [[teenybopper|baby pop]]. That the songs young people turn to for help in their first attempts at discovering what life and love are about are sung by people too young and inexperienced themselves to be of much assistance, and condemned by their celebrity to be unlikely to soon find out."<ref>Sylvie Simmons, ''Serge Gainsbourg: A Fistful of Gitanes'', ISBN 978-0-306-81183-8, page 42</ref> At a young age, France Gall was too naïve to understand the second meaning of the lyrics. But later on she felt she was manipulated and used by Gainsbourg throughout this period, most notably after the song "[[Les Sucettes]]".

Today France Gall tries to not discuss the Gainsbourg period in public and refuses to perform her winning song.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Summer tour===
In the summer of 1965, France Gall toured France for several months with "Le Grand Cirque de France" ("The Great Circus of France"), a combination of radio show and live circus. Her singles continued to chart successfully, including the Gainsbourg-penned "Attends ou va-t'en" ("Wait for me, or go away") and "Nous ne sommes pas des anges" ("We are not angels"). She also had a hit with the song "Amérique" ("America") by [[Eddy Marnay]] and [[Guy Magenta]].

===Summary===
Stewart Mason sums up this early period of Gall's career, culminating in the Eurovision win:

<blockquote>[A]lthough many dismissed Gall as a Francophone [[Lesley Gore]], making fluffy and ultra-commercial pop hits with little substance, Gall's hits from this era stand up far better than most. Only [[Francoise Hardy]] was consistently making records up to these standards during this era. Though Gall's high, breathy voice was admittedly somewhat limited, she made the most of it. Even dopey hits like "Sacre Charlemagne," a duet with a pair of puppets who were the stars of a children's show on French TV, have an infectious, zesty charm; meatier tunes, like the sultry jazz-tinged ballad "Pense a Moi" and the brilliant rocker "Laisse Tomber les Filles," were as good as any single produced in the U.S. or Great Britain at the time.<ref name="mason" /></blockquote>

==Film opportunities==
After a TV film directed by [[Jean-Christophe Averty]] and dedicated to the songs of Gall was distributed in [[the United States]] in 1965, Gall was sought by [[Walt Disney]] to appear as Alice in a musical film version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', after having already made '' [[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice]]'' into a cartoon in 1951. Although Gall had insisted she did not want to become involved in film work, this was the only project which appealed to her. The project was cancelled after Disney's death in 1966.

In 1966 Gall appeared in the television film '' Viva Morandi'', made in the same psychoanalytical mould as the (1965) [[Federico Fellini]] film '' [[Juliet of the Spirits|Giulietta degli Spiriti]] ("Juliet of the Spirits")''. Gall played "La Grâce" alongside [[Christine Lebail]] who plays "La Pureté", both singing ''Les Sucettes'' in a segment which was prominently labelled "Fantasy", in a clear reference to the song's sexual undertones.

She was approached by director [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] for the leading female role in [[Last Tango in Paris]] (1972). However, she firmly rejected this offer.

Gall once again considered appearing on screen in 1993 for a cinematographic collaboration with her best friend, the screenplay writer [[Telsche Boorman]]. Like the Disney film, this planned project was never completed due to the death of Boorman in 1996.

In a feature film titled [[Gainsbourg (Vie héroïque)]] released in France in January 2010, which is based on the graphic novel by the writer-director of the film, Joann Sfar, Gall is portrayed by [[Sara Forestier]].

==1966==
At the beginning of 1965 Gall released '' Baby pop'', another song written by Gainsbourg, the lyrics of which Gall once described as "brutal"{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}, but whose dark undertones are not easily perceived when one hears the song as sung by the then 18 year-old girl. However, the undertones in her next hit song were not so easily missed, and caused a scandal when it was released. Gainsbourg deliberately filled the song ''[[Les Sucettes]]'' ("Lollipops") with double-meanings and strong sexual innuendo. On the surface, the lyrics tell the innocent tale of a girl named Annie who enjoys lollipops. However, it is clear that Gainsbourg intentionally created the theme as a metaphor for [[fellatio|oral sex]]. Although a big hit, the song sat in stark contrast to genuinely innocent songs on the same album such as ''Je me marie en blanc'' ("White Wedding") and ''Ça me fait rire'' ("It makes me laugh").

The public furor over Les Sucettes would throw Gall’s career off-track for years, and Gall was not left unscathed by the experience.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} She belatedly understood that she had been used: the song was deliberately conceived with the aim of attracting publicity. All her records which followed, even expunged of the Gainsbourg signature, would be suspiciously viewed as having crass commercial motivations.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Sullied by her association with Gainsbourg, her songs failed to chart for a long time afterwards. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Even some of her children’s songs recorded in 1966, for example, ''Les Leçons particulières'' ("private lessons"), have not been spared pernicious assumptions. It was not helpful when [[Jean-Christophe Averty]] choreographed a troupe of men on all fours to illustrate her children's song ''J'ai retrouvé mon chien'' ("I’ve found my dog") on his television program ''Les Raisins verts'' ("Green grapes").<ref>Video: France Gall - J'ai Retrouvé Mon Chien 1966. http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x425tg_france-gall-j-ai-retrouve-mon-chien_music. Viewed 20 February 2012.</ref>

==Psychedelic era and transition to adulthood==
At the beginning of the year 1967, Gall sang a duet with [[Maurice Biraud]], ''La Petite'', which describes a young girl coveted by a friend of her father. The controversy over this performance overshadowed her release that year of Gainsbourg’s poetic ''Néfertiti''.

Her next single was recorded with the orchestration of English composer [[David Whitaker (composer)|David Whitaker]]. New authors Frank Thomas and [[Jean-Michel Rivat]] were brought on board. They wrote ''Bébé requin'' (Baby Shark), a song which met with some success for Gall.

This was followed by ''Teenie Weenie Boppie'', an anti-[[LSD]] song by Gainsbourg, which has been described as "a bizarre tune about a deadly LSD trip that somehow involves Mick Jagger."<ref name="mason">Mason, Stewart. France Gall biography, all Music Guide, http://www.allmusic.com/artist/france-gall-p212397/biography, accessed 20 February 2012.</ref> Gainsbourg then sang an anti-capital punishment song with Gall, ''Qui se souvient de [[Caryl Chessman]]?'' ("Anyone remember Caryl Chessman?"), about the [[death row]] prisoner.<ref>{{cite book

Stewart Mason wrote about this period: "The psychedelic era found Gall, under Gainsbourg's guidance, singing increasingly strange songs . . . set to some of Gainsbourg's most out-there arrangements."<ref name="mason" />

Her next record ''C'est toi que je veux'', again with Whitaker, also failed to make an impact.

With this string of recordings in the late 1960s, none of them an unmitigated success, and making the transition from teen-age to adult performer, Gall faced some challenges in this period through the early 1970s. Mason wrote:

<blockquote>No longer a teenager, but without a new persona to redefine herself with, (and without the help of Gainsbourg, whose time was taken by his own albums and those of his wife Jane Birkin), Gall floundered both commercially and artistically. A label change from Philips to BASF in 1972 didn't help matters . . . "<ref name="mason" /></blockquote>

==German career==
Although struggling in her home country, Gall regularly recorded in Germany from 1966 to 1972, in particular with the composer and orchestrator [[Werner Müller (musician)|Werner Müller]]. She had a successful German career with songs by [[Horst Buchholz]] and [[Giorgio Moroder]]: ''Love, l'amour und liebe'' (1967), ''Hippie, hippie'' (1968), ''Ich liebe dich, so wie du bist'' (I love you the way you are) (1969) and ''Mein Herz kann man nicht kaufen'' (My heart is not for sale) (1970). Some of her other German hits included: ''Haifischbaby (Bébé requin)'', ''Die schönste Musik, die es gibt'' (The most beautiful music there is/Music To Watch Girls By), '' Was will ein Boy'' (What does a boy want?) (1967), ''Ja, ich sing'' (Yes, I sing), ''A Banda (Zwei Apfelsinen im Haar)'' (Two oranges in my hair), '' Der Computer Nr. 3 '' (1968), ''Ein bisschen Goethe, ein bisschen Bonaparte'' (A little Goethe, a little Bonaparte), ''I like Mozart'' (1969), ''Dann schon eher der Piano player'' (Then rather the piano player) (1970), ''Komm mit mir nach Bahia, Miguel'' (Come with me to Bahia, Miguel) (1972).

==Post-Gainsbourg career==

===New label, new beginnings===
Gall had several other releases in France in 1968, none of which aroused any great interest. At the end of 1968, on reaching the age of 21, Gall separated from Denis Bourgeois and stretched her wings upon the expiration of her contract with [[Philips Records|Philips]].

She moved to a new [[record label]], "La Compagnie", born from the association of artists [[Hugues Aufray]], [[Nicole Croisille]] and [[Michel Colombier]]. At "La Compagnie", Gall made a number of recordings, but she never succeeded in finding a coherent style with [[Norbert Saada]] as [[Artistic Director]]. She went her own way in 1969 with two adaptations: one Italian and the other British: ''L'Orage / La Pioggia)'' ("The Storm") which she sang with [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] at the 1969 [[Festival della canzone italiana|San Remo Music Festival]], and ''Les Années folles ("Gentlemen Please")'', created by [[Barbara Ruskin]]. Her songs ''Des gens bien élevés'', ''La Manille et la révolution'', '' Zozoï'' and '' Éléphants'' were largely ignored. Moreover, "La Compagnie" went bankrupt.

The early seventies continued to be a barren period for Gall. Although she was the first artist to be recorded in France for [[Atlantic Records]] in 1971, her singles ''C'est cela l'amour'' (1971) and ''Chasse neige'' (1971), faltered in the charts. In 1972, Gall, for the last time, recorded songs by Gainsbourg, ''Frankenstein'' and ''Les Petits ballons'', but these also failed to chart. The results of her collaboration with Jean-Michel Rivat as artistic director, ''La Quatrieme chose'' (1972, suspiciously similar to Bread's "Everything I Own") and ''Par plaisir'' or ''Plus haut que moi'' (1973) did not meet with commercial success.
While officially done with Gainsbourg, an old flame and producer from her Gainsbourg days invited France Gall on television to sing a medley of old songs from their time together, which included "Poupee de cire, Poupee de son".
From the 1970s onwards, Gall started regularly visiting Senegal, which she loved. She bought her hideaway there on the island of [[Gorée|N'Gor]], close to [[Dakar]] in 1990.

==Michel Berger==
France Gall was seduced by [[Michel Berger]]’s music when she heard his song '' Attends-moi'' ("Wait for Me") one day in 1973. During a later radio broadcast, she asked him for his opinion on songs which her then producer wanted her to record. Although he was disconcerted by the quality of the songs, there would be no question of collaboration.

Only six months later, in 1974, after she sang vocals on the song ''Mon fils rira du rock'n'roll'' on Berger's new album, Gall's publisher asked him, at her behest, to write for her. Gall had already made her mind up that ''"It will be him or else it will be nobody"'' (documentary [[France 3]] ''France Gall by France Gall''). Thus, in 1974, ''La Déclaration d'amour'' was to be the first in a long line of hits which marked a turning point in Gall’s career.

Meanwhile, the two artists, whose affinities became more than musical, married on 22 June 1976. France Gall shared years of work and family life with Michel Berger. The couple had two children.

==Musicals==
In 1978, pushed by Berger, she once again trod the boards of the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] where she had auditioned 15 years earlier, starring in a show entitled ''Made in France''. The most novel aspect of this show was that, except for the Brazilian [[transvestism|drag]] act [[Les Étoiles]], the members of the orchestra, choir and the dance troupe were exclusively female.<ref>{{cite video

 | date= 9 April 1978 }}</ref> In this show, France sang ''Maria vai com as outras'' the original, Brazilian (Portuguese) version of ''Plus haut que moi''.

In 1979, Gall took part in a new show which remains memorable for many. Composed by Michel Berger and written by the Québécois author [[Luc Plamondon]], the rock opera ''[[Starmania (musical)|Starmania]]'' enjoyed a success not usual for musicals in France. The show played for one month at [[Palais des congrès de Paris]].

In 1982, Gall rehearsed in the ''Palais des Sports'' of Paris to present ''Tout pour la musique'', an innovative spectacle marked by its use of electronic music. The songs ''Résiste'' and ''Il jouait du piano debout'' ("He played the piano standing") quickly became French pop standards.

==1980s and humanitarian projects==
In 1985, France Gall joined [[Chanteurs Sans Frontières]], on the initiative of [[Valerie Lagrange]]. She also worked for ''S.O.S Ethiopie'' for the benefit of Ethiopia under the aegis of [[Renaud]].

At the same time, she gave a successful series of concerts lasting three weeks at the new venue [[The Zenith|Zénith]] in Paris, where she performed new songs like '' Débranche'' ("Loosen-up"), ''Hong-Kong Star'', and gave solid acoustic performances of ''Plus haut'', ''Diego libre dans sa tête'' and ''Cézanne peint''.

In 1985 and 1986, Gall worked with Berger, [[Richard Berry (actor)|Richard Berry]], [[Daniel Balavoine]] and [[Lionel Rotcage]] for the benefit of ''Action Écoles'', an organization of schoolboy volunteers which collects essential food products in France for African countries where famine and drought prevail. On 14 January 1986, during a trip to Africa, Balavoine tragically perished in a helicopter crash. In 1987, the song ''Évidemment'', written by Berger and sung by Gall, was a moving homage to their lost friend. The song appeared on the album ''Babacar''.

Gall topped the pop charts in many countries in 1987 and 1988 with another song from the ''Babacar'' album, ''[[Ella, elle l'a]]'' ("Ella?s got it"), a Berger tribute to [[Ella Fitzgerald]].

Following the release of ''Babacar'', Gall launched a new show produced by Berger. Opening at [[the Zenith|Le Zénith]], the successful production toured throughout Europe, and gave rise to the live album ''Le Tour de France '88''.

==The 1990s and later==
Gall took a break from singing in the early 1990s and did not record any more for several years to come. She did, however, make an album called ''Double Jeu'' with Berger.

Following the release of ''Double Jeu'', Gall and Berger announced a series of concerts in various Parisian venues, such as [[La Cigale]] and [[Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy|Bercy]]. This project was nearly cancelled by Berger's death from a heart attack on 2 August 1992.

Although Gall was strongly affected by Berger's death, she wanted to complete the project they had planned. However, she decided to commit to the performances at the [[Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy|Bercy]] and promoted the songs that she and Berger created together. However, Gall was diagnosed with breast cancer in April 1993, which was successfully treated. She finally performed at the [[Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy|Bercy]] in September. All the songs she performed were written by [[Michel Berger]] from ''Double Jeu'', and from their discographies.

A year later, she went back on stage and performed in a new show in the [[Pleyel]] in Paris featuring new musicians. The repertoire featured songs written exclusively by Berger though Gall included her own versions of songs originally performed by others.

In 1996, Gall asked [[Jean-Luc Godard]] to produce the video clip of her song "''Plus haut''", taken from her album ''France''. Godard initially refused Gall's offer but later agreed, and directed a dreamy, picturesque video entitled "''Plus Oh!''" near his residence in [[Rolle]] (Switzerland). It was given its first and only airing on 20 April 1996 on the French television channel [[Métropole 6|M6]]. It was only shown once, due to copyright issues.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

After a year in Los Angeles, she released her eighth studio album, ''France'' in 1996. The album featured Gall's own interpretations of some of Michel Berger's songs. In 1996, Gall finally decided to appear as a headline artist at the legendary venue for French artists, the [[Paris Olympia]]. In 1997, she announced her retirement and recorded an unplugged show for French television showcasing songs from her final album.

In December 1997, Pauline, Gall's elder daughter with Michel Berger, died of complications of [[cystic fibrosis]]. Her illness was never made public. Her son [[Raphaël Hamburger|Raphael]] is a music supervisor.

Since the death of her daughter Gall has made only occasional public appearances. As a farewell to her career, a documentary movie was shot in 2001, ''France Gall par France Gall'', directed by Eric Guéret. Nine million people tuned in to watch the documentary when it aired on French television that year. She also staged and appeared in the 2007 France 2 documentary "Tous pour la musique" marking the fifteenth anniversary of Michel Berger's death.

Today she is a patron for French charity [[Coeurs de Femmes]] – a group helping homeless women.

Layfield's main [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] as JBL — a wealthy, big-mouthed, fiery-tempered businessman — was based on Layfield's real-life accomplishments as a stock market investor.

==Football==
Prior to his professional wrestling career, Layfield was a collegiate [[American football]] coach for [[Trinity Valley Community College]] and player for [[Abilene Christian University]].<ref>[http://www.acu.edu/alumni/generalinfo/alumnotes/archive_2005/2005_july.html July 2005 - Abilene Christian University]</ref> At Abilene, Layfield was a two-year starter on the [[offensive line]] and was named first-team All-[[Lone Star Conference]] as a junior and senior.

Layfield did play in the [[World League of American Football]], starting all ten games of the 1991 season at right tackle for the [[San Antonio Riders]], wearing jersey number 61.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Global Wrestling Federation  (1989–1994)===
Layfield was trained initially by [[Brad Rheingans]] and first started wrestling in the [[Global Wrestling Federation]] (GWF) in [[Texas]]. His first gimmick was as John Hawk, storyline cousin of the Windham brothers. He formed the tag team "Texas Mustangs" with [[Bobby Duncum, Jr.]]; they quickly won the GWF  Tag Team Championship from Rough Riders ([[Rick Harris|Black Bart]] and Johnny Mantell) on November 27<ref name="gwftag"/> but [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Drop|dropped]] the titles to [[Bad Breed]] ([[Ian Rotten|Ian]] and [[Axl Rotten]]) on January 29, 1993. Later that year, Hawk won his second GWF Tag Team Championship with Black Bart on December 25 from Steve Dane and Chaz Taylor.<ref name="gwftag"/> They held the title for a long time before losing them to [[The Fabulous Freebirds]] ([[Jimmy Garvin]] and [[Terry Gordy]]) on June 3, 1994. Layfield also won the [[NWA North American Heavyweight Championship]] on January 14, 1995, defeating [[Kevin Von Erich]].<ref name="nanwa">{{cite web|url =http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/nanwa.html|title=NWA - North American Heavyweight Title History|work=Solie's Title Histories| accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref> Two months later, he lost the NWA North American Title to [[Greg Valentine|Greg "The Hammer" Valentine]].

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment===

====Debut and The New Blackjacks (1996–1998)====
{{Main|The Blackjacks#The New Blackjacks|l1=The New Blackjacks}}
After three and a half years touring the [[independent circuit]], Layfield signed a contract with the [[WWE#World Wrestling Federation|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in late 1995 and debuted in January 1996 as Justin "Hawk" Bradshaw.<ref name="OWOW">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/j/john-bradshaw-layfield.html|title=John Bradshaw Layfield Profile|accessdate=2008-03-27|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> His initial gimmick was that of a tough cowboy/mountain man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlecrap.com/oldinductions.html|title=Previous Inductions - Been There, Crapped That|publisher=Wrestlecrap|accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref> After victories, he [[Livestock branding|branded]] his opponents with the symbol "JB" in ink, rather than being seared into the flesh. Managed by [[Dutch Mantel|Uncle Zebekiah]], the character fizzled out by the end of the year, perhaps remembered only for a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Savio Vega]] and a match with [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Fatu]] which he won in eight seconds.

Layfield paired up with his [[Kayfabe|storyline]] cousin [[Barry Windham]] to form [[The Blackjacks#The New Blackjacks|The New Blackjacks]], complete with the traditional "Blackjack" handlebar mustaches and short, jet black hair.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/blackjacks-new.html|title=The New Blackjacks Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref>

Windham's injuries piled up throughout 1997, so the team disbanded, and Layfield wrestled only occasionally on TV as "Blackjack Bradshaw", sometimes teaming with fellow Texan [[Terry Funk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/loaded.html#98|title=Fully Loaded 1998 results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref> He earned a shot at the NWA North American Heavyweight Championship against [[Jeff Jarrett]] at [[No Way Out of Texas: In Your House]] and won by [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]], but Jarrett retained the title because a title cannot change hands by a disqualification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/1998/results/|title=No Way Out 1998 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref> In 1998, he wrestled as a [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Mid-carder|mid-carder]] wrestling the likes of [[Marc Mero]] at [[WWF Mayhem in Manchester|Mayhem in Manchester]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/wwfuk.html#mayhem|title=Mayhem in Manchester results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref> [[Kai En Tai|Kaientai]] ([[Shoichi Funaki|Funaki]], [[Dick Togo]], and [[Takeo Otsuka|Men's Teioh]]) with  [[Taka Michinoku]] in a [[handicap match]] at [[Over the Edge: In Your House|Over the Edge]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/miscppvs1990s.html#22|title=Over the Edge 1998 results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref> and [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] in a [[Falls Count Anywhere Match|Falls Count Anywhere match]] at [[Breakdown: In Your House|Breakdown]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/miscppvs1990s.html#24|title=Breakdown results|work=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref>

In late 1998, Bradshaw teamed alongside former [[Nation of Domination]] member [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]] to form the tag team Hell's Henchmen, managed by the [[Don Callis|Jackyl]]. After the Jackyl left the WWF, Faarooq and Bradshaw joined [[The Undertaker]]'s new [[Ministry of Darkness]] under the name The Acolytes.<ref name="apa">{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/a/apa.html |title=Acolytes Protection Agency (A.P.A.) Profile |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref> The Ministry went on to feud with the [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|Corporation]]. As part of the Ministry, Bradshaw feuded with [[Ken Shamrock]]. The two [[Professional wrestling stable|stables]] would soon unite as the [[Corporate Ministry]], but disbanded after [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] defeated the Undertaker at [[WWF Fully Loaded 1999|Fully Loaded]]. When the Undertaker went on hiatus in September, Bradshaw and Faarooq's dark gimmick faded.

On the May 31, 1999 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw is War]]'', the Acolytes (still with the Corporate Ministry) won their first [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] by defeating [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/304454132111123|title=Acolytes' first World Tag Team Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref> On the July 5 episode of ''Raw is War'', they dropped the titles to the [[Hardy Boyz]] ([[Matt Hardy|Matt]] and [[Jeff Hardy|Jeff]])<ref name="1999raw">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/|title=''RAW is WAR'' results, 1999|publisher =Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref> before defeating the Hardyz and their [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael "P.S."

The duo [[Turn (professional wrestling)|became]] [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorites]] and changed their gimmick to cigar-smoking, bar-brawlers-for-hire.<ref name="apa"/> In jeans and T-shirts, Faarooq and Bradshaw became the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA), with a motto of "because we need beer money." The duo was often seen in the backrooms of arenas with a poker table and later a framed doorway comically in the middle of the often large, open aired hallways; they insisted that anyone entering the space use the door. Occasionally, if the "room" was destroyed in one arena, it was set up exactly as it was destroyed at the next arena, pushing continuity through time and space for comic effect.

The Acolytes earned a shot at the WWF Tag Title at the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]] against the [[New Age Outlaws]] ([[Brian Gerard James|Road Dogg]] [[Edge and Christian|and]] [[Monty Sopp|Billy Gunn]]), but lost the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/198811411/results/|title=Royal Rumble 2000 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref> Their next shot at the title was at [[WWF Fully Loaded#2000|Fully Loaded]] when they faced [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]].

====Singles competition (2002–2003)====
[[Image:Bradshaw.jpg|left|thumb|Layfield at a 2002 [[house show]] during his time as Bradshaw.]]
Shortly after WrestleMania, Faarooq and Bradshaw split due to the [[2002 WWE Brand Extension|WWE Draft]]. Layfield was drafted to Raw where his Bradshaw gimmick had an increased emphasis on his Texas roots, which included him carrying a [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] to the ring and teaming up with fellow Texan [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. Bradshaw helped Austin in the latter's feud against the [[The New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]], teaming up with him against them and losing to [[Scott Hall]] at [[Backlash (2002)|Backlash]]. Following Austin's walkout on the WWE,  Bradshaw joined the [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore division]] and won the [[WWE Hardcore Championship]] seventeen times, with his first title win coming over [[Stevie Richards|Steven Richards]].<ref name="hardcore">{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/hard/|title=WWE Hardcore Championship official title history|publisher=WWE|accessdate= 2008-04-26}}</ref> He renamed the title the Texas Hardcore Championship. It was also during this time that his finishing move was briefly renamed from the "Clothesline From Hell" to the "Clothesline From Texas" or the "Clothesline From Deep in the Heart of Texas". [[Jim Ross]] often called the move as such during his commentary, although the name eventually reverted to the original "Clothesline From Hell".

In the hardcore division, Bradshaw feuded and exchanged the title with the likes of Richards, [[Shawn Stasiak]], [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]], [[Christopher Nowinski]], [[Big Show (wrestler)|Big Show]], [[Peter Polaco|Justin Credible]], [[John Hugger|Johnny Stamboli]], [[Crash Holly]], Jeff Hardy, and [[Tommy Dreamer]],<ref name="hardcore"/> before the title was unified by [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWE Intercontinental Champion]] [[Rob Van Dam]] in August 2002. In September 2002, Layfield suffered a torn left [[biceps brachii muscle|biceps]] at a [[house show]]. He was out of action for six months until returning to [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] and then a few weeks later to the active WWE roster.

====APA reunion (2003–2004)====
Bradshaw returned on an episode of ''SmackDown!'' in 2003, which saw him and his old friend Faarooq saving the Undertaker from the hands of [[Chuck Palumbo]] and Johnny Stamboli. Layfield returned with a new look by cutting his long hair, returning it to its natural color, and going clean shaven. His new look would only be referenced once when, in a scripted segment, Faarooq asked him directly about it. Bradshaw insisted that he had already told the story to Faarooq, who rejected this claim. The duo would return to perform their regular segments, as they did before the brand extension, such as playing poker, drinking beer, and bribing superstars of their money. Unlike before, they would not attack or protect other superstars at the employment of other superstars as none would hire them. At [[Vengeance (2003)|Vengeance]], Bradshaw won a bar room brawl match which featured Faarooq and a variety of mid-card superstars and other WWE employees.<ref>[http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/vengeance03.html Online World of Wrestling]</ref><!--I changed the link because Bradshaw was announced as the winner even though WWE.com lists them both--> The duo wrestled tag teams such as the [[Basham Brothers]] ([[Doug Basham|Doug]] and [[Daniel Hollie|Danny]]) at [[No Mercy (2003)|No Mercy]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nomercy/history/2003/results/ |title=No Mercy 2003 official results |publisher= WWE |accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> and [[The World's Greatest Tag Team]] ([[Charlie Haas]] and [[Shelton Benjamin]]) at [[No Way Out (2004)|No Way Out]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2004/results/ |title=No Way Out 2004 official results |publisher=WWE |accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> At [[WrestleMania XX]] in 2004, they unsuccessfully challenged for the [[WWE Tag Team Championship]] in a [[Triple Threat match|fatal four-way]] [[professional wrestling tag team match types|tag team match]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm20/results/ |title=WrestleMania XX official results |publisher=WWE |accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> The gimmick continued on-and-off until the March 18 episode of ''SmackDown!'' until losing a tag team [[Kayfabe#"You're fired!" and "I quit!"|"You're Fired" match]] to Tag Team Champions [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] and [[Scott Garland (wrestler)|Scotty 2 Hotty]] for the tag team title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/040318.html|title=SmackDown! results - March 18, 2004|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref>  [[Professional wrestling authority figures#SmackDown brand authorities|General Manager]] [[Paul Heyman]], frustrated by an insult by the APA, told Faarooq that if he did not win the aforementioned match, then "You're Fired". After the match, Bradshaw led Faarooq back to Heyman's office to state they had not been fired, but had resigned. Then Heyman cleared up the misunderstanding and pointed out that he said that if they did not win the titles, then he told Faarooq "You're fired." His reason for saying this directly to Faarooq was because it applied only to Faarooq because "WWE Management" still saw a lot of potential in Bradshaw. He left them after telling Bradshaw to think about his own future. Faarooq shouted after Heyman that he was not fired because they (Faarooq and Bradshaw) had quit. Bradshaw, however, hesitated. Faarooq took Bradshaw's hesitation to mean that he would not resign, and so Faarooq promptly disbanded the APA and left. In reality, the WWE had decided to stop using Ron Simmons as an on-air performer. He was initially fired, but he was later re-hired to work behind the scenes in the WWE under various roles.

====WWE Champion (2004–2005)====

[[Image:JBL as WWE Champion.jpg|250px|right|thumb|John "Bradshaw" Layfield, during his reign as [[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]].]]
After the on air character of Faarooq disappeared from WWE TV, Bradshaw proceeded to take on a [[J. R. Ewing]] esque gimmick, becoming a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] persona complete with a suit, cowboy hat, and tie as he began his first main event [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Push|push]].<ref name=energy/> He began referring to himself as John "Bradshaw" Layfield, or JBL. His finishing move's name was part of the overhaul, becoming the ''Clothesline From Wall Street'' until he later changed it back to its original name.<ref name=ClotheslineFromWallStreet>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/The_Specialists_34/article_29029.shtml|title=Under the Microscope - 1/5 WWE Raw: HBK's "history," Axiomatic Jericho, Substantial Penalty for Early Withdrawal|last=Stevens|first=Lee|date=2009-01-06|accessdate=2010-09-08|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref> His first [[Promos (professional wrestling)|promo]] was on the border between Texas and [[Mexico]], where he hunted for incoming [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] in order to win a "Great American Award", which granted the winner number one contendership to the [[WWE Championship]]. He won, thanks to the then-SmackDown! [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] general manager [[Kurt Angle]], and immediately challenged [[Eddie Guerrero]] for the title. The storyline leading up to the match was that JBL caused Guerrero's mother to have a heart attack at a house show when he threatened her and grabbed her by the shoulder. At [[Judgment Day (2004)|Judgment Day]], JBL defeated Guerrero via disqualification in a match for Eddie's WWE title. A title cannot change hands by DQ, so Guerrero retained the title.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/judgmentday2004/mainevent/|title=Eddie Guerrero vs. JBL for the WWE Championship| publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> JBL controversially won the WWE Championship from Guerrero in a [[Strap match|Texas Bull Rope match]] at [[The Great American Bash (2004)|The Great American Bash]].<ref name="GAB - JBL vs Guerrero">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/thegreatamericanbash/history/2004/mainevent/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071213162746/http://www.wwe.com/shows/thegreatamericanbash/history/2004/mainevent/|archivedate=2007-12-13|title=JBL vs. Eddie Guerrero in a Texas Bullrope Match for the WWE Championship| publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> The initial decision of Guerrero's victory was reversed by then-General Manager [[Kurt Angle]], awarding the match and the title to JBL; the replay showed that JBL touched the fourth corner before Guerrero.<ref name="GAB - JBL vs Guerrero"/><ref name="jbl1wwe">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/3044541401121|title=JBL's first WWE Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> JBL won a rematch in a [[steel cage]] two weeks later, again with Angle's assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/040715.html|title=SmackDown! results - July 15, 2004|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref>

After claiming he would not be defending the title at [[SummerSlam (2004)|SummerSlam]], the Undertaker challenged JBL for the title. Around this time, JBL hired [[Orlando Jordan]] to help him in title matches. At SummerSlam, JBL won the match by disqualification.<ref name="SummerSlam - JBL vs Taker">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/2004/mainevent/|title=JBL w/ Orlando Jordan vs. Undertaker for the WWE Championship|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> After the match, Undertaker [[chokeslam]]med JBL through the roof of his limo.<ref name="SummerSlam - JBL vs Taker"/> JBL wore a [[Halo (medicine)|halo]] complete with his cowboy hat on top for the next few weeks to [[Sell (professional wrestling)|sell]] his "injuries".

[[Image:Thecabinet.jpg|left|thumb|The Cabinet: "Chief of Staff" Orlando Jordan and Layfield, the WWE Champion.]]
During JBL's time as WWE Champion, he employed a "staff" to work for him. The [[Professional wrestling stable|stable]] was named The Cabinet.<ref name="cabinet">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/c/cabinit.html|title=Cabinet Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref> At its peak, the stable contained Orlando Jordan, who was JBL's "Chief-of-Staff" and [[Doug Basham|Doug]] [[Basham Brothers|and]] [[Daniel Hollie|Danny Basham]], who were his "Co-Secretaries of Defense" until "quitting" the Cabinet on the June 16, 2005 episode of ''SmackDown!''.<ref name="cabinet"/> [[Amy Weber]] was also a member, being JBL's image consultant, but later left WWE. WWE explained Weber's absence by saying that JBL "fired" her after an episode of ''SmackDown!'' taped in [[Japan]]. That episode saw Weber accidentally shoot JBL with a tranquilizer gun. Jordan is the only member not announced to have left the group, though mention of the term cabinet went on hiatus after SummerSlam and Orlando was released from WWE in May 2006.<ref name="cabinet"/>

JBL's luck continued in early 2005; at the [[Royal Rumble (2005)|Royal Rumble]], he snuck past both Big Show and Kurt Angle in a [[Triple Threat match]] when he pinned Angle after the Clothesline From Hell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/198811/results/|title=Royal Rumble 2005 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref> He once again emerged with his title intact from WWE's first-ever [[Barbed wire match#Barbed Wire Steel Cage Match|Barbed Wire Steel Cage match]] at [[No Way Out (2005)|No Way Out]] against Big Show.

Cena failed to convince Layfield to do so.

JBL lost the WWE Title to John Cena at [[WrestleMania 21]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm21/mainevent/|title=John Cena vs. John Bradshaw Layfield - WWE Championship| publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref> pinning JBL to become the new WWE Champion.  Layfield's unbroken nine-month reign was billed as the longest in a decade, lasting 280 days. On the April 28 episode of ''SmackDown!'', JBL defeated Big Show, Booker T, and Kurt Angle in a four-way elimination match to earn a rematch for the WWE title,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/04282005/|title=Second Chance|publisher= WWE|date=2005-04-28|accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref> but lost to Cena at [[Judgment Day (2005)|Judgment Day]] in an [["I Quit" match]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/judgmentday2005/mainevent/|title=John Cena vs. JBL in an I Quit Match for the WWE Championship|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref>

====Various feuds and United States Champion (2005–2006)====
On June 12, Layfield appeared at the WWE-promoted [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]] pay-per-view as an anti-ECW "crusader." In the course of the night he attacked [[Brian Heffron|The Blue Meanie]] in a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]]. WWE capitalized on the situation by resigning Meanie to a short-term contract. On the July 7 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Meanie was reunited with his old [[Blue World Order]] associates [[Mike Bucci|Nova]] and Stevie Richards and he defeated Layfield with the help of the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Dave Batista|Batista]], who was drafted to ''SmackDown!'' a few weeks after Cena was drafted to ''Raw''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/07072005/|title=Showdown Looming|publisher=WWE|date=2005-07-07|accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref>

[[File:John Layfield Iraq 1.jpg|thumb|right|Layfield in Tribute to Troops.]]
Layfield and Batista then met in a match at [[The Great American Bash (2005)|The Great American Bash]] for the World Heavyweight Championship.

JBL, while still United States Champion, challenged for the World Heavyweight Championship. JBL tried to weaken then champion Rey Mysterio in the weeks leading up to his title match as Mysterio faced off against any opponent of JBL's choosing. Mysterio was defeated by [[Mark Henry]] and squashed by [[The Great Khali]] in non title singles matches before facing Raw's [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] in a match, that went to a no-contest. This was leading to their title match at [[Judgment Day (2006)|Judgment Day]], which Mysterio won and retained the title by pinning JBL after a [[frog splash]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/2006/matches/23848441/results/|title=Rey Mysterio's dream ride somehow continues|date=2006-05-21|author=Ed Williams III|accessdate=2008-01-05| publisher=WWE}}</ref> On the May 26 episode of ''SmackDown!'', JBL lost the US Title to Bobby Lashley.<ref name="SD - JBL vs Lashley, JBL vs Mysterio">{{cite web|first=Louie|last=Dee|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/05262006/|title=Kiss Him Goodbye|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-29|date=2006-05-26}}</ref> He also lost another attempt at the World Title against Mysterio, stating beforehand that he would quit SmackDown! if he lost that match. When he did lose, the crowd at the arena began to sing [[Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye|"Na Na, Hey Hey, Goodbye"]].<ref name="SD - JBL vs Lashley, JBL vs Mysterio"/> JBL later stated that he did not have a formal contract with Teddy Long going into the match and that he did not intend to leave SmackDown!. This [[Angle (professional wrestling)|angle]] was used to give JBL time off wrestling due to his serious back injury.

====Semi retirement and commentator (2006–2007)====
At [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|One Night Stand]], Layfield announced that he would take [[Tazz]]'s place as the new color commentator for ''SmackDown!''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/ecwonenightstand06.html| title=ECW One Night Stand 2006 Results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2006-06-11}}</ref> He made his debut as a heelish color commentator on the June 16 episode of ''SmackDown!''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/06162006/|title=Royal Beating|date=2006-06-16|author= Ed Williams III|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2006-06-16}}</ref> Layfield noted in a commentary on TheStreet.com that he was retiring from in-ring competition for good. In his final column on the website, JBL wrote, "I have also come to believe that you can't fight father time. A broken back suffered in a match in [[England]], compounded by a herniated and bulged disc, finally made me realize my career as a professional wrestler was over. I since migrated to the color commentary position much in the way that [[Jesse Ventura]] did before me."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/_tscs/newsanalysis/investing/10307125_2.html|title=JBL: Three for the Road|publisher= TheStreet.com|accessdate=2006-12-10}}</ref>

JBL returned to the ring on November 13, 2006, in the main event of a WWE house show in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]]. JBL teamed with [[Mr. Kennedy]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|King Booker]] against the [[Brothers of Destruction]] ([[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] and [[The Undertaker]]), and Batista.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/06.htm|title=WWE Show Results 2006|publisher=Angelfire| accessdate=2008-04-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080306115409/http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/06.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-03-06}}</ref> On the December 22 episode of ''SmackDown!'', JBL cut a promo berating Theodore Long and cursing out the fans for cheering during the Inferno match at [[Armageddon (2006)|Armageddon]] five days earlier ("Rome didn't fall because of the gladiators in the ring. Rome fell because of the spectators in the stands.")<ref>{{cite web|first=Lennie|last=DiFino|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/12222006/|title=Bells will be ringing|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-29|date= 2006-12-22}}</ref>

On the October 12, 2007 episode of ''Smackdown!'', Layfield was announced as one of the options WWE fans would be able to vote for to be the special guest referee at [[Cyber Sunday (2007)|Cyber Sunday]] for the World Heavyweight Championship match between Batista and The Undertaker. He lost the vote to Stone Cold Steve Austin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/cybersunday/history/2007/matches/5267610/results/|title=Batista conquers his Phenom-enal demons|first=Mike|last=McAvennie|publisher=WWE| accessdate=2007-10-28|date=2007-10-28}}</ref> At Cyber Sunday, he issued a heated altercation towards those running alongside him, ultimately receiving a [[Stunner (professional wrestling)|Stone Cold Stunner]] from Austin. After this, he became physical as a color commentator, attacking both Batista and The Undertaker in the middle of a match as revenge after he was [[Spear (wrestling)|spear]]ed by Batista and later [[chokeslam]]med by The Undertaker after taunting them consecutively, in events leading up to the pay-per-view. He justified these actions by explaining, "I am retired, not dead" (and that he [Layfield] should be respected).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/11012007/articles/nyknockout|title=New York knockout| publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref>

====Intercontinental Champion and departure (2007–2009)====
JBL was present at the SmackDown announcer's table during the WWE Championship match between [[Randy Orton]] and [[Chris Jericho]], at [[Armageddon (2007)|Armageddon]]. During this match, Orton [[Professional wrestling throws#Irish whip|whipped]] a charging Jericho over the announcer table where JBL was situated, and in the heat of the match, Jericho "pushed" JBL out of the way. Minutes later, an infuriated Layfield applied his boot to the head of Jericho while he looked set to win the match. This interference led to a disqualification victory for Jericho meaning that Orton retained the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/armageddon/history/2007/matches/554660432/results/|title=Saved by a 'wrestling god'|first=Bryan|last=Robinson|accessdate= 2007-12-18|publisher=WWE}}</ref>

On the December 17, 2007 episode of ''Raw'', JBL announced that he would resume his role as an active wrestler, in response to a challenge made by Jericho.<ref>{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=Robinson|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/12172007/articles/wrestlinggodreturn|title=The return of a 'wrestling god'|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=WWE|date=2007-12-17}}</ref> On the December 21 episode of ''SmackDown!'', JBL gave his farewell address from SmackDown,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/12212007/articles/bluewithoutjbl|accessdate=2007-12-21|title=Blue without JBL|last=McAvennie|first=Mike| publisher=WWE|date=2007-12-21}}</ref> officially marking his return to Raw on December 31.

On February 18 on ''Raw'', JBL interfered in the scheduled steel cage match between [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]] and his storyline illegitimate son, Hornswoggle. After Vince whipped Hornswoggle with his belt, JBL attacked Finlay from behind and handcuffed him to the top rope. After Mr. McMahon left the ring, JBL proceeded to beat Hornswoggle by throwing him against the sides of the cage.<ref name="RAW - McMahon vs Hornswoggle">{{cite web|first=Greg|last=Adkins|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/02182008/|title=Outrage in a Cage|publisher =WWE|date=2008-02-18|accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref> JBL later revealed to McMahon that Hornswoggle was Finlay's storyline son, not McMahon's.<ref>{{cite web|first=Corey|last=Clayton|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/02252008/|title=The Truth about Hornswoggle, According to JBL|publisher=WWE|date=2008-02-25|accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref> On March 29, JBL inducted the Brisco Brothers into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/jackbrisco/bio/|title=WWE Hall of Fame profile of Jack Brisco|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/geraldbrisco/bio/|title=WWE Hall of Fame profile of Gerald Brisco|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref> On March 30, JBL defeated Finlay in a [[Hardcore wrestling|Belfast Brawl]] at [[WrestleMania XXIV]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Ben|last=Zoldan|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/2008/matches/6515958/results/|title=JBL picks up brutal win in Belfast Brawl|publisher=WWE|date=2008-03-30|accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref>

[[File:JBL in UK.jpg|thumb|left|JBL at ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' in November 2008.]]
JBL's first championship bid since returning to the ring came by challenging Randy Orton for the WWE Championship and participating in a Fatal Four-Way Elimination match at [[Backlash (2008)|Backlash]] that also included John Cena and Triple H. JBL was eliminated first in the match by tapping out to Cena's [[Professional wrestling holds#STF|STF]], thus renewing their feud from 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2008/04/28/5407546.html|title=HHH reigns again after Backlash|date=2008-04-28|last=Hillhouse|first=Dace|accessdate=2009-07-26|work=Slam!

He managed to defeat Cena in a New York City [[Professional wrestling match types#Parking Lot Brawl|Parking Lot Brawl]] at [[The Great American Bash (2008)|The Great American Bash]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2008/07/20/6215361.html|title=The Great American Soap Opera|date=2008-07-20|last=Hillhouse|first=Dave|accessdate=2009-07-26|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref>

JBL's next on-screen rivalry was with [[CM Punk]], the reigning [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]]. During the feud, JBL criticized Punk's straight-edge beliefs, calling his lifestyle "boring" and saying he could challenge Punk to a contest he could not win which was revealed to be an alcohol-drinking contest on ''Raw''. Punk, instead of drinking a shot, said that he followed his own rules, before throwing the drink in JBL's face. JBL finally got his match for Punk's championship at [[SummerSlam (2008)|SummerSlam]], which he would lose after Punk landed the [[Professional wrestling attacks#Go to Sleep|Go To Sleep]]. On September 7 at [[Unforgiven (2008)|Unforgiven]], JBL faced Batista, [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], Rey Mysterio and Chris Jericho (who replaced Punk in the match after he was attacked by Randy Orton.) in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Championship Scramble|Championship Scramble match]] for the World Heavyweight title. Jericho went on to win the match and the World Heavyweight Championship. On October 5 at [[No Mercy (2008)|No Mercy]], JBL was defeated by Batista in a Number One Contender for the World Heavyweight Championship match.

[[File:HBK & jbl.jpg|thumb|right|Shawn Michaels and JBL.]]
In November 2008, JBL had an on-screen short rivalry with [[Shawn Michaels]]. Michaels had lost his family's personal savings due to the [[Financial crisis|global financial crisis]] and would become Layfield's employee. After failing to secure JBL the World Heavyweight Championship against John Cena at the [[Royal Rumble (2009)|Royal Rumble]]. Michaels agreed to take part in an "All or Nothing" match at [[No Way Out (2009)|No Way Out]] on February 15, 2009, Shawn won the match, after his wife (who was watching in the audience) punched JBL in the face and Michaels planted the [[Superkick|Sweet Chin Music]]. This ended any employment links between the two with Michaels still receiving the full payment owed to him and end the feud.

On the March 9 episode of ''Raw'', JBL defeated CM Punk to win the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]], thus becoming the tenth [[Grand Slam Championship|Grand Slam Champion]] and twentieth [[Triple Crown Championship|Triple Crown Champion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/03092009/mainarticle/| accessdate=April 5, 2009|date=March 9, 2009|last=Sitterson|first=Aubrey|title=In your house|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> He held the title for one month, losing the Intercontinental championship at [[WrestleMania XXV]] against Rey Mysterio in 21 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2009/04/06/9019551.html|title=Wrestlemania 25: HBK-Undertaker steals the show|date=2009-04-06|last=Plummer|first=Dale|accessdate=2009-04-06|work=Slam!

===Return to WWE===

====Return and sporadic appearances (2011–2012)====
[[File:WWE Hall of Fame 2012 JBL.jpg|left|thumb|JBL at the WWE Hall of Fame 2012.]]
Layfield made his return to WWE on the March 7, 2011 episode of ''Raw'' as [[Michael Cole]]'s choice for special guest referee for his match against [[Jerry Lawler]] at [[WrestleMania XXVII]]. He cut a promo claiming he was starting his "journey back to the main event at ''WrestleMania''", before being interrupted by [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] just as he was about to sign the contract. After a brief argument between the two, Austin hit Layfield with the ''Stone Cold Stunner'' and signed the contract to be the special guest referee. On March 31, 2012 Layfield inducted his former tag team partner and real life best friend [[Ron Simmons]] into the [[WWE Hall of Fame|2012 WWE Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_59806.shtml|title=Complete WWE Hall of Fame ceremony recap|date=2012-03-31|last=Tucker|first=Benjamin|accessdate=2012-04-28|work=PW Torch}}</ref> On July 23 Layfield returned as a face with Simmons at ''[[WWF Raw Bowl|Raw 1000]]'' as the [[Acolytes Protection Agency|APA]], after being called for protection by [[Amy Dumas|Lita]].

====Return to commentating (2012–present)====

Starting at [[Night of Champions (2012)|Night of Champions]] Layfield returned as a face for the first time as his JBL persona, and sporadically filled in as color commentator, replacing [[Jerry Lawler]], who suffered a heart attack during the ''Raw'' episode preceding Night of Champions. Layfield later re-signed with the promotion and returned to the ''Smackdown'' broadcast team on a full-time basis, alongside [[Josh Mathews]] and eventually [[Michael Cole]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/73198/wwejbl-update.html?p=1|title=WWE-JBL UPDATE|date=2012-11-08|last=Scherer|first=Dave|accessdate=2012-11-11|work=PWInsider}}</ref>

On January 26, 2014 at the [[Royal Rumble (2014)|Royal Rumble]] PPV, Layfield wrestled in his first WWE match in nearly five years when he was a surprise entrant in the [[Royal Rumble match]]. Having been on commentary the whole broadcast, JBL left the commentator's table when his number (#24) came up. However, Layfield was quickly eliminated by [[Roman Reigns]], and resumed his role as commentator for the rest of the broadcast. In July, Layfield was retired as NXT General Manager.<ref>http://www.pwinsider.com/article/87272/ongoing-nxt-spoilers-from-full-sail.html?p=1</ref>

I'm supposed to incite the crowd. I've done it for decades. I really didn't think anything of [the Nazi salute] - I know how bad it is, I've lived [in Germany]. I've been to [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], seen those places where they exterminated millions of [[Jew]]s. I draw the line between me and my character.

'''Christian Kramp''' (8 July 1760 – 13 May 1826) was a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]], who worked primarily with [[factorial]]s.

Christian Kramp's father was his teacher at grammar school in [[Strasbourg]].<ref name="MacTutor">{{MacTutor Biography|id=Kramp}}</ref> Kramp studied [[medicine]] and graduated, however, his interests certainly ranged outside medicine for, in addition to a number of medical publications, he published a work on [[crystallography]] in 1793. In 1795, France annexed the [[Rhineland]] area in which medical Kramp was carrying out his work and after this he became a teacher at [[Cologne]] (this city was French from 1794 to 1815), teaching mathematics, chemistry, and physics. Kramp could read and write in German and French.<ref name="MacTutor"/>

Kramp was appointed professor of mathematics at Strasbourg, the town of his birth, in 1809. He was elected to the geometry section of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1817. As [[Friedrich Bessel|Bessel]], [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] did, Kramp worked on the generalised factorial function which applied to non-integers. His work on factorials is independent of that of [[James Stirling (mathematician)|James Stirling]] and [[Vandermonde]]. He was the first to use the notation ''n''! (''Elements d'arithmétique universelle'', 1808). In fact, the more general concept of factorial was found at the same time by [[Antoine Arbogast|Arbogast]].

{{Quotation|I have given it the name 'faculty'. Arbogast has substituted the name 'factorial' which is clearer and more French. In adopting his idea I congratulate myself on paying homage to the memory of my friend. ... I use the very simple notation n! to designate the product of numbers decreasing from n to unity, i.e. n(n - 1)(n - 2) ... 3 . 2 . 1. The constant use in combinatorial analysis, in most of my proofs, that I make of this idea, has made this notation necessary.|Christian Kramp|preface to ''Elements d'arithmétique universelle'', 1808}}

''Kramp's function'', a scaled complex error function, is today better known as the [[Faddeeva function]].

{{nihongo|'''Y?jir? Ishizaka'''|?? ???|Ishizaka Y?jir?|extra=January 25, 1900—October 7, 1986}} was an influential and popular novelist of post-[[World War II]] [[Japan]].

==Education, early career, family==
Born at [[Daikancho 82]], [[Hirosaki, Aomori|Hirosaki]], [[Aomori Prefecture]], Ishizaka went to Hirosaki Middle School in 1913 and then to [[Keio University]] in 1920. On graduating, he took a position at Hirosaki Women's High School. Later, he became a teacher at [[Akita Women's High School]]. From 1929 to 1938 he taught at Yokote Junior High School.

In 1939, he moved to [[Tokyo]], and in 1940, during [[World War II]], he was a news correspondent in the [[Philippines]].

One of his granddaughters was [[Tomi Pierce]] (1953-2010),<ref>[http://wiki.igda.org/Memorials/Tomi_Pierce] Memorial for Tomi Pierce</ref> a writer and later producer of video games including [[Prince of Persia]] and [[The Last Express]] (admired for its story-telling), with [[Jordan Mechner]];<ref>[http://jordanmechner.com/blog/2010/02/tp/] Jordan Mechner's obituary of Tomi Pierce</ref> she also worked with her husband Doug Carlston, founder of [[Brøderbund]]. Another granddaughter, Tomi's sister [[Naomi Pierce]], is a world authority on butterflies and a professor at Harvard.

==Ishizaka the writer==
His novel ''Blue Mountain Range'' (???? ''Aoi sanmyaku'') helped introduce the concept of the "New Japan" - a postwar culture that could look forward to a new future.

While widely popular in Japan, to the point that some of his stories were made into multiple movies, only a small portion of his writings have been translated and published in [[English language|English]].

[[File:Tuned mass damper.gif|200px|thumb|An animation showing the movement of a skyscraper versus the mass damper. Shown in green are the [[hydraulic cylinders]] used to damp the motion of the skyscraper.]]
A '''tuned mass damper''', also known as a '''harmonic absorber''', is a device mounted in structures to reduce the amplitude of mechanical [[vibration]]s. Their application can prevent discomfort, damage, or outright [[structural failure]]. They are frequently used in power transmission, automobiles, and buildings.

==Principle==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}
{{technical|date=October 2014}}

[[File:2dof sketch.svg|thumb|A schematic of a simple spring–mass–damper system used to demonstrate the tuned mass damper system.]]

Tuned mass dampers stabilize against violent motion caused by [[normal mode|harmonic vibration]]. A tuned damper reduces the vibration of a system with a comparatively lightweight component so that the worst-case vibrations are less intense. Roughly speaking, practical systems are tuned to either move the main mode away from a troubling excitation frequency, or to add damping to a resonance that is difficult or expensive to damp directly. An example of the latter is a crankshaft torsional damper. Mass dampers  are frequently implemented with a frictional or hydraulic component that turns mechanical kinetic energy into heat, like an automotive [[shock absorber]]. An electrical analogue is an [[LCR circuit]].

Given a motor with mass <math>m_1</math> attached via motor mounts to the ground, the motor vibrates as it operates and the soft motor mounts act as a parallel spring and damper, <math>k_1</math> and <math>c_1</math>. The force on the motor mounts is <math>F_0</math>.  In order to reduce the maximum force on the motor mounts as the motor operates over a range of speeds, a smaller mass, <math>m_2</math>, is connected to <math>m_1</math> by a spring and a damper, <math>k_2</math> and <math>c_2</math>.  <math>F_1</math> is the effective force on the motor due to its operation.

[[File:Tuned mass damper.png|thumb|left|Response of the system excited by one unit of force, with (red) and without (blue) the 10% tuned mass. The peak response is reduced from 9 units down to 5.5 units. While the maximum response force is reduced, there are some operating frequencies for which the response force is increased.]]

The graph shows the effect of a tuned mass damper on a simple spring–mass–damper system, excited by vibrations with an amplitude of one unit of force applied to the main mass, <math>m_1</math>. An important measure of performance is the ratio of the force on the motor mounts to the force vibrating the motor, <math>F_0/F_1</math>. This assumes that the system is linear, so if the force on the motor were to double, so would the force on the motor mounts. The blue line represents the baseline system, with a maximum response of 9 units of force at around 9 units of frequency. The red line shows the effect of adding a tuned mass of 10% of the baseline mass. It has a maximum response of 5.5, at a frequency of 7.  As a side effect, it also has a second normal mode and will vibrate somewhat more than the baseline system at frequencies below about 6 and above about 10. <!-- These really should have units. Does someone want to work the problem out?  -->

The heights of the two peaks can be adjusted by changing the stiffness of the spring in the tuned mass damper. Changing the damping also changes the height of the peaks, in a complex fashion. The split between the two peaks can be changed by altering the mass of the damper (<math>m_2</math>).

[[File:2dof plots.png|thumb|A [[Bode plot]] of displacements in the system with (red) and without (blue) the 10% tuned mass.]]
The [[Bode plot]] is more complex, showing the phase and magnitude of the motion of each mass, for the two cases, relative to F1.

In the plots at right, the black line shows the baseline response (<math>m_2 = 0</math>). Now considering <math>m_2 = m_1/10</math>, the blue line shows the motion of the damping mass and the red line shows the motion of the primary mass. The amplitude plot shows that at low frequencies, the damping mass resonates much more than the primary mass. The phase plot shows that at low frequencies, the two masses are in phase. As the frequency increases <math>m_2</math> moves out of phase with <math>m_1</math> until at around 9.5&nbsp;Hz it is 180° out of phase with <math>m_1</math>, maximizing the damping effect by maximizing the amplitude of <math>x_2-x_1</math>, this maximizes the energy dissipated into <math>c_2</math> and simultaneously pulls on the primary mass in the same direction as the motor mounts.

==Mass dampers in automobiles==
===Motorsport===
The tuned mass damper was introduced as part of the suspension system by Renault, on its 2005 F1 car (the [[Renault R25]]), at the [[2005 Brazilian Grand Prix]]. It was deemed to be legal at first, and it was in use up to the [[2006 German Grand Prix]].

At Hockenheim, the mass damper was deemed illegal by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]], because the mass was not rigidly attached to the chassis and, due to the influence it had on the pitch attitude of the car, which in turn significantly affected the gap under the car and hence the [[ground effect (cars)|ground effect]]s of the car, to be a movable aerodynamic device and hence as a consequence, to be illegally influencing the performance of the [[aerodynamics]].

The Stewards of the meeting deemed it legal, but the FIA appealed against that decision. Two weeks later, the FIA International Court of Appeal deemed the mass damper illegal.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Bishop | first = Matt | year = 2006 | title = The Long Interview: Flavio Briatore | journal = F1 Racing | volume =  | issue = October | pages = 66–76 | accessdate = 2006-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitpass.com/fes_php/pitpass_news_item.php?fes_art_id=28765 |title=FIA bans controversial damper system |publisher=Pitpass.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref>

===Production cars===
Tuned mass dampers are widely used in production cars, typically on the [[crankshaft]] pulley to control [[torsional vibration]] and, more rarely, the bending modes of the crankshaft. They are also used on the driveline for gearwhine, and elsewhere for other noises or vibrations on the exhaust, body, suspension or anywhere else. Almost all modern cars will have one mass damper, some may have 10 or more.

The usual design of damper on the crankshaft consists of a thin band of rubber between the hub of the pully and the outer rim. This design is often called a harmonic damper. An alternative design is the [[centrifugal pendulum absorber]] which is used to reduce the [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion engine's]] torsional vibrations on a few modern cars.

All four wheels of the [[Citroen 2cv]] incorporated a tuned mass damper (referred to as a "Batteur" in the original French) of very similar design to that used in the Renault F1 car, from the start of production in 1949 on all four wheels, before being removed from the rear and eventually the front wheels in the mid 1970s.

==Mass dampers in spacecraft==
One proposal to reduce vibration on NASA's [[Ares I|Ares]] solid fuel booster is to use 16  tuned mass dampers as part of a design strategy to reduce peak loads from 6g to 0.25 g, the TMDs being responsible for the reduction from 1 g to 0.25 g, the rest being done by conventional [[vibration isolation|vibration isolators]] between the upper stages and the booster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2008/12/ares-i-thrust-oscillation-meetings-encouraging-allowance-for-changes/ |title=Ares I Thrust Oscillation meetings conclude with encouraging data, changes |publisher=NASASpaceFlight.com |date=2008-12-09 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/news/080819-nasa-ares1-vibration-update.html |title=Shock Absorber Plan Set for NASA's New Rocket |publisher=SPACE.com |date=2008-08-19 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref>

==Dampers in power transmission lines==
[[File:Stockbridge dampers on an English 400 KV line arp.jpg|thumb|[[Stockbridge damper]]s on a 400 KV power line near [[Castle Combe]], [[England]]]] 
[[High tension line|High-tension lines]] often have small [[barbell]]-shaped [[Stockbridge damper]]s hanging from the [[Electric power transmission|wires]] to reduce the high-frequency, low-amplitude oscillation termed [[Conductor gallop#Flutter|flutter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=13772262 |title=On the hysteresis of wire cables in Stockbridge dampers |publisher=Cat.inist.fr |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/backpage.ns?id=mg19626273.000 |title=Cable clingers - 27 October 2007 |publisher=New Scientist |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref>

==Dampers in wind turbines==
A standard tuned mass damper for wind turbines consists of an auxiliary mass which is attached to the main structure by means of springs and dashpot elements. The natural frequency of the tuned mass damper is basically defined by its spring constant and the damping ratio determined by the dashpot. The tuned parameter of the tuned mass damper enables the auxiliary mass to oscillate with a phase shift with respect to the motion of the structure. In a typical configuration an auxiliary mass hung below the nacelle of a wind turbine supported by dampers or friction plates.

==Dampers in buildings and related structures==
[[File:Taipei 101 Tuned Mass Damper.png|thumb|Location of Taipei 101's largest tuned mass damper]]
[[File:Tuned mass damper - Taipei 101 - Wikimania 2007 0224.jpg|thumb|Tuned mass damper atop [[Taipei 101]].]]
Typically, the [[damping|dampers]] are huge concrete blocks or steel bodies mounted in [[skyscraper]]s or other structures, and moved in opposition to the [[resonance|resonance frequency]] oscillations of the structure by means of [[spring (device)|springs]], fluid or pendulums.

===Sources of vibration and resonance===
Unwanted vibration may be caused by environmental forces acting on a structure, such as wind or earthquake, or by a seemingly innocuous vibration source causing resonance that may be destructive, unpleasant or simply inconvenient.

====Earthquakes====
The [[seismic wave]]s caused by an [[earthquake]] will make buildings sway and [[oscillate]] in various ways depending on the frequency and direction of ground motion, and the height and construction of the building. Seismic activity can cause excessive oscillations of the building which may lead to [[structural failure]]. To enhance the building's [[seismic performance]], a proper building design is performed engaging various seismic [[vibration control]] technologies.
As mentioned above, damping devices had been used in the aeronautics and automobile industries long before they were standard in mitigating seismic damage to buildings. In fact, the first specialized damping devices for earthquakes were not developed until late in 1950.<ref name=Reitherman>{{cite book|last=Reitherman|first=Robert|title=Earthquakes and Engineers: An International History|year=2012|publisher=ASCE Press|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784410714|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&productid=154097877}}</ref>

====Mechanical human sources====
[[File:London Millennium Bridge - Damper beneath deck, north side - 240404.jpg|thumb|Dampers on the [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]] in London. The white disk is not part of the damper.]]
Masses of people walking up and down stairs at once, or great numbers of people stomping in unison, can cause serious problems in large structures like stadiums if those structures lack damping measures.

====Wind====
The force of wind against tall buildings can cause the top of skyscrapers to move more than a meter. This motion can be in the form of swaying or twisting, and can cause the upper floors of such buildings to move. Certain angles of wind and [[aerodynamic]] properties of a building can accentuate the movement and cause [[motion sickness]] in people. A TMD is usually tuned to a certain building's frequency to work efficiently. However, during their lifetimes, high-rise and slender buildings may experience natural frequency changes under wind speed, ambient temperatures and relative humidity variations, among other factors, which requires a robust TMD design.<ref>{{cite journal|last=ALY|first=Aly Mousaad|title=Proposed robust tuned mass damper for response mitigation in buildings exposed to multidirectional wind|journal=The Structural Design of Tall and Special Buildings|year=2012|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tal.1068/abstract|doi=10.1002/tal.1068}}</ref>

[[File:Chicken soup.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Chicken soup]]]]
[[File:??????? Okroshka 05.jpg|thumb|260px|A bowl of [[Okroshka]] soup]]
This is a '''list of notable soups'''. [[Soup]]s have been made since [[Ancient history|ancient times]]. Around 1300, [[Huou]], chef at the court of [[Kublai Khan]], wrote a collection of recipes (mainly soups) and household advice entitled "The Important Things to Know About Eating and Drinking".<ref>[http://www.foodreference.com/html/html/food-timeline-1200-1399.html Food history timeline] at Food Reference Website</ref>

Some soups are served with large chunks of meat or vegetables left in the liquid, while a [[broth]] is a flavored liquid usually derived from boiling a type of meat with bone, or a vegetable for a period of time in a [[Stock (food)|stock]]. A common type of broth is [[consommé]], which are crystal clear broths or stock that have a full flavor, aroma, and body.

A [[potage]] is a category of thick soups, [[stew]]s, or [[porridge]]s, in some of which meat and vegetables are boiled together with water until they form into a thick mush.

[[Bisque (food)|Bisques]] are [[heavy cream]] soups traditionally prepared with [[shellfish]], but can be made with any type of [[seafood]]. Cream soups are a dairy based soup. Although they may be consumed on their own, or with a meal, the canned, condensed form of cream soup is sometimes used as a quick [[sauce]] in a variety of [[meat]] and [[pasta]] [[convenience food]] dishes, such as [[casserole]]s. Similar to a bisque, [[chowder]]s are thick soups usually containing some type of starch.

[[Coulis]] were originally meat juices, and now are thick [[purée]]s.

Some soups are served only cold, and other soups can optionally be served cold.

[[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] oxtail soup is made from a tomato base with oxtails, potatoes, green beans, corn, [[Mirepoix (cuisine)|mirepoix]], garlic, and herbs and spices. In [[Germany]], there are lots of varieties of oxtail soup (called ''Ochsenschwanzsuppe'' or ''Ochsenschleppsuppe'') usually containing oxtail, various root vegetables, herbs, and also Sherry or Madeira.

'''Dennis Miller''' (born November 3, 1953) is an American [[stand-up comedian]], [[talk show host]], [[political commentator]], [[sports commentator]], [[actor]], television personality,  and radio personality. He is known for his critical assessments laced with pop culture references. He rose to fame as a cast member of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1985, and subsequently hosted a string of his own [[talk show]]s on [[HBO]], [[CNBC]] and in syndication. He currently hosts a daily, three-hour, self-titled talk radio program, nationally syndicated by [[Dial Global]].

He is listed as 21st on [[Comedy Central]]'s 100 greatest stand up comedians of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.listology.com/list/comedy-central-100-greatest-standups-all-time|title=Comedy Central 100 Greatest Standups of all Time|publisher=Listology.com|accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref>

==Early life==
Miller was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and grew up in [[Castle Shannon, Pennsylvania|Castle Shannon]], a suburb of Pittsburgh, where he graduated from [[Keystone Oaks High School]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/weekend/people/people-wood020202.shtml |title=People: Peter Wood on Dennis Miller on NRO Weekend |publisher=Nationalreview.com |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> His parents separated and Miller was raised by his mother, Norma, a [[dietitian]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Myers |first=Chuck|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63732934.html |title=1ST PERSON: Meet Dennis Miller  |date=July 27, 2000 |accessdate=2011-05-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sports_headlines/20000730miller4.asp | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Dennis Miller: Monday Night Live | first1=Chuck | last1=Finder | date=July 30, 2000}}</ref> Miller is of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.<ref name="washington">{{cite video| people = Miller, Dennis| title = Live from Washington, D.C. – They Shoot HBO Specials, Don't They?| medium = TV| publisher = [[HBO]]|date = 1994-04-20}}</ref> His two earliest childhood comedy heroes were [[Jonathan Winters]] and [[Tim Conway]].<ref>{{cite interview |last= Miller |first= Dennis |interviewer= Dennis Miller |title= The Dennis Miller Show |last2= Conway |first2= Tim |url= http://www.dennismillerradio.com/blog?action=blogArchive&blogTag=Tim%20Conway |date= 2013-11-01 }}</ref>  During college, he was a member of [[Sigma Tau Gamma]] Fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baylorsigtau.com/page.php?page_id=4056 |title=Welcome to Sigma Tau Gamma, Gamma Omega Chapter |publisher=Baylorsigtau.com |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> About his social status during this period, Miller writes: "When I went to college, I lived on campus, and the guys I hung out with made me do some things I'm not proud of, although they made the characters in ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]'' look like the [[Rat Pack]] in 1962. I myself made that kid [[Curtis Armstrong|Booger]] look like [[Remington Steele]]" (''I Rant, Therefore I Am''). Miller graduated from [[Point Park University|Point Park College]] in 1976 with a degree in [[journalism]].<ref name="TVG bio">{{cite web|title=Dennis Miller Biography|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/dennis-miller/bio/147096|work=TV Guide|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sports_headlines/20000730miller4.asp |title=Dennis Miller: Monday Night Live |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=2000-07-30 |accessdate=2010-07-10 | first1=Chuck | last1=Finder}}</ref>

In 1979 Miller won $500 as a runner-up in ''Playboy''<nowiki/><nowiki>'s first annual humor competition with the following joke:</nowiki><ref>{{Cite news|date=June 1979|title=Funny Money|magazine=Playboy|volume=26|number=6|issn=0032-1478}}</ref>

{{quote|The only difference between group sex and group therapy is that in group therapy you hear about everyone's problems, and in group sex you see them.|Dennis Miller|Playboy, June 1979}}

==Television career==
In the early 1980s, Miller hosted ''Punch Line'', a Saturday afternoon [[newsmagazine]] for teenagers, on Pittsburgh's [[KDKA-TV]].<ref>{{cite web|author=The Comedy Zone Humor Network |url=http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/m/miller-dennis.htm |title=Dennis Miller : Comedian Profile |publisher=Comedy-zone.net |accessdate=2010-10-07}}{{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref> He also produced humorous essays for the syndicated ''[[Evening Magazine]]'' television program. Miller then began performing stand-up in [[New York City|New York]] comedy clubs such as [[Catch A Rising Star]] and The Comic Strip, as well as in Los Angeles at [[The Comedy Store]]. He appeared on ''[[Star Search]]'', where he lost out to fellow comedian [[Sinbad (actor)|Sinbad]] after the two tied with judges' scores, but Sinbad won with a higher studio-audience approval rating.

===''Saturday Night Live''===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SNLDennisMiller.gif|thumb|left|Miller on [[Weekend Update]]]] -->
Miller's big break came in 1985 when he was discovered by [[Lorne Michaels]] at [[The Comedy Store]]. He landed a spot on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where he succeeded [[Christopher Guest]] as the ''[[Weekend Update]]'' anchor. The spot was supposed to go to comic [[Jon Lovitz]], but Lovitz was scheduled for other parts on the show and needed the ''Update'' segment to do costume changes; so Miller was drafted to read the news.<ref name="penn">{{cite episode|title=Penn Jillette Radio Show. Special Guest: Dennis Miller |url=http://www.pennfans.net/view/Audio_Archive/PennRadio/Penn.Jillette.Radio.Show.2006.09.22/| series=[[Penn Radio]] |airdate=2006-09-22}}</ref> Miller began his fictional news reports with "Good evening, and what can I tell you?" and closed with "Guess what, folks?  That's the news, and I am outta here!" Fans of ''SNL'' became accustomed to his smirky delivery, high-pitched giggle, and frequently primped hair idiosyncrasies that would be spoofed by [[Dana Carvey]], [[Tom Hanks]], and [[Jimmy Fallon]], all of whom have impersonated Miller on the show. When Miller left ''SNL'' in 1991, the anchor's chair was turned over to [[Kevin Nealon]].

In 1988, Miller released a stand-up comedy CD, ''The Off-White Album'', derived from an [[HBO]] special titled ''Mr. Miller Goes to Washington'',<ref>{{IMDb title|0249466|Mr. Miller Goes to Washington Starring Dennis Miller (1988) }}</ref> which drew heavily from the [[Observational comedy|observational]] and [[metaphor]]-driven style he was known for on ''Saturday Night Live'', and showed glimpses of the political humor that would influence his later work. A well-received HBO special, ''Dennis Miller: Black and White'',<ref>{{IMDb title|0317340|Dennis Miller: Black and White (1990)}}</ref> aired shortly after the release of the CD.

Although Miller spent much of his time on ''SNL'' behind the ''Weekend Update'' desk, he was included in some sketches and did a few recurring characters and celebrity impersonations.<ref name="snl archives">[http://snl.jt.org/cast.php?i=DeMi Dennis Miller], SNL Archives</ref>

====Recurring characters====
* Koko, one of the pixies in the recurring sketch "Miss Connie's Fable Nook"
* Steve, one of The Stand-Ups (others include [[Jon Lovitz]] as Bob, [[Damon Wayans]] as Keith, and [[Tom Hanks]] as Paul)

====Celebrity impersonations====
* [[Gary Hart]]
* [[George Harrison]]
* [[Nathaniel Crosby]]

===''The Dennis Miller Show''===
In 1992, following his departure from ''Saturday Night Live'', Miller launched a late-night TV talk show, ''The Dennis Miller Show'', syndicated by [[Tribune Entertainment]]. ''The Dennis Miller Show'' continued in the tradition of "[[Alternative culture|alternative]]" talk shows, which started with the ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' show, which debuted on [[NBC]] in 1982.

''The Dennis Miller Show'' featured cutting-edge bands and other groundbreaking guests. For example, [[Toad the Wet Sprocket]] made their national television debut on the show, and [[Henry Rollins]] stopped by occasionally to chat with Miller and perform [[spoken word]].<ref>{{IMDb title|0131667}}</ref> Comedian [[Bill Hicks]] also performed on the show. [[Andy Summers]], formerly of the band [[The Police]], led the house band, and [[Nick Bakay]] was the announcer.

The show's staff boasted a standard mix of past and future performers, writers, and producers of note including Bakay, [[Mark Brazill]] (''[[That '70s Show]]''), Eddie Feldmann, [[David Kohan]] & [[Max Mutchnick]] (creators of ''[[Will & Grace]]''), [[Norm Macdonald]], [[Bob Odenkirk]] (''[[Mr. Show]]''), [[John Riggi]], [[Kevin Rooney]], [[Herb Sargent]] (''[[Saturday Night Live]]''), [[Drake Sather]], and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] (''[[Second City TV]]'').

The show was canceled after seven months, with the Tribune Entertainment CEO saying the show lacked "the ratings growth necessary to continue."<ref>{{cite news

===''Dennis Miller Live''===
Beginning in 1994, Miller hosted ''[[Dennis Miller Live]]'', a half-hour talk show on [[HBO]]. The show's theme song was the iconic [[Tears for Fears]] hit "[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]", and also utilized a snippet of the song "[[Civilized]]" by the [[Rollins Band]].
The show was taped at [[CBS Television City]] on the same stage that ''[[The Price Is Right]]'' is taped. It utilized a small set and sparse lighting, and there was no band. It comprised mainly Miller, speaking to the largely unseen studio audience, on a darkened stage.

Miller hosted one guest per show, with whom he would discuss the topic of the day. Early on, guests were all interviewed live via satellite, but soon most appeared live in the studio. There was also a call-in segment. The number was originally given as 1-800-LACTOSE. Later, he referred to it only by its numeric equivalent (1-800-522-8673). Within the time available, Miller typically could accommodate only two or three calls. He gradually eliminated call-ins entirely in the last few seasons of the show.

Miller and his writing staff won five [[Emmy Award]]s during the show's run, which aired 215 episodes over nine years. HBO cancelled the show in 2002.

===''Monday Night Football''===
In 2000, Miller beat out [[Rush Limbaugh]] and [[Tony Kornheiser]] (among others) for a job as [[color commentator]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Monday Night Football]]''.<ref name=eonline>{{cite web |last=Armstrong |first=Mark |url=http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,6673,00.html |title=Dennis Miller Takes 'Monday Night' Pigskin|publisher=[[E!]]|date=June 22, 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030221060805/http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,6673,00.html|archivedate=February 21, 2003}}</ref> His commentary was sprinkled with esoteric references.<ref name=annotatedmiller>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/abcsports/mnf/s/annotatedmiller/archive.html |title=Website (called "Dennis Miller Annotated" that lists and explains all of Miller's Monday Night quips |publisher=ESPN |date=2002-01-14 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> A common Miller-ism was after a [[Hail Mary pass]] fell incomplete, he would say "Hail Mary is denied – [[separation of church and state]]." He also once referred to the "[[Greatest Show on Turf]]" [[St. Louis Rams]] receiving corps as the "Murderer's Row of Haste".  After two seasons, Miller and former [[San Diego Chargers]]' quarterback [[Dan Fouts]] (who worked alongside play-by-play man [[Al Michaels]]) were replaced by the veteran football commentator [[John Madden]]. In 2010, [[TV Guide Network]] listed Miller's stint at #12 on their list of ''25 Biggest TV Blunders''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20100302tvguide01|title=Breaking News – TV Guide Network's "25 Biggest TV Blunders" Special Delivers 3.3 Million Viewers|date=2010-03-02|publisher=thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=2010-03-10}}</ref>

In 2003, Miller provided short-lived regular commentary for the [[Fox News]] show ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'' before moving on to do a prime-time political show on [[CNBC]] in early 2004 called, simply, ''Dennis Miller''. The hour-long show contained a daily news segment called "The Daily [[Rorschach inkblot test|Rorschach]]", which was reminiscent of his ''Weekend Update'' segments. He also had a chimpanzee, as a nod to the early days of the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show and their mascot [[J. Fred Muggs]]. The show also featured a panel discussion dubbed "The Varsity", which offered a wide variety of political viewpoints on current topics. Frequent "Varsity" panelists included [[Ed Schultz]], [[Gloria Allred]], [[Willie Lewis Brown, Jr.|Willie Brown]], [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]], [[Mickey Kaus]], [[Steve Katz (politician)|Steven Katz]], [[Lawrence O'Donnell]], [[Phil Hendrie]], and [[Harry Shearer]]. CNBC cancelled the show in May 2005 due to declining viewership.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/05/12/news/newsmakers/cnbc_miller/ | publisher=CNN | title=CNBC cancels 'Dennis Miller' | date=May 12, 2005 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>

===Guest appearances and commercials===
Miller has appeared as a guest or guest star on various shows, including ''[[Boston Public]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'', ''[[NewsRadio]]'', ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', ''[[Norm Macdonald|The Norm Show]]'', ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', ''[[SportsCenter]]'', "[[Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives]]" and late-night talk shows such as ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' and ''[[WWE Raw]]''.<ref>{{IMDb name|0588222}}</ref>

Miller hosted the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] in 1995 and 1996. He was also the host of HBO's 1996 series of election specials, ''Not Necessarily the Election''.

He has appeared in various television commercials, serving as a spokesman for [[M&M's]] candies, 10-10-220 long distance service, and the Internet service provider [[NetZero]]. About these activities he has remarked: "Everybody has to [[sell out]] at some point to make a living. I'm a family man. I sold out to make an M&M commercial. They offer incredible amounts of money, and I say, ‘What can I do to sell one more piece of candy for you? Do you want me to hug the M&M?’&nbsp;"<ref>[http://www.usaweekend.com/97_issues/970720/970720talk_dennis_miller.html ''USA WEEKEND'' magazine]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref>  Dennis also did a short B2B commercial for Blockbuster/IBM partnership company, New Leaf Entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retailgeek.com/retail/future-of-retail-as-seen-in-1992|title=Future of Retail (as seen in 1992)|publisher=retailgeek.com|accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref> On February 27, 2012, Miller guest starred on ''[[Hawaii 5-0]]'' in the episode "Lekio", along with guest star [[James Caan]].

===Return to Fox News Channel===
On September 21, 2006, Miller returned to [[Fox News| Fox News Channel]] with a two-and-a-half-minute commentary on [[illegal immigration]] during his "Real Free Speech" segment on ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,215178,00.html | publisher=Fox News Channel | title=Funnyman Dennis Miller Returns to FNC! | date=September 22, 2006}}</ref> He appeared on 13 of the 17 aired episodes of the comedy show ''[[The Half Hour News Hour]]''. Currently, he has a weekly segment called "Miller Time" on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''. Miller has also appeared on ''[[Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld]]'' under the pseudonym "Mansquito", a name Miller has pledged to use on future appearances on the network.

===Game shows===
Miller co-hosted the game show ''[[Grand Slam (US TV series)|Grand Slam]]'', which aired on [[GSN]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6449122.html |title=GSN Taps Dennis Miller To Host Grand Slam – 6/5/2007 12:56:00 AM – Broadcasting & Cable |publisher=Broadcastingcable.com |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref>

For one month, Miller hosted ''[[Amne$ia]]'' for [[NBC]]. The show was a replacement program commissioned during the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike]] and was canceled once the strike was resolved and scripted programming returned to the network.

===''Sports Unfiltered'' on Versus===
Miller's days as a sports commentator did not end when he left ''Monday Night Football.'' In 2007, Versus, now [[NBCSN]], tapped Miller to host ''Sports Unfiltered''.<ref>{{cite web|author=rickchand |url=http://deadspin.com/355359/whither-sports-unfiltered-with-dennis-miller |title=Whither Sports Unfiltered With Dennis Miller? |publisher=Deadspin.com |date=2008-02-12 |accessdate=2011-05-29}}</ref>

==Radio career==

===''The Dennis Miller Show''===
In January 2007, Miller signed a deal with [[Westwood One]] (later acquired by [[Dial Global]]) to launch a weekday three-hour [[talk radio]] program.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWEN204120070112 |title=Dennis Miller starting radio show on Westwood One |agency=Reuters |date= January 10, 2007|accessdate=2011-05-29}}</ref> The program debuted on March 26, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://affiliates.westwoodone.com/features/dennis-miller-show.asp |title=The Dennis Miller Show |publisher=Affiliates.westwoodone.com |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> The show's website<ref>{{cite web|author=Payam Zarrabizadeh |url=http://www.dennismillerradio.com/ |title=The Official Home of Dennis Miller on the Web |publisher=Dennismillerradio.com |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> provides a live stream of the broadcast. The site also makes archives of all shows available in [[MP3]] format. The live feed is free, but a subscription to the Dennis Miller Zone (DMZ) is required in order to access archived broadcasts. The show airs on 250+ stations, many of which (especially in the major markets) are owned by [[Salem Communications]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/3/20/121544.shtml?s=ic |title=Dennis Miller Readies to Host Radio Show |publisher=Newsmax.com |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> airing on tape delay on some of those stations between 6–9 pm ET and 9 pm-12 am ET. Salem stations also air a "best of" Miller show on Saturdays. His former on-air sidekick "Salman" ([[David S. Weiss]]) also wrote for ''Dennis Miller Live''. His producer Christian Bladt previously appeared on-camera as dozens of different characters during the "Daily Rorschach" segment on his CNBC television show.

Miller's program includes serious discussions about American culture, current events, politics, and their place in the global context. The show is infused with Miller's sarcasm, which is often characterized by obscure [[pop culture]] references.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millerjoke.com/ |title=Dennis Miller Joke Generator}}</ref> For example, each hour of the show once opened with an arcane reference. The first hour's opening phrase was a combination of dialogue from the film ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]'' and a U.S. space program slogan coined by [[Alan Shepard]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dennismillerradio.com/show?action=viewRadioShow&showID=70|title=Dennis Miller Radio: The Dennis Miller Show|accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref> "What's up, Hiroshi? Let's light this candle!" Miller's other opening phrases for his second and third hours respectively were "Come to me my babies, let me quell your pain", ([[Powers Boothe]] as [[Jim Jones]] in ''[[Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones]]''<ref>Dennis Miller Radio Show, Hour 2, December 18, 2007./</ref>) and "ABC – '''A'''lways '''b'''e '''c'''losing if you want the knife set" (from ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]'').

Most shows feature three guests (one per hour), mostly from the world of politics and entertainment, as well as calls from listeners. Guests include fellow comedians and ''SNL'' alumni (such as [[Dana Carvey]] and [[Jon Lovitz]]), pundits and authors such as [[Ann Coulter]], [[Aaron Klein]] and [[Mark Steyn]] (while the show's guest list leans [[right-wing|right of center]], there are several [[liberals]] who have appeared on the show, such as [[Dennis Kucinich]] and [[Alan Dershowitz]]), Presidential candidates, several sports commentators, and some "regulars", [[Howard Fineman]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'', singer [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]], [[Nikki Finke]], and Representative [[David Dreier]], a Republican congressman from California,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dennismillerradio.com/pg/jsp/general/friends.jsp|title=Dennis Miller Radio: Friends of the Show|work=The Dennis Miller Show|accessdate=14 March 2010}}</ref> among many others. Miller generally takes calls every hour, and in addition to comments about culture and politics, Miller encourages humorous callers and often comments on their comedic delivery. A segment on Fridays is set aside for "Dennis [[Deus Ex Machina|Ex Machina]]", his term for a segment without a guest, where he allows phone calls on any topic.

According to ''[[Talkers Magazine]]'', as of spring 2011, Miller's show has an estimated 2,250,000 weekly listeners.<ref>{{cite news | title= The Top Talk Radio Audiences | year=2011 | work= [[Talkers Magazine]]|url=http://www.talkers.com/top-talk-radio-audiences/ }}</ref>  Miller and [[Dial Global]] signed an agreement in early 2012 to continue his show for an undisclosed number of years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbr.com/dennis-miller-re-ups-with-dial-global/|title=Dennis Miller re-ups with Dial-Global|work=Radio & Television Business Report|accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref>

===Other endeavors===
Miller periodically performs stand-up at the Orleans Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. In recent appearances, he has done a mix of his old and new material, with some political jokes as well.

He has authored four books based on his stand-up comedy and television monologues: ''The Rants'' (1996), ''Ranting Again'' (1999), ''I Rant, Therefore I Am'' (2000), and ''The Rant Zone'' (2001).

Miller has appeared in several films, in both comedic and non-comedic roles. His movie credits include ''[[Madhouse (1990 film)|Madhouse]]'', ''[[Disclosure (film)|Disclosure]]'', ''[[The Net (1995 film)|The Net]]'', ''[[Never Talk to Strangers]]'', ''[[Bordello of Blood]]'', ''[[What Happens in Vegas]]'' and ''[[Murder at 1600]]''. He plays the [[Howard Stern]]-like talk-radio host Zander Kelly in ''[[Joe Dirt]]'' (2001) and appears as himself in ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]'' (2006).

Miller guest hosted the [[Slammy Award]]s episode of [[WWE Raw]] on December 14, 2009.

==Comedic style==
Miller is known for his laid-back style (for example, calling people "babe" or referring to them as "cats") and acerbic, brooding sense of humor. His specialty is the rant—a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] [[monologue]] in which he rails against whatever happens to be bothering him at the moment. Such rants typically begin with "Now, I don't want to get off on a rant here, but..." and end with "...of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong."

Miller's monologues and standup routines often feature elaborate [[simile]]s and [[metaphor]]s involving [[allusion]]s to obscure people, places, and things. On his passion for language, he has remarked: "I've always loved the flirtatious tango of [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s, the sturdy dependability of [[noun]]s and capricious whimsy of [[verb]]s, the strutting pageantry of the [[adjective]] and the flitting evanescence of the [[adverb]], all kept safe and orderly by those reliable little policemen, [[punctuation mark]]s. Wow! Think I got my ass kicked in high school?"<ref>''The Rant Zone'', pp. 81–2) [http://www.nationalreview.com/weekend/people/people-wood020202.shtml Miller Times]</ref>

==Personal life==
Miller married Carolyn "Ali" Espley,<ref>Reliable sources spell her name variously as "Espley" or "Epsley." In the closing credits of ''Mr. Miller Goes to Washington'', she is listed as "Ali Espley".</ref> a former [[model (person)|model]] from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], on April 10, 1988. Espley is best known as the girl in [[Kajagoogoo]]'s "[[Too Shy]]" music video. The couple live in [[Santa Barbara, California]], with their two sons, Holden (born 1990) and Marlon (born 1993). His younger brother Jimmy Miller has been a manager for comedians such as [[Jim Carrey]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Judd Apatow]], and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].

==Political views==
Although in his early years of fame he was perceived to be a staunch [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and an outspoken critic of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], in recent years, Miller has become known for his [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political opinions. He is a regular political commentator on [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' in a segment called "Miller Time", and previously appeared on the network's ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'' in a segment called "Real Free Speech." During the [[2012 United States Presidential Election|Presidential election of 2012]], Miller appeared on [[Fox News Channel]] and said that under [[Barack Obama]], the US is on the road to the "[[Europe]]an model."

During the late 1980s and continuing through the 1990s, Miller was generally perceived as a cynic on the [[Left-wing politics|left]], ever eager to bash [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] Republicans. This perception did not change much even when Miller told ''[[USA Today]]'' in 1995: "I might be profane and opinionated, but underneath all that are some pretty conservative feelings. On most issues, between [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] and [[Newt Gingrich]], I'd choose Newt in a second, even though he is a bit too exclusionary."<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment062703.asp |title=Duncan Currie on Dennis Miller on National Review Online |publisher=Nationalreview.com |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> Miller also declared himself a "[[Libertarian conservatism|conservative libertarian]]" in a 1996 ''Playboy'' interview.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

Miller's ideology changed significantly in the years following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], when he became one of the few [[Hollywood]] celebrities backing [[George W. Bush]] and the [[war in Iraq]]. Miller has said that one of the defining moments, in addition to 9/11, for his move from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was watching a 2004 [[primary election|primary]] debate between the nine Democrats then contending for their party's nomination. "I haven't seen a starting nine like that since the [[1962 New York Mets season|'62 Mets]]", he remarked.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

[[Slate magazine|Slate.com]] commentator Dennis Cass describes Miller as having changed from a "left-leaning, [[Dada]]-ist wisenheimer" to a "tell-it-like-it-is, right-wing blowhard."<ref>* {{cite web | author=Cass, Dennis | date=6 February 2004| title=Blinded by the Right: Dennis Miller's new talk show is all about his political conversion | work=Slate | url=http://www.slate.com/id/2095127 | accessdate=March 1, 2006}}</ref> The perceived change did not surprise former ''Saturday Night Live'' colleague and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] Senator [[Al Franken]], however: "People have said to me, ‘What happened to Dennis?’ Nothing happened to Dennis. He's the same Dennis. He's always had a conservative streak on certain issues."<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/26/tv.dennismiller.ap/ |title=Dennis Miller: '9-11 changed me' |date=January 26, 2004 |publisher=CNN |agency=Associated Press |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080308131736/http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/26/tv.dennismiller.ap/ |archivedate=March 8, 2008}}</ref>

While not at all shy about expressing his conservative views on topics such as [[taxes]] and [[foreign policy]], Miller is quick to point out that he is still quite [[Cultural liberalism|liberal]] on many social issues, including [[abortion]] and [[gay marriage]].<ref name="autogenerated1" /> During a recent interview{{when|date=July 2013}}, Miller said "I'm basically a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]. I'm pro-gay marriage and [[pro-choice]], but nobody wants to hear all that.... They determine who you are based on the war." During an interview on ''The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'', he said that he did not believe in [[global warming]], and that even if it was happening, he would not mind it because he does not like to be cold.<ref>[http://www.pennlive.com/entertainment/patriotnews/index.ssf?/base/entertainment/116187813997730.xml&coll=1 ''The Patriot News'']{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref>

In a radio interview with [[Penn Jillette]] on September 22, 2006, Miller explained his libertarianism, saying, "...[a libertarian is] what I am, I'll be honest with you. I'm for gay marriage. I don't believe in abortion but I'm pro-choice 'cause it's none of my business. Pretty much anything goes with me if you're not infringing yourself on other people but, I'll tell ya, 9/11 changed me.... You gotta go around and explain it to people and they think you're a [[turncoat]]."

On February 21, 2007, while appearing as a guest on ''The O'Reilly Factor'', and again on May 25, 2007, while appearing as a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', Miller stated that he initially supported [[Rudy Giuliani]] for [[United States presidential election, 2008|president in 2008]]. After Giuliani's departure from the race he redirected his support to [[John McCain]].

Miller endorsed [[Herman Cain]] in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|2012 Republican primary]], but later dropped his support, saying of Cain, "He can't win!"<ref>{{cite news|last=Bershad|first=Jon|title=Dennis Miller Drops His Endorsement Of Herman Cain: ‘He Can’t Win!’|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/dennis-miller-drops-his-endorsement-of-herman-cain-he-cant-win/|accessdate=March 20, 2012|newspaper=The Ticket|date=November 17, 2011}}</ref> He later campaigned for [[Mitt Romney]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|general election]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Cohn|first=Alicia M.|title=Dennis Miller endorses Romney as the 'gosh president'|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/twitter-room/other-news/262729-dennis-miller-endorses-romney-as-the-gosh-president|newspaper=The Hill|date=October 18, 2012}}</ref>

'''''News of the World''''' is the sixth studio album by British [[Rock music|rock]] group [[Queen (band)|Queen]], released in 1977. Containing the hit songs "[[We Will Rock You]]", "[[We Are the Champions]]" and "[[Spread Your Wings]]", it went [[RIAA certification|4x platinum]] in the United States, 2x platinum in the United Kingdom and achieved high certifications around the world.

''News of the World'' was the second album to be produced solely by the band (the first being ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]'') and recorded at [[Sarm West Studios|Sarm West]] and [[Wessex Studios]], London and co-produced and engineered by [[Mike "Clay" Stone|Mike Stone]].

==Production==
Having received some criticism that their first completely self-produced project, ''A Day at the Races'', was a "boring" album,<ref name=wash /> Queen decided to shift their musical focus towards the mainstream but remain as the producers of the next album.

After completing the ''A Day at the Races'' tour, the quartet re-entered the studio to begin work on their sixth studio offering in July 1977, enlisting Mike Stone as assistant producer at the Basing Street and Wessex Studios in London. They scaled down their complex arrangements and focused on a "rootsier" sound (as [[Brian May]] put it). However the staple of the Queen sound, multi-tracked harmonies and guitar orchestrations, still exist on this album, albeit a bit more subtly. ''News of the World'' shows Queen's songwriting less dominated by May and [[Freddie Mercury]], with [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] and [[John Deacon]] composing two songs each. The group completed recording and production of the album two months later in September and released the album on 28 October 1977.

==Song information==

==="We Will Rock You"===
{{Main|We Will Rock You}}
"We Will Rock You" ({{audio-nohelp|Queen - News Of The World - We Will Rock You.ogg|Sample}}) was released as the B-side of "We Are the Champions", and became one of Queen's biggest songs worldwide as a staple of arena and stadium sports everywhere. It was a conscious decision by Brian May to make the song simple and [[anthem]]ic ("stomp, stomp, clap, pause" twice per 4/4 measure), so that their live audience could be more directly involved in the show. In the [[music video|video]] for "We Will Rock You" and "Spread Your Wings", May used a copy of his guitar. He supposedly did not want to commit his [[Red Special]] to outside conditions, as the videos for these songs featured the band performing in the snow in Roger Taylor's garden.

==="We Are the Champions"===
{{Main|We Are the Champions}}
According to Freddie Mercury, "We Are the Champions" had already been written in 1975 but it was not recorded until 1977.<ref>''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' DVD [[audio commentary (DVD)|commentary]].</ref> Released as a single with "We Will Rock You", "We Are the Champions" reached number two in the UK and number four in the US. "We Are the Champions" was the first promotional video for which [[The Official International Queen Fan Club|fan club]] members were invited to participate in the filming. The video was filmed at the [[New London Theatre]] on 6 October 1977. Everyone got a single and Queen did a free concert after the shoot.

==="Sheer Heart Attack"===
"Sheer Heart Attack" was half-finished at the time of [[Sheer Heart Attack|the 1974 album of the same name]]. Taylor sang lead on the demo but for the definitive version the band decided Mercury should sing lead vocals, with Taylor singing the [[refrain|chorus]]. Rhythm guitar and bass were played by Taylor, apart from some guitar "screams" by May during the instrumental section.<ref>{{cite book |last=Purvis |first=Georg |year=2007 |title=Queen: Complete Works |place=Richmond |publisher=Reynolds & Hearn |isbn=978-1-905287-33-8 |page=43}}</ref>

During this time, the [[punk rock]] movement went into full effect, and this song was viewed as something of a jab at the musicians who felt bands like Queen were too self-indulgent. Of note is the lyric "I feel so inarticulate", and the fact that Taylor stated in interviews that he thought many of the 1970s punk bands had very little talent.
*Official [[YouTube]] videos: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x03cf5wy1mg Video Competition winner], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7-xYpnmIbw Live at The Bowl]

==="All Dead, All Dead"===
"All Dead, All Dead" was written and sung by May, and features Mercury on piano and backing vocals. On an episode of ''In the Studio with Redbeard'', May confirmed rumours that the song is partially inspired by the passing of his boyhood pet cat.<ref>Purvis 2007, p. 108.</ref>

==="Spread Your Wings"===
{{Main|Spread Your Wings}}
"Spread Your Wings" was written by bassist John Deacon. The piano is played by Mercury, although Deacon mimes it in the music video. The video was filmed at Taylor's house at that time in his backyard, when the weather was freezing, and the band were performing in the snow. Mercury can be seen wearing star-shaped sunglasses in the video. May is seen playing a copy of his Red Special due to the cold weather conditions. Also, Taylor can be seen singing in the video despite the fact that there are no backing vocals in the song. It was the first Queen single without harmony vocals.

==="Fight from the Inside"===
"Fight from the Inside" was written and sung by Taylor. In addition to the drums, he also plays rhythm and bass guitar, the latter borrowed from Deacon himself.

The track is built around a jangly guitar riff and is amongst the first in the Queen catalogue to focus predominantly on the drums and bass, as opposed to the lead guitars.<ref>[http://www.queenwords.com/lyrics/songs/sng06_06.shtml]</ref> It is also one of the few songs in the band's discography recorded almost entirely by one member, another being Sheer Heart Attack.

Guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] has cited the guitar riff to this song as one of his favourite riffs of all time.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sutcliffe |first=Phil |last2=Hince |first2=Peter |last3=Mack |first3=Reinhold |year=2009 |title=Queen: The Ultimate Illustrated History of the Crown Kings of Rock |place=London |publisher=Voyageur Press |isbn=0-7603-3719-5}}</ref>

==="Get Down, Make Love"===
"Get Down, Make Love", written by Mercury, is among the most sexually oriented songs in the Queen catalogue.

The song was introduced into the band's live show immediately after its release, and remained a staple of their "medley" until the end of the [[Hot Space Tour]] of 1982. It was never played live in its entirety with only the first and last verses/choruses being played with the guitar feature in the middle. On the Hot Space tour, the song was reduced to the first verse/chorus only as a way to lead into May's guitar solo. Live, this song featured Taylor's use of Latin-influenced percussion with timbales on the [[News of the World Tour]], and tightly tuned Remo Roto-Toms on the [[Jazz Tour]], [[Crazy Tour]], [[The Game Tour|The Game]] and Hot Space tours.

The distinctive 'psychedelic' sound effects heard in the song were not produced on a synthesiser, but on May's Red Special and an Electroharmonix Frequency Analyzer pedal, which he would often do live. The studio cut featured an Eventide Harmoniser. These sound effects, together with Mercury's moans and groans, were expanded upon during live renditions of the song, presenting the band an opportunity to show off the full potential of their stage lights and effects.

A more aggressive version of this song was covered by [[Trent Reznor]]'s [[industrial rock]] project [[Nine Inch Nails]] as a B-side for the 1990 single, "[[Sin (song)|Sin]]".

*{{YouTube|id=5ZWZ4ggk2uI|title=Queen music video (Live at The Bowl)}}

==="Sleeping on the Sidewalk"===
"Sleeping on the Sidewalk", written and sung by May, was inspired by [[ZZ Top]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} It was recorded (minus the vocals) in one take. Lyrically, it deals with an aspiring trumpet player's career, delivered in a "rags-to-riches" fashion. May sings with an American accent and measures the aforementioned trumpet player's success by "bucks" (as opposed to pounds). On a close inspection, Deacon can be heard playing the wrong notes in some bass parts, and May can also be heard laughing at the end of the song. It is also one of the few Queen songs that does not feature Mercury.

The band's web site states they were unaware that they were being recorded<ref>{{cite web |title=News of the World |publisher=Queen Online |url=http://www.queenonline.com/history/70/ |accessdate=6 December 2007}}</ref> but May has cast doubt on the authenticity of this, though confirming the first take of the backing track was used.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brian May's Soapbox (January 28th, 2008) |url=http://www.brianmay.com/brian/brianssb/brianssb.html |accessdate=25 January 2009}}</ref>

==="Who Needs You"===
"Who Needs You" was a song written by Deacon, who, along with May, plays Spanish guitar. Mercury's lead vocal is entirely [[Panning (audio)|panned]] on the right audio channel while the lead guitar is on the left channel. May also plays maracas and Mercury plays a [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]].

==="It's Late"===
{{Main|It's Late}}
"It's Late", written by May, was the author's idea of treating a song as a three-act theatrical play. It makes use of the [[tapping]] technique before [[Eddie Van Halen]] of rock group [[Van Halen]] made the technique widely known.

==="My Melancholy Blues"===
"My Melancholy Blues" was composed by Mercury. There are no backing vocals or guitars. Despite the title, the track is more related to [[jazz]]. Deacon played [[fretless guitar|fretless bass]] on stage during this song but used a regular fretted bass on the record.

==Cover==
[[Image:AstoundingOct53.jpg|thumb|''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', October 1953]]
The album's cover was a painting by American [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] artist [[Frank Kelly Freas]]. Taylor had an issue of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' (October 1953) whose cover-art depicted a giant intelligent robot holding the dead body of a man. The caption read: "Please... fix it, Daddy?" to illustrate the story "The Gulf Between" by [[Tom Godwin]].<ref name=pilot/> The painting inspired the band to contact Freas, who agreed to alter the painting for their album cover, by replacing the single dead man with the four "dead" band members (Taylor and Deacon falling to the ground). The inner cover (gatefold) has the robot extending its hand to snatch up the petrified fleeing audience in the shattered auditorium where the corpses were removed. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/news-world/#albumDetails |title=News of the World: Album Details |publisher=Queen Online}}</ref> Freas said he was a classical music fan and did not know Queen, and only listened to the band after doing the cover "because I thought I might just hate them, and it would ruin my ideas", but eventually liked their music.<ref name=pilot>[http://hamptonroads.com/2010/05/symphony-gets-ready-rock-we-remember-local-artist As the Symphony gets ready to rock, we remember a local artist], The Virginian-Pilot</ref>

The original painting (also called ''The Gulf Between'') features on the cover of Freas's collection of art ''As He Sees It'' (Paper Tiger, 2000).

==Singles==
*"We Are the Champions" released 7 October 1977 in the UK as the first single where it reached number 2. In the US it reached number 4.
*"Spread Your Wings" followed as the second single from the album. Released in the UK on 10 February 1978, it reached number 34.
*"It's Late" is the last single from the album and was only released as a single in the US, Canada, Japan and New Zealand in 1978. Only reached number 74 in the US, failing to chart everywhere else.

''News of the World'' initially received mixed reviews, mostly reflecting on the differences to the previous predominantly [[progressive rock]] sound produced by Queen, and this album's vast shift towards a more mainstream sound.<ref name=valley>{{cite web |url=http://queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_11-11-1977_-_News_of_the_World_-_The_Valley_News |publisher=Originally published by The Valley News.

In ''[[Creem]]'' magazine's annual poll, readers voted ''News of the World'' as the 19th best album of 1977.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/creem_lists.htm |title=Rocklist.net...Creem magazine selected readers |publisher=Rocklistmusic.co.uk |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref> In a retrospective review, [[BBC Music]]'s Daryl Easlea said that the album is an exceptional showcase of "Queen's unerring ability to sound absolutely like no-other group – even when parodying other musical styles".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/98dp BBC Review]</ref> Brendan Schroer of [[Sputnikmusic]] called it "the great [[arena rock]] wonder" with very few flaws.<ref name="Sputnikmusic"/>

==2011 re-issue==
On 8 November 2010, record company [[Universal Music]] announced a remastered and expanded reissue of the album set for release in May 2011. This was part of a new record deal between Queen and Universal Music, which meant Queen's association with [[EMI]] would come to an end after almost 40 years. According to Universal Music, all Queen albums would be remastered and reissued in 2011. This reissue included a deluxe edition which contains five additional tracks. The second batch of albums (the band's middle five albums) was released in June 2011.

==In popular culture==
The album's two opening tracks, "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions", have been used many times in popular culture. The album as a whole has been released on Super Audio CD.<ref>[http://www.sa-cd.net/showtitle/7558]</ref> The ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Killer Queen (Family Guy)|Killer Queen]]" features and references the album cover in several scenes.

==History==
[[File:YAMAHA (headquarters 3).jpg|thumb|left|The headquarters of Yamaha Corporation]]
'''Yamaha''' was established in 1887 as a [[piano]] and [[reed organ]] manufacturer by [[Torakusu Yamaha]] as {{Nihongo|'''Nippon Gakki Company, Limited'''|??????????|Nippon Gakki Seiz? Kabushiki Kaisha}} (literally [[Japan]] Musical Instrument Manufacturing Corporation) in [[Hamamatsu]], [[Shizuoka prefecture]] and was incorporated on October 12, 1897.

After [[World War II]], company president <!-- Tomiko -->Genichi Kawakami repurposed the remains of the company's war-time production machinery and the company's expertise in metallurgical [[technologies]] to the [[manufacture]] of [[motorcycle]]s. The YA-1 (AKA Akatombo, the "Red Dragonfly"), of which 125 were built in the first year of production (1954), was named in honour of the founder. It was a 125cc, single [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], two-stroke, street bike patterned after the [[Germany|German]] [[DKW]] [[RT 125|RT125]] (which the [[United Kingdom|British]] munitions firm, [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]], had also copied in the post-war era and manufactured as the ''[[BSA Bantam|Bantam]]'' and [[Harley-Davidson]] as the ''[[Harley-Davidson Hummer|Hummer]]''. In 1955,<ref name=forbes>{{cite web |title=Yamaha Motor |url=http://www.forbes.com/companies/yamaha-motor/ |work=Forbes Global 2000 List}}</ref> the success of the YA-1 resulted in the founding of [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd]].

Yamaha has grown to become the world's largest manufacturer of [[musical instruments]] (including [[piano]]s, [[Silent piano|"silent" pianos]], [[drum]]s, [[guitar]]s, [[brass instruments]], [[woodwind]]s, [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, [[cello|celli]], and [[vibraphone]]s), as well as a leading manufacturer of [[semiconductor]]s, [[Audio-visual|audio/visual]], computer related products, sporting goods, [[home appliance]]s, specialty [[metals]] and [[industrial robot]]s.<ref name=usaci>

'''''The Faculty''''' is a 1998 [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[horror film]] written by [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]] (''Scream [[Scream (1996 film)|1]]'' and ''[[Scream 2|2]]'') and directed by [[Robert Rodriguez]] (''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]'' and ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn (film)|From Dusk Till Dawn]]''). The film stars [[Josh Hartnett]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Shawn Hatosy]], [[Jordana Brewster]], [[Clea DuVall]], [[Laura Harris]], [[Robert Patrick]], [[Bebe Neuwirth]], [[Piper Laurie]], [[Famke Janssen]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher Raymond]], [[Salma Hayek]], and [[Jon Stewart]].

==Plot==
One evening at Herrington High School in [[Ohio]], a few teachers, the head football [[Coach (sport)|coach]] and the [[school principal|principal]] leave after discussions about the school's budget. Having left her keys behind, Principal Drake ([[Bebe Neuwirth]]) returns to retrieve them. In her office, she is barred from leaving by the Coach Willis ([[Robert Patrick]]) who becomes increasingly erratic, then impulsively stakes a pencil through her hand and Drake facially slashes Willis with keys. Drake flees to the main school doors only to find the handles chained up and drama teacher Mrs. Olsen ([[Piper Laurie]]) is outside, unable to assist Drake. Willis is then ambushed by Drake hiding in a room, smashing a jar on his head, seizes his keyset and grabs scissors for a weapon. Drake runs to the doors with Willis at her tail, unable to immediately find the correct key allows Willis to get upclose, and obstruct door closure but Drake successfully closes the padlock. Olsen then consecutively stabs Drake with the scissors, with an emotionless face, and reveals that Olsen is in cahoots with Willis.

The following morning, the film's protagonist students are introduced. Casey Connor ([[Elijah Wood]]), a dedicated but perpetually harrassed and routinely bullied [[photographer]] for the school newspaper, is the unappreciated friend of Delilah Profitt ([[Jordana Brewster]]) (the paper's [[editor-in-chief]] and head [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]]). Delilah's boyfriend Stan Rosado ([[Shawn Hatosy]]) is contemplating quitting the school's football team to pursue more academic ambitions, to Delilah's disapproval. Zeke Tyler ([[Josh Hartnett]]), a student repeating his senior year who sells, among other illegal items, a powdery [[MDMA|ecstasy]]-like drug he manufactures and distributes, is confronted by Miss Elizabeth Burke ([[Famke Janssen]]), who expresses concern for him over his illegal activities. Naive transfer student from [[Atlanta, Georgia]]; Marybeth Louise Hutchinson ([[Laura Harris]]), attempts to befriend self-styled outcast Stokely "Stokes" Mitchell ([[Clea DuVall]]), who deliberately confirms rumors of lesbianism even though she has a crush on Stan and is a fan of science-fiction novels. Marybeth, on the other hand, develops a crush on Zeke.

While eating lunch on the football field, Casey notices a strange creature on the field. He takes it to Professor Furlong ([[Jon Stewart]]), where the specimen is examined and believed to be a new species of [[cephalopod]]-specific parasite called a [[mesozoan]]. Delilah takes Casey into the teacher's lounge to find a story for the front page, where they hide in a closet. They witness the coach and the drama teacher assault the [[School nursing|school nurse]] ([[Salma Hayek]]) by forcing one of the creatures into her ear. They also find the body of Mrs. Brummel (Susan Willis). Casey and Delilah flee, and Casey calls the police. Principal Drake claims nothing is wrong and that Casey is seeking attention.

The next day, Casey tells the others that he believes the teachers are being controlled by [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] and goes to show them the creature he found, which is gone. When confronting Professor Furlong about the creature, he becomes defensive and attempts to infect them. Zeke cuts off Furlong's fingers and then injects his homemade drugs into Furlong's eye, seemingly killing him.

Concerned about Casey's suggestion that everyone at the school could potentially be infected, Zeke takes everyone he trusts to his house where he examines and experiments with Casey's specimen. He discovers that it needs water to survive and can be killed by his drugs because it is a [[diuretic]]. Zeke makes everyone take some of his drug to prove they are human and unaffected. Delilah is revealed as infected, and she destroys Zeke's lab and most of his drug supply before escaping.

Acting on Stokes' speculation that killing the queen alien would revert everyone to normal, the group returns to the school, where their [[American football|football]] team is playing a game and infecting opposing players. Believing Principal Drake to be the queen, they isolate her in the gym and fatally shoot her. Stan goes outside to see if it worked, but is infected by the coach. Zeke and Casey go to Zeke's car to retrieve more of Zeke's drugs. Casey leads  infected students away from Zeke, who encounters Miss Burke in the parking lot and seemingly kills her when he makes his escape.

Casey returns to the gym, where Marybeth reveals herself to be the queen, having faked taking the test earlier. Casey and Stokes flee to the swimming pool where Stokes is injured and infected. Zeke and Casey go to the locker room, where Marybeth reverts to her human disguise, naked. She explains that she is taking over Earth because her own planet is dying. Zeke is thrown into a locker and rendered unconscious. Casey takes the drug and tricks Marybeth into following him into the retracting [[bleachers]]. Casey traps Marybeth and stabs the drug into her eye, killing her.

One month later, everyone has returned to normal. Stan and Stokes begin dating, and Zeke takes Stan's place on the football team (while Miss Burke affectionately watches him practice). Casey begins dating Delilah and has become a local hero. Professor Furlong is adjusting to life with reduced eyesight and fewer fingers.

==Production==
In 1990, David Wechter and Bruce Kimmel wrote their first draft of the script and sent it out, but there were no buyers. It wasn't until after the success of ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' that Miramax bought the script and rushed it into production. Bob Weinstein and Harvey Weinstein brought in Kevin Williamson to do rewrites, keeping the basic story, but rewriting the dialogue and adding new characters to make it more "hip". Originally, Williamson was set to direct the film, but he chose not to so he could direct his self-penned script ''[[Teaching Mrs. Tingle]]''. The Weinsteins brought in Robert Rodriguez to direct the film instead.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldstein |first=Patrick |title=The Faculty |url=http://www.teako170.com/faculty.html |publisher=LA Times |accessdate=2012-09-29}}</ref>

==Reception==
Reviews were mixed. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] tallied 50 reviews from critics (with 27 listed as positive and 23 listed as negative) to give ''The Faculty'' a 54% rating, calling it a "rip-off of other sci-fi thrillers".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/faculty/|title=The Faculty - Consensus: Rip-off of other sci-fi thrillers|publisher=Rottentomatoes.com|date=|accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gave ''The Faculty'' a score of 61.<ref>{{cite web|author=MS.|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/faculty?q=the%20faculty|title=The Faculty: Generally favorable reviews|publisher=Metacritic.com|date=1998-12-25|accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref>

===Cult film status===
Later commentators suggest that a [[cult film]] had been born and was maturing to meet an appreciative audience. In 2013, for example, Aliya Whiteley wrote an essay, "Revisiting Robert Rodriguez's ''The Faculty''," which points out the movie's influences and homages (as opposed to "rip-offs"):

<blockquote>Mix ''[[Invasion Of The Body Snatchers]]'' with ''[[The Thing from Another World|The Thing]]''. Throw in some ''[[The Terminator|Terminator]]'', a spoonful of ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'', and a pinch of ''[[The Stepford Wives]]'', and you've got a big mess of a movie set in a school that’s being taken over by a [[Peer pressure|conformist]] [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]], [[Divide and rule|one teacher at a time]]. You’ve got the very funny, occasionally scary, quite gory, and extremely entertaining 1998 Robert Rodriguez film called ''The Faculty''.</blockquote>

Whiteley added, "It's all about examining the tropes of science fiction with a smart, funny angle. Half of the fun in this film is in identifying where you first came across a certain character's name or saw a particular special effect. For instance, there's a brilliant moment with a head on legs that I defy you to watch and not think of a [[The Thing (1982 film)|certain John Carpenter film]]."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/the-faculty/27623/revisiting-robert-rodriguezs-the-faculty |author= Whiteley, Aliya |date= 11 Oct 2013 |title= Revisiting Robert Rodriguez's ''The Faculty'' |publisher= [[Dennis Publishing]] |accessdate= April 21, 2014}}</blockquote></ref>

Keith Phipps also noticed the nostalgic homage when he described the film as "a Kevin Williamson-scripted high-school variation on ''Invasion Of The Body Snatchers''."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.avclub.com/article/robert-rodriguez-13753 |author= Phipps, Keith  |date= February 14, 2002 |title= Robert Rodriguez: Interview |publisher= ''[[The AV Club]]'' |accessdate= April 21, 2014}}</ref> 

In 2005, a critic for ''Movies Made Easy'' enthused about the film and explained its long life.

The '''Navy and Marine Corps Medal''' is the second highest non-combat [[Military awards of the United States Department of the Navy|decoration]] awarded for heroism by the [[United States Department of the Navy]] to the members of the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]]. The decoration was established by an act of Congress on 7 August 1942, and is authorized under {{usc|10|6246}}.  The Navy and Marine Corps Medal is generally considered the equivalent of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]?s [[Soldier's Medal]], the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]?s [[Airman's Medal]], and the [[Coast Guard Medal]].

==Criteria==
As the senior non-combat award for heroism, this award hinges on the actual level of personal "life threatening" risk experienced by the awardee. For heroic performance to rise to this level it must be clearly established that the act involved very specific life-threatening risk to the awardee.<ref name=1650.1H>{{cite web|title=Navy and Marine Corps Award Manual|url=http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/SecNavInst%201650.1H.pdf|work=SECNAV INSTRUCTION 1650.1H|publisher=United States Navy|accessdate=6 February 2013|page=2-25|date=22 August 2006}}</ref>

During the mid-20th century, the Navy and Marine Corps Medal has been awarded instead of the Silver or Gold [[Lifesaving Medal]], for sea rescues involving risk to life. This is due primarily to the creation of a variety of additional military decorations that are often considered more prestigious than the Lifesaving Medal.<ref name=award>{{cite web|title=Navy and Marine Corps Medal (NM)|url=https://awards.navy.mil/awards/webapp01.nsf/%28vwAwardsDisp%29/AW-10052085MLYF?OpenDocument|work=[https://awards.navy.mil/awards/webbas01.nsf/%28vwWebPage%29/home.htm?OpenDocument US Navy Awards]|publisher=Chief of Naval Operations|accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref> 

The Navy and Marine Corps Medal was first bestowed during [[World War II]]. A famous recipient was President [[John F. Kennedy]] who was awarded the medal as [[Commanding Officer]] of  [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109]] during World War II.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lt. John F. Kennedy's NMCM citation|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq60-10.htm|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref>

==Appearance==
The Navy and Marine Corps Medal is an [[Octagon|octagonal]] bronze medal.  The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] depicts an eagle holding a [[fouled anchor]] over a globe.  The word ''Heroism'' is inscribed below the globe.<ref name=award/>  The ribbon of the medal is three equal stripes of navy blue, old gold, and apple red.<ref>{{cite web|title=MIL-DTL-11589/106E Ribbon, U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps Medal|url=http://www.assistdocs.com/search/document_details.cfm?ident_number=9016&StartRow=14501&PaginatorPageNumber=291&status_all=ON&search_method=BASIC|work=[http://assistdocs.com Assistdocs.com]|publisher=US Department of Defense|accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref>  Additional awards of the medal are denoted by gold or silver [[5/16 inch star]]s.<ref name=1650.1H/>

'''''The Ice Storm''''' is a [[1994 in literature|1994]] [[United States|American]] [[novel]] by [[Rick Moody]]. The novel was widely acclaimed by readers and critics alike, described as a funny, acerbic, and moving hymn to a dazed and confused era of American life.<ref name="reading group">[http://www.readinggroupguides.com/guides3/ice_storm1.asp ''The Ice Storm'' at Reading Guides]; accessed April 3, 2007.</ref>

In 1997, the novel was adapted into an acclaimed [[The Ice Storm (film)|feature film]] directed by [[Ang Lee]], featuring a cast including [[Joan Allen]], [[Kevin Kline]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Christina Ricci]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Tobey Maguire]] and [[Katie Holmes]] in her screen debut.

==Plot summary==
The novel takes place over [[Thanksgiving]] weekend 1973, during a dangerous [[ice storm]] and centers on two neighboring families, the Hoods and the Williamses, and the difficulties they have dealing with the tumultuous political and social climate of the day, in affluent suburban Connecticut, during the height of the [[sexual revolution]]. The novel is narrated from four different perspectives, each of them a member of the two families, who are promoting their own opinion and views of the several complications that arise throughout the novel, including their encounters and daily life. The Hood family is overridden with lies: Ben is currently in an affair with his married neighbor Janey, his wife Elena is alienated, her daughter ventures on her own sexual liaisons with both females and males of her age, including her neighbors Mikey and Sandy.

The Hoods are Ben, Elena, Paul and Wendy and the Williamses are Jim, Janey, Mikey, and Sandy. The story focuses on the 24 hours when a major [[ice storm]] strikes the town of [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Connecticut]], just as both families are melting down from the parents' [[alcoholism]], [[escapism]] and [[adultery]], and their children's [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] experimentation.

==Characters==
*'''Ben Hood'''
*'''Elena Hood'''
*'''Paul Hood'''
*'''Wendy Hood'''
*'''Janey Williams'''
*'''Jim Williams'''
*'''Mikey Williams'''
*'''Sandy Williams'''

==Themes and analysis==
The novel's central themes are the loss of innocence and moral compass in middle-upper class Americans, and the 1970s era. It also deals with several underlying themes, including the [[Watergate scandal]] and suburban secrets, such as sexual experimentation by youths, and the same thing being done by the adults who are failing to be role models for their children, as well as their absence from their children's lives, which causes the most significant problems in the novel. Set during the time of the [[sexual revolution]], a central part of the novel is its recurring theme of sexuality. The rapidly changing sexual era is reflected in the lives of both families, who, as the revolution approached, have experimented with new, [[taboo]] sexual acts, such as [[incest]] and [[adultery]].<ref name="reading group"/>

==Critical reception==
''The Ice Storm'' was largely commended for its audacity and the many daring subjects explored in the novel.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Critic Adam Begley of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called the novel: "A bitter and loving and damning tribute to the American family.... This is a good book, packed with keen observation and sympathy for human failure"{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} while ''[[The Guardian]]'' called it "one of the wittiest books about family life ever written."{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Amanda Heller of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' stated "Moody brings this profusion of metaphor to order with a fierce, subversive intelligence. His characters, drawn with a manic acuity that isn't fully accounted for until the end, stay with us long after we've finished reading." {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

The novel was a moderate success commercially; however its sales were boosted in 1997 with the release of the film adaptation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Film adaptation==
The film adaptation ''[[The Ice Storm (film)|The Ice Storm]]'' featured a cast including [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Kevin Kline]], [[Joan Allen]], [[Christina Ricci]], [[Tobey Maguire]] and [[Elijah Wood]]. The film was a ''succès d'estime'' as an [[Art film|art house]] film and critically acclaimed despite a poor box office, however it gained a modest reception on subsequent [[home video]] releases. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  While remaining more or less faithful to the book, some details were changed. Most notably, Weaver and [[Jamey Sheridan]]'s characters were named Janey and Jim Carver, while in Moody's book, their surname was Williams.

==Influences==
The author [[Junot Diaz]] claims to have received the idea for the deep structure for ''[[The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao]]'' from this book.<ref name="xxx">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/dec/30/junot-diaz-inspiration-how-to-lose-her ''Junot Díaz: my inspiration for writing This Is How You Lose Her'' at The Guardian]; accessed Dec 30, 2012.</ref>

== ''Arliss'' on other programs ==
In July [[1999 in television|1999]], Wuhl also appeared on [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'' as a guest announcer.<ref>http://www.wrestlecrap.com/inductions/arli-on-nitro-maybe-if-he-had-played-alexander-knox/</ref> Joining [[Scott Hudson (wrestling commentator)|Scott Hudson]] and [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby "The Brain" Heenan]], Robert did not appear as himself but was named as Arliss and acted in character. He announced that "the WCW" (sic) would appear on ''Arliss'' because none of the [[Big Three Television Networks|Big Three networks]] would have WCW. Arliss stayed in character on color commentary as [[Randy Savage]], [[Stephanie Bellars|Gorgeous George]], and [[Nora Greenwald|Miss Madness]] walked to the ring. Arliss said he was scouting [[Dennis Rodman]], who was doing his third stint with the company. Wuhl appeared for cross-promotion as WCW was owned by [[Time Warner]] (and ''Nitro'' aired on [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]), as was HBO. In the ''Arliss'' episode entitled "To Thy Own Self Be True", WCW creative head [[Eric Bischoff]] guest stars along with wrestlers [[Lex Luger]], [[Randy Savage]] and Gorgeous George.

During the October 12, 2002 episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', guest host [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] delivered the following monologue in a fake [[television commercial]] sketch:
{{cquote|You know the feeling. Someone's about to tell a joke, and you panic. What if you start laughing? Lots of us experience slight loss of bladder control. An embarrassing accident can happen any time. Sometimes, just when laughing. That's why I watch ''Arliss'' on HBO Comedy. It's nice to know that, every weekday at midnight, I can sit down with Robert Wuhl and the gang at Arliss Michaels Sports Management, and, a half-hour later, my drawers will be as dry as a bone. And now I know I'll be able to get 100% bladder control whenever I'm feeling insecure. Because all seven seasons of ''Arliss'' are now available on DVD. That's over forty hours of keep-your-pants-dry entertainment! So, don't let slight loss of bladder control cramp your style. Watch ''Arliss'', and take back your life. Ask your doctor if  ''Arliss'' is right for you. Side effects may include nausea, depression, and slight sexual dysfunction.<ref>{{Cite episode|transcripturl=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/02/02barliss.phtml|series=Saturday Night Live|season=28|number=2|title=Saturday Night Live Transcripts|network=NBC|airdate=12 October 2002|accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>
}}

In the October 4th, 2012 episode of 30 Rock, "The Beginning of the End," Kenneth says, in response to Tracy Jordan's marriage having lasted for over 20 years, "That's half as long as it felt Arliss was on TV!"

==Criticism==
This show, which ran for seven seasons, is a prime example of how HBO differs from traditional networks due to its nature as a network its viewers specifically pay to be able to watch.  ''Arliss'' was cited by so many viewers as the sole reason that they paid for the network that its relatively small fan base was able to keep the show on the air for a lengthy run.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://time-blog.com/tuned_in/2007/10/tv_101_theyre_not_tv_numbers_t_1.html |title=TV 101: They're Not TV Numbers.

ESPN.com columnist [[Bill Simmons]] repeatedly wrote about how awful he felt the show was, often holding it up as Exhibit A in what he saw as the terrible state of sports shows on TV.  Simmons also noted that HBO was forced to reschedule the show because it wasn't able to hold enough viewers before ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]''. Simmons' viewpoint notwithstanding, his employer acquired rights to air ''Arli$$'' in reruns on [[ESPN Classic]].

'''USS ''Michigan'' (SSBN-727/SSGN-727)''' is the second {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|0}} [[nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] [[Cruise missile submarine|guided missile submarine]] in the [[United States Navy]]. She is the third ship to bear the name of the state of [[Michigan]].

==Construction and commissioning==
''Michigan'' was constructed at the [[Electric Boat]] Division of [[General Dynamics]] Corporation in [[Groton, Connecticut]] and was commissioned on 11 September 1982. ''Michigan'' arrived in Bangor, [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] on 16 March 1983 and completed sixty-six Strategic Deterrent Patrols.

== Conversion to SSGN ==
As of June 2007, ''Michigan'' has been converted to an [[cruise missile submarine|SSGN]] at the [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]].<ref>

On 12 December 2009, ''Michigan'' returned to [[Naval Base Kitsap]], her home base, completing her first deployment after the SSGN conversion.  The deployment began 10 November 2008, and included numerous missions.  The ship also completed several theater security cooperation engagements with Pacific Rim nations.<ref>

[[File:Bling-Bling Skywriting David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|"[[Bling Bling]]": Dot matrix skywriting over the hamlet of [[Bridgehampton, New York]], August 2006.]]
'''Skywriting ''' is the process of using a small [[aircraft]], able to expel special [[smoke]] during flight, to fly in certain patterns to create [[writing]] readable by someone on the ground. The message is often a frivolous or generally meaningless greeting or phrase, an [[Aerial advertising|advertisement]] aimed at everyone in the vicinity, a general public display of celebration or goodwill, or a personal message, such as a [[marriage proposal]] or birthday wish.

==Description==
The typical smoke generator consists of a pressurized container holding a low [[viscosity]] oil, such as Chevron/Texaco "Canopus 13", formerly "Corvus Oil". The oil is injected into the hot [[exhaust manifold]], causing it to vaporize into a huge volume of dense, white smoke.

[[Wake Turbulence]] and [[Wind]] cause dispersal and shearing of the smoke causing the writing to blur and twist, usually within a few minutes. However special "skytyping" techniques have been developed to write in the sky in a [[dot-matrix]] fashion (a new letter every 2-5 seconds instead of every 1-2 minutes), and are legible for longer {{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} than traditional skywriting.

==History==
The beginnings of skywriting are disputed. In a 1926 letter to ''The New York Times'', Albert T. Reid<!--No Wikilink because I cannot tell whether or not this is the cartoonist---> wrote:
:A newspaper paragraph says skywriting was perfected in England in 1919 and used in the United States the next year. But [[Art Smith (pilot)|Art Smith]], who succeeded [[Lincoln Beachey|Beachey]] in flying exhibitions at the [[Panama-Pacific Exposition]] in San Francisco in 1915, after the latter had been killed, did skywriting, always ending his breathtaking stunts by writing "Good night." This was not a trial exhibition, but a part of every flight, and was always witnessed by thousands.<ref>"Skywriting in 1915," ''The New York Times,'' October 9th, 1926, p. 16</ref>

Major Jack Savage, former RAF pilot and a writer for ''[[Flight International|Flight]]'' magazine, had a successful skywriting fleet of [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]] aircraft in England. He flew throughout the 1920s and 1930s, bringing the practice to America as well.<ref>{{cite journal|magazine=Air Trails|date=Winter 1971|page=48}}</ref><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%201929.html obituary ''Flight'' 1945]</ref> The first use of skywriting for advertising purposes was on November 28, 1922 over [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/big-questions/how-big-are-skywriting-letters/2006/11/30/1164777710309.html|title=How big are skywriting letters?|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|author=Harriet Veitch|date=2006-12-02|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref>

However, commercial skywriting in the United States was developed in the early 1930s by Sid Pike, founder of the Skywriting Corporation of America in 1932. One of the first major clients was [[Pepsi|Pepsi-Cola]], which used skywriting to reach a mass market. A tremendous number of flights were contracted by Pepsi-Cola, with 2,225 flown in 1940,.<ref>{{cite web|title=S. Sidney Pike Skywriting Corporation of America Collection 1920s-1940s|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?object=siris_arc_310262|work=National Air and Space Museum|publisher=[[Smithsonian]]|accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> Skywriting has also been used at times by artists. Skywriter Wayne Mansfield flew for John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and he appeared as a sky artist over the Biennale in [[Venice, Italy]]. Artist [[Vik Muniz]] used skywriting for his "cloud cloud" project.

== Skytyping ==

In 1946 the Skywriting Corporation found themselves with a fleet of surplus [[World War 2]] planes and developed '''dot matrix skywriting''', or skytyping.<ref>Cecil Coffrin, Pepsi Skywriting pilot</ref> Skytyping is the process of using five planes in formation to choreograph puffs of smoke being released from each plane. The messages, written at 10,000 foot altitude, can be up to 1250 feet tall and over five miles long. Traditional Skywriting letters are 3,000 feet high and take longer to write.

A '''bronchus''', also known as a main or primary bronchus, is a passage of airway in the [[respiratory tract]] that conducts air into the [[human lung|lung]]s.

No [[gas exchange]] takes place in the bronchi.

==Structure==
The [[trachea]] (windpipe) divides into two '''main''' or '''primary''' bronchi, the left and the right, at the level of the [[sternal angle]] and of the fifth [[thoracic vertebrae|thoracic vertebra]] or up to two vertebrae higher or lower, depending on breathing, at the anatomical point the [[carina of trachea]]. The '''right main bronchus''' is wider, shorter, and more vertical than the left main bronchus.<ref name=Brodsky2003>{{cite journal|last=Brodsky|first=JB|last2=Lemmens|first2=JM|title=Left Double-Lumen Tubes: Clinical Experience With 1,170 Patients|journal=Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia|volume=17|issue=3|pages=289–98|year=2003|pmid=12827573|pmc=|doi=10.1016/S1053-0770(03)00046-6|url=http://ether.stanford.edu/library/thoracic_anesthesia/One-Lung%20Ventilation/DLT%20Placement.pdf}}</ref>It enters the right lung at approximately the fifth [[thoracic vertebra]]. The right main bronchus subdivides into three '''secondary bronchi''' (also known as lobar bronchi), which deliver air to the three [[Human lung#lobes|lobes]] of the right lung—the superior, middle and inferior lobe. The [[azygos vein]] arches over it from behind; and the right pulmonary artery lies at first below and then in front of it. About 2&nbsp;cm from its commencement it gives off a branch to the superior lobe of the right lung, which is also called the [[eparterial bronchus]].  ''Eparterial'' refers to its position above the right [[pulmonary artery]]. The right bronchus now passes below the artery, and is known as the ''hyparterial'' branch which divides into the two lobar bronchi to the middle and lower lobes.

The '''left main bronchus''' is smaller in caliber but longer than the [[Right main bronchus|right]], being 5&nbsp;cm long. It enters the [[root of the lung|root of the left lung]] opposite the sixth [[thoracic vertebra]]. It passes beneath the [[aortic arch]], crosses in front of the [[esophagus]], the [[thoracic duct]], and the [[descending aorta]], and has the left [[pulmonary artery]] lying at first above, and then in front of it. The left bronchus has no [[eparterial branch]], and therefore it has been supposed by some that there is no upper lobe to the left lung, but that the so-called upper lobe corresponds to the middle lobe of the [[right lung]]. The left main bronchus divides into two secondary or lobar bronchi to deliver air to the two lobes of the left lung—the superior and the inferior lobe. 

The secondary bronchi divide further into '''tertiary bronchi''', (also known as segmental bronchi), each of which supplies a [[bronchopulmonary segment]].  A bronchopulmonary segment is a division of a lung separated from the rest of the lung by a [[septum]] of [[connective tissue]]. This property allows a bronchopulmonary segment to be surgically removed without affecting other segments. Initially, there are ten segments in each lung, but during development with the left lung having just two lobes, two pairs of segments fuse to give eight, four for each lobe. The tertiary bronchi divide into many smaller [[bronchiole]]s which divide into [[terminal bronchiole]]s, each of which then gives rise to several [[respiratory bronchiole]]s, which go on to divide into two to eleven [[alveolar duct]]s. There are five or six [[alveolar sac]]s associated with each alveolar duct.  The [[pulmonary alveolus|alveolus]] is the basic anatomical unit of gas exchange in the lung.

The main bronchi have relatively large lumens that are lined by [[respiratory epithelium]]. This cellular lining has cilia departing towards the mouth which removes dust and other small particles. There is a [[smooth muscle]] layer below the epithelium arranged as two ribbons of muscle that spiral in opposite directions.  This smooth muscle layer contains [[seromucous gland]]s.  Irregularly arranged plates of [[hyaline cartilage]] surround the smooth muscle.  These plates give structural support to the bronchi and keep the airway open.

A bronchus has cartilage plates, smooth muscle, and mucus-secreting gland-cells in its wall. It also has lining cells with cilia departing towards the mouth; this removes dust and other small debris.

The [[hyaline cartilage]] forms an incomplete ring in the main bronchi, giving them a "D"-shaped appearance, and form as small plates and islands in the smaller bronchi. [[Smooth muscle]] is present continuously around the bronchi. The hyaline cartilage gives structural support and also keep the airway open.

[[File:Pseudostr. epi.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium - mag. x600]]
[[File:Bronchi.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Cross section of secondary bronchus]]
The [[cartilage]] and [[mucous membrane]] of the primary bronchi are similar to those in the trachea. As the branching continues through the bronchial tree, the amount of [[hyaline cartilage]] in the walls decreases until it is absent in the bronchioles. As the cartilage decreases, the amount of smooth muscle increases. The mucous membrane also undergoes a transition from ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium to simple [[cuboidal epithelium]] to simple [[squamous epithelium]].

===Variation===
In 0.1 to 5% of people there is a right superior lobe bronchus arising from the main stem bronchus prior to the carina.  This is known as a tracheal bronchus, and seen as an [[anatomical variation]]. It can have multiple variations and, although usually asymptomatic, it can be the root cause of pulmonary disease such as a recurrent infection.  In such cases [[segmental resection|resection]] is often curative<ref>{{Cite journal

==Function==
{{See also|Respiratory tree}}

The [[alveolar ducts]] and [[alveoli]] consist primarily of simple [[squamous epithelium]], which permits rapid diffusion of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Exchange of gases between the air in the lungs and the blood in the [[capillaries]] occurs across the walls of the alveolar ducts and alveoli.

==Clinical significance==
===Bronchitis===
{{Main|Bronchitis}}
[[Bronchitis]] is defined as inflammation of the bronchi,  which can either be acute or chronic. Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viral or bacterial infections.  Most sufferers of chronic bronchitis also suffer from [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), and is usually associated with smoking or long-term exposure to irritants. 

===Aspiration===
While the left mainstem bronchus departs from the trachea at an angle, the right mainstem bronchus is almost a vertical continuation of the trachea.  This anatomy predisposes the right lung to several problems:
*If food, liquids, or foreign bodies are aspirated, they often will lodge in the right mainstem bronchus.  [[Aspiration pneumonia]] may result.
*If the [[endotracheal tube]] used for [[tracheal intubation|intubation]] is inserted too far, it usually lodges in the right mainstem bronchus. This allows ventilation of the right lung, but leaves the left lung useless.

===Asthma===
[[Asthma]] is [[bronchial hyperresponsiveness|hyperreactivity of the bronchi]] with an inflammatory component, often in response to [[allergen]]s.

In [[asthma]], the constriction of the bronchi can result in a difficulty in breathing giving shortness of breath; this can lead to a lack of oxygen reaching the body for cellular processes. In this case an [[asthma puffer]] can be used to rectify the problem. The puffer administers a [[bronchodilator]], which serves to soothe the constricted bronchi and to re-expand the airways. This effect occurs quite quickly.

The '''bronchioles''' or '''bronchioli''' are the passageways by which air passes through the [[nose]] or [[mouth]] to the [[pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] (air sacs) of the lungs, in which branches no longer contain [[cartilage]] or [[gland]]s in their [[submucosa]]. They are branches of the [[bronchi]], and are part of the [[conducting zone]] of the [[respiratory system]]. The bronchioles divide further into smaller '''terminal''' bronchioles which are still in the conducting zone and these then divide into the smaller '''respiratory''' bronchioles which mark the beginning of the respiratory region.

== Structure ==
[[File:Gray975.png|thumb|left|200px|A lobule of the [[lung]] showing r. b respiratory bronchiole;al. d [[alveolar duct]];a. s [[alveolar sac]];'a' alveolus;]]
A pulmonary lobule is the portion of the [[lung]] ventilated by one bronchiole. Bronchioles are approximately 1mm or less in diameter and their walls consist of [[ciliated]] cuboidal [[epithelium]] and a layer of [[smooth muscle]]. 
Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called ''terminal'', which are 0.5mm or less in diameter. Terminal bronchioles in turn divide into smaller respiratory bronchioles which divide into [[alveolar ducts]]. Terminal bronchioles mark the end of the conducting division of air flow in the [[respiratory system]] while respiratory bronchioles are the beginning of the respiratory division where actual [[gas exchange]] takes place.

The diameter of the bronchioles plays an important role in air flow. The bronchioles change diameter to either increase or reduce air flow. An increase in diameter is called [[bronchodilation]] and is stimulated by either [[epinephrine]] or [[sympathetic nerves]] to increase air flow. A decrease in diameter is called [[bronchoconstriction]] and is stimulated by [[histamine]], [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic nerves]], cold air, chemical irritants and other factors to decrease air flow.

===Bronchioles===
[[File:Illu bronchi lungs.jpg|Thumb|right|340px|Lungs showing bronchi and bronchioles]]
The '''primary bronchi''', in each lung, which are the [[left bronchus|left]] and [[right bronchus]], give rise to '''[[secondary bronchus|secondary bronchi]]'''. These in turn give rise to '''[[tertiary bronchus|tertiary bronchi]]''' (tertiary meaning third). The tertiary bronchi subdivide into the '''bronchioles'''. They are histologically distinct from the tertiary bronchi in that their walls do not have [[hyaline cartilage]] and they have [[club cell]]s in their epithelial lining.  The [[epithelium]] starts as a [[simple columnar epithelium|simple ciliated columnar epithelium]] and changes to [[simple cuboidal epithelium|simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium]] as the bronchioles decreases in size.   The diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1&nbsp;mm, though this value can actually range from 5&nbsp;mm to 0.3&nbsp;mm.  As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency.  Instead, they rely on [[elastic fiber]]s attached to the surrounding [[human lung|lung]] tissue for support.  The inner lining ([[lamina propria]]) of these bronchioles is thin with no glands present, and is surrounded by a layer of [[smooth muscle]].  As the bronchioles get smaller they divide into '''terminal bronchioles''', these bronchioles mark the end of the [[conducting zone]], which covers the first division through the sixteenth division of the [[respiratory tract]]. [[Pulmonary alveolus|Alveoli]] only become present when the conducting zone changes to the [[respiratory zone]], from the sixteenth through the twenty-third division of the tract.

===Terminal bronchioles===
The terminal bronchiole is the most distal segment of the conducting zone. It branches off the lesser bronchioles. Each of the terminal bronchioles divides to form '''respiratory bronchioles''' which contain a small number of alveoli.  Terminal bronchioles are lined with simple [[cuboidal epithelial cell|cuboidal epithelium]] containing [[club cell]]s.  Terminal bronchioles contain a limited number of ciliated cells and no [[goblet cell]]s.  Club cells are non-ciliated, rounded protein secreting cells.  Their secretions are a nonsticky, proteinaceous compound to maintain the airway in the smallest bronchioles.  The secretion, called [[surfactant]], reduces [[surface tension]], allowing for bronchioles to expand during inspiration and keeping the bronchioles from collapsing during expiration.  Club cells, a [[stem cell]] of the [[respiratory system]], produce [[enzyme]]s that detoxify substances dissolved in the respiratory fluid.

===Respiratory bronchioles===
The '''respiratory bronchioles''' are the narrowest airways of the [[lung]]s, one fiftieth of an inch across.<ref name="Merck">Merck Manual of medical information,home edition, copyright 1997, first printing of pocket books 1999, Pocket Books, a division of Simon and Schuster Inc</ref>  The [[bronchi]] divide many times before evolving into the bronchioles.
The bronchioles deliver air to the exchange surfaces of the lungs.<ref>Human Anatomy by Frederic Martini sixth edition, page 643</ref>
They are interrupted by [[alveoli]] which are thin walled evaginations.  [[Alveolar ducts]] are distal continuations of the respiratory bronchioles.

==Clinical significance==
[[Bronchospasm]], a potentially life-threatening situation, occurs when the smooth muscular tissue of the bronchioles constricts, severely narrowing their diameter. The most common cause of this is asthma. Bronchospasm is commonly treated by [[oxygen therapy]] and [[bronchodilator]]s.

Diseases of the bronchioles include [[asthma]], [[bronchiolitis obliterans]], [[respiratory syncytial virus]] infections, and [[influenza]].

===Inflammation===
The medical condition of inflammation of the bronchioles is termed [[bronchiolitis]].

The '''Attica Prison riot''' occurred at the [[Attica Correctional Facility]] in [[Attica (town), New York|Attica, New York]], [[United States]] in 1971. This riot is one of the most famous and important riots during the Prisoner Rights Movement. The riot was based upon prisoners' demands for political rights and better living conditions.  On September 9, 1971, two weeks after the killing of [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]] at [[San Quentin Prison | San Quentin]], about 1,000 of the Attica prison's approximately 2,200 inmates rebelled and seized control of the prison, taking 42 staff hostage.

During the following four days of negotiations, authorities agreed to 28 of the prisoners' demands{{fact|date=July 2014}}, but would not agree to demands for complete [[amnesty]] from criminal prosecution for the prison takeover or for the removal of Attica's superintendent. By the order of Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], state police took back control of the prison. When the uprising was over, at least 43 people were dead, including ten [[correctional officer]]s and civilian employees, and 33 inmates.

Rockefeller, who refused to visit the prisoners during the rebellion, stated that the prisoners “carried out the cold-blood killings they had threatened from the outset”.<ref>''The Milwaukee Star'' (1971)</ref> On the other hand ''New York Times'' writer Fred Ferritti said the rebellion concluded in “mass deaths that four days of taut negotiations had sought to avert”.<ref>Ferretti (1971)</ref> There are many different perspectives when considering the prison rebellion; the outside world either characterized the inmates as heroes or villains.

==The riot==
At approximately 8:20 a.m. on Thursday, September 9, 1971, 5 Company lined up for roll-call. Hearing rumors that one of their companions was to remain in his cell after being isolated for an incident involving an assault on a prison officer, a small group of 5 Company inmates protested that they too would be locked up and began walking back towards their cells. The remainder of 5 Company continued towards breakfast. As the protesting group walked past the isolated inmate, they were able to free him from his cell. They then rejoined the rest of 5 Company and proceeded on their way to breakfast. A short time later, when the command staff discovered what had occurred, they changed the usual scheduling of the prisoners. Instead of going to the yard after breakfast as they usually did, the prisoners realized they were being led back to their cells. Complaints led to anger when the correctional officer tried to calm the mob of prisoners. He was assaulted and the riot began.<ref name=acs>{{cite web|publisher=Attica Central School District |title=Attica Correctional Facility: 1971 Prison Riot |accessdate=2006-10-04 |url=http://www.atticacsd.org/hs/library/Prison/prison/riot.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930031630/http://www.atticacsd.org/hs/library/Prison/prison/riot.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=2007-09-30}}</ref>
  
The inmates quickly gained control of sections, D-yard, two tunnels and the central control room, referred to as "Times Square".

==Negotiations==
Throughout the negotiations, there was leadership and organization among the prisoners.

As speakers like Barkley raised morale, the rebels' negotiating team of prisoners proposed their requests to the commissioner. ''The Attica Liberation Faction Manifesto Of Demands'' is a compilation of complaints written by the Attica prisoners, which speak directly to the “sincere people of society”. It includes 27 demands, such as better medical treatment, fair visitation rights, and an end to physical brutality. The prisoners also requested better sanitations, improved food quality, and one set of rules for the state among numerous other demands. The manifesto specifically assigns the power to negotiate to five inmates: Donald Noble, Peter Butler, Frank Lott, Carl Jones-El, and Herbert Blyden X. Additionally, the document specifically lists out “vile and vicious slave masters” who oppressed the prisoners such as the New York governor, New York Corrections and even the United States Courts.<ref>The Attica Liberation Faction Manifesto Of Demands (1971)</ref>

The prisoners continued to unsuccessfully negotiate with Correctional Services Commissioner Russell G. Oswald and then later with a team of observers that included [[Tom Wicker]], an editor of the ''[[New York Times]]'', James Ingram of the ''[[Michigan Chronicle]]'', state senator [[John Dunne (politician)|John Dunne]], state representative [[Arthur Eve]], civil rights lawyer [[William Kunstler]], Minister [[Louis Farrakhan]], National Representative of the [[Nation of Islam]] and others.

The situation may have been further complicated by Governor Rockefeller's refusal to come to the scene of the riot and meet with the inmates,<ref name=pbs/> although some later evaluations of the incident would postulate that his absence from the scene actually prevented the situation from deteriorating.<ref>Benjamin, G., & Rappaport, S. (1974). Attica and Prison Reform. ''Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science, 31''(3), 203-212. Retrieved October 6, 2006, from JSTOR database.</ref> Negotiations broke down and Oswald told the inmates that he was unable to negotiate with them anymore and ordered that they must give themselves up. Oswald later called Governor Rockefeller and again begged him to come to the prison to calm the riot. After the governor's refusal, Oswald stated that he would order the State Police to retake the facility by force. Rockefeller agreed with Oswald's decision. This agreement would be later criticized by a commission created by Rockefeller to study the riot and the aftermath.<ref name=Time1972>{{cite news|title=A Year Ago at Attica |work=Time |publisher=Time Magazine, Inc. |date=1972-09-25 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903593,00.html |accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref>

==Retaking of the prison and retaliation==
As the demands were not met, negotiations broke down, and the mood among the inmates deteriorated. It appeared as though Gov. Rockefeller remained opposed to the inmates' demands, and they became restless. Defensive trenches had been dug, metal gates had been electrified, crude battlements were fashioned out of metal tables and dirt, gasoline was put in position to be lit in the event of conflict and the "Times Square" prison command center was fortified. The inmates brought four corrections officers to the top of the command center and threatened to slit their throats. Reporters in helicopters circling the prison reported that the hostages in D yard were also being prepared for killing. Gov. Rockefeller had ordered that the prison be retaken that day if negotiations failed. Situation commander Oswald, seeing the danger to the hostages, ordered that the prison be retaken by force. Of the decision, he later said "On a much smaller scale, I think I have some feeling now of how Truman must have felt when he decided to drop the A-bomb."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910027,00.html | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | title=The Nation: War at Attica: Was There No Other Way? | date=September 27, 1971}}</ref>

==Retaliation by the Weathermen==
On 7:30 p.m. September 17, the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weathermen]] launched a retaliatory attack on the New York Department of Corrections, exploding a bomb near Oswald's office. "The communique accompanying the attack called the prison system an example of 'how a society run by white racists maintains its control,' with white supremacy being the 'main question white people have to face'"<ref>[[Dan Berger|Berger, Dan]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=6KC36MHH3j8C&pg=PT91&lpg=PT91&dq=weather+underground+attica+rockefeller&source=bl&ots=55wtcfOYfg&sig=kiJYmRbmdgXuZ8O8LzZkuKrV9es&hl=en&ei=hnZuTtnAA8HagQfZ6_31BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=weather%20underground%20attica%20rockefeller&f=false ''Outlaws of America: the Weather Underground and the politics of solidarity''], (AK Press, 2006) pp. 182–3, via Google Books.

==Lawsuits and payments==
Within four years of the riot, 62 inmates had been charged in 42 indictments with 1,289 separate counts. One state trooper was indicted for reckless endangerment.<ref name=Al-Jundi>Al-Jundi v. Mancusi, 113 F. Supp. 2d 441 (W.D.N.Y. 2000)</ref>

Inmates and families of inmates killed in the prison retaking sued the State of New York for civil rights violations by law enforcement officers during and after the retaking of Attica. After years in the courts, in 2000, the State of New York agreed to pay $8 million ($12 million minus legal fees) to settle the case.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chen|first=David W.|title=COMPENSATION SET ON ATTICA UPRISING|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/29/nyregion/compensation-set-on-attica-uprising.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 August 2000}}</ref> The State of New York also recognized the families of the slain prison employees in 2005 with a $12 million financial settlement.<ref>{{cite news|title=State and Prison Workers Settle Attica Riot Claims|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/14/nyregion/14attica.html|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 January 2005}}</ref>

The Forgotten Victims of Attica have also asked the State of New York to release state records of the uprising to the public. In 2013, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said he would seek the release of the entire 570-page Meyer Report, the state's review of the uprising. The report was prepared by former State Supreme Court justice Bernard S. Meyer and submitted in 1975. One volume was made public, but a State Supreme Court justice ordered in 1981 that the other two be sealed permanently.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kaplan|first=Thomas|title=Decades Later, State Seeks Release of Report on Attica Uprising|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/20/nyregion/decades-later-state-seeks-release-of-report-on-attica-uprising.html?ref=atticariots1971|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 April 2013}}</ref>

==Racial issues==
At the time of the riots, black militancy was at its peak and many black prisoners had transferred to Attica causing prison population to increase from its designed 1200 prisoners to 2243.<ref name=Vince>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9563394/Vincent-Mancusi.html|title=Obituary:Vincent Mancusi|work=Daily Telegraph|date=24 Sep 2012|accessdate=27 Sep 2012}}</ref> 54% of these were [[Black American]], 9% [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Rican]] and 37% white;<ref>{{cite book|title=Attica: The Official Report of the New York State Special Commission on Attica|year=1972|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|pages=28 (digital page 67) |url=http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/mssc/attica/atticareport.pdf |oclc=601935}}</ref> however, all of the 383 correctional officers were white.

===''Al Jundi v. Mancusi''===
It was believed that a group of Muslims were responsible for the uprising and the harm of the hostages, when in fact the group of Muslims was protecting the hostages from other inmates. The leader of the Muslims even told the other inmates that if any of the inmates tried to hurt the hostages, that they would "kill [the inmates involved] or die protecting the hostages." The court in ''Al Jundi v. Mancusi'', 113 F.Supp.2d 441 wrote:<ref>http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/926/235/258238/</ref><ref>http://www.nywd.uscourts.gov/decision/corroborating.pdf</ref>

{{importance-section|date=March 2012}}
A number of former Muslim inmates testified that they had been singled out for "special" brutal treatment by troopers and prison officers because they had played an active role in protecting the hostages during the four days before the retaking. Because a number of militant inmates were prepared to do harm to the hostages, Frank "Big Black" Smith, in conjunction with the Muslim leadership, implemented a plan to secure the safety of the hostages during negotiations.<ref name="smithpbs">http://www.pbs.org/pov/docs/disturbingtheuniverse/kunstler_lp_smith.pdf</ref>

This view was corroborated by Michael Smith, age 51, a former corrections officer who was a hostage up to September 13, 1971. He testified that he was taken hostage on September 9, 1971 by a group of inmates who were out of control. He described them as a "wave of human emotion". He was in charge of the sheet metal shop and developed a good rapport with the inmates who worked under him and they protected him from the militant group. But eventually he came under the control of the take-over group and found himself in the center of D-Yard with other hostages. One of the inmates, Don Noble, whom he had befriended and who worked in the sheet metal shop, and Carl Reighn (originally referred to in previous interviews as Carl Rain) protected him on September 9, 1971, trying desperately to come up with ways to hide or save him and protect him; and would later save his life on September 13, 1971. Mr. Carl Reighn was there from the moment they broke the metal shop doors down.

Smith was interviewed by the media while being held hostage along with Corrections Officer Cunningham. He conveyed that the inmates' demands were for improved conditions and reported that he was not being harmed. He was blindfolded most of the time. Upon receiving news of Corrections Officer Quinn's death, the negotiation process broke down.

On Sunday night, September 12, 1971, the feeling was "somber".<ref name="smithpbs" /> He got a pen and wrote a goodbye note to his wife and family on dollar bills which were in his wallet. He testified that the hostages sat in a circle and leaned up against each other for support.

On Monday, September 13, 1971, he was selected along with a few other hostages to be taken up on the A-Yard catwalk and a hostage execution was arranged. He was taken to the top of the catwalk by three inmates and sat on a chair blindfolded. Inmate Don Noble was on his left and held a knife to his throat. As the Army helicopter hovered over them and dropped tear gas, the shooting started and the inmate on his right was shot twice and blown over the railing of the catwalk. Don Noble pulled him to his left and the inmate immediately behind him received a fatal volley of gunfire. Noble was shot and Smith was shot four times in the stomach and once in the arm. The chair on which he had been sitting disintegrated from gunshots. Smith said in court, "I don't know how long the shooting went on. You could hear people crying, people dying and people screaming." He never lost consciousness as he lay on the catwalk until a trooper stood over him pointing a shotgun at his head. A prison officer saw what was going on and yelled to the trooper, "He is one of us", who then focused his attention on Noble, at which point Smith told the trooper, "He saved my life".

He was eventually taken by National Guard medics to St. Jerome's Hospital in [[Batavia (city), New York|Batavia]] for an extensive period of treatment involving multiple surgeries. He was eventually released from service as a corrections officer because of his physical inability to perform his duties. He commented on the inaccuracy of the McKay Report which claimed that he had been merely knocked unconscious—no mention of his extensive gunshot wounds nor how they were obtained. He openly stated that his life was saved while he was held hostage because of the dedicated efforts of the Muslim group at Attica. "In fact, I can recall hearing one of the Muslim leaders instructing one of their men that if anyone tries to break through their Muslim perimeter to kill them or die protecting the hostages."

===In film ===
Direct coverage of the Attica Prison riot:
* ScreenSlate describes [[Cindy Firestone]]'s documentary, titled ''Attica'' (1974), as follows:<ref>{{cite news|work=ScreenSlate|url= http://www.screenslate.com/whats-showing-today/tuesday-september-13|accessdate=2 February 2014|title=Tuesday, September 13 >> Featured Screening: ''Attica'' at BAMcinématek|author= SCREENSLATE|date=September 13, 2011}}</ref>
<blockquote>''Firestone’s 1974 film, restored in 2007, culls together primary footage from surveillance and news cameras along with prisoner, family and guard interviews to create an account of the massacre that has been described as temperate, but undeniably damning with respect to the state’s actions. As ''[[The New Yorker]]''’s 1974 review describes it, “Cinda Firestone’s quiet picture uses horrifying film footage: shots taken through state troopers’ telescopic rifle lenses; musings by inmates which sometimes sputter into anger against a world that finds descriptions of Attica incredible; riot quellers insensibly proud of their skill with weapons, showing off their prowess before the commission of inquiry. … If Attica disturbed our slumber for a mere month or two, one of the qualities of this trumpet call of a film is that it makes the disturbance enduring.”''</blockquote>
* At least three TV movies of the riot have been produced: ''[[Attica (film)|Attica]]'' (1980), with [[George Grizzard]] and [[Morgan Freeman]], [[John Frankenheimer]]'s ''[[Against the Wall (1994 film)|Against The Wall]]'' (1994), with [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Kyle MacLachlan]], and [[Clarence Williams III]]; and ''[[The Killing Yard]]'' (2001), directed by [[Euzhan Palcy]], with [[Alan Alda]] and [[Morris Chestnut]].

Several other films reference the uprising:
* In the film ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]],'' (1975), [[Al Pacino]]'s character, Sonny, who is holding eight bank employees hostage, starts the chant, "Attica! Attica!", at the massed police outside, evoking the excessive police force used in response to the Attica riot.  The chant "Attica! Attica!" has since been parodied or used for comedic effect in everything from children's cartoons to crime procedurals.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

* In the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977), [[John Travolta]]'s character, Tony Manero, wakes up after a night out at the disco and, while looking at himself in the mirror and seeing a poster of [[Al Pacino]] in ''[[Serpico]]''(1973), debates whether he resembles Al Pacino. Becoming enamored of the idea, he yells "Al Pacino!" and then opens his bedroom door, walks into the hallway, and chants "Attica! Attica!", wearing only his underwear while his grandmother covers her eyes with her apron. This scene's reference to Pacino and his two characters (Serpico and Sonny) invites the audience to contrast them to Travolta and his character Tony, setting them up both as ideal models and as foils for Tony.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===In music===
The incident is directly referenced in several songs.

* The song "[[Rubber Bullets]]" by English band [[10cc]].

* [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Attica State (song)|Attica State]]" on his ''[[Some Time In New York City]]'' album

* [[Tom Paxton]]'s "The Hostage", which was included by [[Judy Collins]] on her 1973 album ''[[True Stories and Other Dreams]]'' (1973)

* In the [[Gil Scott-Heron]] song, "We Beg Your Pardon", Scott-Heron is critical of Governor Rockefeller's handling of the riot, stating that "brother Richard X of Buffalo New York faces 1365 years... behind bars for participating in Attica, and Rockefeller faces being the Vice President of this country".

* [[Paul Simon]]'s "Virgil", on his album ''[[Songs from The Capeman]]'' (1997)

* The Attica riot also inspired the [[Charles Mingus]] composition "[[Changes One (Mingus)|Remember Rockefeller at Attica]]", and jazz saxophonist [[Archie Shepp]]'s composition "Attica Blues" (1972) from his [[Attica Blues (album)|album of the same name]]. Rapper [[Nas]] mentioned Attica in his collaboration song with Lauryn Hill, "[[If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)]]". Nas raps "I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa". 
* In the song "C.I.A. (Criminals in Action)", by [[KRS-One]], Zack De La Rocha, and The Last Emperor: "I flip the shit like Pacino and it's your ''Dog Day Afternoon'' / Attica, Attica, drug agents you bring your static-a."

*[[Black Moon (group)|Black Moon]]'s "Powaful Impak!" on the album "[[Enta da Stage]]" the riot is mentioned in the lyric "I'm bustin' niggas open, Attica style"

*[[Frederic Rzewski]] wrote Coming together/Attica based on [[Sam Melville]]'s letters from Attica

===In poetry===
* Boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] recited a poem in Ireland, imagining what Attica's prisoners would have said before their death.{{when|date=February 2014}}{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* In 1972, [[avant-garde]] composer and pianist [[Frederic Rzewski]] wrote two pieces connected to the Attica riot, both for percussion ensemble and speaker. "Coming Together" sets text by [[Sam Melville]], a leader of the uprising and one of the people who lost their lives as a result of it, from a letter he wrote in 1971. The second and shorter piece, "Attica", is set to the statement made by inmate Richard X. Clark when he was released from the prison: "Attica is in front of me now." The two pieces was recorded in 1973 for the Opus One label by the Blackearth Percussion Group, with Steven ben Israel of the [[Living Theater]] as the speaker.<ref>Rzewski, Frederic. ''Coming Together / Les Moutons de Panurge / Attica''. Opus One: 20.</ref>

* The poem ''[[Hadda Be Playing on the Jukebox]]'' by American poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] makes a reference to the Attica prison riot. This poem was also subsequently performed as a song by political rock band [[Rage Against The Machine]].

===In television===
* The Attica Prison riot served as a source of inspiration for the Bell Riots from the [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]] episode [[Past Tense (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Past Tense]].<ref>Source: Time Travel Files: "Past Tense". DVD extra included with ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine – The Complete Third Season''. [[ASIN]] B00008KA5A.</ref>

* In the episode "A Date with the Booty Warrior" of the popular animated series ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'', the episode's titular character takes Tom hostage with a shank, inciting a prison riot. After the convicts had taken the guards hostage, they were deciding what to do next. The other convicts were disgruntled to learn that the Booty Warrior's only demands were "to get some booty". One of the other convicts (voiced by [[Clifton Powell]]) remarked "I thought this was supposed to be some Attica-type shit!".

*In the 25th episode of the 2003 TV series, ''TMNT'', titled "The Search for Splinter: Part 1", Casey Jones says the phrase "Attica, Attica" while distracting the guards of TCRI; meanwhile April disables the building's alarms.

* In the season 1 finale of the HBO series ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'', Attica is referenced by unit manager Tim McManus as his hometown and the riot as his original impetus for his wanting to set up Emerald City.

* In the episode "Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody's Ass" of the FX series ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]'', in a form of protesting the bar's "No rules" stance, Charlie scares bystanders away from Dee's street performance by swinging a broom and screaming, "Attica! Attica, man!" repeatedly.

* In the episode "Missing Identity" of ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', SpongeBob imagines someone robbing a bank wearing his name tag, and when the camera zooms in on the name tag, the robber begins screaming "Attica!". This may be more of a reference to the movie ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'', but it is an Attica reference nonetheless.

* During the January 26th, 1998 episode of WCW Monday Nitro, pro wrestler Kevin Nash is "arrested" after using his banned jackknife maneuver. As he is being handcuffed and being led away by security, he yells "Attica!"

* In season 7, episode 18 of "Sabrina: The Teenage Witch", Sabrina encases her talking cat, Salem, in a metal box.  Salem yells "Cattica, Cattica!" in reference to the riot.

* In season 3, episode 4 (entitled "Lines in the Sand") of the TV show "House M.D.," House protests Cuddy's refusal to return a recently removed hemo-stained carpet to his office with cries of "Attica." 

* In season 3, episode 7 of 'The King of Queens', Arthur chants "Attica! Attica!" at a passing police officer on the street.

'''Ziaur Rahman''' ({{lang-bn|??????? ?????}} ''Ji-yaur Rôhman'') (19 January 1931 – 30 May 1981) was a Bangladeshi politician who served as the 7th President of Bangladesh from 21 April 1977 until his death in 30 May 1981. He is popularly known as '''Zia'''.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} He was the announcer of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. He formed and was commander of the Central Sector, BDF (Bangladesh Defense Forces) Sector 11, during the nations war of independence in 1971. Later turned politician, he formed one of the largest political parties, the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] in 1978.

A highly decorated and accomplished military officer, he was awarded [[Bir Uttom]] (the highest gallantry award for a living military personnel) for his wartime services retired from the [[Bangladesh Army]] as a [[Lieutenant General]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangabhaban.gov.bd/ziaur.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130605130743/http://www.bangabhaban.gov.bd/ziaur.html |archivedate=5 June 2013 |title=Bangabhaban Biography showing Ziaur Rahman getting promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General |publisher=Bangabhaban.gov.bd |date= |accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref> in 1979 {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}.

==Early life==
Ziaur Rahman Komol , popularly known as Zia, was the second son of Mansur Rahman and Jahanara Khatun. His father was a chemist who specialised in paper and ink chemistry and worked for a government department at Writer's Building in Kolkata. As a child Ziaur Rahman, nicknamed Komol, was reserved, shy, quietly spoken, and intense in many respects. He was raised in a village named Bagbari, in Bogra, British India.

In 1946, Mansur Rahman, for a short stint, enrolled Zia in one of the leading boys schools of Calcutta—Hare School—where Zia studied until the dissolution of the British Empire in South Asia and creation of India in 1947. On 14 August 1947, Mansur Rahman, became a citizen of [[Pakistan]], like many Muslims working for the former British government in India, exercised his option to become a citizen of a Muslim majority Pakistan and moved to Karachi,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404707055.html |title=Encyclopedia Biography showing Ziaur Rahman family moving to Karachi |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=18 February 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140501235929/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404707055.html|archivedate=1 May 2014}}</ref> the first capital of Pakistan located in Sindh, West Pakistan.
Zia, at the age of 11, had become a student in class 6(six) at the Academy School in Karachi in 1947. Zia spent his adolescent years in Karachi and by age 16 completed his secondary education from that School in 1952.

In 1953, Zia was admitted into the D.J. College in Karachi. In the same year he joined the [[Pakistan Military Academy]] at [[Kakul]] as an officer cadet.
Zia's character and style as one of the most effective leaders in the colonised world was largely shaped by the issues, attitudes, and events during his years at the Academy School.

===Marriage to Khaleda Majumder===
In August 1960, his marriage was arranged to Khaleda Majumder (who subsequently converted her maiden name to [[Khaleda Zia]] and became Prime Minister of [[Bangladesh]] for 3 times), the 15-year-old daughter of Iskandar Majumder and Taiyaba Majumder from the Dinajpur District, in a simple ceremony. Ziaur Rahman, a Captain in the then Pakistani Army who was posted at that time as an Officer of the Defence Forces. His father, Mansur Rahman could not attend the marriage ceremony,<ref>{{cite book| last = Singh| first = Nagendra Kr| title = Ziaur Rahamn's father not attending marriage ceremony| url = http://books.google.com/?id=qVtuAAAAMAAJ| accessdate = 18 February 2013| year = 2001| publisher = A.P.H.

The wedding reception took place after one year in the then Hotel Shahbag, which later became the PG Hospital

Zia went to East Pakistan on a short visit and was amazed by the negative attitude of the Bengali middle class towards the military, which consumed a large chunk of the country's resources. The low representation of the Bengalis in the military was largely due to discrimination,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404707055.html |title=Encyclopedia Biography showing discrimination on Bengali's |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=18 February 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140501235929/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404707055.html|archivedate=1 May 2014}}</ref> but Ziaur Rahman felt that the Bengali attitude towards the military perhaps prevented promising young Bengali from seeking military careers. As a Bengali army officer he became a staunch advocate of military careers for Bengali youth. Zia argued that Bengali attitudes would change when they were in a position to share the resources and power of the military which was traditionally enjoyed by West Pakistanis, particularly those from the Punjab and Northwest Frontier provinces.
After serving for two years in Karachi, he was transferred to the East Bengal Regiment in 1957. He attended military training schools in West Germany and UK. He also worked in the military intelligence department from 1959 to 1964.<ref>{{cite web|author=Prof. Sirajul Islam |url=http://www.banglapedia.org/HT/R_0028.HTM |title=Banglapedia Biography showing Ziaur Rahman's working in the military intelligence |publisher=Banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=18 February 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131016040622/http://www.banglapedia.org:80/HT/R_0028.HTM|archivedate=16 October 2013}}</ref>

==Role model for aspiring Bengali army officers==
Ayub Khan's highly successful military rule from 1958 to 1968 further convinced Zia of the need for a fundamental change in the Bengali attitude towards the military. During that period Zia offered a role model for Bengali youth, excelling in his army career.
During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Ziaur Rahman made his mark as a valiant fighter whilst serving in the Khemkaran sector in Punjab as the commander of a company unit of 300–500 soldiers. The sector was the scene of the most intense battles between the rival armies. Zia's unit won one of the highest numbers of gallantry awards for heroic performances. Ziaur Rahman himself won the distinguished and prestigious [[Hilal-i-Jur'at]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncml.page.tl/Hilal_e_Jurat.htm |title=Ziaur Rahman getting Hilal_e_Jurat |publisher=Ncml.page.tl |date= |accessdate=18 February 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140202231047/http://ncml.page.tl/Hilal_e_Jurat.htm|archivedate=2 February 2014}}</ref> (Crescent of Courage) medal, Pakistan’s second highest military award, and his unit won 2 Sitara-e-Jurat (Star of Courage) medals, the third highest military award, and 9 Tamgha-e-Jurat (Medal of Courage) medals, fourth highest award, from the Army for their brave roles in the 1965 War with India.
In 1966, Zia was appointed military instructor at the Pakistan Military Academy, later going on to attend the prestigious Command and Staff College in Quetta, Pakistan, where he completed a course in command and tactical warfare. Advocating that the Pakistan Army make greater efforts to recruit and encourage Bengali military officers, Zia helped raise two Bengali battalions called the 8th and 9th Bengals<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404707055.html |title=Encyclopedia Biography showing Ziaur Rahman raising Bengali regiments |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=18 February 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140501235929/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404707055.html|archivedate=1 May 2014}}</ref> during his stint as instructor.
Around the same time, his wife Khaleda Zia, now 23, gave birth to their first child Tarique Rahman (more popularly known as Tareq Zia, in reminiscent of his father's main name) on 20 November 1967. Very soon Ziaur Rahman, the father, would have to combine his newfound paternal instinct with his military expertise for a longsuffering deprived nation hungry for justice.
Trained for high-ranking command posts, Zia joined the 2nd East Bengal regiment as its second-in-command at Joydebpur in Gazipur district, near Dhaka, in 1969. Although sectarian tensions between East and West Pakistan were intensifying, Zia travelled to West Germany to receive advanced military and command training with the German Army<ref>{{cite web|author=Prof. Sirajul Islam |url=http://www.banglapedia.org/HT/R_0028.HTM |title=Banglapedia Biography showing Ziaur Rahman training with German Army |publisher=Banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=18 February 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131016040622/http://www.banglapedia.org:80/HT/R_0028.HTM|archivedate=16 October 2013}}</ref> and later on spent few months with the British Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangabhaban.gov.bd/ziaur.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130605130743/http://www.bangabhaban.gov.bd/ziaur.html |archivedate=5 June 2013 |title=Bangabhaban Biography showing Ziaur Rahman training with British Army |publisher=Bangabhaban.gov.bd |date= |accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref>

==Pre-liberation==
Zia returned to Pakistan the following year, and witnessed political turmoil and regional division. Upon his return, Zia attained the rank of Major and was transferred in October 1970 to the 8th East Bengal regiment stationed in Chittagong to serve as its second-in-command.<ref>{{cite web|author=Prof. Sirajul Islam |url=http://www.banglapedia.org/HT/R_0028.HTM |title=Banglapedia Biography showing Ziaur Rahman Chittagong posting |publisher=Banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=18 February 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131016040622/http://www.banglapedia.org:80/HT/R_0028.HTM|archivedate=16 October 2013}}</ref>
East Pakistan had been devastated by the 1970 Bhola cyclone, and the population had been embittered by the slow response of the central government. The political conflict between Pakistan's two major parties, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Awami League, and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's PPP.  The 1970 Pakistan Parliamentary elections which [[Maulana Bhasani]] advised Mujib not to call or participate in, the Pakistan Awami League had won a majority. Pakistan President [[Yahya Khan]] and PPP chair [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] had brought sectarian tensions to a climax. Sheikh Mujib laid claim to form a government, but Yahya Khan postponed the convening of the legislature under pressure from Bhutto's party.

==Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971==
Following the failure of last-ditch talks, Yahya Khan declared [[martial law]] and ordered the army to crack down on Bengali political activities and arrested Sheikh Mujib before mid-night 26 March 1971, and taken to Tejgaon International Airport and flown to West Pakistan. Zia who already by then geared to revolt against the government of Pakistan, was preparing to defect, and later arrested and executed his commanding officer Lt. Col. Janjua,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/q71/8459_149567681899197_1975168999_n.jpg |title=Ziaur Rahman killing Col.Janjua |publisher=Books.google.com.bd |date= |accessdate=18 February 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130928020532/http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/q71/8459_149567681899197_1975168999_n.jpg|archivedate=28 September 2013}}</ref>  revolted <ref name="Posted by Admin">{{cite web|author=Admin. |url=http://newsbd71.blogspot.com/2011/03/flames-of-freedom-beginning-of.html |title=Major Ziaur Rahman's revolt with 8 East Bengal Regiment at Chittagong |publisher=Newsbd71.blogspot.com |date=20 March 2011 |accessdate=18 February 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140226194804/http://newsbd71.blogspot.com/2011/03/flames-of-freedom-beginning-of.html |archivedate=26 February 2014 }}</ref> and broadcast the announcement of the Declaration of Independence on the evening hours of 26 March 1971<ref name="Gupta 1974">{{cite book| last = Gupta| first = Jyoti Sen| title = HISTORY OF FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BANGLADESH, 1943-1973 SOME INVOLVEMENT| url = http://books.google.com/?id=DedtAAAAMAAJ| year = 1974| publisher = Naya Prokash }}</ref><ref>[http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/biography/zia.html Virtual Bangladesh Biography showing Ziaur Rahman declaring Independence of Bangladesh the second time with Sheikh Mujib's name] {{Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/biography/zia.html|date =20130509082218}}</ref> from the captured [[Kalurghat]]<ref name="Posted by Admin"/> radio station in Chittagong which read:

On 27 March 1971, a second broadcast was read:
<blockquote>''I, Major Ziaur Rahman, do hereby declare the Independence of Bangladesh in the name of our great leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.''</blockquote>

Later in an interview with German Radio, Ziaur Rahman talked about his March 27th announcement [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtAUbEfi58E (Radio interview)].

Zia organised an infantry unit gathering all Bengali soldiers from military and EPR units in Chittagong. He designated it Sector No. 1 with its HQ in Sabroom. A few weeks later, it was restructured officially under [[Bangladesh Forces]] as the sector in the [[Chittagong and Hill Tracts area]], under General [[M. A. G. Osmani]], the Supreme Commander of [[Bangladesh Forces]], of the Provisional Government of Bangladesh HQ'd at 8 Theatre Road, Calcutta, WB, India. On 30 June 1971 Zia was appointed the commander of the first conventional [[brigade]] of the Bangladesh Forces, which was named "Z Force", after the first initial of his name, followed by K-forces in August and S-force in September, named after Major Khaled Musharraf and Major  Shafiullah respectively. His brigade consisted of 1st, 3rd and 8th East Bengali regiments,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pdfcast.org/images/s/1613/z-force-organogram-1971-bangladesh-liberation-war.jpg |title=Z Force organogram |publisher=Pdfcast.org |date=12 July 2012 |accessdate=18 February 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130930104716/http://pdfcast.org/images/s/1613/z-force-organogram-1971-bangladesh-liberation-war.jpg |archivedate=30 September 2013 }}</ref> enabling Zia to launch major attacks on Pakistani forces.
Having earned a reputation for courageous leadership during the course of the war and reading the declaration of independence of Bangladesh in a critical time, Zia was awarded the [[Bir Uttom]], the second-highest military honour (and the highest for living officers) by the Government of Bangladesh.

==Assassination of Mujib in 1975 and its aftermath==
On 15 August 1975 President [[Mujibur Rahman]] and his family were brutally assassinated at home in a coup staged by a group of military officers and soldiers. One of [[Mujibur Rahman]]'s cabinet ministers and leading conspirator [[Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad]] gained the presidency. He subsequently appointed the then deputy chief of army staff  Major General Ziaur Rahman as the army chief after removal of Major General [[K M Shafiullah]]. However, the coup of 15 August caused a period of instability and unrest in Bangladesh and more so across the ranks and files of the army. Brigadier [[Khaled Mosharraf]] and the 46th Brigade of Dhaka Cantonment under Colonel [[Shafat Jamil]] made a counter-coup on 3 November 1975, and Ziaur Rahman was forced to relingquish his post as Army chief and was put under house arrest. A mutiny was staged by the [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal|JSD]] under retired Lieutenant Colonel [[Abu Taher]] and a group of socialist military officers and supporters of the [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal|National Socialist Party]] on 7 November, called the "[[National Revolution and Solidarity Day]]" (''Sipoy-Janata Biplob'') (Soldiers and People's Coup).<ref name="JSTOR3">{{cite web

Following a major meeting at the army headquarters, an interim government was formed with Justice [[Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem]] as chief martial law administrator and [[Major General]] Ziaur Rahman, [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[M.

Under anxiety that Abu Taher, who had actually planned  to grab power through another organised revolt, Zia ordered his arrest. Following a secret trial in a military court, Zia authorised the execution of Taher on 21 July 1976. Zia became the [[chief martial law administrator]] following Justice Sayem's elevation to the presidency on 19 November 1976. He tried to integrate the armed forces, giving repatriates a status appropriate to their qualifications and seniority. While this angered some veterans of the independence war, who had rapidly reached high positions following independence in 1971, Zia defused potential threats from discontented officers by sending them on diplomatic missions abroad{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

==President of Bangladesh==
[[File:Staff Car Mercedes Benz 4 Cylinder 2000 cc.jpg|thumb|240px|This Mercedes Benz car was used by Ziaur Rahman when he was the chief of army staff of [[Bangladesh Army]].]]
Ziaur Rahman became the 7th [[President of Bangladesh]] on 21 April 1977. Years of disorder from the previous  political administration of the [[Awami League]] and [[BAKSAL]] had left most of Bangladesh's state institutions in disarray, with constant internal and external threats. Assuming full control of the state, Zia lifted martial law and introduced massive reforms for the development of the country.

In late September 1977, a group of [[Japanese Red Army]] terrorists [[Japan Airlines Flight 472|hijacked an airplane and forced it to land in Dhaka]]. On 30 September, while the attention of the government was riveted on this event, a mutiny broke out in Bogra. Although the mutiny was quickly quelled on the night of 2 October, a second mutiny occurred in Dhaka by disgrunteled airmen of [[Bangladesh Air Force|BAF]]. The mutineers unsuccessfully attacked Zia's residence, captured Dhaka Radio for a short time and killed a good number of air force officers and airmen at [[Dhaka International Airport|Tejgaon International Airport]], where they were gathered for negotiations with the hijackers. Wing Commander [[M. Hamidullah Khan]] BP (Sector Commander [[Bangladesh Forces|BDF]] Sector 11), then [[Bangladesh Air Force|BAF Ground Defense Commander]], quickly put down the rebellion within the Air Force, but the government was severely shaken. Chief of Air Staff [[Air vice-marshal|AVM]] AG Mahmud reappointed Wing Commander Hamidullah as [[Provost Marshal]] of [[Bangladesh Air Force]]. Government intelligence had failed and Zia promptly dismissed the DGFI chief, [[Air vice-marshal|AVM]] Aminul Islam Khan [[Bangladesh Air Force|BAF]], of 9th GD formerly of [[PAF]], and also the DG-NSI. Special tribunals dealt harshly with the large groups of bandits, smugglers and guerrilla bands operating across the country.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The size of Bangladesh police forces was doubled and the strength of the army increased from 50,000 to 90,000 soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Prof. Sirajul Islam |url=http://www.banglapedia.org/HT/R_0028.HTM |title=Banglapedia Biography showing Ziaur Rahman strengthening the Army |publisher=Banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=18 February 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131016040622/http://www.banglapedia.org:80/HT/R_0028.HTM|archivedate=16 October 2013}}</ref>

When Ziaur Rahman assumed the presidency, he revived the multiparty system and restored freedom of the press. In 1978 he appointed [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] as the new [[Chief of Army Staff of the Bangladesh Army|Chief of Army Staff]], promoting him to the rank of [[Lieutenant General]]. Viewed as a professional soldier with no political aspirations (because of his imprisonment in former West Pakistan during the Bangladesh War of Independence) who possessed a soft corner for India.

Zia had taken a forward head start charge of a nation suffering from illiteracy, severe poverty, chronic unemployment, shortages and economic stagnation. Mujib initiated state commitment to socialism, following Indira's advice under the Soviet bloc was foregone with. Zia announced a "19-point programme" of economic emancipation which emphasised self-reliance, rural development, decentralisation, free markets and population control.

Directing his campaign to mobilise rural support and development, Zia established ''Gram Sarkar'' (''Village Councils'') system of self-government and the "Village Defence Party" system of security and crime prevention.<!--Was Gram Sarkar motivated by Panchayati Raj or vice versa?--> Programmes to promote primary and adult education on a mass scale were initiated and focused mainly across rural Bangladesh.

Zia began reorienting Bangladesh's foreign policy, addressing the concerns of the mostly staunch rightists coupled with some renegade leftist who believed that Bangladesh was reliant on Indian economic and military aid. Zia withdrew from his predecessors' affinity with the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]], developing closer relations with the United States and Western Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Zia also moved to harmonise ties with [[Saudi Arabia]] and the People's Republic of China, who had opposed Bangladesh's creation and had not recognised it until 1975. Zia moved to normalise relations with Pakistan. While distancing Bangladesh from India, Zia sought to improve ties with other Islamic nations. Zia's move towards Islamic state policies improved the nation's standing in the Middle East.<ref>[http://www.banglapedia.org/HT/R_0028.HTM Banglapedia document Ziaur Rahman relation with Middle East]. {{Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.banglapedia.org/HT/R_0028.HTM|date =20131016040622}}</ref> Zia also proposed an organisation of the nations of South Asia to bolster economic and political co-operation at a regional level.<ref>{{cite web|author=Prof. Sirajul Islam |url=http://www.banglapedia.org/HT/R_0028.HTM |title=Banglapedia document Ziaur Rahman on regional co-operation |publisher=Banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=18 February 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131016040622/http://www.banglapedia.org:80/HT/R_0028.HTM|archivedate=16 October 2013}}</ref> This proposal materialized in 1985 under the Presidency of [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] with the first meeting of the [[South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation]] in Dhaka.

===Islam and nationalism===
Zia moved to lead the nation in a new direction, significantly different from the ideology and agenda of India and Sheikh Mujib.<ref name="countrystudies.us"/> He discovered Bangladesh like never before. He found that the massive section of the population was suffering from an identity crisis, both religious and as a people, with a very limited sense of sovereignty. He issued a proclamation order amending the constitution, under whose basis laws would be set in an effort to increase the self-knowledge of religion and nation. In the preamble, he inserted the salutation ''"Bismillahir-Rahmaanir-Rahim"'' ("In the name of [[Allah]], the Beneficent, the Merciful"). In Article 8(1) and 8(1A) the statement "absolute trust and faith in Almighty Allah"' was added, replacing the socialist religious free commitment to [[secularism]]. Socialism was redefined as "economic and social justice" under his leadership.<ref name="GPSA">{{cite book| last = Charles Kennedy| first = Craig Baxter| title = Governance and Politics in South Asia| url = http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=51259067| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110804233209/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=51259067| archivedate = 4 August 2011| accessdate = 11 July 2006| date = 11 July 2006| publisher = Westview Press| isbn = 978-0-8133-3901-6| page = 238 }}</ref> In Article 25(2), Zia introduced the principle that '"the state shall endeavour to consolidate, preserve and strengthen fraternal relations among Muslim countries based on Islamic solidarity.".<ref>{{cite web|author=Prof. Sirajul Islam |url=http://www.banglapedia.org/HT/R_0028.HTM |title=Banglapedia document-Ziaur Rahman constitution fundamental change for Muslim countries relations |publisher=Banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=18 February 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131016040622/http://www.banglapedia.org:80/HT/R_0028.HTM|archivedate=16 October 2013}}</ref> Zia's edits to the constitution redefined the nature of the republic from the secularism laid out by Sheikh Mujib and his supporters.<ref name="GPSA"/> Later Ershad introduced Islamic religious education as a compulsory subject in Bangladeshi schools, with provisions for non-Muslim students to learn of their own religions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In public speeches and policies that he formulated, Zia began expounding "Bangladesh Nationalism", its "Sovereignty", as opposed to Mujib's assertion of a Bengali identity based under Awami League social policies and membership. Zia emphasised the national role of Islam as guide to life's principle. Claiming to promote an inclusive national identity, Zia reached out to non-Bengali minorities such as the [[Santal]]s, [[Garo (tribe)|Garos]], Manipuris and [[Chakma people|Chakmas]], as well as the [[Urdu]]-speaking peoples of [[Bihar]]i origin. He even amended the constitution to change the nationality of the citizens from [[Bengali people|Bengali]], an ethnic identity, to Bangladeshi, a national identity, under sovereign allegiance not political belief or party affiliation.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
In an effort to promote cultural assimilation and economic development, Zia appointed a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] Development Commission in 1976, but and initiated holding a political dialogue with the representatives of the hill tribes on the issue of autonomy and cultural self-preservation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} On 2 July 1977 Ziaur Rahman organised a tribal convention to promote a dialogue between the government and tribal groups{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

After the formation of Bangladesh Nationalist Party in 1978, Zia took initiative for formation of political institutes and sponsored workshops for the youth to get active political lessons on Bangladesh nationalism. In such a workshop in September 1980, Zia spoke to the learners,<ref>{{cite book |title=Tarique Rahman: Opekkhaye Bangladesh |publisher=Ziaur Rahman Foundation |location=Dhaka |year= 2010 |page=389 |isbn=978-984-760-141-0 |oclc= |author-separator=; |author1 = Ahamed|first1 = Emajuddin]]|last2 = Islam|first2=Majidul |last3=Moohmud |first3=Shaukat]] |last4=Sikder |first4=Abdul Hai |authorlink1=Emajuddin Ahamed |authorlink3=Shaukat Mahmood }}</ref>

===Indemnity===
{{Main|Indemnity Act}}
As Bangladesh's dynamic leader, Zia enacted several controversial measures, some to discipline the army, some to solidify his power and some to win the support of far-right groups including Islamic political parties. However, he took no action against Awami League leaders who were infamous for corruption except ex-President [[Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad]], whom he sent to jail on theft charges. He re-introduced multi-party politics and allowed Sheikh Hasina, the exiled daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to return to Bangladesh in 1981. He also allowed the banned [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh|Jamaat-e-Islami]] leaders to do politics under different party name as Islamic Democratic League (IDL). Zia's, who was a leader in the war for independence, was highly criticized as Jamaat-e-Islami collaborated with the Pakistan army, which committed [[war crime]]s, and was unsuccessful in preventing Bangladesh's independence. [[Golam Azam]], the exiled chief of the Jammat-e-Islami, was allowed to come back and visit his ill mother to Bangladesh in July 1978 with a Pakistan passport on a visitor's visa, and he remained in Bangladesh following its expiry.  No court case was lodged for his trial over his alleged role in committing wartime atrocities. He also facilitated the comeback of other anti-India political entities like Muslim League and other Islamic parties. Zia also reluctantly made highly controversial anti-independence figure [[Shah Azizur Rahman]] (who was earlier released from jail by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1973 <ref>[http://www.prothom-alo.net.nyud.net:8080/V1/archive/news_details_mcat.php?dt=2008-03-26&issue_id=875&cat_id=1&nid=OTA0OTk=&mid=MQ== Sheikh Mujibur Rahman freeing Shah Azizur Rahman] {{Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.prothom-alo.net.nyud.net:8080/V1/archive/news_details_mcat.php?dt=2008-03-26&issue_id=875&cat_id=1&nid=OTA0OTk=&mid=MQ==|date =20130421005011}}</ref>) prime minister after the sudden demise of more suitable candidate Mashiur Rahman Jadu Mia <ref>{{cite web|url=http://jadumia.com/death.htm |title=Mashiur Rahman Jadu Mia death |publisher=Jadumia.com |date=12 March 1979 |accessdate=18 February 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140202100846/http://jadumia.com/death.htm |archivedate=2 February 2014 }}</ref> and gave foreign appointments to several men accused of murdering Sheikh Mujib.

During the tenure of President [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]], the Indemnity Act was incorporated as the 5th amendment to the constitution, legalising the military coups, rule under martial law and other political events between 1975 to 1979. Zia also gave Sheikh Mujib's assassins [[Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|Major Dalim]], [[Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|Major Rashid]], and [[Syed Faruque Rahman|Major Faruk]] jobs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in subsequent years they were appointed ambassadors of Bangladesh to African and Middle Eastern nations.

==Criticism and legacy==
Ziaur Rahman is considered responsible for the turmoil and fall of Bangladesh since independence.<ref name="countrystudies.us"/> President Zia introduced a banana republic in Bangladesh after Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who had envisioned Bangladesh as world super power and who wanted to have a peaceful environment which he believed was in interest of the people of Bangladesh but General Zia legislated the Indemnity Bill, pardoning the subsequently convicted killers of President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman<ref name="akhonsamoy.com"/> in August 1975. Also deeply controversial is Zia's rehabilitation of persons and political groups that had collaborated with the Pakistani army. Zia is also criticised for creating a "magna democracy", which remained largely beholden to his political party.

Zia's martial law decrees, his ascendancy to the presidency in 1977 and the referendum held in 1978 were declared "unknown to the constitution."

Ziaur Rahman is survived by his wife Begum Khaleda Zia and his sons [[Tareq Rahman]] and Arafat Rahman. Begum Khaleda Zia became the head of the BNP and organised a coalition of political parties opposed to Ershad's regime. In elections held in 1991, Begum Khaleda Zia led the BNP to victory and became prime minister. She lost the 1996 elections to the Awami League's [[Sheikh Hasina Wajed]], the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, but returned to power in 2001. Tareq Rahman serves as BNP senior joint secretary, regarded by many as the architect of the BNP's 2001 election victory. Zia has been the namesake of many public institutions, such as formerly the [[Zia International Airport]] in Dhaka, which is the busiest airport in the nation. [[Turkey]] has named an important road in [[Ankara]] as Ziaur Rahman Caddesi after his death to honor him.<ref>https://maps.google.com.bd/maps?q=%C3%87ankaya,+Ziaur+Rahman+Caddesi,+Ankara,+Turkey&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x14d34f88c9791223:0x7889d768f59b3edb,Ziaur+Rahman+Cd,+Ankara,+Turkey&gl=bd&ei=dWa2UrauM82jhgfg44HICQ&ved=0CCkQ8gEwAA</ref>

The '''Mannegishi''' (singular the same) are a race of [[trickster]] people in [[Cree]] [[folklore]], similar in nature to the [[Memegwesi]] of the [[Ojibwa]]. They are described as semi-humanoid, being [[sexdactylous]] humans with very thin and lanky arms and legs and big heads minus a nose. According to one Cree schema of the mythology, there are two humanoid races, one being the familiar [[human]] species and the other being the "little people", i.e. Mannegishi. These people are said to live between rocks in the rapids. One of their biggest delights -- a completely non-heroic form of trickster behavior -- is to crawl out of the rocks and capsize the canoes of people canoeing through the rapids, spinning them to their death. 

The Mannegishi has attracted interest in recent years due to its possible [[cryptozoology|cryptozoological]] connections. It is believed by some that the [[Dover Demon]] represents a modern sighting of the Mannegishi.

'''NCSA HTTPd''' was a [[web server]] originally developed at the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications|NCSA]] by Robert McCool and others.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071020104356/http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/acknowledgement.html NCSA HTTPd Acknowledgements] hosted on the [[Internet Archive]]</ref> It was among the earliest web servers developed, following [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s [[CERN httpd]], Tony Sanders' Plexus server, and some others. It was for some time the natural counterpart to the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] [[web browser]] in the [[client–server]] [[World Wide Web]]. It also introduced the [[Common Gateway Interface]], allowing for the creation of dynamic websites.

When development slowed down, an independent effort, the [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] project, took the codebase and continued; meanwhile, NCSA released one more version (1.5), then ceased development. At the time, NCSA HTTPd powered over 95% of all [[webserver]]s on the [[Internet]]; nearly all of them switched over to Apache.

The NCSA code has since been removed from Apache, as part of a [[Rewrite (programming)|rewrite]].

'''Lanza del Vasto''' (born ''Giuseppe Giovanni Luigi Maria Enrico Lanza di Trabia-Branciforte'' <ref>http://www.geneall.net/W/per_page.php?id=584835</ref>) (September 29, 1901 &ndash; January 5, 1981) was a philosopher, poet, artist, catholic and nonviolent activist.

He was born in [[San Vito dei Normanni]], [[Italy]] and died in [[Elche de la Sierra]], [[Spain]].

A western disciple of [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], he worked for inter-religious dialogue, spiritual renewal, ecological activism and [[nonviolence]].

== Youth in Italy ==
His father, Don Luigi Giuseppe Lanza di Trabia-Branciforte, was Sicilian and his mother, Anne-Marie Henriette Nauts-Oedenkoven,<ref>http://www.geneall.net/W/per_page.php?id=584835</ref> was born in Antwerp, in Belgium. Very early he traveled in Italy and Europe. He entered the University of Pisa in 1922.

== Meeting Gandhi ==
In December 1936, Lanza went to India, joining the movement for Indian independence led by [[Mohandas K. Gandhi|Gandhi]]. He knew of Gandhi through a book by [[Romain Rolland]]. He spent six months with the [[Mahatma]], then in June 1937, went to the source of the [[Ganges]] river in the [[Himalayas]], a famous pilgrimage site. There he saw a vision which told him "Go back and found!"

He then left India and went back to Europe. In 1938, he went to [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]], then in the midst of civil war, to [[Jerusalem]] and [[Bethlehem]], "between two lines of tanks".

He came back to Paris at the time when the [[Second World War]] started. He wrote some books of poetry and in 1943 published the story of his trip to India, ''Return to the Source'', which became a huge success.

== Foundation of the Ark ==
He founded the [[Community of the Ark]] in 1948 which first met with many difficulties. In 1954, he went back to India to participate in nonviolent anti-feudal struggles with [[Vinoba Bhave]].

In 1962 the Community of the Ark settled in Haut-[[Languedoc]], in the south of [[France]], at "La Borie Noble", near [[Lodève]], in a deserted village. After numbering over a hundred members in the 1970s and 1980s, some communities were closed in the 1990s due to conflicts, ageing population (under thirty members) and a lack of interest in their work and lifestyle. Since 2000, groups are present in a few regions of France, in Belgium, Spain, Italy, Equator and Canada.<ref>[http://www.arche-nonviolence.eu/regions.html ''Régions'']  Community of Ark website.</ref>

== Nonviolent struggles ==
In 1957, during the [[Algerian War]], del Vasto started with other well-known people ([[Jacques Pâris de Bollardière|General de Bollardière]], [[François Mauriac]], [[Robert Barrat]], etc.) a movement of protest against torture. He [[fasting|fasted]] for 21 days. In 1958, he demonstrated against the nuclear power plant in [[Marcoule]], France, which produced [[plutonium]] for [[nuclear weapons]].

In 1963, he fasted for 40 days in [[Rome]] during the [[Vatican II|Second Vatican Council]], asking [[Pope John XXIII]] to stand against war - ''"Pour demander au Pape de prendre position contre la guerre."''

In 1965 he was at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina, talking about no-violence during weeks with the students.

[[Image:Lanza muller bolardiere.jpg|thumb|300px|Left to right, Jean-Marie Muller, Lanza del Vasto, Jacques de la Bollardière on the Larzac during the struggle against the military camp extension.]]
In 1972, he supported the farmers of the [[Larzac]] plateau against the [[Fight for the Larzac|extension of a military base]] while fasting for 15 days. In 1974 a community of the Ark settled in the Larzac in a farmhouse bought by the army.

In 1976, he participated in the demonstrations against the building of the [[fast breeder]] reactor [[Superphénix]] at [[Creys-Mépieu|Creys-Malville]], Isère (France).

[[Image:NURBstatic.svg|thumb|250px|A NURBS curve. [[:Image:Spline01.gif|Animated version]]]]
'''Non-uniform rational [[b-spline|basis spline]]''' ('''NURBS''') is a mathematical model commonly used in [[computer graphics]] for generating and representing curves and surfaces. It offers great flexibility and precision for handling both analytic ([[surface]]s defined by common mathematical [[formula]]e) and [[3D modeling|modeled]] shapes. NURBS are commonly used in computer-aided design ([[CAD]]), manufacturing ([[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]]), and engineering ([[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]]) and are part of numerous industry wide standards, such as [[IGES]], [[ISO 10303|STEP]], [[ACIS]], and [[PHIGS]]. NURBS tools are also found in various [[3D computer graphics software|3D modelling]] and [[animation]] software packages.

They can be efficiently handled by  the computer programs and yet allow for easy human interaction. NURBS surfaces are functions of two parameters mapping to a surface in three-dimensional space. The shape of the surface is determined by control points. NURBS surfaces can represent simple geometrical shapes in a compact form. [[T-Spline (mathematics)|T-splines]] and [[subdivision surfaces]] are more suitable for complex organic shapes because they reduce the number of control points twofold in comparison with the NURBS surfaces.

In general, editing NURBS curves and surfaces is highly intuitive and predictable. Control points are always either connected directly to the curve/surface, or act as if they were connected by a rubber band. Depending on the type of user interface, editing can be realized via an element’s control points, which are most obvious and common for [[Bézier curve]]s, or via higher level tools such as spline modeling or hierarchical editing.

== History ==
Before computers, designs were drawn by hand on paper with various [[Technical drawing|drafting tools]]. [[Ruler]]s were used for straight lines, [[Compass (drafting)|compasses]] for circles, and [[protractors]] for angles. But many shapes, such as the [[freeform surface|freeform curve]] of a ship's bow, could not be drawn with these tools. Although such curves could be drawn freehand at the drafting board, shipbuilders often needed a life-size version which could not be done by hand. Such large drawings were done with the help of flexible strips of wood, called splines. The splines were held in place at a number of predetermined points, called "ducks"; between the ducks, the [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the spline material caused the strip to take the shape that minimized the energy of bending, thus creating the smoothest possible shape that fit the constraints. The shape could be tweaked by moving the ducks.<ref name=mactech>{{cite web|last1=Schneider|first1=Philip|title=NURB Curves: A Guide for the Uninitiated|url=http://www.mactech.com/articles/develop/issue_25/schneider.html|website=MACTECH|accessdate=26 September 2014}}</ref>

In 1946, mathematicians started studying the spline shape, and derived the piecewise [[polynomial]] formula known as the [[spline (mathematics)|spline curve]] or spline function. [[Isaac Jacob Schoenberg|I. J. Schoenberg]] gave the spline function its name after its resemblance to the mechanical spline used by draftsmen.<ref>{{cite journal

As computers were introduced into the design process, the physical properties of such splines were investigated so that they could be modelled with mathematical precision and reproduced where needed. Pioneering work was done in [[France]] by [[Renault]] engineer [[Pierre Bézier]], and [[Citroën]]'s physicist and mathematician and [[Paul de Casteljau]]. They worked nearly parallel to each other, but because Bézier published the results of his work, Bézier curves were named after him, while de Casteljau’s name is only known and used for the algorithms.

At first NURBS were only used in the proprietary [[Computer aided design|CAD]] packages of car companies. Later they became part of standard computer graphics packages. 

Real-time, interactive rendering of NURBS curves and surfaces was first made  commercially available on [[Silicon Graphics]] workstations in 1989. In 1993, the first interactive NURBS modeller for PCs, called NöRBS, was developed by CAS Berlin, a small startup company cooperating with the [[Technical University of Berlin]]. Today most professional computer graphics applications available for desktop use offer NURBS technology, which is most often realized by integrating a NURBS engine from a specialized company.

== Continuity ==
{{main|Smooth function}}
A surface under construction, e.g. the hull of a motor yacht, is usually composed of several NURBS surfaces known as ''patches''. These patches should be fitted together in such a way that the boundaries are invisible. This is mathematically expressed by the concept of [[geometric continuity]].

Higher-level tools exist that benefit from the ability of NURBS to create and establish geometric continuity of different levels:
* '''Positional continuity''' (G<sup>0</sup>) holds whenever the end positions of two curves or surfaces coincide.  The curves or surfaces may still meet at an angle, giving rise to a sharp corner or edge and causing broken highlights.
* '''Tangential continuity''' (G¹) requires the end vectors of the curves or surfaces to be parallel and pointing the same way, ruling out sharp edges.  Because highlights falling on a tangentially continuous edge are always continuous and thus look natural, this level of continuity can often be sufficient.
* '''Curvature continuity''' (G²) further requires the end vectors to be of the same length and rate of length change.  Highlights falling on a curvature-continuous edge do not display any change, causing the two surfaces to appear as one.  This can be visually recognized as “perfectly smooth”.  This level of continuity is very useful in the creation of models that require many [[bi-cubic]] patches composing one continuous surface.

Geometric continuity mainly refers to the shape of the resulting surface; since NURBS surfaces are functions, it is also possible to discuss the derivatives of the surface with respect to the parameters. This is known as [[parametric continuity]]. Parametric continuity of a given degree implies geometric continuity of that degree.
 
First- and second-level parametric continuity (C<sup>0</sup> and C¹) are for practical purposes identical to positional and tangential (G<sup>0</sup> and G¹) continuity.  Third-level parametric continuity (C²), however, differs from curvature continuity in that its parameterization is also continuous.  In practice, C² continuity is easier to achieve if uniform B-splines are used.

The definition of C<sup>''n''</sup> continuity requires that the ''n''th derivative of adjacent curves/surfaces (<math>d^n C(u)/du^n</math>) are equal at a joint.<ref>Foley, van Dam, Feiner & Hughes: ''[[Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice]]'', section 11.2, [[Addison-Wesley]] 1996 (2nd ed.).</ref> Note that the (partial) derivatives of curves and surfaces are vectors that have a direction and a magnitude; both should be equal. 

Highlights and reflections can reveal the perfect smoothing, which is otherwise practically impossible to achieve without NURBS surfaces that have at least G² continuity. This same principle is used as one of the surface evaluation methods whereby a [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray-traced]] or [[reflection mapping|reflection-mapped]] image of a surface with white stripes reflecting on it will show even the smallest deviations on a surface or set of surfaces.  This method is derived from car prototyping wherein surface quality is inspected by checking the quality of reflections of a neon-light ceiling on the car surface. This method is also known as "Zebra analysis".

A NURBS curve is defined by its order, a set of weighted control points, and a knot vector.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref>  NURBS curves and surfaces are generalizations of both [[B-spline]]s and [[Bézier curve]]s and surfaces, the primary difference being the weighting of the control points, which makes NURBS curves ''rational'' (non-rational B-splines are a special case of rational B-splines).
By using a two-dimensional grid of control points, NURBS surfaces including planar patches and sections of spheres can be created. These are parametrized with two variables (typically called ''s'' and ''t'' or ''u'' and ''v''). This can be extended to arbitrary dimensions to create NURBS mapping <math>R^n\to R^n</math>.

NURBS curves and surfaces are useful for a number of reasons:
* They are [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under [[affine transformation|affine]] transformations:<ref>David F. Rogers: An Introduction to NURBS with Historical Perspective, section 7.1</ref> operations like rotations and translations can be applied to NURBS curves and surfaces by applying them to their control points.
* They offer one common mathematical form for both standard analytical shapes (e.g., [[conics]]) and free-form shapes.
* They provide the flexibility to design a large variety of shapes.
* They reduce the memory consumption when storing shapes (compared to simpler methods).
* They can be evaluated reasonably quickly by [[numerically stable]] and accurate [[algorithm]]s.

In the next sections, NURBS is discussed in one dimension (curves). It should be noted that all of it can be generalized to two or even more dimensions.

=== Control points ===
[[Image:NURBS 3-D surface.gif|250px|right|thumb|Three-dimensional NURBS surfaces can have complex, organic shapes. Control points influence the directions the surface takes. The outermost square below delineates the X/Y extents of the surface.]]
The control points determine the shape of the curve.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gershenfeld |first=Neil |authorlink=Neil Gershenfeld |year=1999 |page=141 |title=The Nature of Mathematical Modeling |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-57095-6}}</ref> Typically, each point of the curve is computed by taking a [[weighted]] sum of a number of control points. The weight of each point varies according to the governing parameter. For a curve of degree d, the weight of any control point is only nonzero in d+1 intervals of the parameter space. Within those intervals, the weight changes according to a polynomial function (''basis functions'') of degree d. At the boundaries of the intervals, the basis functions go smoothly to zero, the smoothness being determined by the degree of the polynomial.

As an example, the basis function of degree one is a triangle function. It rises from zero to one, then falls to zero again. While it rises, the basis function of the previous control point falls. In that way, the curve interpolates between the two points, and the resulting curve is a polygon, which is [[continuous function|continuous]], but not [[differentiable]] at the interval boundaries, or knots. Higher degree polynomials have correspondingly more continuous derivatives. Note that within the interval the polynomial nature of the basis functions and the linearity of the construction make the curve perfectly smooth, so it is only at the knots that discontinuity can arise.

In many applications the fact that a single control point only influences those intervals where it is active is a highly desirable property, known as '''local support'''. In modeling, it allows the changing of one part of a surface while keeping other parts equal.

Adding more control points allows better approximation to a given curve, although only a certain class of curves can be represented exactly with a finite number of control points. NURBS curves also feature a scalar '''weight''' for each control point. This allows for more control over the shape of the curve without unduly raising the number of control points.  In particular, it adds conic sections like circles and ellipses to the set of curves that can be represented exactly. The term ''rational'' in NURBS refers to these weights.

The control points can have any [[dimensionality]]. One-dimensional points just define a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] function of the parameter. These are typically used in image processing programs to tune the brightness and color curves. Three-dimensional control points are used abundantly in 3D modeling, where they are used in the everyday meaning of the word 'point', a location in 3D space.
Multi-dimensional points might be used to control sets of time-driven values, e.g. the different positional and rotational settings of a robot arm. NURBS surfaces are just an application of this. Each control 'point' is actually a full vector of control points, defining a curve. These curves share their degree and the number of control points, and span one dimension of the parameter space. By interpolating these control vectors over the other dimension of the parameter space, a continuous set of curves is obtained, defining the surface.

=== Knot vector ===
The knot vector is a sequence of parameter values that determines where and how the control points affect the NURBS curve. The number of knots is always equal to the number of control points plus curve degree plus one (i.e. number of control points plus curve order). The knot vector divides the parametric space in the intervals mentioned before, usually referred to as ''knot spans''. Each time the parameter value enters a new knot span, a new control point becomes active, while an old control point is discarded.  
It follows that the values in the knot vector should be in nondecreasing order, so (0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3) is valid while (0, 0, 2, 1, 3, 3) is not.

Consecutive knots can have the same value. This then defines a knot span of zero length, which implies that two control points are activated at the same time (and of course two control points become deactivated). This has impact on continuity of the resulting curve or its higher derivatives; for instance, it allows the creation of corners in an otherwise smooth NURBS curve.
A number of coinciding knots is sometimes referred to as a knot with a certain '''multiplicity'''. Knots with multiplicity two or three are known as double or triple knots. 
The multiplicity of a knot is limited to the degree of the curve; since a higher multiplicity would split the curve into disjoint parts and it would leave control points unused. For first-degree NURBS, each knot is paired with a control point.

The knot vector usually starts with a knot that has multiplicity equal to the order. This makes sense, since this activates the control points that have influence on the first knot span. Similarly, the knot vector usually ends with a knot of that multiplicity.
Curves with such knot vectors start and end in a control point. 

The values of the knots control the mapping between the input parameter and the corresponding NURBS value. For example, if a NURBS describes a path through space over time, the knots control the time that the function proceeds past the control points. For the purposes of representing shapes, however, only the ratios of the difference between the knot values matter; in that case, the knot vectors (0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3) and (0, 0, 2, 4, 6, 6) produce the same curve. The positions of the knot values influences the mapping of parameter space to curve space. Rendering a NURBS curve is usually done by stepping with a fixed stride through the parameter range. By changing the knot span lengths, more sample points can be used in regions where the curvature is high. Another use is in situations where the parameter value has some physical significance, for instance if the parameter is time and the curve describes the motion of a robot arm. The knot span lengths then translate into velocity and acceleration, which are essential to get right to prevent damage to the robot arm or its environment. This flexibility in the mapping is what the phrase ''non uniform'' in NURBS refers to.

Necessary only for internal calculations, knots are usually not helpful to the users of modeling software.  Therefore, many modeling applications do not make the knots editable or even visible. It's usually possible to establish reasonable knot vectors by looking at the variation in the control points. More recent versions of NURBS software (e.g., [[Autodesk Maya]] and [[Rhinoceros 3D]]) allow for interactive editing of knot positions, but this is significantly less intuitive than the editing of control points.

===Comparison of Knots and Control Points===
A common misconception is that each knot is paired with a control point. This is true only for degree 1 NURBS (polylines). In general, the knots break the domain up into knot spans, but each control point corresponds to one basis function which spans a range of (degree+1) knot spans. For example, suppose we have a degree-3 NURBS with 7 control points and knots 0,0,0,1,2,5,8,8,8. The first four control points are grouped with the first six knots. The second through fifth control points are grouped with the knots 0,0,1,2,5,8. The third through sixth control points are grouped with the knots 0,1,2,5,8,8. The last four control points are grouped with the last six knots.

Some modelers that use older algorithms for NURBS evaluation require two extra knot values for a total of (degree+N+1) knots.<ref>{{cite web|title=What are NURBS?|url=http://www.rhino3d.com/nurbs/|publisher=Rhinoceros|accessdate=26 September 2014}}</ref>

=== Order ===
The ''order'' of a NURBS curve defines the number of nearby control points that influence any given point on the curve.  The curve is represented mathematically by a polynomial of degree one less than the order of the curve.  Hence, second-order curves (which are represented by linear polynomials) are called linear curves, third-order curves are called quadratic curves, and fourth-order curves are called cubic curves.  The number of control points must be greater than or equal to the order of the curve. 

In practice, cubic curves are the ones most commonly used.  Fifth- and sixth-order curves are sometimes useful, especially for obtaining continuous higher order derivatives, but curves of higher orders are practically never used because they lead to internal numerical problems and tend to require disproportionately large calculation times.

=== Construction of the basis functions ===
The B-spline basis functions used in the construction of NURBS curves are usually denoted as <math>N_{i,n}(u)</math>, in which <math>i</math> corresponds to the <math>i</math><sup>th</sup>
control point, and <math>n</math> corresponds with the degree of the basis function.<ref name=nurbs-book>{{cite book |last1=Piegl |first1=Les |last2=Tiller |first2=Wayne |title=The NURBS Book|date=1997 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |isbn=3-540-61545-8 |edition=2. ed.}}</ref> The parameter dependence is frequently left out, so we can write <math>N_{i,n}</math>.
The definition of these basis functions is recursive in <math>n</math>. 
The degree-0 functions <math>N_{i,0}</math> are piecewise constant functions. They are one on the corresponding knot span and zero everywhere else.
Effectively, <math>N_{i,n}</math> is a linear interpolation of <math>N_{i,n-1}</math> and <math>N_{i+1,n-1}</math>. The latter two functions are non-zero for
<math>n</math> knot spans, overlapping for <math>n-1</math> knot spans.  The function <math>N_{i,n}</math> is computed as

[[Image:nurbsbasisconstruct.svg|thumb|right|From top to bottom: Linear basis functions <math>N_{1,1}</math> (blue) and <math>N_{2,1}</math> (green) (top), their weight functions <math>f</math> and <math>g</math> (middle) and the resulting quadratic basis function (bottom). The knots are 0, 1, 2, and 2.5]]

: <math>N_{i,n} = f_{i,n} N_{i,n-1} + g_{i+1,n} N_{i+1,n-1}</math>

<math>f_i</math> rises linearly from zero to one on the interval where <math>N_{i,n-1}</math> is non-zero, while <math>g_{i+1}</math> falls from one to zero on the interval where <math>N_{i+1,n-1}</math> is non-zero. As mentioned before, <math>N_{i,1}</math> is a triangular function, nonzero over two knot spans rising from zero to one on the first, and falling to zero on the second knot span. Higher order basis functions are non-zero over corresponding more knot spans and have correspondingly higher degree. If <math>u</math> is the parameter, and <math>k_i</math> is the <math>i</math><sup>th</sup> knot, we can write the functions <math>f</math> and <math>g</math> as

: <math>f_{i,n}(u) = {{u - k_i} \over {k_{i+n} - k_i}}</math>

and

: <math>g_{i,n}(u) = {{k_{i+n} - u} \over {k_{i+n} - k_{i}}}</math>

The functions <math>f</math> and <math>g</math> are positive when the corresponding lower order basis functions are non-zero. By [[mathematical induction|induction]] on n it follows that the basis functions are non-negative for all values of <math>n</math> and <math>u</math>. This makes the computation of the basis functions numerically stable. 

Again by induction, it can be proved that the sum of the basis functions for a particular value of the parameter is unity. This is known as the '''partition of unity''' property of the basis functions.

[[Image:nurbsbasislin2.png|frame|Linear basis functions]]

[[Image:nurbsbasisquad2.png|frame|Quadratic basis functions]]

The figures show the linear and the quadratic basis functions for the knots {..., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, ...}

One knot span is considerably shorter than the others. On that knot span, the peak in the quadratic basis function is more distinct, reaching almost one. Conversely, the adjoining basis functions fall to zero more quickly. In the geometrical interpretation, this means that the curve approaches the corresponding control point closely. In case of a double knot, the length of the knot span becomes zero and the peak reaches one exactly. The basis function is no longer differentiable at that point. The curve will have a sharp corner if the neighbour control points are not collinear.

=== General form of a NURBS curve ===

Using the definitions of the basis functions <math>N_{i,n}</math> from the previous paragraph, a NURBS curve takes the following form:<ref name=nurbs-book/>

: <math>C(u) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} {\frac
	{N_{i,n}w_i}
	{\sum_{j=1}^k N_{j,n}w_j}}
	\bold{P}_i = \frac
	{\sum_{i=1}^k {N_{i,n}w_i \bold{P}_i}}
	{\sum_{i=1}^k {N_{i,n}w_i}}
	</math>

In this, <math>k</math> is the number of control points <math>\bold{P}_i</math> and <math>w_i</math> are the corresponding weights. The denominator is a normalizing factor that evaluates to one if all weights are one. This can be seen from the partition of unity property of the basis functions. It is customary to write this as

: <math>C(u)=\sum_{i=1}^k R_{i,n}(u)\bold{P}_i</math>

in which the functions

: <math>R_{i,n}(u) = {N_{i,n}(u)w_i \over \sum_{j=1}^k N_{j,n}(u)w_j}</math>

are known as the ''rational basis functions''.

=== General form of a NURBS surface ===

A NURBS surface is obtained as the [[tensor product]] of two NURBS curves, thus using two independent parameters <math>u</math> and <math>v</math> (with indices <math>i</math> and <math>j</math> respectively):<ref name=nurbs-book/>

: <math>S(u,v) = \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=1}^l R_{i,j}(u,v) \bold{P}_{i,j} </math>

with 

: <math>R_{i,j}(u,v) = \frac {N_{i,n}(u) N_{j,m}(v) w_{i,j}} {\sum_{p=1}^k \sum_{q=1}^l N_{p,n}(u) N_{q,m}(v) w_{p,q}}</math>

as rational basis functions.

== Manipulating NURBS objects ==
[[Image:motoryacht design i.png|thumb|250px|right|Motoryacht design.]]
A number of transformations can be applied to a NURBS object. For instance, if some curve is defined using a certain degree and N control points, the same curve can be expressed using the same degree and N+1 control points. In the process a number of control points change position and a knot is inserted in the knot vector.
These manipulations are used extensively during interactive design. When adding a control point, the shape of the curve should stay the same, forming the starting point for further adjustments. A number of these operations are discussed below.<ref name=nurbs-book/><ref>L. Piegl, Modifying the shape of rational B-splines. Part 1: curves, Computer-Aided Design, Volume 21, Issue 8, October 1989, Pages 509-518, ISSN 0010-4485, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0010-4485(89)90059-6.</ref>

=== Knot insertion ===
As the term suggests, '''knot insertion''' inserts a knot into the knot vector. If the degree of the curve is <math>n</math>, then <math>n-1</math> control points are replaced by <math>n</math> new ones. The shape of the curve stays the same. 

A knot can be inserted multiple times, up to the maximum multiplicity of the knot. This is sometimes referred to as '''knot refinement''' and can be achieved by an algorithm that is more efficient than repeated knot insertion.

=== Knot removal ===
'''Knot removal''' is the reverse of knot insertion. Its purpose is to remove knots and the associated control points in order to get a more compact representation. Obviously, this is not always possible while retaining the exact shape of the curve. In practice, a tolerance in the accuracy is used to determine whether a knot can be removed. The process is used to clean up after an interactive session in which control points may have been added manually, or after importing
a curve from a different representation, where a straightforward conversion process leads to redundant control points.

=== Degree elevation ===
A NURBS curve of a particular degree can always be represented by a NURBS curve of higher degree. This is frequently used when combining separate NURBS curves,
e.g., when creating a NURBS surface interpolating between a set of NURBS curves or when unifying adjacent curves. In the process, the different curves should be brought to the same degree, usually the maximum degree of the set of curves. The process is known as '''degree elevation'''.

=== Curvature ===
The most important property in [[differential geometry]] is the [[curvature]] <math>\kappa</math>. It describes the local properties (edges, corners, etc.) and relations between the first and second derivative, and thus, the precise curve shape. Having determined the derivatives it is easy to compute <math>\kappa=\frac{|r'(t) \times r''(t)|}{|r'(t)|^3}</math> or approximated as the arclength from the second derivate <math>\kappa=|r''(s_o)|</math>. The direct computation of the curvature <math>\kappa</math> with these equations is the big advantage of parameterized curves against their polygonal representations.

== Example: a circle ==
[[File:NURBS-circle-3D.png|thumb|250px|NURBS have the ability to exactly describe circles. Here, the black triangle is the control polygon of a NURBS curve (shown at w=1). The Blue dotted line shows the corresponding control polygon of a B-spline curve in 3D [[homogeneous coordinates]], formed by multiplying the NURBS by the control points by the corresponding weights. The blue parabolas are the corresponding B-spline curve in 3D, consisting of three parabolas. By choosing the NURBS control points and weights, the parabolas are parallel to the opposite face of the gray cone (with its tip at the 3D origin), so dividing by ''w'' to project the parabolas onto the ''w''=1 plane results in circular arcs (red circle; see [[conic section]]).]]
Non-rational splines or [[Bézier curve]]s may approximate a circle, but they cannot represent it exactly. Rational splines can represent any conic section, including the circle, exactly. This representation is not unique, but one possibility appears below:
<center>
{|class="wikitable"
!style="width:6em;"| ''x''
!style="width:6em;"| ''y''
!style="width:6em;"| ''z''

</center>

The order is three, since a circle is a quadratic curve and the spline's order is one more than the degree of its piecewise polynomial segments. The knot vector is <math>\{0, 0, 0, \pi/2, \pi/2, \pi, \pi, 3\pi/2, 3\pi/2, 2\pi, 2\pi, 2\pi\}\,</math>. The circle is composed of four quarter circles, tied together with double knots. Although double knots in a third order NURBS curve would normally result in loss of continuity in the first derivative, the control points are positioned in such a way that the first derivative is continuous. In fact, the curve is infinitely differentiable everywhere, as it must be if it exactly represents a circle.

The curve represents a circle exactly, but it is not exactly parametrized in the circle's arc length. This means, for example, that the point at <math>t</math> does not lie at <math>(\sin(t), \cos(t))</math> (except for the start, middle and end point of each quarter circle, since the representation is symmetrical). This would be impossible, since the ''x'' coordinate of the circle would provide an exact rational polynomial expression for <math>\cos(t)</math>, which is impossible. The circle does make one full revolution as its parameter <math>t</math> goes from 0 to <math>2\pi</math>, but this is only because the knot vector was arbitrarily chosen as multiples of <math>\pi/2</math>.

==Life==

He was a freedman, and his [[manumitter]] has been identified with Verrius Flaccus, an authority on pontifical law; but for chronological reasons the name of Veranius Flaccus, a writer on augury, has been suggested (Teuffel-Schwabe, ''Hist. of Roman Lit.'' 199, 4). He gained such a reputation by his methods of instruction that he was summoned to court to bring up [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]] and [[Lucius Caesar|Lucius]], the grandsons of Augustus. He removed there with his whole school, and his salary was greatly increased on the condition that he took no fresh pupils. He died at an advanced age during the reign of Tiberius ([[Suetonius' minor works|Suetonius]], ''De Grammaticis'', 17), and a statue in his honour was erected at [[Praeneste]], in a marble recess, with inscriptions from his ''[[Fasti]]''.

==Works==

Flaccus was also a distinguished philologist and antiquarian investigator. For his most important work (''De Verborum Significatu'') see [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]]. Of the calendar of Roman festivals (''[[Fasti Praenestini]]'') engraved on marble and set up in the forum at [[Praeneste]], some fragments were discovered (1771) at some distance from the town itself in a Christian building of later date, and some consular ''fasti'' in the forum itself (1778). The collection was subsequently increased by two new fragments.

Other lost works of Flaccus include:
*''De Orthographia: De Obscuris Catonis'', an elucidation of obscurities in the writings of [[Cato the Elder]]
*''Saturnus'', dealing with questions of Roman ritual
*''Rerum memoria dignarum libri'', an encyclopaedic work much used by [[Pliny the Elder]]
*''Res Etruscae'', probably on [[augury]].

The '''''Daily Star''''' is a popular daily [[tabloid newspaper]] published in the United Kingdom. It first published on 2 November 1978, and was the first new national paper to be launched since the ''[[Daily Worker]]'' in 1930 (now the ''[[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|Morning Star]]''). For many years it published Monday to Saturday but on 15 September 2002 a sister Sunday edition, the ''[[Daily Star Sunday]]'', was launched with a separate staff. On 31 October 2009 the paper published its 10,000th issue.

The paper was launched from Manchester and initially circulated only in the North and Midlands. It was conceived by the then-owners of Express Newspapers, Trafalgar House, to take on the strength of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' in the north. It was also intended to utilise the under-capacity of the [[Great Ancoats Street]] presses in Manchester as the ''[[Daily Express]]'' was losing circulation. The ''Daily Star'' sold out its first night print of 1,400,000. Its cover price has decreased over the years in order to compete with its rival ''The Sun''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/markets/article-23842174-red-top-papers-prepare-for-marketing-war.do |title=Red-top papers prepare for marketing war |publisher= |accessdate=7 June 2010}}</ref>

The ''Daily Star'' is published by [[Express Newspapers]], which also publishes the ''Daily Express'' and ''Sunday Express''. The group is now owned by [[Richard Desmond]]'s [[Northern and Shell]] company. The paper predominantly focuses on stories largely revolving around celebrities, sport, and news and [[gossip]] about popular television programmes, such as soap operas and reality TV shows.

Its editor is [[Dawn Neesom]]. She was promoted to the post in December 2003 after the previous editor, [[Peter Hill (journalist)|Peter Hill]], moved to become editor of the ''Daily Express''. Previously she had been an executive on the paper in charge of the features department.

==Regular features==
The newspaper features a photograph of a [[toplessness|topless]] model on weekdays (in a similar vein to ''The Sun'''s [[Page Three girl|Page 3]] feature) and has discovered some well known models, most notably [[Rachel Ter Horst]] in 1993, and [[Lucy Pinder]] on a [[Bournemouth]] beach in Summer 2003. Such models as [[Cherry Dee]] and [[Michelle Marsh (model)|Michelle Marsh]] have also appeared on their page 3. These women are known in the paper as "Star Babes". The paper's glamour photographer is [[Jeany Savage]].

Other regular features in the ''Daily Star'' include '''Goss''' a daily gossip column edited by Edward Dyson see [[The Goss Girls]], "[[Playlist]]", a daily music news column edited by [[Kim Dawson]], "Star TV", a television news column edited by Peter Dyke and Katie Begley, Mike Ward's weekly TV review page and "Forum", a daily page devoted to readers' [[SMS language|text messages]], which are apparently printed verbatim. Opinion columns by [[Dominik Diamond]] and [[Vanessa Feltz]] were discontinued in 2008. Until his death in 2012, the chief football writer was [[Brian Woolnough]], lured from ''The Sun'' in 2001 for a £200,000 pay packet.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/desmond-gets-his-chequebook-out-for-the-lads-702635.html|title=Desmond gets his chequebook out for the lads|author=David Lister|work=The Independent |location=UK |date=16 January 2001|accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref>

The paper's [[editorial|leader column]], entitled "The Daily Star Says", appears most days on Page 6.

==Controversies==

===Jeffrey Archer===
In 1987, the newspaper lost a high profile [[libel]] action brought by [[Jeffrey Archer]], leading to an award of £500,000 in damages, over allegations of Archer's involvement with a prostitute, [[Monica Coghlan]]. The editor of the ''Daily Star'', [[Lloyd Turner (journalist)|Lloyd Turner]], was sacked six weeks after the trial. However the newspaper always stood by its story, and on 19 July 2001 Archer was found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice at the 1987 trial and was sentenced to a total of four years' imprisonment. The paper later launched a bid to reclaim £2.2m – the original payout plus interest and damages.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Adam Raphael | first=Adam | last=Raphael | title=My Learned Friends: an Insider's View of the Jeffrey Archer Case and Other Notorious Actions | isbn=978-1-85227-094-0 | year=1989 }}</ref>

===Hillsborough disaster===
On 18 April 1989, three days after the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in which 96 [[Liverpool F.C.]] fans were fatally injured at an [[FA Cup]] semi-final game, the ''Daily Star'' ran the front page headline ''Dead Fans Robbed By Drunk Thugs'', alleging that Liverpool fans had stolen from fans injured or killed in the tragedy. These allegations, along with claims that fans had also attacked police officers aiding the injured, were published in several other newspapers, though it was the content of a front page article by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' on 19 April which caused the most controversy. A later inquiry showed all of the claims made were false.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contrast.org/hillsborough/history/media.shtm |title=The Immediate Aftermath – The Media Reaction – Hillsborough Football Disaster |publisher=Contrast.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref>

===Madeleine McCann===
Both the ''Daily Star'' and its Sunday equivalent, as well as its stablemates the ''[[Daily Express]]'' and ''[[Sunday Express]]'', featured heavy coverage of the [[disappearance of Madeleine McCann]] in May 2007. In 2008 the McCann family sued the ''Star'' and ''Express'' for [[libel]]. The action concerned more than 100 stories across the ''Daily Express'', ''Daily Star'' and their Sunday equivalents, which accused the McCanns of involvement in their daughter's disappearance. The newspapers' coverage was regarded by the McCanns as grossly defamatory. In a settlement at the [[High Court of Justice]], the newspapers agreed to run a front-page apology to the McCanns on 19 March 2008, publish another apology on the front pages of the Sunday editions on 23 March and make a statement of apology at the High Court. They also agreed to pay costs and substantial damages, which the McCanns plan to use to aid their search for their daughter.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7303801.stm | title=Damages due over McCann stories |publisher=BBC News  | date=18 March 2008}}</ref> In its apology, the ''Daily Star'' apologised for printing "stories suggesting the couple were responsible for, or may be responsible for, the death of their daughter Madeleine and for covering it up" and stated that "We now recognise that such a suggestion is absolutely untrue and that Kate and Gerry are completely innocent of any involvement in their daughter's disappearance."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/32577/Kate-Gerry-McCann-Sorry/ | title=Kate & Gerry McCann: Sorry | publisher=Daily Star | date=19 March 2008}}</ref>

===Volcanic ash front page===
On 21 April 2010, in the [[aftermath of the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption]], the ''Star'' splashed a computer-generated image on its front page of 1982's [[British Airways Flight 9]], which encountered [[volcanic ash]] and suffered the temporary loss of all engines. The image, taken from a documentary, was accompanied by a headline "Terror as plane hits ash cloud", without any indication on the front page that the image and event was a historical one.<ref>The lead stated: "Exclusive: This is the moment a British Airways jumbo jet hit a cloud of volcanic ash at 37,000ft. Yet last night all UK airports finally reopened, in spite of the ash cloud." The full story was published on page six. See: "{{cite news | author=Wall, Emma | title = Drama as airlines fly again | work=Daily Star | date = 21 April 2010 | page = 6 | url = http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/131706/PLANE-HITS-ASH-CLOUD/ | accessdate =13 May 2010}}</ref> The splash, on the first day that flights restarted after a six-day closure of UK airspace due to volcanic ash, led to the removal of the paper from newsagents at some UK airports.<ref>{{cite news | author=Plunkett, John | title = Daily Star pulled from airports over volcano ash splash | work=The Guardian | date = 21 April 2010 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/apr/21/airports-pull-daily-star | accessdate =13 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref>

===''Grand Theft Auto Rothbury''===
On 21 July 2010, the paper ran a story<ref>http://www.mcvuk.com/static/images/assets/565/1055_DailyStar_GTARothbury.jpg</ref> by [[Jerry Lawton]] claiming that [[Rockstar Games]] was planning an instalment of their [[Grand Theft Auto (series)|''Grand Theft Auto'']] series of video games based around the then-recent shootings carried out by [[Raoul Moat]]. Amid outcry at the inaccuracy of the story, an apology was published by the paper on 24 July<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/145880/Rockstar-Games-Grand-Theft-Auto-An-apology |title= Rockstar Games – Grand Theft Auto – An apology |publisher=Daily Star |date=26 July 2010 |accessdate=22 October 2010}}</ref> for making no attempt to verify the truth of any of their claims, publishing what they claimed to be the cover, criticising Rockstar for their alleged plans without questioning the likelihood, making no attempt to contact Rockstar before publishing, and obtaining statements from a grieving relative of one of Moat's victims. The paper claimed to have paid "substantial" damages to Rockstar as a result, which Rockstar donated to charity.

Prior to the paper's apology, Lawton defended his story on his Facebook page, claiming to be "baffled by the fury of adult gamers", describing them as "grown (?!?) men who sit around all day playing computer games with one another". He then added "Think I'll challenge them to a virtual reality duel....stab....I win!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/40124/Journalist-defends-GTA-Raoul-Moat-story |title=Journalist defends GTA: Raoul Moat story &#124; Games Industry &#124; MCV |publisher=Mcvuk.com |accessdate=22 October 2010}}</ref>

===Resignation by Richard Peppiatt===
In March 2011, a journalist named [[Richard Peppiatt]] resigned from the ''Daily Star'' with an open letter to Richard Desmond.  In the letter, Peppiatt accused the ''Star'' of demonising Muslims, supporting the [[English Defence League]] (EDL),  fabricating stories, ignoring foreign news and paying low wages to staff.  The ''Daily Star'' said in its defence that Peppiatt was only a "casual reporter" and that he bore resentment over being denied promotion.  It also denied that it supported the EDL or that it was anti-Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/mar/04/daily-star-reporter-letter-full |title=Richard Peppiatt's letter to Daily Star proprietor Richard Desmond |publisher=The Guardian |date=4 March 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2013}}</ref>

*1987: [[Mike Gabbert]]. He was brought in to take the paper downmarket, which he did, briefly including content from the ''[[Sunday Sport]]'' under the name ''Daily Star Sport'' (this was before the ''[[Daily Sport]]'' launched). He had a very short tenure as circulation dropped dramatically. He was the journalist who had exposed the Sheffield Wednesday trio of [[Peter Swan (footballer born 1936)|Peter Swan]], [[David Layne]] and [[Tony Kay]] for [[1964 British betting scandal|match fixing]] in the 1960s.

==Political allegiance==
Although some of its headlines and stories could be considered 'reactionary' and [[traditionalist]], the ''Daily Star'' has limited articles on politics, and has rarely shown clear support for any specific party or leader.  However, in the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], the newspaper printed several articles which hinted that it wanted to see [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Gordon Brown]] voted out of power, while at the same time offering no explicit support for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] or their leader [[David Cameron]].  (The latter ultimately became Prime Minister following the formation of a new [[coalition]] government with the [[Liberal Democrats]] when his party failed to gain a majority in Parliament.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supanet.com/business--money/which-political-parties-do-the-newspapers-support--25923p1.html |title=Which political parties do the newspapers support? – Business & Money |publisher=Supanet.com |accessdate=22 October 2010}}</ref>

'''Ezzo''' ({{circa|955}} – 21 March 1034), sometimes called '''Ehrenfried''', [[Count Palatine]] of [[Lotharingia]] of the [[Ezzonen]] dynasty, brother-in-law of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]], father of Queen [[Richeza]] of Poland and many other illustrious children, is undoubtedly one of the most important figures of the Rhenish History of his time.

==Life==
Ezzo was the son of [[Herman I (count palatine)|Herman I]], [[Count Palatine]] of [[Lotharingia]]. Born around 955, he was sent as a child to be educated by his relative, Bishop [[Ulrich of Augsburg]] (episcopate 923–973). Nothing is known about his youth.

Having married [[Matilda of Germany (979–1025)|Matilda of Germany]] (died 1025), a daughter of Emperor [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] and [[Theophanu]], Ezzo became prominent during the reign of his brother-in-law, Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]].  The marriage was expressly consented by the Dowager Empress [[Theophanu]], probably to rally the powerful family of Ezzo to the throne. [[Matilda of Germany (979–1025)|Matilda]] received as dowry out of Ottonian possessions lands in [[Thuringia]] and [[Franconia]] (the East Frankish territories of [[Coburg]], [[Salz]] and [[Orlamünde]]), while her husband gave her as dowry the family estate of [[Brauweiler]]. At the death of his father in 996, [[Herman I (count palatine)|Herman I]]'s rich allodial property was shared between his sons. Ezzo received lands in the Moselle, in Maifeld, the Flamersheimer Wald and the Tomburg as well as half the usufruct of Villewaldin. About the same time, he must have received the Palatinate and previous countal rights, as he is referred as Count in [[Auelgau]] in 1015 and as [[Count Palatine]] in [[Bonngau]] in 1020. He also received the county of [[Ruhrgau]] with tutelage of the Abbey of [[Essen]].

Unsuccessful candidate to the imperial throne at the death of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]], his relation with the new [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] was immediately very tensed. [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] disputed Ezzo's ownership of territories, that Ezzo defended as his wife's inheritance of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]. The conflict dragged on for years, reached its peak in 1011. Facing disturbances in Lotharingia, and in need for Ezzo's military support, the emperor was forced to come to terms. Ezzo's victory led to Henry II to make concessions and to a complete transformation of its policy. He reconciled with Ezzo, recognized its rights of inheritance and gave him the royal territories of Kaiserswerth, Duisburg and Saalfeld for renouncing to the throne. He also associated the Palatine dynasty to his Eastern policies, and mediated the marriage of Ezzo's daughter Richeza with the heir to the Polish Duke Mieszko II.

[[File:Brauweiler Abtei 1925.jpg|thumb|The Abbey of Brauweiler was founded by Ezzo in 1024.]]
These huge territorial concessions made Ezzo the most powerful man in the Empire, after the Emperor. Ezzo's growing power and the increased prestige of his house were reflected in the founding of the family [[Brauweiler Abbey]] near Cologne, the place where his marriage had been celebrated, whose construction begun after a trip to [[Rome]] of the couple in 1024. The monastery, which was consecrated in 1028 by Piligrim, archbishop of Cologne, was to be the grave and spiritual center of Palatine dynasty. The first member of the family buried there was Ezzo' wife [[Matilda of Germany (979–1025)|Matilda]], who died on 4 November 1025.

Very little is known about Ezzo's later life, but we are told that he died at a great age at Saalfeld on 21 March 1034, and was buried in [[Brauweiler Abbey|Brauweiler]].

Ezzo has been quite an impressive personality, even if the reporting on his life and offices, described by the glorifying author of "Fundatio monasterii Brunwilarensis" may be exaggerated. He was mostly active in political affairs when it came to his own interests and the standing of his house, and where he could increase his territories and authority. His dexterous management of the favours of Empress Theophano, Emperor Otto III and later Henry II, testify of his personal ambition and political dexterity.

==Children==
[[File:Mechtila dceraOty2 syni.jpg|thumb|right]]
Ezzo and Mathilda left three sons and seven daughters. The first two sons, [[Liudolf of Lotharingia|Liudolf]] and [[Otto II, Duke of Swabia|Otto]] were aimed at perpetuating the dynasty while the third [[Hermann II, Archbishop of Cologne|Hermann]], was raised to enter the clergy. Of the seven daughters only Richeza was conspicuously married, while the others were placed in monasteries of which they all became abbesses.

'''Gerbrand van den Eeckhout''' (August 19, 1621 &ndash; September 29,<ref>[https://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/archieven/archiefbank/indexen/begraafregisters_voor_1811/zoek/query.nl.pl?i1=1&v1=ger*&a1=eeck*&i2=3&u2=s&x=12&z=b City Archive Amsterdam]</ref><ref>Liedtke, W. (2007) Dutch Paintings in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 185.</ref> 1674), was a [[Dutch Golden Age]] [[Painting|painter]] and a favourite student of [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]]. He was also an etcher, an amateur poet, a collector and an adviser on art.

==Biography==
[[Image:Gerbrand van den Eeckhout - Vision of Cornelius the Centurion - Walters 372492.jpg|left|thumb|In this painting (dated 1664) an angel appears to the Roman [[centurion]] [[Cornelius the Centurion|Cornelius]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]
 |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/32288
 |title= Vision of Cornelius the Centurion}}</ref> The Walters Art Museum.]]

Gerbrand was born in [[Amsterdam]], the son of a jeweller, a [[Mennonite]] who fled after 1585 from [[Antwerp]] to the north. In 1631 his mother died. His father's second wife was Cornelia Dedel, the daughter of a founder of the [[Delft]] chamber of the [[Dutch East India Company]].

[[Arnold Houbraken]] records Van den Eeckhout was a pupil of [[Rembrandt]]. A fellow pupil to [[Ferdinand Bol]], [[Nicolaes Maes]] and [[Govert Flinck]],  be regarded as inferior to them in skill and experience; he soon assumed Rembrandt's manner with such success that his pictures were confused with those of his master.

Eeckhout does not merely copy the subjects; he also takes the shapes, the figures, the [[Jew]]ish dress and the pictorial effects of his master. It is difficult to form an exact judgment of Eeckhout's qualities at the outset of his career. His earliest pieces are probably those in which he more faithfully reproduced Rembrandt's peculiarities. Exclusively his is a tinge of green in shadows marring the harmony of the work, a gaudiness of jarring tints, uniform surface and a touch more quick than subtle.

Eeckhout matriculated early in the [[Guild|Gild]] of Amsterdam. As he grew older Eeckhout succeeded best in [[portraits]], for example that of the historian [[Olfert Dapper]] (1669), in the [[Städel]] collection in Frankfurt. Eeckhout occasionally varied his style. He followed [[Gerard ter Borch]] in ''Gambling Soldiers'', at [[Stafford House]], and a ''Soldiers' Merrymaking'', in the collection of the [[marquess of Bute]]. Amongst the best of Eeckhout's works are ''Christ in the Temple'' (1662), at [[Munich]], and the ''Haman and Mordecai'' of 1665, at [[Luton House]].

Eeckhout, unmarried, was also appreciated as art connoisseur, and dealing with poets and scientists. At the end of his life he was living with his sister-in-law, a widow, on [[Herengracht]], at a very prestigious part of the canal.  He died in Amsterdam.

'''Govert''' (or '''Govaert''') '''Teuniszoon Flinck''' (25 January 1615{{spaced ndash}}2 February 1660) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Painting|painter]] of the [[Dutch Golden Age]].

==Life==
Born at [[Kleve]], capital of the [[Duchy of Cleves]], which was occupied at the time by the United Provinces, he was apprenticed by his father to a silk [[Mercery|mercer]], but having secretly acquired a passion for etching and drawing, was sent to [[Leeuwarden]], where he boarded in the house of [[Lambert Jacobsz]]oon, a [[Mennonite]], better known as an itinerant preacher than as a painter.

Here Flinck was joined by [[Jacob Adriaensz Backer|Jacob Backer]], and the companionship of a youth determined like himself to be an artist only confirmed his passion for painting. Amongst the neighbours of Jacobszon at Leeuwarden were the sons and relations of [[Rombertus van Uylenburgh]], whose daughter [[Saskia van Uylenburg|Saskia]] married [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]] in 1634. Other members of the same family lived at [[Amsterdam]], cultivating the arts either professionally or as amateurs. The pupils of Lambert probably gained some knowledge of Rembrandt by intercourse with the Ulenburgs. Certainly [[Joachim von Sandrart]], who visited Holland in 1637, found Flinck acknowledged as one of Rembrandt's best pupils, and living habitually in the house of the dealer [[Hendrick van Uylenburgh]] at Amsterdam.

For many years Flinck laboured on the lines of Rembrandt, following that master's style in all the works which he executed between 1636 and 1648. With aspirations as a [[History painting|history painter]], however, he looked to the swelling forms and grand action of [[Peter Paul Rubens]], which led to many commissions for official and diplomatic painting. Flinck's relations with Cleves became in time very important. He was introduced to the court of the [[prince-elector|Great Elector]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg]], who possessed the Duchy and who married in 1646 [[Louise Henriette of Orange-Nassau|Louisa of Orange]]. He obtained the patronage of [[John Maurice of Nassau]], who was made stadtholder of Cleves in 1649.

In 1652 a citizen of Amsterdam, Flinck married in 1656 an heiress, Sophie van der Houven, daughter of a director of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. Flinck was already well known in the patrician circles over which the brothers [[Cornelis de Graeff|Cornelis]] and [[Andries de Graeff]] and the alderman [[Jan Six]] presided; he was on terms of intimacy with the poet [[Joost van den Vondel]] and the treasurer Johannes Uitenbogaard. In his house, adorned with casts after the Antique, costumes, and a noble collection of prints, he often received the [[stadtholder]] John Maurice, whose portrait is still preserved in the work of the learned [[Caspar Barlaeus]]. Flinck died in Amsterdam on February 2, 1660.

[[Image:Isaac Blessing Jacob - Govert Flinck.jpg|thumb|250px|''Blessing of Jacob''  (1638)]]

The earliest of Flinck's authentic pieces is a [[portrait]] of a lady, dated 1636, in the gallery of [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]. His first subject picture is the ''Blessing of Jacob''  (1638), in the [[Rijksmuseum]] Amsterdam. Both are thoroughly Rembrandtesque in effect as well as in vigour of touch and warmth of flesh tints. The four ''civic guards'' of 1642, and ''the twelve musketeers'' with their president in an arm-chair (1648); in the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Stadhuis, Amsterdam]], are fine specimens of composed portrait groups. But the best of Flinck's productions in this style is the ''[[peace of Münster]]'' in the Rijksmuseum, a canvas with 19 life-size figures full of animation in the faces, "radiant with Rembrandtesque colour," and admirably distributed. Flinck here painted his own likeness to the left in a doorway. The mannered period of Flinck is amply illustrated in the ''[[Manius Curius Dentatus]] eating Turnips before the Samnite Envoys'', and ''[[Solomon]] receiving Wisdom'', in the [[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|Palace on the Dam]] at Amsterdam. Here it is that Flinck shows most defects, being faulty in arrangement, gaudy in tint, flat and shallow in execution, that looks as if it had been smeared with violet powder and rouge.

The chronology of Flinck's works, so far as they are seen in public galleries, comprises, in addition to the foregoing, the ''Grey Beard'' of 1639 at [[Dresden]], ''[[A Young Archer]]'' from 1640 in the [[Wallace Collection]], the ''Girl'' of 1641 at the [[Louvre]], a portrait group of a male and female (1646) at [[Rotterdam]], a lady (1651) at [[Berlin]].

In November 1659 the burgomaster of Amsterdam contracted with Flinck for 12 canvases to represent four heroic figures of [[David]] and [[Samson]] and [[Manius Curius Dentatus]] and [[Horatius Cocles]], and scenes from the [[Batavians]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Flinck was unable to finish more than the sketches.  After his death [[Rembrandt]] was asked to fill one of the commissions, and produced his last great history picture, the ''Conspriracy of Claudius Civilis'', which the authorities rejected.<ref>[[Kenneth Clark|Clark, Kenneth]], ''An Introduction to Rembrandt'',pp. 60-61, 1978, London, John Murray/Readers Union, 1978</ref>

In the same year he received a flattering acknowledgment from the town council of Cleves and the completion of a picture of Solomon which was a counterpart of the composition at Amsterdam. This and other pictures and portraits, such as those of Friedrich Wilhelm and [[Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen|John Maurice]], and the [[allegory]] of ''Louisa of Orange attended by Victory and Fame'' and other figures at the cradle of the first-born son of the elector, have disappeared{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. Of several pictures which were painted for the Great Elector, none are preserved except the ''Expulsion of [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]]'' in the Berlin museum.

'''John Maurice of Nassau''' (Dutch: ''Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen'', German: ''Johann Moritz von Nassau-Siegen'', Portuguese: ''João Maurício de Nassau-Siegen'', 17 June 1604 – 20 December 1679) was count and (from 1674) prince of [[Nassau-Siegen]], and Grand Master of the [[Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)]].

==Early years in Europe==
He was born in [[Dillenburg]]. His father was [[John VII, Count of Nassau|John VII of Nassau]]; his grandfather [[John VI of Nassau-Dillenburg|John VI of Nassau]], the younger brother of Dutch [[stadtholder]] [[William the Silent|William the Silent of Orange]].

John Maurice joined the Dutch army in 1621, at a very early age. He distinguished himself in the campaigns of his cousin, the stadtholder [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange]]. In 1626 he became captain. He was involved in 1629 in the capture of [[Den Bosch]]. In 1636, he conquered a fortress at [[Siege of Schenkenschans|Schenkenschans]].

== Dutch governor in Brazil ==
[[File:Brasão de armas do Príncipe Maurício de Nassau-Siegen.svg|thumb|180px|left|Arms of John Maurice of Nassau, imposed upon the cross of the [[Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)|''Johanniterorden'']] and encircled by the Danish Order of the Elephant.]]
He was appointed as the governor of the Dutch possessions in [[Brazil]] in 1636 by the [[Dutch West India Company]] on recommendation of Frederick Henry. He landed at [[Recife]], the port of [[Pernambuco]] and the chief stronghold of the Dutch, in January 1637.

By a series of successful expeditions, he gradually extended the Dutch possessions from [[Sergipe]] on the south to [[São Luís de Maranhão]] in the north.  With the assistance of the famous architect, [[Pieter Post]] of [[Haarlem]], he transformed Recife by building a new town adorned with splendid public edifices and gardens, which was called after his name, Mauritsstad.

[[File:Brasão de armas de Maurício de Nassau.JPG|thumb|right|Brazilian depiction of arms of Johan Maurits]]
By his statesmanlike policy he brought the colony into a most flourishing condition. His leadership in Brazil inspired two Latin epics from 1647: [[Caspar Barlaeus|Caspar Barlaeus']] ''Rerum per octennium in Brasilia et alibi nuper gestarum sub praefectura''<ref>[http://www.s4ulanguages.com/71.html Facsimile of 1647 first edition]</ref> and [[Franciscus Plante|Franciscus Plante's]] ''Mauritias''. The painters [[Albert Eckhout]], [[Frans Post]], and [[Abraham Willaerts]] served as members of John Maurice's entourage.

In 1643 in Johan Maurits equipped the expedition of [[Hendrik Brouwer]] that [[Dutch expedition to Valdivia|attempted to establish an outpost]] in southern Chile.<ref name=Kock>Robbert Kock [http://www.colonialvoyage.com/dutchchile.html The Dutch in Chili] at coloniavoyage.com</ref><ref name=Kris>Kris E. Lane [http://books.google.com/books?id=893J8RTsKjgC Pillaging the Empire: Piracy in the Americas, 1500-1750], 1998, pages 88-92</ref>

He also established representative councils in the colony for local government, and developed [[Recife]]'s transportation infrastructure. His large schemes and lavish expenditure alarmed the parsimonious directors of the West India Company, and John Maurice, refusing to retain his post unless he were given a free hand, returned to Europe in July 1644.

== Return to Europe ==
[[File:Johanmaurits.JPG|thumb|200px|left|John Maurice of Nassau]]
He was shortly afterwards appointed by Frederick Henry to the command of the cavalry in the Dutch army, and he took part in the campaigns of 1645 and 1646. When the war was ended by the [[Peace of Münster]] in January 1648, he accepted from the [[prince-elector|elector]] of [[Brandenburg]] the post of governor of [[Duchy of Cleves|Cleves]], [[Mark (county)|Mark]] and [[County of Ravensberg|Ravensberg]], and later also of [[Principality of Minden|Minden]]. His success in the [[Rhineland]] was as great as it had been in Brazil, and he proved himself a most able and wise ruler.

At the end of 1652, John Maurice was appointed head of the [[Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)]] and made a prince of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]]. In 1664 he came back to [[Holland]]; when war broke out with an England supported by the invading [[bishop of Münster]], he was appointed commander-in-chief of the [[Dutch States Army]]. Though hampered in his command by the restrictions of the states-general, he repelled the invasion, and the bishop, [[Christoph Bernhard von Galen]], nicknamed "Bommen Berend", was forced to conclude peace. His campaigning was not yet at an end, for in 1668 he was appointed first Field-Marshal of the States Army and in 1673 he was charged by stadtholder [[William III of England|William III]] to command the forces in [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], and to defend the eastern frontier of the Provinces, again against Van Galen.

In 1675 his health compelled him to give up active military service, and he spent his last years in his beloved [[Cleves]], where he died in December 1679.

==Legacy==
The residence he built in [[The Hague]] is now called the [[Mauritshuis]], and houses the Royal Cabinet of Paintings. It is now a major museum of old Dutch paintings.

Brazilian author [[Paulo Setúbal]] wrote a historic novel about John Maurice and the Dutch settlement in Brazil, ''O Príncipe de Nassau'' ("The Prince of Nassau", translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]] by R. Schreuder and [[J. Slauerhoff]] in 1933 as ''Johan Maurits van Nassau'').

'''Richard Copley Christie''' (22 July 1830 – 9 January 1901) was an [[England|English]] lawyer, University teacher, philanthropist and [[bibliophile]].

He was born at [[Lenton, Nottingham|Lenton]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], the son of a mill owner. He was educated at [[Lincoln College, Oxford]] where he was tutored by [[Mark Pattison (academic)|Mark Pattison]], and was called to the bar at [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1857. He also held numerous academic appointments, notably the professorships of history (from 1854 to 1856) and of [[political economy]] (from 1855 to 1866) at [[Owens College]]. He always took an active interest in this college, of which he was one of the governors. In 1898 he gave the Christie Library building, designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]]: the plan connected this on the east with the Whitworth Hall.

==Philanthropy==
Christie was a friend of the industrialist Sir [[Joseph Whitworth]]. By Whitworth's will, Christie was appointed one of three legatees, each of whom was left more than half a million pounds for their own use, ‘they being each of them aware of the objects’ to which these funds would have been put by Whitworth. They chose to spend more than a fifth of the money on support for [[Owens College]], together with the purchase of land now occupied by
the [[Manchester Royal Infirmary]]. In 1897, Christie personally assigned more than £50,000 for the erection of the [[Whitworth Hall]], to complete the front quadrangle of Owens College. He was president of the Whitworth Institute from 1890 to 1895 and was much interested in the medical and other charities of Manchester, especially the Cancer Pavilion and Home, of whose committee he was chairman from 1890 to 1893, and which later became the [[Christie Hospital]].<ref>
A. W. Ward, ‘Christie, Richard Copley (1830–1901)’, rev. M. C. Curthoys, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32408, accessed 20 Dec 2007, paid registration required]</ref> In October 1893 the freedom of the city of Manchester was conferred upon him and on his surviving fellow legatee, R. D. Darbishire.

==Chancellor of the diocese==
From 1872 to 1894, Christie was [[Diocesan chancery|Chancellor]] of the [[Anglican Diocese of Manchester]]. In that capacity, he advised [[Bishop of Manchester]] [[James Fraser (bishop)|James Fraser]] on the matters that led to the imprisonment of the Rev. [[Sidney Faithorn Green]] under the [[Public Worship Regulation Act 1874]].

==Bibliophily==
Christie was an enthusiastic book collector, and bequeathed to Owens College his library of about 15,000 volumes, rich in a very complete set of the books printed by [[Étienne Dolet]], a series of [[Aldine Press]] publications, and of volumes printed by [[Sebastian Gryphius]] and other European humanists. His ''Étienne Dolet, the Martyr of the Renaissance'' (1880) is the most exhaustive work on the subject. He died at [[Ribsden]] in Surrey after a long period of illness: the book collection has always been separate from the general stock of the library of [[Manchester University]] and was transferred to the [[John Rylands Library]] building in Deansgate in 1972. A printed catalogue was issued in 1915 by the librarian, Charles Leigh. A stained glass window commemorates him on the staircase of the Christie Library.

==Scholarship==
He was the author of a number of essays and contributions to periodicals, some of which were published after his death.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://man-fe.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/MU_VU1:44MAN_ALMA_DS21183753840001631| title=Selected Papers, 1902|accessdate=2014-09-03}} </ref> He was a Member of the [[Chetham Society]], serving as a Member of Council from 1868, as Vice-President in 1882-3, and as President from 1884 until 1901.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chethamsociety.org.uk/pdf/CS_Officers_Council_1843-2013.pdf |title=Chetham Society: Officers and Council |publisher=Chetham Society |date=2014-01-13 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}</ref>

'''Alfred Waterhouse''' (19 July 1830&nbsp;– 22 August 1905) was a British [[architect]], particularly associated with the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[Gothic Revival architecture]]. He is perhaps best known for his design for [[Manchester Town Hall]] and the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in [[London]], although he also built a wide variety of other buildings throughout the country. Financially speaking, Waterhouse was probably the most successful of all Victorian architects. Though expert within Neo-Gothic, [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance revival]] and [[Romanesque revival architecture|Romanesque revival]] styles, Waterhouse never limited himself to a single architectural style.

== Early life ==
Waterhouse was born on 19 July 1830 in [[Aigburth]], [[Liverpool]], [[Lancashire]], the son of wealthy mill-owning [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] parents. His brothers were [[accountant]] [[Edwin Waterhouse]], co-founder of the ''Price Waterhouse'' partnership that now forms part of [[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]] and [[solicitor]] [[Theodore Waterhouse]], who founded the law firm Waterhouse & Co. that is now part of [[Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP]] in the [[City of London]].<ref name=bhaw>{{cite web | publisher = David Nash Ford | year = 2003 | url = http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/awaterhouse.html | title = Royal Berkshire History — Alfred Waterhouse (1830–1905) | accessdate = 2005-06-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20050705075846/http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/awaterhouse.html| archivedate= 5 July 2005 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first = Edwin | last = Waterhouse | title = The Memoirs of Edwin Waterhouse | publisher = Batsford | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-7134-5579-9 | editor = Edgar Jones | url = http://www.biography-clarebooks.co.uk/item5902.htm}}</ref>

Alfred Waterhouse was educated at the Quaker run [[Grove House School]] in [[Tottenham]] near [[London]]. He studied architecture under [[Richard Lane (architect)|Richard Lane]] in [[Manchester]], and spent much of his youth travelling in [[Europe]] and studying in [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Germany]]. Upon his return to Britain, Alfred set up his own architectural practice in Manchester.<ref name="bhaw"/>

== Manchester practice ==
[[File:Assize Courts, Manchester.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Manchester Assize Courts]], irreparably damaged in World War II, and subsequently demolished]]
Waterhouse continued to practise in Manchester for 12 years, until moving his practice to London in 1865. His earliest commissions were for domestic buildings. In executing the commission for the cemetery buildings at Warrington Road, Lower Ince, [[Wigan]], (1855–56) he began his move towards designing public buildings in his developing [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic style]], building a lodge for the registrar, and two chapels, one [[Church of England]], and one [[Non-conformist]]. His success as a designer of public buildings was assured in 1859 when he won the open competition for the [[Manchester assize courts|Manchester Assize Courts]] (now demolished). This work not only showed his ability to plan a complicated building on a large scale, but also marked him out as a champion of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cause.<ref name=eb1911>{{EB1911}}</ref>

In 1860, he married Elizabeth Hodgkin (1834–1918), daughter of [[John Hodgkin (barrister)|John Hodgkin]] and sister of the historian [[Thomas Hodgkin (historian)|Thomas Hodgkin]]. Elizabeth was herself the author of several books, including a collection of verse and some anthologies. Her best known work was ''The Island of Anarchy'', a 
Utopian story set in the late 20th century, first published in 1887 and more recently re-published by the Reading-based [[Two Rivers Press]].<ref name=nharch>{{cite web | title = Natural History Museum Archive Catalogue - Alfred Waterhouse | publisher = Natural History Museum | accessdate = 2007-11-09 | url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/library/library-archives/catalogue/DServe.exe?dsqServer=placid&dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Persons&dsqSearch=Code=='PX686'&dsqCmd=Show.tcl }}</ref><ref name=ruwatcol>{{cite web | url = http://www.reading.ac.uk/special-collections/collections/sc-waterhouse.aspx | title = Waterhouse Collection | publisher = University of Reading | accessdate = 2014-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first = Elizabeth | last = Waterhouse | title = The Island of Anarchy | isbn =  978-0952370185 | publisher = Two Rivers Press}}</ref>

Waterhouse had connections with wealthy Quaker industrialist through schooling, marriage and religious affiliation. Many of these Quaker connections commissioned him to design and build country houses, especially in the areas near [[Darlington]]. Several of these were built for members of the Backhouse family, founders of [[Backhouse's Bank]], a forerunner of [[Barclays Bank]]. For Alfred Backhouse, Waterhouse built Pilmore Hall (1863), now known as Rockliffe Hall, in [[Hurworth-on-Tees]]. In the same village he built the Grange (1875), now known as [[Hurworth Grange Community Centre]], which Alfred Backhouse had commissioned as a wedding gift for his nephew, James. E. Backhouse. Another Backhouse family mansion designed and built by Waterhouse was Dryderdale Hall (1872), near [[Hamsterley, Bishop Auckland|Hamsterley]], which many might recognise as the home of Cyril Kinnear in the film ''[[Get Carter]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7325054.stm | title =  'Get Carter' mansion up for sale | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 2008-04-01 | accessdate = 2009-04-24}}</ref>

== London practice ==
[[File:Manchester Town Hall from Lloyd St.jpg|right|thumb|[[Manchester Town Hall]], built 1868-1877.]]
In 1865, Waterhouse was one of the architects selected to compete for the [[Royal Courts of Justice]]. The new [[University Club of New York]] was undertaken in 1866. In 1868 and nine years after his work on the Manchester Assize Courts, another competition secured for Waterhouse the design of [[Manchester Town Hall]], where he was able to show a firmer and more original handling of the Gothic style. The same year he was involved in rebuilding part of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]; this was not his first university work, for he had already worked on [[Balliol College, Oxford]] in 1867, and the new buildings of the [[Cambridge Union]] Society, in 1866.<ref name=eb1911>{{EB1911}}</ref>

At Caius, out of deference to the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] treatment of the older parts of the college, this Gothic element was intentionally mingled with classic detail, while Balliol and [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], which followed in 1871, are typical of the style of his mid career with Gothic tradition tempered by individual taste and by adaptation to modern needs. [[Girton College]], [[Cambridge]], a building of simpler type, dates originally from the same period (1870), but has been periodically enlarged by further buildings. Two important domestic works were undertaken in 1870 and 1871 respectively — [[Eaton Hall (Cheshire)|Eaton Hall]] in [[Cheshire]] for the [[Duke of Westminster]], and [[Heythrop Hall]], [[Oxfordshire]], the latter a restoration of a fairly strict classic type.<ref name=eb1911>{{EB1911}}</ref>

[[Image:BritNatural History Museum2.jpg|upright|thumb|right|The Natural History Museum has an ornate [[terracotta]] facade typical of high [[Victorian architecture]].]]Waterhouse received, without competition, the commission to build the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in [[South Kensington]] (1873–1881), a design which marks an epoch in the modern use of [[architectural terracotta]] and which was to become his best known work. Waterhouse's other works in London included the [[National Liberal Club]] (a study in Renaissance composition), [[University College London]]'s Cruciform Building, the former site of [[University College Hospital]], the [[Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors]] in London's Great George Street (1896), and the Jenner Institute of Preventive Medicine in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] (1895).<ref name=eb1911>{{EB1911}}</ref>

From the late 1860s, Waterhouse lived in the [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] area and was responsible for several significant buildings there. These included his own residences of [[Foxhill House]] (1868) and Yattendon Court (1877), together with [[Reading Town Hall]] (1875) and [[Reading School]] (1870). Foxhill House is still in use by the [[University of Reading]], as are his Whiteknights House (built for his father) and [[Museum of English Rural Life|East Thorpe House]] (built in 1880 for [[Alfred Palmer]]).<ref name="bhaw"/>

For the [[Prudential plc|Prudential Assurance Company]], Waterhouse designed many offices, including their [[Holborn Bars]] head office in [[Holborn]] and branch offices in [[Southampton]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Leeds]]. He also designed offices for the [[NatWest|National Provincial Bank]] in [[Piccadilly]] (1892) and in Manchester. The [[Liverpool Infirmary]] was Waterhouse's largest hospital; and [[St Mary's Hospital, Manchester|St. Mary's Hospital]] in Manchester, the [[Alexandra Hospital]] in [[Rhyl]], and extensive additions at the [[Nottingham General Hospital]], also involved him.

== Recognition ==
Waterhouse became a fellow of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in 1861, and was President from 1888 to 1891. He obtained a grand prix for architecture at the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Paris Exposition of 1867]], and a "Rappel" in 1878. In the same year he received the [[Royal Gold Medal]] of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and was made an associate of the [[Royal Academy]], of which body he became a full member in 1885 and treasurer in 1898. He was also a member of the academies of [[Vienna]] (1869), [[Brussels]] (1886), [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]] (1887), [[Milan]] (1888) and [[Berlin]] (1889), and a corresponding member of the [[Institut de France]] (1893). After 1886 he was constantly called upon to act as assessor in architectural competitions, and was a member of the international jury appointed to adjudicate on the designs for the west front of [[Milan Cathedral]] in 1887. In 1890 he served as architectural member of the Royal Commission on the proposed enlargement of [[Westminster Abbey]] as a place of burial.<ref name=eb1911>{{EB1911}}</ref>

The '''mountain pygmy possum''' (''Burramys parvus'') is a small, [[mouse]]-sized (weighs {{convert|45|g}}) [[nocturnal]] [[marsupial]] of [[Australia]] found in dense alpine rock screes and boulder fields, mainly southern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and around [[Mount Kosciuszko]] in [[Kosciuszko National Park]] in [[New South Wales]] at elevations from {{convert|1300|to|2230|m|ft}}.<ref name=iucn>{{IUCN2008|assessors=Menkhorst, P., Broome, L. & Driessen, M.|year=2008|id=3339|title=Burramys parvus|downloaded=28 December 2008}} Database entry includes justification for why this species is listed as critically endangered</ref> At almost {{convert|14|cm|abbr=on}}, its prehensile tail is longer than its {{convert|11|cm|abbr=on}} combined head and body length. Its diet consists of insects (such as the [[Bogong Moth]]), fleshy fruits, [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[nectar]] and [[seed]]s. Its body is covered in a thick [[fur|coat]] of fine grey fur except for its stomach, which is cream colored; its tail is hairless. On the underside of the female's body is a pouch containing four tits. This [[possum]] is the [[Monotypic taxon|only]] [[Extant taxon|extant]] species in the ''[[Burramys]]'' genus.<ref name=MSW3>{{MSW3 Diprotodontia | id = 11000019 | page = 44}}</ref> It is also the only Australian mammal restricted to alpine habitat.<ref name=iucn/>

==Introduction==
The mountain pygmy possum was first discovered in the fossil record in 1895 when a portion of the jaw and skull bones were found in the Wombeyan Caves in central South Wales.<ref name="Broome, L. 2012">Broome, L., Archer, M., Bates, H., Shi, H., Geiser, F., McAllan, B., . . .

Wildlife and Climate Change, 114-126.</ref> At the time, the species was believed to be extinct. It was not until 1966 that a living individual was found at a ski resort at Mount Hotham in Victoria.<ref name="animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu">Bender, J. (2013, December 2). Burramys parvus mountain pygmy possum. Retrieved from Animal Diversity Web: http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Burramys_parvus/#physical_description</ref> Since that time, the mountain pygmy possum has been located in three isolated, genetically distinct populations in the alpine regions of southern Australia.<ref name="Broome, L. 2012"/>

==Physical Description==
'''''Burramys parvus''''', the mountain pygmy possum, is a small rodent-like marsupial. The mountain pygmy possum has an average weight of approximately 45 g and an average head and body length of 110&nbsp;mm.<ref name="animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu"/> The species is sexually dimorphic, with males being slightly larger than females. They have large, forward pointing eyes and short pointed snouts. Mountain pygmy possums exhibit [[diprotodont]] dentition, with three upper incisors and two upper premolars. On the syndactylous hind feet, they possess an opposable hallux.<ref name="Turner, V. 1989 pp. 1-27">Turner, V., & McKay, G. (1989). Burramyidae. In V. Turner, & G. McKay, Fauna of Australia (pp. 1-27). Canberra: Academic Press.</ref> In addition, the mountain pygmy possum has a pouch which opens anteriorly and contains 4 teats.<ref name="Turner, V. 1989 pp. 1-27"/> Pygmy possums are covered in a layer of fine, dense fur. Their pelage is grayish-brown on the dorsal side, with a darker stripe along the midline of the back, and a pale cream color on the ventral side. They typically have a darker gray ring surrounding the eyes. During breeding season, males become more tawny-orange on the abdomen and flanks.<ref name="environment.gov.au">Australian Government. (2013, December 2). Burramys parvus-Mountain pygmy possum. Retrieved from Australian Government Department of the Environment: http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=267#description</ref> The mountain pygmy possum has a long prehensile tail, averaging about 140mm in length, which is sparsely haired.

==Habitat and Geographic Range==
The mountain pygmy possum is endemic to the alpine regions of southern Australia. The species is currently restricted to three isolated mountain regions: (1) Mount Blue Cow in [[Kosciuszko National Park]] in New South Wales, (2) Mount Bogong and Mount Higginbotham/Loch in the Bogong High Plains in Victoria, and (3) Mount Buller in Victoria.<ref>Mitrovski, P., Heinze, D., Hoffmann, A., & Weeks, A. (2007). High levels of variation despite genetic fragmentation in populations of the endangered mountain pygmy-possum, Burramys parvus, in alpine Australia. Molecular Ecology, 75-87.</ref> The typical home ranges within these mountain ranges differ for males and females. Females tend to reside at higher elevations of approximately 1400-2228m near patches of block streams and other deep boulder formations. The home range of a female mountain pygmy possum is correlated with the density of [[Bogong moths]], the pygmy possum’s preferred food source, which varies at different elevations. Females at higher elevations have smaller home ranges due to a relatively greater abundance of Bogong moths, whereas females residing at lower elevations typically have much larger home ranges as the quantity of moths declines.<ref name="Broome, L. 2001">Broome, L. (2001). Density, home range, seasonal movements and habitat use of the mountain pygmy-possum Burramys parvus (Marsupialia: Burramyidae) at Mount Blue Cow, Kosciuszko National Park. Austral Ecology, 275-292.</ref> Male mountain pygmy possums reside at low elevations, generally between 1200-1300m, of these mountain ranges.<ref name="Broome, L. 2012"/> Male home ranges are largest during the breeding season, between November and December, when they migrate to female nesting sites, and decline thereafter.<ref name="Broome, L. 2001"/>

==Foraging Habits and Behavior==
Mountain pygmy possums prefer to feed on Bogong moths which make up about a third of their diet. This moth species (Agrotis infusa) migrates to the high alpine mountainous regions during the spring and summer months. During these months, mountain pygmy possums utilize Bogong moths as their principle food source. In the autumn months, Bogong moths depart from the mountain ranges and mountain pygmy possums must supplement their diets with fruits and seeds. ''Burramys parvis'' species will supplement their diet with the mountain plum pine from the fruit-bearing conifer [[Podocarpus lawrencei]] as well as seeds from the Snow Beard-heaths [[Leucopogon]] spp. and blackberry [[Rubus]] spp.<ref name="ReferenceA">Broome, L. (2001). Intersite differences in population demography of Mountain Pygmy-possums Burramys parvis Broom (1986-1998): implications for metapopulation conservation and ski resorts in Koskiuszko National Park, Australia. Biological Conservation, 309-323.</ref> Upon finding food, the mountain pygmy possum will first smell the food source before picking it up with its incisors. It will then transfer the item to its forelimbs so that it may manipulate the food and tear off pieces of flesh.<ref name="Turner, V. 1989 pp. 1-27"/>

==Reproduction==
Mountain pygmy possums have an annual reproductive cycle. Although females are polyestrous, the need for sufficient fat reserves during hibernation limits females to one litter per year. In order to ensure adequate fat reserves, female mountain pygmy possums will synchronize reproduction for the spring months, when Bogong moths are abundant.<ref name="animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu"/> The breeding season typically occurs during the Austral spring months of October and November. During this time, males migrate to the higher elevation nesting sites of females to mate.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Mountain pygmy possums then have an internal gestation period of 14–16 days, after which the altricial young will enter the forward-facing pouch of the female. A female mountain pygmy possum has four teats, and a litter is usually three to four offspring. The young remain in the pouch for approximately 3 weeks, after which they remain at the nest for another 3–4 weeks.<ref name="Turner, V. 1989 pp. 1-27"/> The offspring are then weaned at around 9–10 weeks.<ref name="environment.gov.au"/> The mating system that occurs in ''Burramys parvus'' is resource defense polygyny. A philopatric group of females typically share a nest space within deep boulder crevices. The nest sites are generally areas of high densities of migrating Bogong moths. Shortly after mating season, females will drive the male pygmy possums from the nest. The male mountain pygmy possums do not participate in parental care. Additionally, juvenile males are driven from the nest shortly after weaning.<ref name="Broome, L. 2001"/>  As noted in all species of Burramyids, mountain pygmy possums become sexually mature by one year of age.<ref name="Turner, V. 1989 pp. 1-27"/>

==Behaviour==
Mountain pygmy possums are nocturnal creatures, preferring to sleep during the day and forage at night. While all other members of the [[Burramyidae]] family are arboreal, the mountain pygmy possum is a terrestrial species. The preferred habitat of these pygmy possums is within deep boulderfields in alpine regions of Southern Australia. The females tend to stay in familial groups of up to 10 related individuals. Females also tend to be relatively sedentary and exhibit high nest site fidelity.<ref name="Turner, V. 1989 pp. 1-27"/> Male mountain pygmy possums, on the other hand, tend to be solitary, leaving nesting sites as juveniles to take residence in lower elevations of the mountain ranges.<ref>Parker, J. (2013, December 2). Possum Dreaming. Retrieved from ABC Science: http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2000/05/01/2686592.htm</ref> For this reason, male mountain pygmy possums generally suffer higher mortality than females as the boulderfields appear to offer some protection from predation.<ref name="Turner, V. 1989 pp. 1-27"/> ''Burramys parvus'' is noted to be the only small mammal in Australia that hibernates seasonally for long periods of time. All other members of ''Burramyidae'' are capable of opportunistic hibernation.<ref name="Broome, L. 2001"/> Adult mountain pygmy possums enter hibernation for a period of up to seven months, whereas juveniles generally hibernate for about five months.<ref name="Broome, L. 2001"/> Both males and females rely heavily on Bogong moths as an energy rich food and for the fattening period which occurs prior to hibernation. Mountain pygmy possums are also noted to cache seeds and berries which they will feed on during periods when they awaken from torpor.<ref name="Turner, V. 1989 pp. 1-27"/> During the months of hibernation, ''Burramys parvus'' is noted to awaken from torpor for periods of two to three days at a time during which the animal will feed on cached food resources. These periods of arousal typically occur when the ambient temperature is between 4-7?C. During the hibernating period, the mountain pygmy possum is capable of reducing its temperature to 2?C.<ref>Kortner, G., & Geiser, F. (1998). Ecology of natural hibernation in the marsupial mountain pygmy-possum (Burramys parvus). Oecologia, 170-178.</ref> Individuals in torpid periods will curl their bodies up, tucking their heads into their chest or abdomen in order to retain body heat. In addition, females have been observed sharing nests constructed from moss and snow grass.<ref name="Turner, V. 1989 pp. 1-27"/> Both males and females are noted to hibernate under an insulating layer of snow.<ref name="Broome, L. 2001"/>
During the breeding season in the spring and summer months, older, heavier mountain pygmy possums typically occupy the highest quality habitats. While males are generally tolerant of one another during most of the year, they can act aggressively toward each other during the breeding season. Aggression is noted in both males and females in the form of tail biting.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Females are observed to act very aggressively towards both males and females when defending nesting sites, especially when offspring are present. Additionally, females are aggressive to adult males following the breeding season as well as to juvenile males post-weaning.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Conservation status==
As of 2008, the mountain pygmy possum has been declared by the IUCN Redlist as Critically endangered. Population estimates totalled less than 2000 individuals from the three combined isolated populations in 2000. Current population estimates indicate that these numbers have severely declined in the last decade. The most recent study conducted in 2006 at Mount Buller tallied only 30 adults.<ref name="environment.gov.au"/> As of 2007, the number of females recorded at Mount Blue Cow had Kosciuzsko with a total of 60 individuals.<ref name="environment.gov.au"/> 

	The biggest threats to the Mountain pygmy possum populations include habitat destruction and fragmentation, climate change, predation by feral cats and red foxes, and threats to the Bogong moth. The construction of ski resorts in the alpine regions in which the mountain pygmy possums inhabit has been one of the greatest factors attributed to population decline. At Mount Higginbotham, a major road constructed to the Mount Hotham ski resort prevented male mountain pygmy possums from migrating to the female nesting sites during the breeding season. This physical barrier was noted to markedly increase winter mortality in the Mount Higginbotham population. In response to this, an underground tunnel was constructed which provided male pygmy possums with an alternative migratory route.<ref>van der Ree, R., Heinze, D., McCarthy, M., & Mansergh, I. (2009). Wildlife Tunnel Enhances Population Viability. Ecology and Society, 1-10.</ref>

	Climate change is another serious threat to the mountain pygmy possum. ''Burramys parvus'' is the only Australian mammal which is completely restricted to the alpine regions. The species is well adapted to the seasonal availability of Bogong moths and other food resources.<ref name="Broome, L. 2012"/> Although data from New South Wales and Victoria are still pending, preliminary models suggest that reduced survival of Mountain pygmy possums can be related to declining snow cover and shorter winters.<ref name="Broome, L. 2012"/> Studies conducted at Kosciuszko National Park revealed that the period of snow cover was diminished by an average of 10 days and snow melt occurred approximately 15 days earlier. Linda Broome and her group of researchers determined that, while hibernation sites appeared well insulated despite lack of snow, snow cover provides additional protection to the mountain pygmy possums during the coldest months. This added layer of insulation is believed to promote prolonged torpor and decrease waking intervals which can deplete energy stores and decrease possum survival.<ref name="Broome, L. 2012"/> As a suggested solution to this environmental disturbance, Broome and her colleagues proposed moving the remaining populations of mountain pygmy possums from their alpine habitats to lower elevation temperate rainforests. This solution is based on previous husbandry efforts, which showed that mountain pygmy possums did not require a period of hibernation at environmental temperatures above 12?C.<ref name="Broome, L. 2012"/> 

	A third negative impact on the mountain pygmy population is high levels of predation by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and feral cats. In order to control the level of predation, threat abatement plans are in place. These threat abatement plans identify the necessary actions required to protect all species affected by predation of red foxes and feral cats.<ref name="environment.gov.au"/> 

	Research has also extended to identify the threats impacting the survival of the Bogong moth. This moth species is the preferred food source of mountain pygmy possums. Their arrival during the spring months acts as a seasonal indicator signalling the end of hibernation for the possums. In addition, Bogong moths are rich in protein and fat and they provide mountain pygmy possums with the necessary energy reserves to sustain the seven month hibernation period.<ref name="Broome, L. 2012"/>

	Lastly, the Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife has implemented captive breeding programmes under the support and guidance of Linda Broome and her colleagues.<ref>Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife. (2013, December 2). Mountain Pygmy-Possum Captive Breeding. Retrieved from Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife: http://fnpw.org.au/plants-a-wildlife/land-mammals/mountain-pygmy-possum/mountain-pygmy-possum-captive-breeding</ref> In addition, Zoos Victoria has also become involved in the effort to sustain the remaining populations of mountain pygmy possums. The Zoos Victoria started a captive breeding programme for ''B. parvus'' in 2007 in the Healesville Sanctuary. The programme currently cares for a population of 45 mountain pygmy possums. Their overall goal is to down-list the mountain pygmy possum to a lower-threat category on the IUCN Redlist.<ref>Zoos Victoria. (2013, December 2). Healesville Sanctuary: Mountain pygmy-possum.

[[File:Nolan-chart.svg|right|thumb|The Nolan chart, with the traditional left-right political spectrum on the dashed diagonal.]]

The '''Nolan Chart''' is a [[political views|political view]] assessment diagram created by American politician [[David Nolan (libertarian)|David Nolan]] in 1969. The chart divides human political opinions into two [[Coordinate vector|vectors]] – economic opinion and personal opinion – to produce a type of [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian chart]]. It expands political view analysis beyond the traditional "left–right" line, which measures politics along a one-dimensional line, into a graph with two dimensions: degrees of economic and personal freedom.

==Development==
[[File:David Nolan.jpg|right|thumb|David Nolan]]

A similar two-dimensional chart, with eight points instead of four, appeared in 1970 in the publication ''The Floodgates of Anarchy''<ref>[[Stuart Christie|Christie, Stuart]], Albert Meltzer. ''[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/stuart-christie-albert-meltzer-the-floodgates-of-anarchy The Floodgates of Anarchy]''. London: Kahn & Averill, 1970. ISBN 978-0-900707-03-2. p. 73.</ref> by [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]]. In ''[[Radicals for Capitalism]]'' (p.&nbsp;321), [[Brian Doherty (journalist)|Brian Doherty]] traces the idea for the chart to an article by Maurice Bryson and William McDill in ''The Rampart Journal of Individualist Thought'' (Summer 1968) entitled "The Political Spectrum: A Bi-Dimensional Approach".<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://mises.org/journals/rampart/Rampart_summer1968.pdf|author=Maurice Bryson and William McDill |journal=The Rampart Journal of Individualist Thought|date=Summer 1968| title=The Political Spectrum: A Bi-Dimensional Approach}}</ref>

David Nolan first published the current version of the chart in an article named "Classifying and Analyzing Politico-Economic Systems" in the January 1971 issue of ''[[The Individualist (magazine)|The Individualist]]'', the monthly magazine of the [[Society for Individual Liberty]] (SIL). In December 1971, he helped to start the group that would become the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/david-nolan.html |title=David Nolan – Libertarian Celebrity |accessdate=2008-09-09 |work= |publisher=[[Advocates for Self Government]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080616110300/http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/david-nolan.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-16}}</ref>

Frustrated by the "left-right" line analysis that leaves no room for other ideologies, Nolan devised a chart with two axes which would come to be known as the Nolan Chart.  The Nolan Chart is the centerpiece of the [[World's Smallest Political Quiz]]. Nolan's insight was that the major difference between various political philosophies, the real defining element in what a person believes politically, is the amount of government control over human action that is advocated.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Nolan further reasoned that virtually all human political action can be divided into two broad categories: economic and personal. The "economic" category includes what people do as producers and consumers – what they can buy, sell, and produce, where they work, who they hire, and what they do with their money. Examples of economic activity include starting or operating a business, buying a home, constructing a building, and working in an office. The "personal" category includes what people do in relationships, in self-expression, and what they do with their own bodies and minds. Examples of personal activities include whom they marry; choosing what books they read and movies they watch; what foods, medicines, and drugs they choose to consume; recreational activities; religious choices; organizations they join; and with whom they choose to associate.

[[File:NolanwithNolanChart1996.jpg|thumb|David Nolan in 1996 with a version of the Nolan Chart distributed by [[Advocates for Self-Government]].]]
Since, Nolan realized, most government activity (or government control) occurs in these two major areas, political positions can be defined by how much government control a person or political party favors in these two areas. The extremes are no government at all in either area (anarchism) or total or near-total government control of everything (various forms of totalitarianism). Most [[political philosophy|political philosophies]] fall somewhere in between. In broad terms:
* Conservatives and those on the right tend to favor more freedom in economic areas (example: a free market), but more government intervention in personal matters (example: drug laws).
* Liberals and those on the left (by the common US meanings of those terms) tend to favor more freedom in personal areas (example: no [[Conscription|military draft]]), but more government activism or control in economics (example: a government-mandated minimum wage).
* Libertarians favor both personal and economic freedom, and oppose most (or all) government intervention in both areas. Like conservatives, libertarians believe that people should be free to make economic choices for themselves. Like liberals, libertarians believe in personal freedom.
* Statists favor a lot of government control in both the personal and economic areas. Different versions of the chart, as well as Nolan's original chart, use terms such as "[[communitarian]]" or "[[populism|populist]]" to label this corner of the chart.

In order to visually express this insight, Nolan came up with a two-axis graph. One axis was for economic freedom, and the other was for personal freedom, with the scale on each of the two axes ranging from zero (total state control) to 100% (no state control). 100% freedom in economics would mean a free market; 100% freedom in personal issues would mean no government control of private, personal life. By using the scale on each of the two axes, it was possible to graph the intersection of the amount of personal liberty and economic liberty a person, political organization, or political philosophy advocates. Instead of classifying all political opinion on a one-dimensional range from liberal to conservative, Nolan's chart allowed two-dimensional measurement: how much (or little) government control a person favored in personal and economic matters.

Nolan said that one of the impacts of his chart is that when someone views it, it causes an irreversible change: viewers henceforth view the included orientations in two dimensions instead of one.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libertariantv.com/libertarian_alternative/nolan_chart/index.asp |title=Mark Selzer and co-host Martina Slocomb interview David Nolan |publisher=The Libertarian Alternative Public Access TV Show |accessdate=February 15, 2013}}</ref>

In 1987, [[Marshall Fritz]], founder of [[Advocates for Self-Government]], tweaked the chart and added ten questions – which he called the [[World's Smallest Political Quiz]] – which enabled people to plot their political beliefs on the chart.

==Positions==
[[Image:Political-spectrum-multiaxis.png|thumb|A variant of the [[Nolan chart]] using traditional political color-coding ([[Red#Use by political movements|red leftism]] versus [[Blue#Politics|blue rightism]]) and alternative labels for the sections. (Note that this chart is rotated 90° from the one above.)]]

Differing from the traditional "left/right" distinction and other political taxonomies, the Nolan Chart in its original form has two dimensions, with a horizontal x-axis labeled "economic freedom" and a vertical y-axis labeled "personal freedom". It resembles a square divided into four sections, with a label assigned to one of the sections:
* Bottom left – [[Left-wing politics|Left-wing political philosophies]].  Those supporting low economic freedom and high personal freedom.
* Top right – [[Right-wing politics|Right-wing political philosophies]].  Those supporting high economic freedom and low personal freedom.
* Bottom right – [[Libertarianism]].  David Nolan's own ideology, corresponding with those supporting high economic and personal freedom.
* Top left – [[Statism]]. The opposite of libertarianism, corresponding with those supporting low economic and personal freedom. David Nolan originally termed this philosophy [[populism]], but many later renditions of the chart have used the label [[statism]], [[authoritarianism]], [[totalitarianism]], or [[fascism]] instead. Many libertarian groups have labeled that section as [[communitarianism]].

==Polling==
In August 2011, the libertarian ''[[Reason Magazine]]'' worked with the Rupe organization to survey 1,200 Americans by telephone and place their views within the Nolan chart categories. The Reason-Rupe poll found that "Americans cannot easily be bundled into either the 'liberal' or 'conservative' groups".

'''''Galaxy High''''' is an [[United States|American]]-[[Japan|Japanese]] [[science fiction]] [[animated series]] that premiered on September 13, 1986 on [[CBS]] and ran for 13 episodes until December 6, 1986.

== Synopsis ==
Two earth teenagers are accepted into the InterGalactic high school, Galaxy High School on the asteroid Flutor. The teenage boy, Doyle, was a skilled athlete and popular, while the teenage girl Aimee was shy and as the theme song states, "the smartest girl in school, not very popular, not very cool." But once in space their roles are somewhat reversed. The alien teenagers seem to accept the not so popular Aimee, while Doyle tends to rub the aliens the wrong way. Although Doyle finds himself an outcast and having difficulties adjusting, Aimee does not abandon him, and suggests he can make friends and bring glory to Galaxy High through his excellent sporting abilities, which he does by winning a championship in "psych-hockey", which Galaxy High always lost. The show drops many hints of a budding romance between Doyle and Aimee but was never given time to grow due to the show not being renewed for a second season.

The aliens in the school included Gilda Gossip, the girl with the big mouth or mouths, Booey Bubblehead, who has a bubble for a head and is absent-minded, Milo De Venus, the six armed class president, Beef and the Bonk Bunch who bully Doyle (and just about every student at Galaxy High), and The Creep, a small alien who resembled something between a very fat cherub and a marshmallow and had a huge crush on Aimee which would often reveal itself as he serenaded like a Las Vegas lounge singer. The teachers are even more unusual than the students: Ms. Biddy McBrain has a light bulb attached to her head while Coach Frogface eats flies and Professor Icenstein has to keep his classroom cold or he will melt.

Brief description of the show from the video box:

"Blast off to the outer space high school where the students come in all shapes, sizes and every color of the rainbow! At Galaxy High, the junior class president has six hands. The local pizza parlor is as close as the nearest satellite and when the science teacher gets mad he melts! Join two earthling exchange students as they encounter a crazy collection of cosmic kids from all over the universe."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tms-e.com/english/film/sf/02.php |title=Tms Entertainment, Ltd |publisher=Tms-e.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-18}}</ref>

== Production notes ==
The animated series ''[[Partridge Family 2200 A.D.]]'', which debuted in 1974, features  Keith and Laurie Partridge going to a futuristic space high school called "Galaxy High," and Laurie's friend Marion Moonglow (a Martian) bears a striking resemblance to the Wendy Garbo character from this series.

''Galaxy High'' was animated, distributed and owned by [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha|TMS Entertainment]].

[[John Kricfalusi]] was a character designer for the show and went on to create ''[[The Ren and Stimpy Show|Ren and Stimpy]]'' and ''[[The Ripping Friends]]''. 

Syd Iwanter, the Creative Director of TMS productions came up with the concept and hired Kricfalusi to draw a one sheet pitch featuring the main characters for a proposed HIGH SCHOOL 2525. When Michael Chase Walker became Director of Children's Programs for the CBS Television Network he bought the show, changed the name to Galaxy High School and convinced up and coming screenwriter Chris Columbus to develop the show under his name. Walker was trying to develop a Saturday Morning schedule that resembled an old school Saturday matinee at the movies with a wide range of horror ([[Teen Wolf (1986 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]), Science Fiction (Galaxy High School), Comedy ([[Pee Wee's Playhouse]]), and western fantasy ([[Wildfire (1986 TV series)|Wildfire]]).  The characters of Booey Bubblehead, Doyle and Aimee are named after Chris Columbus's siblings.

In 1996 Walker optioned the film rights with [[John H. Williams]] of [[Vanguard_Films_%26_Animation | Vanguard Films]], and reteamed with Chris Columbus to develop the big screen version of Galaxy High School. After various development deals with both [[DreamWorks]] and [[Paramount pictures]], the movie plans remain in limbo.

An alternate theme song exists showing clips from various episodes. The theme was changed to an instrumental one. At the end, Aimee speaks "Here we are Doyle! The only two kids from Earth at a high school in outer space! How do you feel?" Doyle responds "A little spaced out Aimee!"

The show features transportation tubes, which people can enter and be whisked away around the school; these are reminiscent of old-style [[pneumatic tubes]]. In ''Galaxy High'', they are known as 'wooshers'.

===Series tie-in===
An 85-page paperback book titled ''Galaxy High School'' was published in August 1987 by [[Bantam Books|Bantam-Skylark Books]] and written by [[Ann Hodgman]]. It is an adaptation of six episodes, "Welcome to Galaxy High", "Those Eyes, Those Lips", "The Beef Who Would Be King", "Dollars and Sense", "Beach Blanket Blow-Up" and "Founder's Day". In the prologue, it says that Doyle and Aimee, while on Earth, attended Presley High School and its sports team was called the Hound Dogs. It also says that Aimee didn't know Doyle well before coming to Galaxy High, but did think he was cute, until they actually meet when first entering their new school. The paperback is out-of-print and is a highly sought collectible among fans of the show.

===Airdates===
''Galaxy High'' originally aired at 11:00am EST/10:00am CST after ''[[Teen Wolf (1986 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]'' and before ''[[CBS Storybreak]]'' in the 1986-1987 season on [[CBS]]. It was also given a timeslot for the 1987-1988 CBS season in the expectation of a second season, but upon the show's retirement the 1987-1988 schedules re-ran episodes of the first season.

Later airdates: 2 January 1988 - 27 August 1988 on [[CBS]], January 2, 1994-?, July 2, 1994-September 24, 1994, October 8, 1994-December 31, 1994-early 1995, 7 February 1996 - 23 February 1996, April 2, 1996-April 19, 1996, May 27, 1996-June 17, 1996 on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]].

==Awards==
The show was nominated for a [[Humanitas Prize]] for its anti-drug episode, ''The Brain Blaster.''

== Legacy ==
Despite its short run, Galaxy high become a [[cult classic|cult favorite]] among fans and views alike for years.

*Galaxy High School appears frequently in the eighties animation magazine, ''cereal:geek''

*The [[Role-playing game]] ''[[Teenagers from Outer Space (role-playing game)|Teenagers from Outer Space]]'' released in 1987 expanded upon this concept.

*A long running parody of Galaxy High appeared on the British kids comedy show, ''[[Round the Bend]]'' as ''"Cosmic [[Comprehensive school|Comprehensive]]"''.

== DVD and Video-On-Demand Releases ==
''Galaxy High'' has been released in full on DVD. All 13 episodes are available uncut and as they were originally aired, across two volumes, produced and distributed by [[Media Blasters]] through their [[AnimeWorks]] division (the same company previously responsible for the release of ''[[Invader Zim]]'').

Volume 1 was released June 27, 2006, containing episodes 1-7.
Volume 2 was released July 25, 2006, containing episodes 8-13.

On the volume 1 DVD, the original episode 2, "Pizza's Honor" and episode 3, "The Beef Who Would Be King" are swapped around. This actually makes more sense chronologically as the rivalry between Doyle and Beef develops more in "The Beef Who Would Be King" better explaining Beef's strong negative actions towards Doyle in "Pizza's Honor".<ref name="dvdtalk1"/>

The complete Galaxy High School series is also currently available through video-on-demand services including [[Amazon Instant Video]] and [[Crunchyroll]].

'''Legio X ''Equestris''''' ([[Latin]]: Tenth mounted legion), a [[Roman legion]], was levied by [[Julius Caesar]] in 61 BC when he was the Governor of [[Hispania Ulterior]].  The Tenth was the first legion levied personally by Caesar and was consistently his most trusted. The name ''Equestris'' was applied after Caesar mounted legionaries from the Tenth on horses as a ruse in a parley with the German King [[Ariovistus]] in 58 BC{{Dubious|date=October 2009}} because he did not trust his Gallic cavalry auxiliaries from the [[Aedui]] tribe. Legio X was famous in its day<ref>Dando-Collins</ref> and throughout history, because of its portrayal in [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Caesar's Commentaries]] and the prominent role the Tenth played in his Gallic campaigns.<ref name=dbg142>Julius Caesar, I.42.</ref> Its soldiers were discharged in 45 BC. Its remnants were reconstituted, fought for [[Mark Antony]] and [[Augustus|Octavian]], disbanded, and later merged into [[Legio X Gemina|X ''Gemina'']].<ref name=gemina>See, for example, Kreppie.</ref>

==History==

===Founding===

When [[Gaius Julius Caesar]] arrived as Governor in the province of [[Baetica]] or [[Hispania Ulterior|Hispania Ulterior (Farther Spain)]], as it was in 61 BC, he immediately decided to subdue the west and northwest areas (modern day [[Portugal]]). He already had two legions based in the province, the 8th and 9th Legions, which had been enlisted by Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ([[Pompey]] the Great) in 65 BC. Caesar needed a third legion for his planned campaign and so he immediately enlisted a new legion, the 10th Legion. Enlisted in March, the legion took as its emblem the bull,<ref>Stephen Dando-Collins, ''Caesar's Legion: The Epic Saga of Julius Caesar's Elite 10th Legion and the Armies of Rome'', John Wiley& Sons,New York, 2002, p.9</ref> an emblem which proved popular with other legions such as [[Legio V Alaudae|Legio V ''Alaudae'']] (''Larks''), [[Legio XI]], [[Legio XII Fulminata|Legio XII ''Victrix'']], and [[Legio XIII Gemina|Legio XIII ''Gemina'']].

The campaign in the summer of 61 BC was very successful and the 10th Legion showed itself to be brave and loyal to Julius Caesar.<ref>Stephen Dando-Collins, ''Caesar's Legion: The Epic Saga of Julius Caesar's Elite 10th Legion and the Armies of Rome'', John Wiley& Sons,New York, 2002, p.12</ref>

===Gallic Wars===
The Tenth played a crucial part in the [[Gallic Wars]], fighting under Caesar in virtually every battle.

At the beginning of the Gallic campaign, Caesar brought the 10th legion from Spain (with the 7th, 8th, and 9th legions). Almost immediately, in the summer of 58 BC, the legion fought in two major actions, the battles of [[Battle of the Arar|Arar]] and [[Battle of Bibracte|Bibracte]].  They played a central part in Caesar's defeat of the Helvetii tribes, preventing their migration from present day Switzerland to western France.

Following the defeat of the Helvetii, the leaders of the Gallic tribes petitioned Caesar for his aid against [[Ariovistus]], king of the German Suebi tribe.  Prior to battle, Ariovistus suggested a peace conference but insisted that each side should only be accompanied by mounted troops.  Ariovistus made this a condition knowing that Caesar's cavalry was composed mainly of Aedian horsemen whose loyalty to Caesar was questionable.  Caesar ordered a group of his Gallic auxiliaries to dismount and had legionaries from the 10th ride in their place to accompany him to the peace conference. This incident earned the legion its nickname ''Equestris'' (mounted). One of the legionaries jokingly said that Caesar was better than his word: he had promised to make them foot guards, but now they appeared as [[equestrians]].<ref>Stephen Dando-Collins, ''Caesar's Legion: The Epic Saga of Julius Caesar's Elite 10th Legion and the Armies of Rome'', John Wiley & Sons, New York, 2002, p. 22.</ref>

Legio X saved the day in the [[Battle against the Nervians]] in 57 BC. Together with the [[Legio IX Hispana|IXth]], the Xth defeated the [[Atrebates]], moved against the Belgians on the other side of the river and captured the enemy camp. From that position, the Tenth could see how desperate the situation was for the [[Legio XII Fulminata|XII ''Victrix'']] and the [[Legio VII Claudia|VII]], so it quickly charged downhill, crossed the river, and attacked the [[Nervii]] from the rear, trapping them so that there was little hope of survival.

===End of the legion===
In 45 BC the legion was disbanded, and the veterans obtained lands in [[Narbonne]], southern [[Gaul]].

During the [[Liberators' civil war|civil war]] that followed Caesar's assassination, the Legio X was reconstituted by [[Lepidus]] (winter 44/43), and fought for the [[triumvir]]s until the final [[Battle of Philippi]]. The veterans obtained lands near [[Cremona]], and an inscription reports that the name of the legion at the time was '''''Veneria''''', "devoted to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]", the mythical mother of [[gens Julia]].<ref>CIL V 4191, ''C. Lanius C. f(ilius) Ani(ensis) de leg(ione) X Vener(ia)'', cited in Ritterling.</ref>

The Tenth later followed [[Mark Antony]] in [[Armenia]], during his [[Parthia]]n campaign. During [[Antony's civil war]], the legion fought for Mark Antony until the defeat in the [[Battle of Actium]], after which the legion moved into [[Augustus|Octavian]]'s army. The veterans settled in [[Patras]]. When the legion rebelled under Augustus, it was disbanded,<ref>[[Suetonius]], ''De Vita Caesarum—Divus Augustus'', [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suet-augustus-rolfe.html xxiv].</ref> stripped of its ''Equestris'' title, and, being populated with soldiers from other legions, renamed [[Legio X Gemina|X ''Gemina'']].<ref name=gemina />

'''Legio decima ''Gemina''''' ('''Tenth ''Twin'' Legion'''), was one of the four legions used by [[Julius Caesar]] in 58 BC, for his invasion of [[Gaul]]. There are still records of the X ''Gemina'' in [[Vienna]] in the beginning of the 5th century. The legion symbol was a [[Taurus (constellation)|bull]]. Early on in its history, the legion was called '''[[Legio X Equestris|X ''Equestris'']]''' (''mounted''), because Caesar once used the [[legionary|legionaries]] as [[cavalry]].

==In Republican Service==
===Gallic Wars===
:''See also [[Legio X Equestris]]''
In the [[Gallic Wars]], X ''Equestris'' played an important role on Caesar's military success and for this reason is sometimes said to be his favorite. In Caesar's campaigns they were present in the [[battle of the Sabis]], the [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invasions of Britain]], and the [[battle of Gergovia]]. They remained faithful to Caesar in the civil war against [[Pompey]], being present in the battles of [[battle of Pharsalus|Pharsalus]] (49 BC) and [[battle of Munda|Munda]] (45 BC). In 45 BC Caesar disbanded the legion, giving the veterans farmlands near [[Narbonne]] in Gaul and in Hispania.

===Augustus===
The legion was reconstituted in 42 BC and fought for [[Augustus]] (then Octavian), [[Lepidus]] and [[Mark Antony]] in the [[Battle of Philippi]] against the murderers of Caesar. After this, they followed Mark Antony in his campaign against [[Parthia]] and were defeated with him at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]]. Augustus then took control of the legion and settled the veterans in [[Patras]]. The legion rebelled and lost its ''[[cognomen]]'' ''Equestris'' as punishment. Reinforcements were added from other legions, and the Tenth was rebaptized ''Gemina''.

==In Imperial Service==
The newly formed X ''Gemina'' was relocated to [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], where Augustus was preparing a [[Cantabrian Wars|campaign against the Cantabrians]]. They stayed in Hispania for many years and their veterans were among the first inhabitants of modern [[Zaragoza]] and EMERITA Augusta, modern [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]].

===Under the Flavian dynasty===
[[Image:Roman Legions camps - AD 80.png|300px|left|thumb|Position of Roman legions in 80. X ''Gemina'' was in [[Nijmegen]] (mark 4), with [[Legio XXII Primigenia|XXII ''Primigenia'']].]]

In 70, after the [[Batavian rebellion]] was suppressed by [[Vespasian]], X ''Gemina'' was sent to [[Batavians|Batavia]] in [[Germania Inferior]] to police the lands and prevent new revolts. From 71 to 103, the legion was stationed at the base built by [[Legio II Adiutrix|II ''Adiutrix'']] at ''Oppidum Batavorum'', the present day Dutch city of [[Nijmegen]]. 

As part of the army of [[Germania Inferior]], X ''Gemina'' fought against the rebellion of the governor of [[Germania Superior]], [[Lucius Antonius Saturninus|L. Antonius Saturninus]], against Emperor [[Domitian]]. For this reason, the Tenth — as well as the other legions of the army, [[Legio I Minervia|I ''Minervia'']], [[Legio VI Victrix|VI ''Victrix'']], and [[Legio XXII Primigenia|XXII ''Primigenia'']] — received the title ''Pia Fidelis Domitiana'', "faithful and loyal to Domitian", with the reference to the Emperor dropped at his death and subsequent ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''.

===2nd century===
During the Trajan's first campaign in Dacia, (101-102) the legion participated at the [[Second Battle of Tapae]], fighting against the army of the [[Dacians]] led by King [[Decebalus]].

In 103, it was moved to ''[[Aquincum]]'' and later to ''[[Vindobona]]'' (modern [[Vienna]]), in [[Pannonia|Pannonia Superior]], which would be the legion's camp until the 5th century.

''[[Vexillatio]]nes'' of the X ''Gemina'' fought against the [[Bar Kokhba's revolt|rebellion]] of [[Simon bar Kokhba]] in 132-135, in [[Iudaea (Roman province)|Iudaea]], others participated in the Parthian campaign of [[Lucius Verus]] in 162. Another major campaign was [[Marcomannic Wars|the one fought against]] the [[Quadi]], [[Marcomanni]] and the [[Lombards]], under the command of Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]].

X ''Gemina'' supported its governor, [[Septimius Severus]], in his bid for purple, and many men of the legion went to Rome to become part of the [[Praetorian Guard]] of the new Emperor.

===3rd century===
During the 3rd century, the legion fought for several emperors, who awarded the legion with titles showing the fidelity of the legion and the favour gained by the Emperor himself. The titles ''Antoniniana'' (awarded by [[Caracalla]] or [[Elagabalus]]), ''Gordiana'' (by [[Gordian III]]), ''Deciana'' (by [[Decius]]), ''Floriana'' (by [[Florianus]]), and ''Cariniana'' (by [[Carinus]]) were short-lived, however, and dropped after the death of the Emperor. For its support of Emperor [[Gallienus]] against [[Postumus]], the ''Gemina'' was awarded the title '''''Pia VI Fidelis VI''''', "six times faithful, six times loyal".

===4th century===
At the time in which ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' was written (late 4th century), the first detachment of ''Decima Gemina'' was under the command of the ''[[Magister Militum]] per Orientem'', and was a [[comitatensis]] unit.<ref>''[[Notitia dignitatum]]'', [http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Notitia_dignitatum_partibus_orientis_-_I_XX#IX ''in partibus Orientis'', ix].</ref> The other detachment was still in Vindobona, under the command of the ''[[Dux]] [[Pannonia Prima|Pannoniae primae]] et [[Noricum Ripensis|Norici ripensis]]''.

Note the eagle and lion, symbols on the reverse, respectively of legio V and legio XIII.]]

'''Legio tertia decima ''Gemina''''' ('''Thirteenth ''Twin'' Legion''') was one of the most prominent [[Roman legion]]s. It was one of [[Julius Caesar]]'s key units in [[Gaul]] and in the [[Caesar's Civil War|civil war]], and was the legion with which he famously [[Caesar's Civil War#Crossing the Rubicon|crossed the Rubicon]] on January 10, 49 BC. The legion appears to have still been in existence in the fifth century. Its symbol was the lion.

== History ==
=== Under the late Republic ===
Legio XIII was levied by [[Julius Caesar]] in 57 BC, before marching against the [[Belgae]], in one of his early interventions in intra-Gallic conflicts. During the [[Gallic Wars]] (58–51 BC), Legio XIII was present at the [[Battle against the Nervians]], the [[Siege of Gergovia]], and while not specifically mentioned in the sources, it is reasonable to assume that Legio XIII was also present for the [[Battle of Alesia]].

After the end of the Gallic wars, the [[Roman Senate]] refused Caesar his second consulship, ordered  him to give up his commands, and demanded he return to [[Rome]] to face prosecution. Forced to choose either the end of his political career, or civil war, Caesar brought ''Legio XIII'' across the [[Rubicon]] river and into Italy. The legion remained faithful to Caesar during the resulting civil war between Caesar and the conservative [[Optimates]] faction of the senate, whose legions were commanded by [[Pompey]]. Legio XIII was active throughout the entire war, fighting at [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|Dyrrhachium]] (48 BC) and [[Battle of Pharsalus|Pharsalus]] (48 BC). After the decisive victory over Pompey at Pharsalus, the legion was to be disbanded, and the [[legionaries]] "pensioned off" with the traditional land grants; however, the legion was recalled for the [[Battle of Thapsus]] (46 BC) and the final [[Battle of Munda]] (45 BC).  After Munda, Caesar disbanded the legion, retired his veterans, and gave them farmland in Italy.

=== Under the Empire ===
[[Augustus]] reconstituted the legion once again in 41 BC to deal with rebellion of [[Sextus Pompeius]] (son of [[Pompey]]) in [[Sicily]].

Legio XIII acquired the [[cognomen]] ''Gemina'' ("twin", a common appellation for legions constituted from portions of others) after being reinforced with veteran [[legionary|legionaries]] from other legions following the war against [[Mark Antony]] and the [[Battle of Actium]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Birley | first = E.B. | title = A Note on the Title 'Gemina' | journal = Journal of Roman Studies | issue = 18 | pages = pp. 56–60 }}</ref> Augustus then sent the legion to ''Burnum'' (modern [[Knin]]), in [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], a [[Roman province]] in the Adriatic Sea.

In 16 BC, the legion was transferred to ''[[Emona]]'' (now [[Ljubljana]]) in [[Pannonia]], where they dealt with local rebellions.

After the disaster of the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in AD 9, the legion was sent as reinforcements to ''Augusta Vindelicorum'' ([[Augsburg]]), and then to [[Vindonissa]], [[Raetia]], to prevent further attacks from the Germanic tribes.

Emperor [[Claudius]] sent them back to Pannonia around 45; the legion camped at ''[[Poetovio]]'' (modern [[Ptuj]], Slovenia).

In the [[year of the four emperors]] (69), XIII ''Gemina'' supported first [[Otho]] and then [[Vespasian]] against [[Vitellius]], fighting in the two [[Battle of Bedriacum|Battles of Bedriacum]].
[[Image:LegioXIII Brick.JPG||thumb|250px|Stamped Brick found at [[Alba Iulia]], Romania]]

Under [[Trajan]] the Legion took part in both [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian wars]] (101-102, 105-106), and it was transferred by Trajan in 106 to the [[Roman Dacia|newly conquered province of Dacia]] (in [[Apulum]], modern [[Alba Iulia]], [[Romania]]) to garrison it. 

''[[Vexillatio]]nes'' of the XIII ''Gemina'' fought under Emperor [[Gallienus]] in northern Italy. The emperor issued a legionary ''[[antoninianus]]'' celebrating the legion, and showing the legion's lion (259-260).<ref>Cowan, p. 17.</ref> Another ''vexillatio'' was present in the army of the emperor of the [[Gallic Empire]] [[Victorinus]]: this emperor, in fact, issued a gold coin celebrating the legion and its emblem.<ref>Cowan, p. 26.</ref>

In 271, the legion was relocated when the Dacia province was evacuated, and restationed in ''[[Dacia Aureliana]]''.

In the 5th century, according to the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', a ''legio tertiadecima gemina'' was in [[Babylon (Egypt)|Babylon in Egypt]], a strategic fortress on the Nile at the traditional border between [[Lower Egypt]] and [[Middle Egypt]], under the command of the ''Comes limitis Aegypti''.<ref>''Notitia Dignitatum'', ''In partibus Orientis'', XXVIII</ref>

The '''Mason Bogie''' is a type of articulated [[steam locomotive]] suited for sharp curves and uneven track, once commonly used on [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] lines in the [[United States]]. The design is a development of the single [[Fairlie]], and is sometimes, and perhaps more properly known as the '''Mason Fairlie'''.

==Concept and Development==
The American licensee of the [[Fairlie]] Patent steam locomotive was the firm of [[William Mason (locomotive builder)|William Mason]], located in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]]. It became obvious that, for all the Fairlie locomotive's advantages, its disadvantages outweighed them. Mason developed an improved design, called the Mason-Fairlie, or more commonly the Mason Bogie (the word [[bogie]] is the British word for [[truck]] in the railroad sense). Similar locomotives developed in England were known as [[Single Fairlie]]s.

Mason's idea was to remove what American railroad men saw as the biggest disadvantages of the Fairlie - its cramped space for fuel and water caused by its double ended design (not very useful on American railroads where there was always ample room for a [[turntable (railroad)|turntable]] or [[wye (railroad)|wye]]), its cramped cab caused by the joined double boilers, and to some degree its poor riding.

He did this by removing one boiler of the double Fairlie and retaining only one power truck at the front. A much larger cab was fitted, and a fuel bunker and water tank behind the cab, supported by a [[trailing truck]]. The advantages of the Fairlie design were kept; the swivelling driven truck for a greater ability to negotiate curves, and the large open space between the trucks to fit a large [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] unrestricted by the wheels.

The Mason Bogie was still, though, plagued by one of the biggest problems of the Fairlie - the jointed steam pipes to the driven truck leaked far too much steam. Mason eventually changed to a different scheme, in which the pivot point for the leading truck became a hollow ball joint through which the live steam for the cylinders passed.<ref>William Mason, Improvement in Locomotive Truck Engines, {{US patent|156031}}, granted Oct. 20, 1874.</ref><ref>William Mason, Induction-Pipe for Bogie-Locomotives, {{US patent|242464}}, granted June 7, 1881.</ref>  Mason also developed a sliding seal for the exhaust from the moving cylinder saddle into the smoke box.<ref>William Mason, Improvement in Locomotives, {{US patent|177343}}, granted May 16, 1876.</ref> Although better, Mason's improvements took up much valuable space in between the driving wheels, forcing Mason to use an outside valve gear, generally the [[Walschaerts valve gear]]. Additionally, the reversing shaft had to be mounted atop the boiler, with a long lifting link dropping down to the radius rod, a feature unique to Mason Bogies (this was necessary because the lifting link would swing to the side as the truck pivoted, lifting the radius rod and changing the valve setting.  Lengthening the link, and thus increasing the radius of its swing, minimized the amount of change.).

==Production and Service==
Approximately 146 Mason Bogies were produced by William Mason's firm between 1871 and 1890 when the firm built its last locomotive, of which 88 or so were [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] units, the rest being [[standard gauge]]. This was about half the firm's total output of locomotives during this period. Major buyers included the [[Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn Railroad]], a suburban carrier which owned 32, the [[Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad]], a Colorado common-carrier railroad which owned 23, and the [[New York and Manhattan Beach Railroad]], another suburban carrier, which ran seventeen locomotives of this pattern.

The best-known locomotives were those on the Denver, South Park & Pacific, and they rostered fairly large Mason Bogies, mostly of 2-6-6 and 2-8-6 wheel arrangements, and had a lot of success with them.  Some of these locomotives were later sold to the [[Burlington and Northwestern Railway]], a [[CB&Q]] subsidiary in [[Iowa]].<ref>Mason Bogie loco 2-8-6T narrow gauge B&NW #1 (c1890), [http://www.burlingtonroute.com/docs/library/subphoto/m.htm BRHS Subject-Photo index, page M], Burlington Route Historical Socitey, May 28, 2013.</ref> Another problem with the Fairlie design showed itself in Colorado, the surprisingly poor tracking of the powered bogie. It would both hunt, or wander, when on straight track, yet provide more resistance to turning when it hit curvature than might be thought. This manifested itself in much greater wear on wheels and track than might have been expected.

The type had its possibly most notable success on the aforementioned Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn, which liked Mason Bogies so much that it continued to purchase them even after the closure of the William Mason factory, ordering similar locomotives from other builders as late as 1914 and operating them until electrification in 1928. It must be said, though, that the special features of the Mason Bogie weren't really used in this application, since the line was not greatly curved and did not need the flexibility the Mason Bogie bought at the cost of quite some complexity.

==Surviving==
At least one Mason Bogie, ''Torch Lake'', survives, at [[Greenfield Village]] (part of [[The Henry Ford]]) in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], an 0-6-4.  It was built in 1873 and still hauls passengers during the summer months.
[[Image:Steam Locomotive at Greenfield Village.JPG|thumb|360px|''Torch Lake'' at Greenfield Village]]

==Similar Designs==
Superficially similar to the Mason Bogie is another design, the [[Forney locomotive]]. Like the Mason Bogie, the Forney has powered axles under the boiler and a trailing truck under the rear bunker and tank behind the cab. However, the Forney's driving wheels are fixed in the frame, rather than articulated. They were reasonably popular on American narrow gauge railroads.

'''Legio XXII ''Primigenia''''' (Latin for "Twenty-second legion ''Primigenia''", dedicated to the goddess [[Fortuna]] Primigenia) was a [[Roman legion]] levied by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Caligula]] in 39, for his campaigns in [[Germania]]. There are still records of the XXII ''Primigenia'' in [[Mogontiacum]] (modern [[Mainz]]) from the end of 3rd century. The legion's symbols were a [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]<ref>L.J.F. Keppie, ''Legions and Veterans: Roman Army Papers'' 1971-2000, p. 128</ref> and the demigod [[Hercules]].

XXII ''Primigenia'' was first stationed in Mogontiacum in the [[Roman province]] of [[Germania Superior]], guarding the [[Rhine]] border as part of the [[limes]]. Along with the rest of the Germanic army, the legion supported [[Vitellius]] in the [[Year of the four emperors]] (69). During the [[Batavian rebellion]], XXII ''Primigenia'', commanded by [[Gaius Dillius Vocula]], was the only Germanic legion that survived attacks of the rebels and stayed in its camp, defending Moguntiacum. They remained in Moguntiacum until at least the 3rd century. Later Emperor [[Hadrian]] was ''[[tribunus militum]]'' of the XXIIth in 97-98.

Around 90, units of the XXII was garrisoned in or around the area of modern-day [[Butzbach]], as part of the [[Limes Germanicus]] (a series of forts along the Roman frontier of [[Germania Superior]] . A stamp of the XXII Legion was found during excavations of a Roman Fort in Butzbach. The 22nd U.S. Infantry Regiment was stationed in Butzbach after WW2, and the stamp of the Legion and the emblem of the American unit were very similar.<ref>http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?ref=SERP&br=ro&mkt=en-US&dl=en&lp=DE_EN&a=http%3a%2f%2fde.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fButzbach</ref>

The Rhine settlement was their main camp, but ''[[vexillationes]]'' of the legion participated in the building of the [[Antonine wall]] in Scotland (2nd century) and in the campaigns against the [[Sassanid Empire]] (around 235).

They were still in Moguntiacum during the attack of the tribe of the [[Alamanni]] in 235, and were responsible for the lynching of emperor [[Alexander Severus]], when he tried to negotiate with the enemy, and the subsequent election of [[Maximinus Thrax]] as new emperor.

In 268, ''Primigenia'' probably fought under [[Gallienus]] at the [[Battle of Naissus]], winning a victory over the [[Goths]]. The following year, [[Laelianus]], the commander of the 22nd, became emperor of the [[Gallic Empire]].

A '''lictor''' (possibly from {{lang-la|ligare}}, "to bind") was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civil servant tasked with attending and guarding  the magistrates of the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]] who held ''imperium'', the right and power to command; essentially a lictor performed the role of a [[bodyguard]]. Lictors are known to have been first employed during the [[Roman Kingdom]] age. According to Roman historian [[Livy]] the custom of deploying lictors may have originated at an earlier time in the [[Etruscan civilization]].

==Origin==
[[File:Fasces lictoriae.svg|thumb|right|A ''fasces'' was the symbol of a Lictor]]
According to [[Livy]], lictors were first introduced by Rome's first king, [[Romulus]], who appointed twelve lictors to attend his majesty. Livy refers to two competing traditions for the reason that Romulus chose that number of lictors. The first version is that twelve was the number of birds that appeared in the augury, which had portended the kingdom to Romulus. The second version, favoured by Livy, is that the number of lictors was borrowed from the Etruscan kings, who had one lictor appointed from each of their twelve states.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:8</ref>

==Eligibility==
{{Roman government|30em}}
Originally, lictors were chosen from the [[plebs]], but through most part of the Roman history they seemed to have been [[freedman|freedmen]]. Centurions from the legions were also automatically eligible to become lictors on retirement from the army.<ref>''The Legions of Rome'', Stephen Dando-Collins, pp41, Quercus (December 2010)</ref> They were, however, definitely Roman citizens, since they wore [[toga]]e inside Rome. A lictor had to be a strongly built man, capable of physical work. Lictors were exempted from military service, received a fixed salary (of 600 [[sestertius|sesterces]], in the beginning of the Empire), and were organized in a corporation. Usually, they were personally chosen by the magistrate they were supposed to serve, but it is also possible that they were drawn by lots.

Lictors were associated with [[Comitia Curiata]] and, probably, one was originally selected from each curia, since there were originally 30 curiae and 30 lictors (24 for the two [[consul]]s and 6 for the sole [[praetor]]).

==Tasks==
[[File:Roman Lictors.gif|thumb|left|Roman Lictors]]
The lictor's main task was to attend as bodyguards to magistrates who held ''[[imperium]]''. They carried rods decorated with [[fasces]] and, outside the ''[[pomerium]]'', with axes that symbolized the power to execute. [[Roman dictator|Dictatorial]] lictors had axes even within the ''[[pomerium]]''. They followed the magistrate wherever he went, including the [[Roman Forum|Forum]], his house, temples and the baths. Lictors were organized in an ordered line before him, with the '''primus lictor''' (the principal lictor) directly in front of him, waiting for orders. If there was a crowd, the lictors opened the way and kept their master safe, pushing all aside except for Roman matrons, who were accorded special honor. They also had to stand beside the magistrate whenever he addressed the crowd. Magistrates could only dispense with their lictors if they were visiting a free city or addressing a higher status magistrate. Lictors also had legal and penal duties: they could, at their master's command, arrest Roman citizens and punish them. A [[Vestal Virgin]] was accorded a lictor when her presence was required at a public ceremony.

The degree of [[magistrate]]'s [[imperium]] was symbolised by the number of lictors escorting him:

*[[Roman dictator|Dictator]]: 24 lictors outside the [[pomerium]], 12 inside. The latter rule was ignored beginning with the dictatorship of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]]
*[[Roman Emperor|Emperor]]: originally 12 lictors, after Domitian 24 lictors
*[[Rex]] and [[Roman consul|Consul]]: 12 lictors
*[[Promagistrate|Proconsul]]: 11 lictors
*[[Magister equitum]]: 6 lictors
*[[Praetor]]: 6 lictors, 2 within the pomerium
*[[Promagistrate|Propraetor]] and [[Legatus]]: 5 lictors
*[[Aedile|Curule aediles]]: 2 lictors
*[[Quaestor]]: 1 lictor.

Sometimes, lictors were ascribed to private citizens on special occasions, such as funerals or political reunions, as a show of respect by the city.

==Lictor curiatus==

The ''lictor curiatus'' (plural ''lictores curiati'') was a special kind of lictor who did not carry rods or ''fasces'' and whose main tasks were religious. Some thirty in number, they were at the command of the ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'', the high priest of Rome. They were present at sacrifices, where they carried or guided sacrificial animals to the altars. [[Vestal Virgin]]s, as well as ''[[Flamen|flamines]]'' (priests) and other high ranking priests, were entitled to be escorted and protected by ''lictores curiati''. In the Empire, women of the royal family were usually followed by two of this kind of lictor. The ''lictores curiati'' were also responsible for summoning the ''Comitia Curiata'' (the Public Assembly) and to maintain order during its procedures.

The title '''Duke of Braganza''' (Portuguese: Duque de Bragança) in the [[House of Braganza]] is one of the most important titles in the peerage of [[Portugal]].  Since the [[House of Braganza]] acceded to the throne of Portugal in 1640, the male heir of the [[Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese Crown]] was known as the Duke of Braganza and [[Prince of Brazil]] until 1822, or sometimes also as [[Prince of Beira]].  The tradition of the heir to the throne being titled Duke of Braganza was revived by various pretenders after the foundation of the [[History of Portugal|Portuguese Republic]] on 5 October 1910 to signify their claims to the throne.

==History of Dukedom==
===Feudal dukes===

The '''Duke of Braganza''' holds one of the most important [[List of Dukedoms in Portugal|dukedoms in Portugal]], see [[Duchy of Braganza]] (''Bragança'').  Created in 1442 by King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] for his uncle [[Afonso, Duke of Braganza|Afonso]], Count of Barcelos (natural son of King [[John I of Portugal]]), it is one of the oldest [[fief]]doms in Portugal.

By 1640, Portugal was on the verge of rebellion against Spanish rule, and a new Portuguese king had to be found. The choice fell upon [[John IV of Portugal|John, 8th Duke of Braganza]], who had a claim to the throne of Portugal both through his grandmother [[Catherine, Duchess of Braganza|Catherine of Guimarães]], a legitimate granddaughter of King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]], and through his great-great-grandfather, the 4th duke of Braganza, a nephew of King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]]. John was a modest man without particular ambitions to the crown. Legend has it that his wife [[Luisa of Guzman]] urged him to accept the offer by saying, "I'd rather be queen for one day than duchess for a lifetime". He accepted the leadership of the rebellion against Spain, which was successful, and was acclaimed King [[John IV of Portugal]] on 1 December 1640.

===Dukedom in the Braganza monarchy===
After the accession of the [[House of Braganza]] to the Portuguese throne in 1640 as a replacement for the [[Philippine Dynasty]] of Spanish Habsburgs, the Dukedom of Braganza became linked to the crown. "Duke of Braganza" became the traditional title of the heir to the [[Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese throne]], together with or alternate to "[[Prince of Beira]]", much as "[[Prince of Wales]]" is in the [[United Kingdom]]. After the 8th Duke had ascended the royal throne, he elevated his son and heir [[Teodósio, Prince of Brazil|Teodósio]] to the newly created rank of [[Prince of Brazil]] in 1645, but granted the Duchy of Braganza to his brother, the Infante Duarte, who died in 1649 in Spanish captivity. Then it was granted to the king's second son, the future [[Afonso VI of Portugal]].

From this time onwards, the title "Duke of Braganza" was kept for the [[heir apparent]] of the throne – in its strictest sense.  Although the other title for an unavoidable heir, that of "Prince of Brazil", was from time to time granted even to female heirs, the Dukedom of Braganza was always reserved only for the male heir except for two extraordinary creations, in 1683 and 1711. These two creations are deemed invalid by some legalists, who accordingly number the dukes in a way that [[Luís Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal]], the last Duke of Braganza during the period of Portuguese monarchy, is reckoned to be the 21st Duke. The present table reflects a numbering that specifies him as the 21st Duke.

When Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil]] abdicated his throne in 1831, he claimed the title of Duke of Braganza. 

On 1 February 1908 King [[Charles I of Portugal]] was murdered with his eldest son and heir, Luís Filipe, the last individual during the monarchy to carry that title. Carlos was succeeded by [[Manuel II of Portugal]] but for a short time: on 5 October 1910, a republic was instituted, and the king was exiled. King Manuel II then settled in England.

===Dukes in the post-monarchy era===
After the foundation of the Portuguese Republic in 1910, the tradition of the heir to the throne being titled Duke of Braganza was revived by various pretenders to signify their claims to the throne.

In the last years of the deposed king [[Manuel II of Portugal]], the dukedom of Bragança was claimed by [[Miguel, Duke of Braganza]], son of the exiled king [[Miguel I of Portugal]], who was living in the Austrian Empire. His branch of the Braganza family allegedly became heirs to the crown in 1932, when Manuel II died without children. These Braganzas were officially allowed to return to the country in 1950 and have lived there ever since. 

Presently, the commonly acknowledged duke of Braganza and Portuguese heir is [[Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza|Duarte Pio of Braganza]] (born 1945). Unlike other European republics (such as Greece) which attempt to prevent the presence of former royal houses in their lands, republican Portugal and its claimants to the throne have long been reconciled, a fact shown when among the guests at the wedding of Duarte Pio was the President of the Portuguese Republic and the country's prime minister.

'''Miguel of Braganza''' ({{IPA-pt|mi????}}; full name ''Miguel Maria Carlos Egídio Constantino Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga Francisco de Paula e de Assis Januário de Bragança'') (September 19, 1853 – October 11, 1927) was the [[Miguelist]] claimant to the throne of [[Portugal]] from 1866 to 1920.  He used the title '''[[Duke of Braganza]]'''.

==Life==
Miguel was born in Kleinheubach Castle near [[Miltenberg]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], during the exile in [[Germany]] of his father, former King [[Miguel I of Portugal]]. His mother was [[Princess Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg]]. He was a grandson of the Portuguese Queen Carlota Joaquina as well as [[John VI of Portugal]].

By the Portuguese law of banishment of 1834 and the constitution of 1838 Miguel was forbidden to enter [[Portugal]]. Therefore, he was educated in Germany and [[Austria]]. He was a member of the staff of Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria]] and took part in the occupation of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. It is said that the emperor Franz Joseph liked Miguel immensely and granted him the privilege of extraterritoriality that allowed him to remain Portuguese, despite the rejection of Portugal. His second son, Prince Francisco José of Braganza, was named after the Austrian Emperor, who was his godfather.

Miguel held the rank of a colonel in the 7th Austrian Regiment of Hussars. During [[World War I]], he held the rank of Lieutenant General (Feldmarschalleutnant) in the Austrian army.  He resigned in 1917 when Portugal entered the conflict on the opposite side, and spent the rest of the war as a civilian in the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Malta]]. After the end of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], Miguel and his family were thrown into relative poverty.

On 31 July 1920, after quarrels with his eldest son (who contracted a controversial marriage to an American heiress), Miguel renounced his claims as king of Portugal in favour of his third son, [[Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza|Duarte Nuno]], who was 13 years old at the time.

Miguel died in [[Seebenstein]], on October 11, 1927.  He is buried at Kloster Maria Himmelfahrt in Bronnbach.

==Marriages and children==
Miguel's first marriage, with [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Austrian Empress Elisabeth]]'s niece [[Princess Elisabeth of Thurn and Taxis]] (May 28, 1860 – February 7, 1881) took place on October 17, 1877 in [[Regensburg]]. They had three children.

'''Teodósio II, Duke of Braganza''' (April 28, 1568 - November 29, 1630) was a Portuguese nobleman. He is known for his allegiance to King [[Philip I of Portugal]].

==Biography==
[[File:Teodósio II.png|thumb|left|130px|''D. Teodósio II''.]]
As a child, Teodósio was brought to the court and made page to the king [[Sebastian I of Portugal]]. The king was very fond of him and in 1578 insisted on taking him to [[Africa]] in the expedition against the king of [[Morocco]]. This military campaign was doomed. During the ill-fated [[battle of Alcacer-Quibir]], Teodósio remained at the side of his king until the situation become extremely dangerous. Then, Sebastian ordered servants to take the ten-year-old child to safety behind the lines. The young man was not happy to be set aside and ran away at the first opportunity. Teodósio mounted a horse and went to the front lines of the battle, pursued by very scared servants. Eventually, like many others, he was wounded  and taken prisoner. Back in Portugal, his father João went mad with grief and offered a fortune for the ransom of his heir. He also asked king [[Philip II of Spain]] to write to the king of Morocco in order to spare young Teodósio's life. There was no need for such alarm. Impressed by the tale of his courage in battle, the king of Morocco let the child go, safely and without ransom, in August 1579.

Meanwhile in Portugal, the situation was one of unrest. With the disappearance of King Sebastian in the battle, the new king was Cardinal [[Henry I of Portugal]] an old childless man. Teodósio was the son of [[Infanta]] [[Catherine, Duchess of Braganza|Catarina]], an ambitious woman who, with her husband the Duke of Bragança, aspired to the throne. Philip II of Spain also aspired to the Portuguese throne and used every means to keep young Teodósio (great-grandson of King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] and a possible threat) out of the country. Only when he had safely secured the crown did Philip II of Spain, now Philip I of Portugal, allow the child's return.

Teodósio became a duke in 1583 at his father's death and grew up to be a faithful servant of the Spanish king of Portugal. He defended [[Lisbon]] from the attacks of another candidate ([[António, Prior of Crato|António of Crato]]) and was responsible for the kingdom's security for many years. Acknowledging this fidelity, Philip II granted the Braganças more lands and titles.

The '''Battle of Alfarrobeira''' ({{IPA-pt|a?f??u?b?j??}}) took place on 20 May 1449. It was a confrontation between the forces commanded by King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] and his uncle [[Afonso, Duke of Braganza]],  against the army of the rebellious [[Peter, Duke of Coimbra]]. The place was [[Alverca do Ribatejo]], near [[Lisbon]], at the margins of the creek of Alfarrobeira. The result was the clear defeat and death of the Duke of Coimbra and the establishment of the [[Duke of Braganza|Braganzas]] as the most powerful House of Portugal.

==The reasons for battle==
After the death of King [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Fernando]], the last of the First Dynasty, in 1383, power fell on the regent Queen [[Leonor Telles de Menezes|Leonor]], hated by the people, and her daughter [[Beatrice of Portugal|Beatrice]], married to the Castilian King [[John I of Castile|Juan I]]. Fernando's half-brother [[John I of Portugal|John, Master of Aviz]], led a [[1383–1385 Crisis|revolution]] against Queen and the Castilian King, defeating them with a smaller army in the [[battle of Aljubarrota]]. The battle became a turnpoint in Portuguese and the world's History, and King [[John I of Portugal|John I]] and his military aide, Constable [[Nuno Álvares Pereira]], became immortal idols.

King John I had a first illegitimate son, [[Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza|Afonso]], and a daughter [[Infanta Beatrice, Countess of Arundel|Beatrice]]; after marrying [[Philippa of Lancaster]], John of Gaunt's daughter, and establishing the [[House of Aviz]], they had a first boy (died of young age), a girl [[Infanta Isabel, Duchess of Burgundy|Isabella]] (who became a famous duchess of Burgundy and Flanders), then five boys who were grew up under the memories of the famous battle. [[Edward of Portugal|Edward]] (Duarte) was trained to become King, [[Infante Pedro, Duke of Coimbra|Peter]] (Pedro), [[Henry the Navigator|Henry]] (Henrique, a.k.a. "The Navigator"), that was becoming powerful and famous with the military actions in Northern Africa against Muslims; [[Infante João, Lord of Reguengos de Monsaraz|John]] and [[Ferdinand the Saint Prince|Fernando]], the youngest, died before Alfarrobeira. For ten years Peter lived abroad.

When King John I, and a few years later, King Edward, died, the crown fell on the boy [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]], under the regency of the Queen, an [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]]; the people remembered 1383 and the civil war, and rebelled against the Queen. The old [[Afonso, Count of Barcelos]], King John's first son, supported the Queen. Peter (now the eldest brother) led a revolution with the help of his brothers, but Henry managed to establish peace through a tripartite regency between the Queen, Peter and Afonso.

In the years to follow, the Queen tried a coup-d'etat with the help of her family; Peter, married to an Aragonese whose family fought for Castilian power against the Queen's family, managed to send her back to [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], appeased older Afonso giving him the Duchy of Braganza and conquered the thrust of his sons by promising them military titles, married his daughter to the young King, and assumed the Regency, establishing himself as the most powerful man in Portugal with the help of his brother Henry. But he made mistakes, for when his two brothers John and Fernando died, he gave their military titles to his sons, and not Afonso's sons as promised.

When young Afonso V reached his 14th birthday, he dismissed his uncle as regent, associated with Afonso's sons, and began to uproot Peter's men from their positions of power. Finally, for reasons that would be proven false later, the King marched against Peter. The battle, near Lisbon, to the North, was short, and Peter one of its first victims being killed by an arrow.<ref>Clayton J. Drees, p.15</ref> Henry, King John's fifth son, was now first and only of the House of Aviz.

==Outcomes of the battle==
Mistrusted by King Afonso V and the Duke of Braganza's sons as a member of the House of Aviz, and mistrusted by his dead brother's friends who never accepted his betrayal (and rejected by his old sister Isabella, in Burgundy), Henry retreated to his land in [[Sagres, Portugal|Sagres]], the southernmost and westernmost tip of Portugal - and Europe. There, living a secluded and religious life, he concentrated his efforts on the sailing expeditions of his men, becoming worldly renowned as discoverer of never before seen oceans and coasts ([[Madeira]], [[Azores]], the African coast to Guinea, and after his death [[Cape of Good Hope]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Canada]], [[Brasil]], etc.).

Afonso V ignored the travels of his uncle and immersed himself in the [[War of the Castilian Succession|battles of Castile]], trying to take the throne to himself, but his claim was defeated in the indecisive [[Battle of Toro]] by Queen Isabella the Catholic and King Fernando of Aragon. However, he won the naval war against the [[Catholic monarchs]] during this [[war of the Castilian Succession]] (1475-79). He died leaving Portugal on the brink of bankruptcy.

Afonso's son, [[John II of Portugal|John II]], turned his back on Castile and saw an opportunity on the ocean discoveries and expanded them, making Portugal the first intercontinental empire and becoming the most powerful King in medieval History.

The longest segment connects the Brazilian city of [[Macapá]] in [[Amapá]] State to Cayenne in [[French Guiana]], [[Paramaribo]] by the [[East-West Link (Suriname)|East-West Link Highway]] in [[Suriname]], [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] in Guyana, and [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]] city in [[Roraima]] Brazilian State. Boa Vista is connected with all the cities in [[Venezuela]] such as [[Ciudad Guayana]], its easternmost city. The highway supports trade among these countries. It is crossed by three large rivers, but an international system of ferries helps cross these natural obstacles.

==Venezuela==
The highway begins its path through [[South America]] in [[Colombia]]. However, a branch called the Simon Bolivar Highway runs through Venezuela. This stretch of the highway is an important link between [[Caracas]] and [[Bogotá]].

===Güiria===
The road begins as [[Venezuela Highway 9]] in [[Güiria, Venezuela|Güiria]], a small town in the state of [[Sucre]] just west of [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]] along the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coastline. From Güiria, the highway winds west {{convert|76|km|mi|0}} towards the town of [[Yaguaraparo, Venezuela|Yaguaraparo]].

===Yaguaraparo===
Once the highway reaches Yaguaraparo, on the southern portion of the [[Paria Peninsula]] along the [[Gulf of Paria]], Highway 9 continues west for approximately {{convert|83|km|mi|0}} to the towns of [[Casanay, Venezuela|Casanay]] and [[Pantoño, Venezuela|Pantoño]].

===Casanay===
Upon reaching Casanay, the highway crosses [[Venezuela Highway 10]], a major north–south highway. From Casanay and neighboring Pantoño, it continues west, paralleling the [[Cariaco Basin|Gulf of Cariaco]]. The highway crosses Secondary Highway 2 at [[Villa Frontado, Venezuela|Villa Frontado]], which travels south into the state of [[Monagas]]. The distance from Casanay to [[Cumaná, Venezuela|Cumaná]] is about {{convert|90|km|mi|0}}.

===Cumaná===
[[Cumaná]], founded in 1521, is the oldest city in South America. Cumaná is located on the banks of the [[Manzanares River]] and the [[Cariaco Basin|Gulf of Cariaco]]. Tourist attractions in Cumaná include the ''Castillo de San Antonio de la Eminencia'' (Castle of Saint Anthony of the Eminence), the ''Museo del Mar'' (Maritime Museum), and the ''Cueva del Guácharo'' (Guácharo Cave). From Cumaná, the road travels southwest approximately 65&nbsp;km to the border with the state of [[Anzoátegui]].

===Barcelona===
After crossing into Anzoátegui, it almost immediately enters the city of [[Barcelona, Venezuela|Barcelona]].
Barcelona was founded in 1671 and is a traditional Venezuelan city. Local attractions include [[Barcelona Cathedral]] and ''[[Casa Fuerte]]'', a national historic monument that celebrates Venezuelan independence. Nearby [[Puerto La Cruz, Venezuela|Puerto La Cruz]] is one of the most popular tourist areas in Venezuela and has some of the nation's best Caribbean beaches. Tourists can take a ferry from Puerto La Cruz to [[Margarita Island]].

===Boca de Uchire===
Travelling from Barcelona and Puerto La Cruz, the highway continues westward. For about 47&nbsp;km, it becomes a limited-access [[Limited-access road|expressway]], returning to a two-lane highway at [[Puerto Píritu, Venezuela|Puerto Píritu]]. The highway travels another 62&nbsp;km reaches the border with the state of [[Miranda (state)|Miranda]] at the town of [[Boca de Uchire]]. This portion includes a short run through the ''[[Los Llanos, Venezuela|llanos]]'', or Venezuelan savannahs.

===El Guapo===
About 34&nbsp;km west of Boca de Uchire, the highway starts climbing up the [[Cordillera Central]], in the [[Andes mountains]]. Highway 9 begins here to move further away from the [[Caribbean Sea]] coastline. From Boca de Uchire to El Guapo the distance is 65&nbsp;km; from El Guapo to [[Caucagua, Venezuela|Caucagua]] adds 59&nbsp;km.

===Caucagua===
At Caucagua, the Pan-American Highway crosses [[Venezuela Highway 12]]. Highway 9 continues through the Cordillera Central. After about 21&nbsp;km, the highway becomes a limited-access expressway for 32&nbsp;km west towards the [[Caracas]] metropolitan area and the [[Venezuelan Federal District]].

===Caracas===
With a population of around four million, [[Caracas, Venezuela|Caracas]] is the largest city and capital of Venezuela. Although located near the Caribbean Sea, Caracas is on a plateau at an approximate height of {{convert|2400|ft|m}}, so its weather can vary greatly. The city lies under [[Cerro El Ávila]], a mountain approximately {{convert|7800|ft|m}} high.

Attractions include the [[Teresa Carreño Theater]], the [[National Art Gallery (Venezuela)|National Art Gallery]], and [[Avila National Park]]. The Pan-American Highway switches from Highway 9 in Caracas to turn south on [[Venezuela Highway 1]], where it re-enters [[Miranda (state)|Miranda]]. It remains an expressway as it heads towards [[Carabobo]] for its remaining 48&nbsp;km in Miranda.

===Maracay===
[[Maracay]] is the capital and most important city of Aragua state in central Venezuela. It was officially established on March 5, 1701, by [[Bishop Diego de Baños y Sotomayor]] in the valleys of Tocopio and Tapatapa (what is known today as the central valley of Aragua) in northern Venezuela.

In Spanish, Maracay is known as "Ciudad Jardín", or "Garden City". Maracay was the name of a Cacique (Indian chief) of the indigenous people who lived in the area before the Spanish arrived. Apparently, the word means "tiger" in an ancient Caribbean language. Maracay is the cradle of Venezuelan aviation, and home to the two country's largest Air Force bases and other military facilities.

From Maracay the highway extends about 44&nbsp;km to Valencia, passing San Joaquin and near Cuacara en route to the city.

===Valencia===
[[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]] is the capital city of Carabobo state. The city is an economic hub that contains Venezuela's top industries and manufacturing companies. Its population is about 1.4 million. Valencia is known for its racial and international diversity. The city is located in a valley, some {{convert|520|m|ft}} over the sea and surrounded by a mountain range called the Coastal Range (Cordillera de la Costa). On its eastern outskirts lies Lake Valencia, Venezuela's second largest lake. Tourist sights include [[Casa Páez]], [[Casa de los Celis]], the [[Museum of History and Anthropology]] and [[Iturriza Palace]].

In Valencia, the highway shifts northwest and passes through mountains that are part of the [[Sistema Coriano]]. The distance between Valencia and the small town of [[El Palito, Carabobo|El Palito]] on the Caribbean Sea is approximately 40&nbsp;km. At El Palito, the road joins with [[Venezuela Highway 3]] for 10&nbsp;km, then splits off at Morón. The distance from Morón to the state border with [[Yaracuy State|Yaracuy]] state and the village of Guaremal is about 20&nbsp;km.

===San Felipe===
From Guaremal to [[San Felipe, Venezuela|San Felipe]], the major city in Yaracuy, is about 26&nbsp;km. The city itself is located on a route adjacent to Highway 1. The road runs 73&nbsp;km from San Felipe to the state border with [[Lara State|Lara]] (located just past the town of Cambural).

===Barquisimeto===
The distance from the border to [[Barquisimeto]] is about 16&nbsp;km.

Barquisimeto, the capital of Lara state, is a successful industrial and commercial centre. It has one of the largest markets in Latin America - Mercabar - where about 80% of the food produced in Venezuela is distributed throughout the country, and various shopping malls like Las Trinitarias, Ciudad París and Babylon. Among its many landmarks is an obelisk (El Obelisco) which commemorates Barquisimeto's 400th anniversary; and the oddly-shaped cathedral,  rare in Latin America, that sits below a cross-like tinted glass dome.

From Barquisimeto, Highway 1 continues roughly west, then southwest (at around Agua Salada) for 147&nbsp;km to the state line with Trujillo, near El Empedrado.

===Trujillo (state)===
Once in the state of [[Trujillo State|Trujillo]] (near the town of Parajá), the Pan-American Highway continues in a southwest direction; it does not travel through the state capital city of [[Trujillo, Venezuela|Trujillo]] but connects to Trujillo by way of state highways 3 and 1. The highway's length in this state is about 111&nbsp;km.

===Mérida (state)===
The highway enters [[Mérida State|Mérida]] state near Arapuey. As in Trujillo, the highway does not travel through the major population centers, of which the largest is [[Mérida, Venezuela|Mérida]]. Highway 1 connects to Mérida via an 88&nbsp;km stretch of Mérida state highway 4. About 5&nbsp;km southwest of Caja Seca is a 13&nbsp;km cutoff road to [[Lake Maracaibo]], Venezuela's largest lake and one of the largest on the continent. The highway covers 104&nbsp;km in Mérida.

===San Cristóbal===
Upon entering the state of [[Táchira State|Táchira]], the high extends about 58&nbsp;km from the border to the junction with [[Venezuela Highway 6]]. From the junction to the city of [[San Cristóbal, Táchira|San Cristóbal]] the distance is 44&nbsp;km, although there is a separate expressway that parallels the Pan-American Highway along this stretch. From San Cristóbal to the Venezuela-Colombia border, near San Antonio de Táchira, the distance is 32&nbsp;km.

==Colombia==
From [[Yaviza, Panama]] southeast lies the virtually impenetrable [[Darién Gap]], a {{convert|57|mi|km|sing=on}} stretch of some of the world's most rugged, mountainous jungle terrain. '''It is advised that travelers do not enter the Darién Gap as it is considered dangerous'''; it is a haven for bandits, smugglers, and Colombian paramilitary forces. The Colombian town nearest to the Darién Gap is [[Turbo, Colombia|Turbo]], located in [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] province. The highway linking Turbo to [[Medellín]] is [[Colombia Route 62]] and is approximately 278&nbsp;km in length.

Travelers along the [[Inter-American Highway]] portion of the Pan-American Highway in Panama can take a ferry from [[Panama City]] to the port of [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Buenaventura]], which is 115&nbsp;km northwest of [[Cali]]. Cali represents a major junction between Buenaventura and two northern spurs of the Pan-American Highway that connect from northern Colombia and [[Venezuela]].

===Cúcuta===
The main route of the Pan-American Highway in Colombia (starting from the northeast) begins just east of [[Cúcuta]], the capital city of the department of [[Norte de Santander]]. The highway follows [[Colombia Route 55]] for 63&nbsp;km from Cúcuta to Pamplona, where it shifts to [[Colombia Route 66]] for 45&nbsp;km to reach the border with the department of [[Santander Department|Santander]].

===Bucaramanga===
From the department border, Route 66 continues southwest for 50&nbsp;km toward [[Bucaramanga]], state captal of [[Santander Department|Santander]] located on a plateau in the [[Cordillera Oriental, Colombia|Cordillera Oriental]]. From Bucaramanga, the Pan-American Highway switches from Route 66 to [[Colombia Route 45A]], which it follows south by southwest to the town of Barbosa. This 203-km stretch on Route 45A is a [[toll road]]. Approximately 26&nbsp;km of this stretch of highway enters the department of [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] and reenters Santander between Vado Real and Guepsa. From Barbosa, the Pan-American Highways switches from Route 45A to [[Colombia Route 62]] and immediately reenters Boyacá towards Tunja, the state capital of Boyacá.

===Tunja===
A 53-km stretch of highway connects Barbosa with [[Tunja]], an important agriculture and mining center in the region. The Pan-American Highway switches routes again in Tunja, returning to [[Colombia Route 55]] on its way to [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] and the national capital, [[Bogotá]]. The stretch of highway from Tunja to the departmental border with Cundinamarca is 54&nbsp;km and is a toll road.

===Bogotá===
From the Cundinamarca departmental line, the highway continues another 26&nbsp;km without tolls before becoming a toll road again. From that point, the highway reaches [[Bogotá]] in 52&nbsp;km. Bogotá is the capital and largest city of Colombia, with a population of roughly 7.8&nbsp;million (about 8.5&nbsp;million in the metropolitan area). Bogotá is {{convert|2640|m|ft}} above sea level on the Cordillera Oriental of the Northern [[Andes|Andean Mountains]]. Bogotá is Colombia's largest economic center and is a center of art, culture, and learning.

In Bogotá, the highway crosses from the north to the southwest portion of the city, switching from Route 55 to [[Colombia Route 40]]. Continuing as a toll road from Bogotá, it travels for 128&nbsp;km through [[Fusagasugá]] to the departmental border with [[Tolima Department|Tolima]].

===Ibagué===
From the Tolima departmental border, the highway continues as a toll road for another 16&nbsp;km to [[El Espinal (Tolima)|El Espinal]]. It travels west and after another 37&nbsp;km, reaches the city of [[Ibagué]]. Ibagué is the capital of Tolima department and has an estimated population of 422,549. The city is situated {{convert|1285|m|ft}} above sea level on the eastern slopes of the Andean [[Cordillera Central, Colombia|Cordillera Central]] between the [[Chipalo River|Chipalo]] and [[Combeima River|Combeima]] rivers, tributaries of the [[Coello River]].

From Ibagué to the [[Quindío Department|Quindío]] departmental border near La Linea is about 77&nbsp;km.

===Armenia===
Upon crossing into Quindío, [[Colombia Route 40]] continues westward for another 4&nbsp;km before reaching [[Calarcá]], where Route 40 splits into two spurs. One enters [[Armenia, Colombia|Armenia]]. The spurs rejoin about 18&nbsp;km southwest of Calarcá at the town of Club Campestre. The city of Armenia has about 300,000 people and an economy based on coffee and bananas. Armenia has several universities, including the [[University of Gran Colombia]] and the [[University of Quindío]].

From Club Campestre, it covers another 16&nbsp;km until reaching the [[Valle del Cauca]] departmental border.

===Cali===
From the border, the Pan-American Highway travels 26&nbsp;km to the town of La Paila, where it crosses [[Colombia Route 25]]. At this junction, the two routes merge and become a toll road for 61&nbsp;km from that point to Buga. At Buga, Route 40 splits west toward the city of Buenaventura and the [[Pacific Ocean]]; the Pan-American Highway continues south on Route 25 for another 42&nbsp;km until arriving near Palmira. From Palmira, the highway continues southwest for 23&nbsp;km, where it reaches the large city of [[Cali]].

[[Santiago de Cali]], the city's complete name, is the capital of the [[Valle del Cauca]] department. It is Colombia's second largest city, with an estimated population of 2.3&nbsp;million and a metropolitan area population of 4.3&nbsp;million. Popular museums include the ''[[Museo Arqueológico La Merced]]'' (La Merced Archeological Museum) and the ''[[Museo del Oro del Banco de la República]]'' (Bank of the Republic Gold Museum), containing archaeological exhibits of pre-Columbian cultures.

==Ecuador==
[[Ecuador Highway 35]], the "Troncal de la Sierra" (Highland's Road), is commonly known to Ecuadorians as "La Panamericana" and forms Ecuador's contribution to the project. It connects cities and towns from the Sierra region, from Tulcán at the north (border with Colombia), passing through Quito, the country's capital, to the southern border with Peru. Part of this highway is a toll-road administered by Panavial, a private concessionary. The road condition is quite good, but it mostly goes through mountains and it has some bad trails around the province of Cañar (center of the country), making it a fairly dangerous road to drive on.

===Tulcán===
The Ecuadorian portion begins at the Columbian border in [[Carchi Province|Carchi]] province and almost immediately enters the city of [[Tulcán]], the capital of Carchi province.

He specialized in [[bubblegum pop]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Joey Levine induction |url=http://www.bubblegum-music.com/joeylevineinduction |publisher= Bubblegum University |accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref>

Levine produced records for [[Super K Productions]], run by [[Jerry Kasenetz]] and [[Jeffrey Katz]], who released many singles in the late 1960s by [[The Ohio Express]], The [[1910 Fruitgum Company]], and The [[Music Explosion]].  Levine sang lead for various groups of studio musicians, whose songs were released under the name of actual groups of musicians, or sometimes the groups did not exist at all outside the studio.

Starting in the early 1970s, Levine began working on [[jingles]] for television [[TV commercials|commercials]], as well as singing on them, with one of his most well-remembered jingles being "Sometimes You Feel Like A Nut" for [[Mounds (candy)|Mounds]] and [[Almond Joy]] [[chocolate bar]]s.

Levine founded Crushing Enterprises in New York City in 1969, and continues to write music for commercials and television.  Popular campaigns from the past include: “[[Pepsi]] – The Joy of Cola", "Gentlemen Prefer Hanes", "Just For the Taste of It – [[Diet Coke]]", "Orange you smart, (for drinking Orange Juice)", "Come See the Softer Side of [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]]", "Heartbeat of America – [[Chevrolet|Chevy]]", "[[Dr Pepper]] – You Make the World Taste Better", "You Asked For It, You Got It, [[Toyota]]," "Who's that Kid With the [[Oreo]] Cookie," and "This Bud's For You" for [[Anheuser-Busch]]. Most recently he wrote the current [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] [[anthem]], "This Is Budweiser, This Is Beer." In addition, Levine has also contributed songs, some of them with his 1960's bubblegum pop sound, to the [[PBS]] series ''[[Dragon Tales]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Joey Levine |url=http://home.comcast.net/~bubblegumusic/levine.htm |accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref>

'''''Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs''''' (working title: '''''So White and de Sebben Dwarfs''''') is a ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[animation|animated]] cartoon directed by [[Bob Clampett]], produced by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]], and released to theatres on January 16, 1943 by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and [[The Vitaphone Corporation]].<ref name="bcdb">{{Cite news|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/7484-Coal_Black_And_De_Sebben_Dwarfs.html|title=Coal Black And De Sebben Dwarfs|publisher=BCDB|date=2013-11-16}}</ref>
The film is notable for being an all-[[African American|black]] parody of the [[Brothers Grimm]] [[fairy tale]] ''[[Snow White]]'', known to its audience from the popular 1937 [[Walt Disney]] animated feature ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. The stylistic portrayal of the characters, however, is an example of ''darky iconography'' (see [[blackface]]), which was widely accepted in [[United States|American]] society at the time. As such, it is one of the most controversial cartoons in the classic Warner Bros. library, has been rarely seen on television, and (because it is one of the [[Censored Eleven]]; see below) has never been officially released on home video. However, it is often named as one of the best cartoons ever made,<ref>[http://home.roadrunner.com/~tuco/looney/50greatest.html "History Of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of All Time".]</ref> in part for its African-American-inspired jazz and swing music, and is considered one of Clampett's masterpieces.

==History==
[[Image:1942 Coal Black And De Sebben Dwarfs Ad.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Coal Black'' lobby card. The character designs for "So White" and her seven friends are examples of the 'darky' iconography typical of Hollywood animation during the first half of the 20th century. As a result, ''Coal Black'' and similar cartoons have been removed from circulation and are little known today among mainstream audiences.]]

===Overview===
In this version of the story, all of the characters are [[African American]], and speak all of their dialogue in rhyme. The story is set during World War II in the [[United States]], and the original tale's [[fairy tale]] wholesomeness is replaced in this film by a hot [[jazz]] mentality and sexual overtones. Several scenes unique to Disney's film version of ''Snow White'', such as the wishing-well sequence, the forest full of staring eyes, and the awakening kiss, are directly parodied in this film. The film was intended to have been named ''So White and de Sebben Dwarfs'', which producer [[Leon Schlesinger]] thought was too close to the original film's actual title, and had changed to ''Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Clampett intended ''Coal Black'' as both a parody of ''Snow White'' and a dedication to the all-black jazz [[musical film]]s popular in the early 1940s (i.e. ''[[Cabin in the Sky]]'', ''[[Stormy Weather (1943 film)|Stormy Weather]]'', etc.). In fact, the idea to produce ''Coal Black'' came to Clampett after he saw [[Duke Ellington]]'s 1941 musical revue ''Jump for Joy'', and Ellington and the cast suggested Clampett make a black musical cartoon.<ref name="bcdb" /> The Clampett unit made a couple of field trips to Club Alabam, a [[Los Angeles]] area black club, to get a feel for the music and the dancing, and Clampett cast popular radio actors as the voices of his main three characters. The main character, So White, is voiced by [[Vivian Dandridge]], sister of actress [[Dorothy Dandridge]]. Their mother, [[Ruby Dandridge]], voices the [[Queen (Snow White) in derivative works|Wicked Queen]] (or rather her sweet voice and evil cackle, while for the majority of the cartoon, the Queen's true voice, which is low and raspy, is played by [[Danny Webb]]). [[Leo Watson]] is the voice of "Prince Chawmin'". The other characters, including the Sebben Dwarfs, are voiced by standard Warner voice artist [[Mel Blanc]].

Originally, Clampett wanted an all-black band to score the cartoon, the same way [[Max Fleischer|Max]] and [[Dave Fleischer]] had [[Cab Calloway|Cab Calloway and His Orchestra]] score the ''[[Betty Boop]]'' cartoons ''[[Minnie the Moocher]]'', ''[[The Old Man of the Mountain (1933 cartoon)|The Old Man of the Mountain]]'', and their own version of ''[[Snow White (1933 cartoon)|Snow White]]''. However, Schlesinger refused, and the black band Clampett had hired, Eddie Beals and His Orchestra, only recorded the music for the final kiss sequence. The rest of the film was scored, as was standard for Warner cartoons, by [[Carl W. Stalling]].

===Synopsis===
''Coal Black'' opens in front of a fireplace with a red-tinted silhouette of a large woman holding a young child in her lap. The little black girl asks her "[[mammy archetype|mammy]]" to tell her the story of "So White an' de Sebben Dwarfs". "Mammy" begins:

:''"Well, once there was a ''mean'' ol' queen. And she lived in a gorgeous castle. And was that ole' gal rich! She was just as rich as she was mean! She had ''everythang!''

The rich, [[Queen (Snow White)|Wicked Queen]] then appears, depicted as a "food hoarder", with a large repository of items that were on ration during [[World War II]]: rubber, sugar, gin ("[[Eli Whitney]]'s [[cotton gin|Cotton Gin]]" brand) and more. After stuffing her face with candies (from a box marked "[[Chattanooga Choo Choo|Chattanooga Chew-Chews]]"), she asks her magic mirror to "send her a prince 'bout six feet tall", but when Prince Chawmin' arrives in his flashy car, he declares "that mean ol' queen sho' is a fright / but her gal So White is dyn-a-mite!" Finding So White hard at work doing the laundry, the prince takes her hand and the two swing out into a wild [[jitterbug]]. The queen sees this and hires "[[Murder, Inc.|Murder, Incorporated]]" to "black-out So White."  The assassins arrive in a panel truck that advertises, "We rub out anybody for $1.00; [[Midget]]s: 1/2-price; [[Jap]]s: free". (That [[US$]]1 would be equal to US${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|1|1943|r=2}}}} today.{{Inflation-fn|US}})

The assassins kidnap the girl, but after several unseen "favors" which make the would-be assassins very happy, set her free in the woods unharmed. Just before they drive off, the assassins are seen covered with So White's lipstick, an [[innuendo]] as to exactly how she earned her freedom. Wandering through the woods by herself, So White runs into the Sebben Dwarfs, seven diminutive army men in uniform who sing "We're in the Army Now," with two dwarfs singing "it takes us cats ... to catch them rats" at the end, and So White declares in a 1940s swing-style singing voice, "I'm wacky over khaki now!" They immediately recruit her as their squad cook, and she spends her days "fryin' up eggs an' pork chops too" (to the tune of "Five O'Clock Whistle") for the hungry soldiers, as a sign which hangs from her outdoor antique stove reads, "Keep 'em frying," as a sendup of the World War II slogan, "Keep 'Em Flying."

Meanwhile, the queen has learned that So White is still alive, and pumps an apple full of poison to give to the girl and kill her.  Several worms escape the apple as the queen injects it with poison, one carrying a sign that says "Refoogees."  The queen disguises herself as an old peddler woman, and arrives at the Sebben Dwarfs' camp and gives So White the poisoned apple. One of the seven dwarfs (modeled on the "Dopey" dwarf in Disney's film) alerts the others that the queen has caused So White to "kick the bucket," and the entire squad hops into its vehicles (a [[Jeep]], a "Beep," and, for "Dopey," a "Peep"). As the queen makes her escape over the hills, the dwarfs load a cannon with both a war shell and "Dopey." The shell sails over to the queen, stops in front of her in mid-air, opens, and "Dopey" appears, knocking the crone out with a mallet.

Even though the queen has been defeated, So White is still dead to the world. The dwarfs note, in spoken rhyme:

:''"She's outta this world! She's stiff as wood!''
:[[I Got It Bad (and That Ain't Good)|''She's got it bad, and that ain't good!'']]
:''There's only one thing that'll remedy this''
:''and dat's Prince Chawmin' and his Dynamite [[Kiss]]!"''

Upon the dwarfs' invoking his name, the prince jumps into the scene in a spotlight and promises to "give her a kiss / and it won't be a dud / I'll bring her to life with my special 'Rosebud'", a nod to ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Wiping his lip and leaning over the girl in preparation, Prince Chawmin' proceeds to give So White a succession of highly aerobic kisses, practically swallowing the girl's face whole in trying to awaken her, but without any luck. Prince Chawmin' keeps frantically kissing So White (his efforts underscored by a solo from Eddie Beale's trumpet player), and the efforts literally take the life out of him as he first turns blue in the face, before turning into a withered old, pale-faced man, shrugging his shoulders in defeat. The "Dopey" dwarf then saunters over to So White, and, to the tune of "You're in the Army Now," lays a kiss on the girl so dynamic that not only does So White wake up, but her eyes become large as saucers and her pigtails fly straight up into the air (depicted in Rod Scribner's typically extreme animation style) as she jumps into the air.

The worn-out and aged Prince asks "Dopey," "Man, what you got that makes So White think ''you'' so hot?!" "Dopey" replies, with the only non-rhyming line in the cartoon, "well, dat is a military secret," and lays another kiss on So White, which sends her pigtails sailing into the air again and causes the red ribbons on them to turn into twin [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]s, to several notes of "[[The Stars and Stripes Forever]]", and immediately after the kiss, So White shows an obvious "afterglow" in her eyes and her smile. The film then fades to the standard ''Merrie Melodies'' "That's all, Folks!" end title text, superimposed over a shot of the little girl and her "mammy" from the opening scene.

===Controversy over racial content===
''Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs'' is notorious for being one of the "[[Censored Eleven]]": eleven Schlesinger/Warner Bros. cartoons produced at the height of the [[Hollywood Animation: The Golden Age|Golden Age of Hollywood animation]] based on its unflattering and stereotypical use of [[darky iconography]]. Because it was produced in America during [[World War II]], there is also [[anti-Japanese sentiment]]: the firm "Murder Inc." advertises that it does not charge to kill "Japs".

The same basic stereotypical elements present in the earlier Censored Eleven films are also present in ''Coal Black'', depicted with more detail and made to conform to Clampett's "wacky" directorial style. The Prince, a vague [[Cab Calloway]] lookalike, is depicted as a slender, [[zoot suit]]ed Black man with [[straightened hair]], a [[monocle]], and gold teeth (with dice in place of the front two incisors). Both he and the dwarfs are drawn with large eyes, small noses, and unnaturally large pink lips, derived from the appearance of a white man in [[blackface]] rather than that of an actual black man. The middle-aged wicked Queen is depicted as an overweight, asexual [[Hag|crone]], with large lips that are only partially covered with lipstick (the Queen's lipstick only extends as far as it would if her lips were proportionate to her face).

Only So White escapes the extreme caricature given the other characters, although she is stereotyped in a different manner. She is designed as an attractive young woman with a voluptuous figure revealed by a short skirt and a low-cut, cleavage-revealing blouse. The sexualization of So White recalls [[Walter Lantz]]'s 1941 cartoon ''[[Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat]]'', where a young light-skinned Black woman is depicted as attractive while the other Black characters are drawn as extreme caricatures. In both that film and ''Coal Black'', the sexually attractive features of the young women are significant plot devices. In ''Coal Black'', So White is the object of sexual desire for every male character in the picture. This draws upon the stereotype of the young attractive black woman as an "exotic" sexual being, a stereotype present in roles that African-American actresses such as [[Dorothy Dandridge]] and [[Lena Horne]] played in American cinema.

Clampett would revisit black jazz culture again in another 1943 Merrie Melodies cartoon, ''[[Tin Pan Alley Cats]]'', which features a feline caricature of [[Fats Waller]] in a repurposing of the wacky fantasy world from ''[[Porky in Wackyland]]'' (during the opening sequence, the "Fats" cat is distracted by what appears to be So White). Clampett's colleague [[Friz Freleng]] directed a cartoon titled ''[[Goldilocks and the Jivin' Bears]]'' in 1944, essentially ''Coal Black'' remade with a different fairy tale, and Warner's director [[Chuck Jones]] directed a series of shorts starring a prepubescent [[African]] hunter named [[Inki]] from 1939 to 1950. Like ''Coal Black'', ''Tin Pan Alley Cats'' and ''Goldilocks and the Jivin' Bears'' would also end up in the Censored Eleven.

Bob Clampett claimed in the cartoon's defense that;{{cquote|In 1942, during the height of anti-Japanese sentiment during [[World War II]], I was approached in Hollywood by the cast of an all-black musical off-broadway production called ''Jump For Joy'' while they were doing some special performances in Los Angeles. They asked me why there weren't any Warner's cartoons with black characters and I didn't have any good answer for that question. So we sat down together and came up with a parody of Disney's "[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs|Snow White]]" and "Coal Black" was the result. They did all the voices for that cartoon, even though Mel Blanc's contract with Warners gave him sole voice credit for all Warners cartoons by then. There was nothing racist or disrespectful toward blacks intended in that film at all, nor in ''Tin Pan Alley Cats'' which is just a parody of jazz piano great Fats Waller, who was always hamming into the camera during his musical films. Everybody, including blacks had a good time when these cartoons first came out. All the controversy about these two cartoons has developed in later years merely because of changing attitudes toward black civil rights that have happened since then.}}

===''Coal Black'' in later years===
The racially stereotyped portrayals of African-Americans in ''Coal Black'' and the other "[[Censored Eleven]]" cartoons led to their being suppressed from [[television]] broadcast. In 1968, [[United Artists]], which then owned the rights to the pre-August 1948<ref>The latest released WB cartoon sold to a.a.p. was ''[[Haredevil Hare]]'', released on July 24, 1948.</ref> Warner cartoon library, officially banned the cartoons from circulation, and they have not been officially broadcast or released on [[home video]] since - even as the rights returned to Warners.

''Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs'' is often praised and defended by film scholars and animation historians, and has often been included on lists of the greatest animated films ever made. One such list, the subject of [[Jerry Beck]]'s 1994 book ''[[The 50 Greatest Cartoons]]'', placed ''Coal Black'' at number twenty-one, based upon votes from over 1000 members of the American animation industry. Scholarly animation texts including Michael Barrier's ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age'',<ref>[[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]], [http://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-Cartoons-American-Animation-Golden/dp/0195167295 ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age''], 2003, Oxford University Press, 978-0195167290</ref> name ''Coal Black'' as Clampett's undisputed masterpiece.  Despite its being banned, ''Coal Black'' is a popular draw at [[film festivals]] and small-audience screenings, and is often [[copyright infringement|bootlegged]] for release on home video.

It was seen briefly in the 1989 [[Turner Entertainment]] VHS release ''Cartoons For Big Kids'', hosted by Leonard Maltin, and in the ''Behind the Tunes'' featurette, "Once Upon a Looney Tune" in the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5]]'' [[DVD]] box set.

On April 24, 2010, ''Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs'', along with 7 other titles from the [[Censored Eleven]] was screened at the first annual [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] Film Festival as part of a special presentation hosted by film historian [[Donald Bogle]]; the eight shorts shown were restored for that release.

WARN  - 2014-11-30 14:42:59.859; org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.SolrWriter; Error creating document : SolrInputDocument(fields: [contents=The '''Violin Concerto''' ([[Opus number|Op.]] 36) by [[Arnold Schoenberg]] dates from Schoenberg's time in the [[United States]], where he had moved in 1933 to escape the [[Nazis]]. The piece was written in 1936, the same year as the [[String quartets (Schoenberg)|String Quartet No. 4]]. At the time of its completion, Schoenberg was living in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood, California]], and had just accepted a teaching position at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].

==Style and form==
Schoenberg had made a return to [[tonality|tonal]] writing upon his move to America and, though the Violin Concerto uses [[twelve-tone technique]], its [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] form demanded a mimesis of tonal melody, and hence a renunciation of the motivic technique used in his earlier work in favour of a thematic structure {{harv|Rosen|1996|loc=101}}. The basic row of the concerto is: 
<center>A–B{{Music|flat}}–E{{Music|flat}}–B–E–F{{Music|sharp}}–C–C{{Music|sharp}}–G–A{{Music|flat}}–D–F</center>
While the row is not necessary for understanding any good twelve-note piece, an awareness of it in this concerto is useful because the row is very much in the foreground, and is quite obviously abstracted from Schoenberg's concrete melodic-thematic thinking {{harv|Keller|1961|loc=157}}. 

It is in a three movement fast-slow-fast form, traditional for [[concerto]]s:

#''Poco allegro—Vivace''. Opinion is divided about the form of the first movement. According to one authority, it is in [[sonata form]] {{harv|Keller|1961|loc=157}}, while another asserts it is a large ternary form, concluding with a [[cadenza]] and a [[Coda (music)|coda]] {{harv|Mead|1985|loc=140}}. It employs a wide variety of row forms, often in families associated by [[Hexachordal combinatoriality|hexachordal content]] {{harv|Mead|1985|loc=141}}.
#''Andante grazioso''
#''Finale: Allegro''. The last movement is a [[rondo]] with an unusually dynamic development. It only gradually becomes clear that the underlying character is that of a march. There is a second cadenza just before the end, which rounds off the whole work in [[Cyclic form|cyclic]] fashion {{harv|Keller|1961|loc=157}}.

The concerto was premiered on December 6, 1940, by the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] conducted by [[Leopold Stokowski]] with [[Louis Krasner]] as the soloist (Krasner had previously given the premiere of the [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] by Schoenberg's pupil, [[Alban Berg]]).  Krasner later made a recording of the concerto, with [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]] and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]].

The concerto was first published in 1939 by [[G. Schirmer]].

==Instrumentation==

The orchestra calls for 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 3 oboes, piccolo clarinet, clarinet, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, glockenspiel, xylophone, bass drum, cymbals, tamtam, snare drum, triangle, tambourine, and strings.

'''Mario Orlando Hardy Hamlet Brenno Benedetti Farrugia'''<ref name=martinez/> ({{IPA-es|?ma?jo ?ene?ðeti|-|Mario Benedetti.ogg}}; 14 September 1920 – 17 May 2009),<ref name=death/>
known as '''Mario Benedetti''', was an [[Uruguayan people|Uruguayan]] [[journalist]], [[novelist]], and [[poet]] as well as being an integral member of the [[Generación del 45]]. In spite of publishing more than 80 books and being published in twenty languages he was not well known in the [[English language|English-speaking]] world,<ref name=gregory/> but in the [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking world he was considered one of [[Latin America]]'s most important  writers from the latter half of the 20th-century.<ref name=independent/>

==Early years==

Benedetti was born in [[Paso de los Toros]] in the department of  [[Tacuarembó]] to Brenno Benedetti y Matilde Farrugia, a family of Italian descent. Between 1938 and 1941 he lived in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. In 1946 he married Luz López Alegre.

He was a member of the '[[Generation of 45]]', a Uruguayan intellectual and literary movement: [[Carlos Maggi]], [[Manuel Flores Mora]], [[Ángel Rama]], [[Emir Rodríguez Monegal]], [[Idea Vilariño]], [[Carlos Real de Azúa]], [[José Pedro Díaz]], [[Amanda Berenguer]],  [[Ida Vitale]], [[Líber Falco]], [[Juan Carlos Onetti]], among others.<ref>[http://www.elpais.com.uy/Suple/EntrevistasDeDicandia/03/05/24/dicandia_42137.asp Generación del 45: severa en la crítica y brillante en la creación.]</ref>

He also wrote in the famous weekly Uruguayan newspaper ''[[Marcha (newspaper)|Marcha]]'' from 1945 until it was forcibly closed by the military government in 1973, and was its literary director from 1954.

==Exile==

From 1973 to 1985, when a [[Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay|civic-military dictatorship ruled Uruguay]], Benedetti lived in exile, first going to [[Buenos Aires]]. He then went to [[Lima]] in [[Peru]] where he was detained, deported and then given an amnesty. He went to [[Cuba]] in 1976 and the following year went to [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. His exile was made particularly trying as his wife had to remain in Uruguay to look after the mothers of both of them. In 1980 he moved to [[Palma, Majorca]].

==Return to Uruguay==
[[File:Mario Benedetti2.jpg|right|thumb|170px|Benedetti in Uruguay (1998?)]]
Benedetti returned to Uruguay in March 1983 following the restoration of democracy, dividing his time between [[Montevideo]] and [[Madrid]].  He was granted Honoris Causa doctorates by the [[Universidad de la República]], Uruguay, the [[Universidad de Alicante]], Spain and the [[Universidad de Valladolid]], Spain. In 1986 he was awarded [[Laureate Of The International Botev Prize]]. On June 7, 2005, he was named the recipient of the [[Menéndez Pelayo International Prize]]. His poetry was also used in the 1992 Argentine movie ''The Dark Side of the Heart'' (''El lado oscuro del corazón'') in which he read some of his poems in German.<ref>{{IMDb title|0104662|El lado oscuro del corazón}}</ref>

In 2006, Mario Benedetti signed a petition in support of the independence of [[Puerto Rico]] from the [[United States of America]].

==Illness and death==

In the last ten years of his life he suffered from [[asthma]] and spent his winters in Madrid (where it was summer) in order to avoid the cold, though as his health deteriorated he eventually remained in Montevideo. In 2006 his wife Luz López died, ending more than six decades of matrimony.
 
He died in [[Montevideo]] on 17 May 2009, a little after six pm. He had suffered from respiratory and intestinal problems for more than a year. His remains are buried at the National Pantheon, [[Central Cemetery of Montevideo]].<ref>[http://www.lr21.com.uy/justicia/365221-mario-benedetti Benedetti dies] {{es}}</ref>

Before dying, he dictated to his personal secretary, Ariel Silva what would become his last poem:<ref>[http://www.eldiario.com.ec/noticias-manabi-ecuador/119366-rostros-de-vos/ El Diario de Ecuador: Mario Benedetti dictates his last poem (in Spanish)]</ref>

:''Mi vida ha sido como una farsa''	
:''Mi arte ha consistido''	
:''En que esta no se notara demasiado''	
:''He sido como un levitador en la vejez''	
:''El brillo marrón de los azulejos''	
:''Jamás se separó de mi piel''
: (Fragment)

A free translation into English of these few lines might be as follows:

:''My life has been like a farce''	
:''My art has consisted''
:''In this not being noticed too much''
:''I've been as a levitator in my old age''	
:''The brown sheen of the tiles''
:''Never came off my skin''
: (Fragment)

== Works ==

For his poetry and novels Benedetti had won numerous international awards. ''La Tregua'', first published in 1960, has since been translated into over 20 languages and inspired [[The Truce (1974 film)|The Truce]].

The '''Lancia Delta''' is a compact luxury car produced by Italian automaker [[Lancia]] with the first generation produced between 1979 and 1994, the second generation from 1993 to 1999, and the third generation Delta entered production in 2008. 

The Delta was first shown at the [[Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung|Frankfurt Motor Show]] in 1979.<ref name="supercars.net">{{cite web|url= http://www.supercars.net/cars/2535.html |first=Richard |last=Owen |title=1991 Lancia Delta HF Integrale Evoluzione |publisher=supercars.net |accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> The Delta dominated the [[World Rally Championship]] during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The [[homologation]] requirements of [[Group A]] regulations meant marketing road-going versions of these competition cars — the Lancia Delta HF 4WD and HF Integrale. A total of 44,296 Integrales were produced.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.biser3a.com/cars/lancia-delta-hf-integrale |title=Lancia Delta HF Integrale |publisher=biser3a.com |accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref>

The first Delta (Type 831) was a five-door [[hatchback]], based on the [[Fiat Ritmo]], designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and released in 1979. Between 1980 and 1982, it was also sold in [[Sweden]] by [[Saab Automobile]], [[badge engineering|badged]] as the [[Saab-Lancia 600]]. The Delta was voted 1980 [[European Car of the Year]]. At launch it came with a choice of 1302cc 75&nbsp;bhp or 1498cc 85&nbsp;bhp engines and 5-speed gearbox. Later other engine options became available along with an optional automatic transmission. In 1983, 1585cc engines in both normally aspirated 105PS and [[turbocharged]] 130PS versions became available.

The Delta range was first introduced to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1980 and remained virtually unchanged until 1986, when small changes were made to the cars' body shape, the engines updated and the four-wheel drive model introduced.

A special '''Delta HF Integrale''' version was a [[four-wheel drive]] [[hot hatch]] with a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[petrol engine]]. Modified versions of the HF dominated the World Rally Championship, scoring [[List of World Rally Championship records|46 WRC victories overall]] and winning the [[List of World Rally Championship Constructors' Champions|Constructors Championship]] a record six times in a row from [[1987 World Rally Championship season|1987]] to [[1992 World Rally Championship season|1992]], in addition to [[List of World Rally Championship Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]] titles for [[Juha Kankkunen]] (1987 and [[1991 World Rally Championship season|1991]]) and [[Miki Biasion]] ([[1988 World Rally Championship season|1988]] and [[1989 World Rally Championship season|1989]]).

The [[Lancia Delta S4]], which the works team ran immediately prior to the HF 4WD and Integrale models' world championship careers from the season-ending [[1985 World Rally Championship season|1985]] [[RAC Rally]] until the end of the [[1986 World Rally Championship season|1986 season]], while sharing the same name and appearance, was a [[Group B]] race car designed and built specifically for [[rallying]], and was entirely different from the mass produced consumer versions.

===HF 4WD===
[[File:Lancia Delta HF turbo 001.JPG|thumb|Lancia Delta HF Turbo (FF)]]
[[File:Lancia Delta HF 4WD 1986.jpg|thumb|1986 Delta HF 4WD]]
[[Group B]] rallying was dropped at the end of the 1986 season, but the Delta HF 4WD was not suited to Group A rallying. The Delta HF Turbo became the road car top of the Delta range. There is very little to distinguish the car from the earlier 'Turbo i.e.' apart from the four-headlight system, fog lamps mounted in the front spoiler, 4WD badging on the rear hatch, small side skirts and two raised air intakes on the bonnet (hood). The later car is therefore virtually indistinguishable from the 1600 cc HF Turbo i.e.

In the Delta HF 4X4, Lancia opted for a four-wheel drive system with an in-built torque-splitting action. Three [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]]s were used. Drive to the front wheels is linked through a free-floating differential; drive to the rear wheels is transmitted via a 56/44 front/rear torque-splitting Ferguson viscous-coupling-controlled epicyclic central differential. At the rear wheels is a [[Torsen]] (torque sensing) rear differential. It divides the torque between the wheels according to the available grip, with a maximum lockup of 70%.

The basic suspension layout of the Delta 4WD remains the same as in the rest of the two-wheel drive Delta range: [[MacPherson strut]]–type independent suspension with dual-rate dampers and helicoidal springs, with the struts and springs set slightly off-centre.

The suspension mounting provided more isolation by incorporating flexible rubber links. Progressive rebound bumpers were adopted, while the damper rates, front and rear toe-in and the relative angle between springs and dampers have all been altered. The steering was power-assisted rack and pinion.

===Integrale 8v===
[[File:Martini op show 1989.jpg|thumb|right|1989 Lancia Delta HF Integrale 8V at the Birmingham Motorshow]]
The Lancia HF Integrale incorporated some of the features of the Delta HF 4WD into a road car. The engine was a 8-valve 2 L fuel injected 4-cylinder, with balancing shafts. The HF version featured new valves, valve seats and water pump, larger water and oil radiators, more powerful cooling fan and bigger air cleaner. A larger capacity [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett T3]] [[turbocharger]] with improved air flow and bigger inter-cooler, revised settings for the electronic injection/ignition control unit and a knock sensor, boost power output to 185&nbsp;[[Pferdestärke|bhp (DIN)]] (136&nbsp;kW) at 5300&nbsp;rpm and maximum torque of 31&nbsp;m·[[kilogram-force|kgf]] (304&nbsp;[[newton metre|N·m]], 224&nbsp;[[foot-pound force|lbf·ft]]) at 3500&nbsp;rpm.

The HF Integrale had permanent 4-wheel drive, a front transversely mounted engine and five-speed gearbox. An epicyclic centre differential normally splits the torque 56 per cent to the front axle, 44 per cent to the rear. A Ferguson viscous coupling balanced the torque split between front and rear axles depending on road conditions and tyre grip. The Torsen rear differential further divides the torque delivered to each rear wheel according to grip available. A shorter final drive ratio (3.111 instead of 2.944 on the HF 4WD) matched the larger 6.5x15 wheels to give 24&nbsp;mph/1000&nbsp;rpm (39&nbsp;km/h per 1000&nbsp;rpm) in fifth gear.

Braking and suspension were uprated to {{convert|284|mm|in|abbr=on}} ventilated front discs, a larger brake master cylinder and servo, as well as revised front springs, dampers, and front struts.

The HF Integrale was facelited with bulged wheel arches for the wider section 195/55 VR tyres on 15-inch 6J alloy wheels. A new bonnet incorporated air louvres while the restyled bumpers wrapped around to meet the wheel arches at front and rear. The front bumper, now wider, incorporates air intakes and for the rectangular auxiliary driving lights. The side skirts are faired into the wheel arches at front and rear and the twin rear view mirrors are finished in body colour.

===Integrale 16v===
The 16v Integrale was developed for rallying, introduced at the 1989 Geneva Motorshow,<ref name="carsfromitaly.net"/> and made a winning debut on the 1989 San Remo Rally.

It featured a raised centre of the bonnet to accommodate the new 16 valve engine, as well as wider wheels and tyres and new identity badges front and rear.  The torque split was changed to 47% front and 53% rear. 

The turbocharged 2-litre Lancia 16v engine produced 200&nbsp;bhp (149&nbsp;kW) at 5500&nbsp;rpm, for a maximum speed of 137&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h) and 0–100&nbsp;km/h (0-62&nbsp;mph) in 5.5&nbsp; seconds. Changes included larger injectors, a more responsive Garrett T3 [[turbocharger]], more efficient intercooler, and the ability to run on unleaded fuel without modification.

===Integrale Evoluzione===
[[File:Lancia Delta Evo vl EMS.jpg|thumb|Lancia Delta Evo]]
The first Evoluzione cars were built at the end of 1991 and through 1992. These were to be the final [[homologation]] cars for the Lancia Rally Team; the [[Catalytic]] Evoluzione II (below) was never rallied by the factory.

The Evoluzione I had a wider track front and rear than earlier Deltas.<ref name="supercars.net"/> The bodyside arches were extended and became more rounded. The wings were now made in a single pressing. The front strut top mounts were also raised, which necessitated a front strut brace. The new Integrale retained the four wheel drive layout. The engine was modified to produce 210&nbsp;bhp (157&nbsp;kW) at 5750&nbsp;rpm.

External changes included: new grilles in the front bumper to improve the air intake for engine compartment cooling; a redesigned bonnet (hood) with new lateral air slats to further assist underbonnet ventilation; an adjustable roof spoiler above the tailgate; new five-bolt wheels with the same design of the rally cars; and a new single exhaust pipe.

Interior trim was now grey [[Alcantara (material)|Alcantara]] on the [[Recaro]] seats, as fitted to the earlier 16V cars; leather and [[air conditioning]] were offered as options, as well as a leather-covered Momo steering wheel.

===Integrale Evoluzione II===
[[File:Lancia Delta Integrale Evo 2 IMG 9403.jpg|thumb|right|Lancia Delta HF Integrale 16v Evoluzione II]]
Presented in June 1993, the second Evolution version of the Delta HF Integrale featured an updated version of the 2-litre 16-valve turbo engine to produce more power, as well as a three-way catalyst and Lambda probe.<ref name="carsfromitaly.net">{{cite web|url= http://www.carsfromitaly.net/lancia/index.html |title=Lancia/Models |publisher=carsfromitaly.net |accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> A Marelli integrated engine control system with an 8&nbsp;MHz clock frequency which incorporates:
* timed sequential multipoint injection;
* self-adapting injection times;
* automatic idling control;
* engine protection strategies depending on the temperature of intaken air;
* Mapped ignition with two double outlet coils;
* Three-way catalyst and pre-catalyst with lambda probe ([[oxygen sensor]]) on the turbine outlet link;
* Anti-evaporation system with air line for canister flushing optimised for the turboengine;
* New [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] turbocharger: water-cooled with boost-drive management i.e. boost controlled by feedback from the central control unit on the basis of revs/throttle angle;
* Knock control by engine block sensor and new signal handling software for spark park advance, fuel quantity injected, and turbocharging;

The engine developed {{convert|215|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} DIN (against 210&nbsp;PS on the earlier uncatalysed version) and maximum torque of 32&nbsp;kgf·m (314&nbsp;N·m) (formerly 31&nbsp;kgf·m or 300&nbsp;N·m).

The 1993 Integrale received a cosmetic and functional facelift that included.
* new 16" light alloy rims with 205/45 ZR 16 tyres;
* body colour roof moulding to underline the connection between the roof and the Solar control windows;
* aluminium fuel cap and air-intake grilles on the front mudguards;
* red-painted cylinder head;
* new leather-covered three-spoke MOMO steering wheel;
* standard [[Recaro]] seats upholstered in beige [[Alcantara (material)|Alcantara]] with diagonal stitching.

===Rallying===
See: [[Lancia Delta Group A]]
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
[[File:Markku Alén - 1987 RAC Rally.jpg|thumb|[[Markku Alén]] at the 1987 RAC Rally]]
[[File:Lancia Delta Integrale - 2007 Rallye Deutschland.jpg|thumb|Lancia Delta HF Integrale - 2007 Rallye Deutschland]]
[[File:Delta gruppo A.jpg|thumb|Lancia Delta HF Integrale Evoluzione]]
During the early 1980s the top level of rallying was dominated by the [[Group B]] formula, for which Lancia produced the rear-drive [[Lancia 037|037]] and then, when that became obsolete, the Delta S4. The entire formula was abolished at the end of the 1986 season, however, after a string of fatal accidents, leaving [[Group A]] as the top formula for the 1987 and subsequent seasons.

The change in the rules left many manufacturers without a suitable car. However, The Delta HF 4WD featured a two-litre turbocharged engine and four-wheel-drive, but its wheel arches were restrictive and the wheels and brakes were too small, and the suspension travel was limited.

In 1987 the Lancias were driven by [[Massimo Biasion]], [[Juha Kankkunen]] and [[Markku Alén]].  Biasion opened with victory in the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] and later in the season won the Argentina and Sanremo rallies. However, Juha Kankkunen’s four podium places, coupled with victories on the [[Olympus Rally]] and the final round, the [[RAC Rally]], saw him clinch the title ahead of Markku Alén, whose title hopes ended on the RAC with a series of accidents, including overturning the car in front of the television cameras on one of the opening day's short spectator stages. Lancia won seven of the eleven rounds which counted towards the manufacturers’ championship, and with them the world title. However, Kankkunen left the team at the end of the season and joined Toyota.

The Delta HF 4WD also won the first two events of the 1988 season, [[Bruno Saby]] taking the win at Monte Carlo and Markku Alén in Sweden, before the Integrale appeared at the third round in Portugal. Markku Alen went out with transmission failure early in the event. However, the Biasion continued to win the event. A new and stronger six-speed gearbox was introduced for the next event. Lancia then dominated the rest of the season. Only once were they beaten in a straight fight, on the dry asphalt of Corsica by [[Didier Auriol]] in a Sierra Cosworth. By the season’s end Lancia had won ten of the eleven rounds which counted for the manufacturers’ series, and Biasion was drivers’ World Champion, having clinched the title on the penultimate round. Markku Alén rounded off the season with victory on the RAC Rally, a personal first for the Finn.

By this time serious competitors emerged, including the [[Toyota Celica GT-Four|Toyota Celica GT-Four ST165]], which in the hands of Juha Kankkunen had run Markku Alén close on the previous year’s 1000 Lakes Rally before retiring with mechanical failure. The Toyota remained unreliable for the first part of the 1989 season, however, and Lancia, with Biasion, Alen and Auriol (whom the team had recruited after his performances in the Ford the previous year) the lead drivers, were able to pull out a substantial championship lead. By the time guest driver [[Mikael Ericsson]] took it to victory on the Rally Argentina, the 8v Integrale had won all of its previous twelve World Championship events.  Later in the season, however, developmental difficulties with the [[Mitsubishi Galant]] were overcome and Mikael Ericsson, now driving for Mitsubishi, won the [[1000 Lakes Rally]], where no Lancias finished in the top three.  Kankkunen then took the Toyota to a maiden victory in Australia, with his team mate [[Kenneth Eriksson]] second and Alén third.  The Integrale was beginning to slip behind its key competitors, but by then Lancia was already working on the next evolution.

The Integrale 16v made its début on the 1989 [[Rallye Sanremo]] where, for the first and only time, it ran in Italian racing red. Didier Auriol went out early in the event after a high-speed crash, but Biasion went on to win. Having won the both the manufacturers’ and drivers’ titles for the third year running, Lancia declined to contest the final round of the season, the RAC Rally.  Lancia continued to use the 16v Integrale throughout the 1990 season.  Juha Kankkunen rejoined the team, joining Biasion and Auriol.   Lancia won the manufacturers’ title, with six wins, but these were shared between the team's three drivers, and in the drivers’ title race Sainz, driving a [[Toyota Celica GT-Four]], took the lead.  The issue was eventually settled on the RAC Rally, when Kankkunen crashed whilst leading, leaving the Spanish driver to take the title, the first time since 1986 that Lancia had not won both drivers’ and manufacturers’ championships.

The 1991 season saw another close battle between Toyota and Lancia. Juha Kankkunen the Delta took wins in Kenya, Argentina, Finland, and Australia, and Didier Auriol also won at Sanremo, give Lancia the manufacturers’ title for a record fifth time.  Meanwhile, Sainz crashed out in Australia and retired with electrical failure in Catalunya, putting Kankkunen in contention for the driver’s title. The 1991 RAC Rally saw a close battle in the British forests between Kankkunen and Sainz, which was settled late in the event when the head gasket blew on Sainz's Toyota, giving Kankkunen his third driver's championship.

During the latter part of the season, Lancia developed the Evoluzione version of the Delta, sometimes nicknamed the 'Deltona' or 'Super Delta,' which would début on the 1992 Monte Carlo. This final evolution, with its stiffer body, wider wheel arches, bigger wheels and brakes, improved suspension and aerodynamics and more powerful engine, was 5-6% faster under most circumstances than the 16v car. Lancia officially withdrew from rallying at the end of 1991. For the next two seasons the cars would be run by the semi-private [[Jolly Club]] team, albeit initially with continuing support from the factory.

For 1992, Auriol dominated the early part of the season for Lancia, taking a record six wins and pulling out a large championship lead. Kankkunen also scored consistent podium finishes and a win in Portugal, whilst guest driver [[Andrea Aghini]] won the Rallye Sanremo. Lancia took the manufacturers’ title for a sixth consecutive year.

For 1993, Auriol and Kankkunen both left Lancia and joined the Toyota team, while Sainz moved to the Jolly Club, where he was supported by Aghini and [[Gustavo Trelles]]. Lancia's sponsorship from Martini also ended, and the Jolly Club Deltas ran in the colours of Sainz’s sponsor, oil firm [[Repsol]]. With the end of the factory’s involvement technical developments were minor. Sainz took second on the [[Acropolis Rally]], but that was the car’s best placing. He finished second again at Sanremo, but the team was subsequently disqualified and docked points for fuel irregularities, and Sainz had by then retired from the Catalunya Rally with electrical failure. The Jolly Club decided not to contest the final round of the series and withdrew, signalling the end of both the Delta's career as a top-line rally car and Lancia's involvement in the World Rally Championship.

In total, the four evolutions of the Lancia Delta won 46 World Championship rallies, and Lancia’s run of six consecutive manufacturers’ titles remains a record.

Outside the World Championship the Delta was used by several private teams, with varying degrees of backing from the works team. Jolly Club ran as a second-string team throughout the Group A era, before taking over from the official works team for 1992-3. Other teams using the car included Astra Motorsport and HF Grifone. Drivers using Deltas run by teams such as these won the European title in every year between 1987 and 1991, and also in 1993, the car’s last major success. Astra continued to run Deltas on European and some World Championship events in 1994, the best result being fourth place for [[Alessandro Fiorio]] on the Acropolis Rally.  Deltas also took many national titles in continental Europe.

== {{anchor|Saab|SAAB|600}} Saab-Lancia 600 ==
[[File:1981 SAAB-Lancia 600.jpg|thumb|1981 SAAB-Lancia 600]]

The '''Saab-Lancia 600''' is a [[rebadged]] Lancia Delta, sold by [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] after a deal with [[Lancia]].

The deal was a part of the 1980s co-operation between the [[Sweden|Swedish]] car manufacturer [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] and the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Fiat Group]], which includes Lancia and [[Alfa Romeo]] in addition to Fiat. The partnership also resulted in the '[[Type Four platform|Type 4]]' project, which provided the common platforms for the [[Saab 9000]], the [[Lancia Thema]], the [[Fiat Croma]] and the [[Alfa Romeo 164]].

The 600 was developed because Saab did not have the finances to support the production of entirely new models and looked to other companies in order to provide a new model line-up.

The first years it was sold as GLS and the exclusive GLE, but due to poor sales because of the high price tag the GLE-model was later dropped from the lineup. It was offered only with the 1.5-litre engine that had 85 horsepower connected to a manual 5-speed gearbox.

The Saab-Lancia 600 was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and, in common with the company's other models, was a [[front-wheel drive]] and a [[hatchback]], with a [[rallying]] pedigree. The Lancia Delta earned the [[European Car of the Year]] Award in 1980.

The Saab-Lancia 600 was sold only in Sweden, Finland, and [[Norway]].

==Lancia Hyena==
[[File:Lancia Hyena CENTENARY.jpg|right|thumb|Lancia Hyena]]
The Integrale based Hyena was an initiative of the Dutch classic car restorer and collector Paul Koot in collaboration with [[Zagato]]. The Hyena was designed in 1990 by Marco Pedracini (Zagato), and introduced at the Brussels Motor Show in January 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.italiaspeed.com/2004/cars/lancia/12/delta/2512_4.html |title=Christmas Special: 25 Years Of The Lancia Delta - The Ultimate Pocket Rocket Rally Extraordinaire |date=27 December 2004 |publisher=italiaspeed.com |accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> The Hyena was based on the Delta Integrale floorpan structure, but with a 2-door coupe body.

Fiat refused to participate in the project, which complicated the production process.  Integrales were stripped down in The Netherlands and then sent to Zagato in Italy to have the new composite/alloy body fitted and for final assembly. All of this made the Hyena very expensive to build and they were sold for around $75,000.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z1516/Zagato_Hyena/default.aspx |title=1993 Lancia Hyena news, pictures, specifications, and information |publisher=conceptcarz.com |accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> The Hyena weighed around {{convert|200|kg|lb|-1}} less than original Integrale, had {{convert|250|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and could accelerate from 0–100&nbsp;km in 5.4 seconds.<ref name="carfolio.com/Hyena">{{cite web|url= http://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=95931 |title=1992 Lancia Hyena technical specifications |publisher=carfolio.com |accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref>

The successor to the original Delta, the 'Nuova Delta' (Type 836), was introduced in 1993 based on the [[Fiat Tipo]] platform. The Nuova Delta was targeted at customers more interested in comfort and convenience.

The Nuova Delta was offered with engine versions up to {{convert|193|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, but without four-wheel drive. Until 1995 only five-door hatchback body styles was offered, when the three-door was introduced under the name HPE. In 1996 two 1.8-litre engines were introduced (one with variable valve timing) and the naturally aspirated 2.0 was discontinued.

The Delta was dropped from Lancia's lineup in 1999, with no immediate successor. The [[Lancia Dedra|Dedra]] was axed at the same time and was replaced by the [[Lancia Lybra|Lybra]], which was not offered with a hatchback body style.

In September 2006, Lancia announced the revival of the Delta name, with new cars to be built on the [[Fiat C platform]].<ref>[http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/news.php?sid=139&page=1 "Lancia lifts lid on new Delta" — CAR Magazine]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref>

The world première of the new HPE concept was held at the 63rd [[Venice International Film Festival]].

The new Lancia Delta (Type 844) was unveiled at the 2008 [[Geneva Motor Show]].

The Lancia brand was reintroduced to the Scandinavian, Russian, and Turkish markets in 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/motoring/news/article.cfm?c_id=9&objectid=10492663 |title=New Lancia Delta for Geneva show |accessdate=2008-09-13|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |first=Gilles |last=Castonguay |date=15 February 2008 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> The new Delta meant a return by Lancia to the UK market during 2009.

Delta as well as being an historical name from Lancia’s past is also being interpreted this time around by Lancia as a mathematical symbol that stands for change, difference and evolution. Designed by the Lancia Style Centre, this car is aimed at the luxury end of the small family car segment. The Delta is {{convert|4.52|m|in|1|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|1.797|m|in|1|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|1.499|m|in|1|abbr=on}} high, and has a wheelbase of {{convert|2.7|m|in|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} more than the [[Fiat Bravo#Second generation|Fiat Bravo]]. It has five doors and can be considered a hatchback or an estate (see [[Hatchback#Hatchback vs. station wagon|Hatchback vs. Station wagon]]).

At the 2010 [[North American International Auto Show]], a [[badge engineering|badge-engineered]] version of the Delta under the [[Chrysler]] brand was unveiled as a concept car for a potential North American release.<ref name="delta-concept-us">{{cite web|url= http://www.caranddriver.com/news/car/10q1/chrysler_delta_concept-auto_shows |title=Chrysler Delta Concept - Auto Shows |last=Gall |first=Jared |date=11 January 2010 |publisher=Car and Driver |accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref>  The Delta, along with the [[Lancia Ypsilon|Ypsilon]], is marketed as a Chrysler in the UK and Ireland.

===Features===
The new Delta offers a number of options and equipment including a [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] Hi-Fi radio incorporating a CD player and [[MP3]] file reader with steering-wheel mounted controls, the [[Blue&Me]] system developed with [[Microsoft]], and a new satellite navigation system developed with [[Magneti Marelli]].

Further technical equipment included to effect the ride and handling will include an advanced ESC (Electronic Stability Control) system and SDC suspension (with [[semi-active suspension|electronic damping control]], also by Magneti Marelli).

The new Delta also has a driving assistant featuring electric eye monitors that give feedback to steering wheel to suggest corrections to the driver. The car is available also with semi-automatic parking assistant.

===2011 facelift===
The 2011 facelift of the Delta received trim level changes, a Chrysler-derived 'family' grille, and a {{convert|105|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} 1.6-litre Multijet diesel engine with lower fuel consumption and {{co2}} emissions.
The new version of the Delta was expected to be presented at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/others/motor_shows/geneva/preview/lancia/delta/1402.html |title=Lancia's Delta gets a model year spruce up for Geneva |date=14 February 2011 |work=www.italiaspeed.com |accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref>

The '''United States Motor Company''' (USMC) was organized by [[Benjamin Briscoe]] in 1910 as a selling company, to represent various manufacturers. It had begun life as the International Motor Company in 1908 in an attempt to create the first major consolidation within the industry with Maxwell-Briscoe and Buick, which did not succeed.  International Motor was renamed USMC in December 1909.  By the end of 1910 there were 11 constituent companies, each still headed by the individual who had built each company originally. During 1910, rumors surfaced that United States Motor Company was going to merge with General Motors, but Briscoe scotched the rumors by stating that any attempt to integrate General Motors into USMC would create chaos.

This was an effort to try to save several independent automotive manufacturing companies who were having great difficulty in getting the necessary financial backing. Those companies included: [[Maxwell automobile|Maxwell]], [[Stoddard-Dayton]], [[Courier Car Co]], [[Columbia Automobile Company]], [[Brush Motor Car Company]], Alden Sampson Trucks, Gray Marine, and Providence Engineering Works, with the Thomas and other lines coming aboard later.  

1910 production announced in mid-year included 15,000 Maxwells, 10,000 Brush Runabouts, and 10,000 of the Stoddard-Dayton, Columbia, and Alden Sampson Trucks. Later in 1910, Briscoe formed United Motors International, Ltd. to handle international sales of the United States Motor Company, focused mainly on England.

Announcing some price reductions for 1911 models, the company stated that it had 18 plants with combined floorspace of {{convert|49|acre|m2}} with 14,000 employees capable of producing 52,000 vehicles.  There were 52 models offered in 1911.  It was claimed that there was no left over stock of unsold cars from the 1910 model year and that business was up fifty-seven percent from the year earlier period.  

Briscoe several times complained that the antipathy of bankers to the automobile industry was hampering growth.  In early 1912, the company suspended dividend payments on its preferred stock and in September 1912 year went into [[bankruptcy|receivership]]. The bankers attributed the failure to bad management. A conflict between two of its backers, who also had a financial interest in [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], led to the downfall. Briscoe retired in late 1912 and was replaced by Walter E. Flanders as manager for the receivers committee. The assets of the United States Motor Company and constituent companies were sold for $7,080,000 at a public foreclosure sale in January 1913. 

The USMC assets were purchased by [[Walter Flanders]], who reorganized the company as the Maxwell Motor Company, Inc. This was the only surviving member of the group. In the early 1920s this company was reorganized and became [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]].

'''Caroli disease''' is a rare inherited disorder characterized by dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts.  There are two types of Caroli disease, the most common being the simple, or isolated case where the bile ducts are widened by [[ectasia]]. The second, more complex, cause is commonly known as Caroli Syndrome. This complex form is also linked with portal [[hypertension]] and [[congenital hepatic fibrosis]].
<ref name=Karim>{{cite journal |author=Karim B |title=Caroli’s Disease Case Reports |journal=Indian Pediatrics |volume=41 |issue= 8|pages=848–50 |date=August 2007 |url=http://www.indianpediatrics.net/aug2004/848.pdf|format=PDF |pmid=15347876}}</ref> The differences between the causes of the two cases have not yet been discovered. Caroli disease is also associated with [[liver failure]] and [[polycystic kidney disease]]. The disease affects about 1 in 1,000,000 people, with more reported cases of Caroli syndrome than of Caroli disease.
<ref name=EMedRad>{{EMedicine|radio|131|Romano WJ: Caroli Disease}}</ref>

Caroli disease also is known as communicating cavernous ectasia, or congenital cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic [[biliary tree]]. Caroli disease is distinct from other diseases that cause ductal dilatation caused by obstruction, in that it is not one of the many [[choledochal cyst]] derivatives.

== Causes ==

The cause appears to be genetic; the simple form is an [[autosomal dominant]] trait while the complex form is an [[autosomal recessive]] trait.<ref name="Karim" /> Females are more prone to Caroli disease than males.<ref name="Kahn">[http://chorus.rad.mcw.edu/doc/00059.html Kahn, Charles E, Jr. January 2003. Collaborative Hypertext of Radiology. Medical College of Wisconsin.]</ref> Family history may include kidney and liver disease due to the link between Caroli Disease and [[ARPKD]].<ref name="EMedPed">{{EMedicine|PED|325|Friedman JR: Caroli Disease}}</ref> [[PKHD1]], the gene linked to ARPKD, has been found mutated in patients with Caroli syndrome. PKHD1 is expressed primarily in the kidneys with lower levels in the [[liver]], [[pancreas]], and [[lungs]], a pattern consistent with phenotype of the disease, which primarily affects the liver and [[kidneys]].<ref name="Karim" /><ref name="EMedPed" /> The genetic basis for the difference between Caroli disease and Caroli syndrome has not been defined.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The first symptoms typically include [[fever]], intermittent [[abdominal pain]], and [[hepatomegaly]]. Occasionally [[jaundice]] occurs.
<ref name="Medcyc">{{cite web|url=http://www.medcyclopaedia.com/library/topics/volume_iv_1/c/CAROLIS_DISEASE.aspx|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120205102047/http://www.medcyclopaedia.com/library/topics/volume_iv_1/c/CAROLIS_DISEASE.aspx|archivedate=2012-02-05|title=Carolis disease|publisher=[[General Electric|GE]]|work=Medcyclopaedia}}</ref> Caroli disease usually occurs in the presence of other diseases, such as autosomal recessive [[polycystic kidney disease]], [[cholangitis]], [[gallstones]], [[bilary abscess]], [[septicemia]], liver [[cirrhosis]], [[renal failure]], and [[cholangiocarcinoma]] (7% affected).<ref name=Karim/> People with Caroli disease are 100 times more at risk for cholangiocarcinoma than the general population.<ref name="Medcyc"/> After recognizing symptoms of related diseases, Caroli disease can be diagnosed.

Morbidity is common and is caused by complications of cholangitis, [[sepsis]], [[choledocholithiasis]], and [[cholangiocarcinoma]].<ref name="Lendoire">{{cite journal |author=Lendoire J, Schelotto PB, Rodríguez JA, ''et al.'' |title=Bile duct cyst type V (Caroli's disease): surgical strategy and results |journal=HPB (Oxford) |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=281–4 |year=2007 |pmid=18345305 |doi=10.1080/13651820701329258 |pmc=2215397}}</ref> These morbid conditions often prompt the diagnosis. Portal hypertension may be present, resulting in other conditions including [[splenomegaly]], [[hematemesis]] and [[melena]].<ref name="EMedPed" /> These problems can severely affect the patient's quality of life. In a ten-year period between 1995 and 2005, only ten patients were surgically treated for Caroli disease, with an average patient age of 45.8 years.<ref name="Lendoire" />

After reviewing 46 cases of Caroli disease before 1990, it was found that 21.7% of the cases were the result of an intraheptic cyst or non-obstructive biliary tree dilation, 34.7% were linked with [[congenital hepatic fibrosis]], 13% were isolated choledochal cystic dilation, and the remaining 24.6% had a combination of all three.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Choi BI, Yeon KM, Kim SH, Han MC |title=Caroli disease: central dot sign in CT |journal=Radiology |volume=174 |issue=1 |pages=161–3 |date=1 January 1990|pmid=2294544 |url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2294544 |doi=10.1148/radiology.174.1.2294544}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
Modern imaging techniques allow the diagnosis to be made more easily and without invasive imaging of the biliary tree.<ref name=p17418061>{{cite journal |author=Ananthakrishnan AN, Saeian K |title=Caroli's disease: identification and treatment strategy |journal=Curr Gastroenterol Rep |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=151–5 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17418061 |doi=10.1007/s11894-007-0010-7 }}</ref>  Commonly the disease is limited to the left lobe of the liver. Images taken by [[CT-scan]], [[X-ray]], or [[MRI]] will show enlarged [[intrahepatic]] (in the liver) bile ducts due to ectasia. Using an [[ultrasound]], tubular dilation of the bile ducts can be seen. On a CT-Scan, Caroli disease can be observed by noting the many fluid-filled, tubular structures extending to the liver.<ref name="Medcyc"/> A high contrast CT must be used to distinguish the difference between stones and widened ducts. Bowel gas and digestive habits make it difficult to obtain a clear [[Medical ultrasonography|sonogram]], therefore, a CT scan is a good substitution. When the intrahepatic bile duct wall has protrusions, it is clearly seen as central dots or a linear streak.<ref name=Chiba/> Caroli disease is commonly diagnosed after this “central dot sign” is detected on a CT scan or ultrasound.<ref name=Chiba>{{cite journal |author=Chiba T, Shinozaki M, Kato S, Goto N, Fujimoto H, Kondo F |title=Caroli's disease: central dot sign re-examined by CT arteriography and CT during arterial portography |journal=Eur Radiol |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=701–2 |date=March 2002 |pmid=11870491 |doi=10.1007/s003300101048 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/1gptbh2y011a292j/fulltext.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> However, [[cholangiography]] is the best, and final, approach to show the enlarged bile ducts as a result of Caroli disease.

==Treatment==
The treatment depends on clinical features and the location of the biliary abnormality. When the disease is localized to one hepatic lobe, [[hepatectomy]] relieves symptoms and appears to remove the risk of [[malignancy]].<ref name=Taylor>{{cite journal |author=Taylor AC, Palmer KR |title=Caroli's disease |journal=Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=105–8 |date=February 1998 |pmid=9581983 |doi=10.1097/00042737-199802000-00001}}</ref> There is good evidence that malignancy complicates Caroli disease in approximately 7% of cases.<ref name=Taylor/>

Antibiotics are used to treat the inflammation of the bile duct, and ursodeoxycholic acid for hepatolithiasis.<ref name=p17418061/> [[Ursodiol]] is given to treat cholelithiasis. In diffuse cases of Caroli disease, treatment options include conservative or endoscopic therapy, internal biliary bypass procedures and liver transplantation in carefully selected cases.<ref name=Taylor/> Surgical resection has been used successfully in patients with monolobar disease.<ref name=p17418061/> An orthotopic [[liver transplant]] is another option, used only when antibiotics have no effect, in combination with recurring cholangitis. With a liver transplant, cholangiocarcinoma is usually avoided in the long run.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ulrich F, Steinmüller T, Settmacher U, ''et al.'' |title=Therapy of Caroli's disease by orthotopic liver transplantation |journal=Transplant. Proc. |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=2279–80 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12270398 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0041134502032359 |doi=10.1016/S0041-1345(02)03235-9}}</ref>

Family studies are necessary to determine if Caroli disease is due to inheritable causes. Regular follow-ups, including ultrasounds and liver biopsies, are performed.

== Prognosis ==
Mortality is indirect and caused by complications. After [[cholangitis]] occurs, patients typically die within approximately 5–10 years.<ref name="EMedRad" />

== Epidemiology ==
Caroli disease is typically found in [[Asia]] and diagnosed in persons under the age of 22. Cases have also been found in both infants and adults. As medical imaging technology improves, diagnostic age decreases.

== History ==
Jacques Caroli, a [[gastroenterologist]], first described a rare congenital condition in 1958 in [[Paris]], [[France]].
<ref name="Kahn" /><ref name="WhoNamedIt">{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|3078|Jacques Caroli}}</ref>
He described it as "nonobstructive saccular or fusiform multi-focal segmental dilatation of the intra-hepatic bile ducts"; basically, he observed cavernous ectasia in the biliary tree causing a chronic, often life-threatening [[hepatobiliary]] disease.
<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miller WJ, Sechtin AG, Campbell WL, Pieters PC |title=Imaging findings in Caroli's disease |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=165 |issue=2 |pages=333–7 |date=1 August 1995|pmid=7618550 |url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7618550 |doi=10.2214/ajr.165.2.7618550}}</ref> Caroli, born in [[France]] in 1902, learned and practiced medicine in [[Angers]]. After [[World War II]] he was chief of service for 30 years at [[Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University|Saint-Antoine]] in [[Paris]]. Before dying in 1979, he was honored with the rank of commander in the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1976.<ref name="WhoNamedIt" />

'''John Michael Turturro''' (born February 28, 1957) is an American actor, writer and director known for his roles in the films ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'' (1989), ''[[Miller's Crossing]]'' (1990), ''[[Barton Fink]]'' (1991), ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' (1994), ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998), ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' (2000) and the first three films in the [[Transformers (film series)|''Transformers'' film series]] (2007–2011). He has appeared in over sixty films, and has worked frequently with the [[Coen brothers]], [[Adam Sandler]] and [[Spike Lee]].

==Early life==
Turturro was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], the son of Katherine, an amateur [[jazz]] singer who worked in a [[US Navy|Navy]] yard during [[World War II]], and Nicholas Turturro, a carpenter and construction worker who fought as a Navy sailor on [[D-Day]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800021684/bio |title=John Turturro Biography - Yahoo!

He majored in Theatre Arts at the [[State University of New York at New Paltz]], and completed his [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] at the [[Yale School of Drama]].

==Career==
[[File:JohnTurturroSept10TIFF.jpg|thumb|right|Turturro at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]]]]
Turturro's first film appearance was a non-speaking [[extra (actor)|extra]] role in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s critically acclaimed ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980).<ref name="Cat" /> Turturro then created the title role of [[John Patrick Shanley]]'s ''Danny and the Deep Blue Sea'' at the Playwrights Conference at the [[Eugene O'Neill]] Theatre Center in 1983. He repeated it the following year [[Off-Broadway]] and won an [[Obie Award]].

[[Spike Lee]] liked Turturro's performance in ''[[Five Corners (film)|Five Corners]]'' so much that he cast him in ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''. This movie was the first of a long-standing collaboration between the [[film director|director]] and Turturro, which includes work together on a total of nine films—more than any other actor in the Lee [[Work of art|oeuvre]]--<ref name=NYO>{{cite news|last=Akers|first=W.M.|title=The Long and the Short of It|newspaper=The New York Observer -Fall Arts Preview|date=19 September 2011}}</ref>  including  ''[[Mo' Better Blues]]'' (1990), ''[[Jungle Fever]]'' (1991), ''[[Clockers (film)|Clockers]]'' (1995), ''[[Girl 6 (film)|Girl 6]]'' (1996), ''[[He Got Game]]'' (1998), ''[[Summer of Sam]]'' (1999), ''[[She Hate Me]]'' (2004), and ''[[Miracle at St. Anna]]'' (2008).

Turturro has appeared in both comedy and drama films, and engaged in an extended collaboration with the [[Coen Brothers]]—he appeared in their films ''[[Miller's Crossing]]'' (1990), ''[[Barton Fink]]'' (1991), ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998), and ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' (2000). He has also appeared in several of [[Adam Sandler]]'s movies, such as ''[[Mr. Deeds]]'' (2002) and ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'' (2008). He played a severely disturbed patient of [[Jack Nicholson]]'s character in the comedy ''[[Anger Management (film)|Anger Management]]'' and played [[Johnny Depp]]'s character's antagonist in ''[[Secret Window]]''. Turturro hosted ''Saturday Night Live'' in 1994, where he spoofed his recent film ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'', being told he was ineligible to host unless he answered questions in a booth and if he failed, the honor of hosting would go to [[Joey Buttafuoco]], who was actually backstage to witness Turturro's test.

He won an Emmy award for his portrayal of Adrian Monk's brother [[Ambrose Monk|Ambrose]] in the [[USA Network]] series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', and has reprised the role on numerous occasions. He has also been nominated and won many awards from film organizations such as [[Screen Actors Guild]], [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[Golden Globes]] and others.

Turturro produced and directed, as well as acted in, the film ''[[Illuminata (film)|Illuminata]]'' (1999), which also starred his wife Katherine Borowitz. He wrote and directed the film ''[[Romance and Cigarettes]]'' (2005). In 2006 he appeared in [[Robert De Niro]]'s ''[[The Good Shepherd (film)|The Good Shepherd]]'', and as the Sector 7 agent Simmons in three films of the [[Transformers (film series)|''Transformers'' live-action series]]. In 2010 he directed (and had cameo on-screen appearances in) ''[[Passione (2010 film)|Passione]]'', which chronicles the rich musical heritage of [[Naples|Naples, Italy]].

His stage directorial debut was in October 2011, with the Broadway play "Relatively Speaking," in which he guided an ensemble of  veteran actors in a production of three comedic one-act plays, written by [[Elaine May]], [[Woody Allen]] and [[Ethan Coen]]. The cast included [[Julie Kavner]], [[Marlo Thomas]],  [[Mark Linn-Baker]] and [[Steve Guttenberg]].<ref name=NYO />

Turturro's fifth directorial film ''[[Fading Gigolo]]'' premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF)]] in mid-September 2013. Turturro also acts in the film alongside Woody Allen, who plays a novice [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] overseeing the sex work of Turturro's character. In a September 2013 interview, Turturro expressed his intention to draw parallels between sex work and acting, explaining that the latter is a "service business" in which actors are "acting out people's wishes or fantasies."<ref name="Cat">{{cite news|title=John Turturro on nuns, Woody Allen and middle-aged sex|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/12/john-turturro-nuns-woody-allen-sex|accessdate=13 September 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 September 2013|first=Catherine|last=Shoard}}</ref>
In March 2014, John Turturro received the Career Achievement tribute and award at the 31st Edition of the Miami International Film Festival at the Olympia Theater in Downtown Miami.

==Personal life==
Turturro's brother is actor [[Nicholas Turturro]]. Artist Ralph Turturro, composer and film director [[Richard Termini]] and actress [[Aida Turturro]]  are his cousins. He has two children, Amedeo (born 1990) and Diego (born 2000), with his wife, actress Katherine Borowitz.<ref name="religion">{{cite web|last=Pfefferman |first=Naomi |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/articles/item/the_arts_19980420/ |title=Far Beyond Tears |publisher=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]] |date=1998-04-19 |accessdate=2010-03-14}}</ref>

WARN  - 2014-11-30 14:42:59.968; org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.SolrWriter; Error creating document : SolrInputDocument(fields: [contents=The '''Violin Concerto in D major''', [[Opus number|Op.]] 35, was written by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] in 1878. It is one of the best known [[violin concerto]]s, and is considered one of the most technically difficult works for the [[violin]]. [[File:Tchaikovsky.gif|right|thumb|357x357px]]

==Instrumentation==
The concerto is scored for two [[flutes]], two [[oboes]], two [[clarinets]] in A and B-flat, two [[bassoons]], four [[French horn|horns]] in F, two [[trumpets]] in D, [[timpani]] and [[string section|strings]].

==Form==
The piece is in three movements:

# Allegro moderato (D major)
# ''Canzonetta'': Andante (G minor)
# ''Finale'': Allegro vivacissimo (D major)

There is [[wikt:attacca|no break or pause]] between the second and third movements.

A typical performance runs approximately 35 minutes.

==Composition==
[[File:Kotek iosif.jpg|thumb|right|Tchaikovsky (right) with violinist [[Iosif Kotek]]]]
The piece was written in [[Clarens, Switzerland|Clarens]], a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] resort on the shores of [[Lake Geneva]], where Tchaikovsky had gone to recover from the depression brought on by his disastrous marriage to [[Antonina Miliukova]]. He was working on his [[Piano Sonata in G major (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Sonata in G major]] but finding it heavy going.  Presently he was joined there by his composition pupil, the violinist [[Iosif Kotek]], who had been in [[Berlin]] for violin studies with [[Joseph Joachim]]. The two played works for violin and piano together, including a violin-and-piano arrangement of [[Édouard Lalo]]'s ''[[Symphonie espagnole]]'', which they may have played through the day after Kotek's arrival. This work may have been the catalyst for the composition of the concerto.<ref>Brown, ''Crisis Years'', 260.</ref> He wrote to his patroness [[Nadezhda von Meck]], "It [the ''Symphonie espagnole''] has a lot of freshness, lightness, of piquant rhythms, of beautiful and excellently harmonized melodies.... He [Lalo], in the same way as [[Léo Delibes]] and [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]], does not strive after profundity, but he carefully avoids routine, seeks out new forms, and thinks more about ''musical beauty'' than about observing established traditions, as do the Germans."<ref>As quoted in Brown, ''Crisis Years'', 260.</ref> Tchaikovsky authority Dr. David Brown writes that Tchaikovsky "might almost have been writing the prescription for the violin concerto he himself was about to compose."<ref>Brown, ''Crisis Years'', 260—261.</ref>

Tchaikovsky made swift, steady progress on the concerto, as by this point in his rest cure he had regained his inspiration, and the work was completed within a month despite the middle movement getting a complete rewrite (a version of the original movement was preserved as the first of the  three pieces for violin and piano, ''[[Souvenir d'un lieu cher]]'').<ref name="brown261">Brown, ''Crisis Years'', 261.</ref> Since Tchaikovsky was not a violinist, he sought the advice of Kotek on the completion of the solo part.<ref>Steinberg, 484.</ref> "How lovingly he's busying himself with my concerto!" Tchaikovsky wrote to his brother Anatoly on the day he completed the new slow movement. "It goes without saying that I would have been able to do nothing without him. He plays it marvelously."<ref>As quoted in Brown, ''Crisis Years'', 261.</ref>

Tchaikovsky wanted to dedicate the concerto to Iosif Kotek, but felt constrained by the gossip this would undoubtedly cause about the true nature of his relationship with the younger man. (They were almost certainly lovers at one point, and Tchaikovsky was always at pains to disguise his homosexuality from the general public.)<ref>Alexander Poznansky, Tchaikovsky: The Quest for the Inner Man, p. 297</ref> In 1881, he broke with Kotek after he refused to play the Violin Concerto, believing it was poorly received and would do damage to his budding career. However, he did dedicate to Kotek the ''[[Valse-Scherzo (Tchaikovsky)|Valse-Scherzo in C]]'' for violin and orchestra, written in 1877, on its publication in 1878.

Tchaikovsky intended the first performance to be given by [[Leopold Auer]], for whom he had written his ''[[Sérénade mélancolique]]'' for violin and orchestra, and accordingly dedicated the work to him. Auer refused, however, meaning that the planned premiere for March 1879 had to be cancelled and a new soloist found.<ref>Brown, ''Crisis Years'', 261–262.</ref> In 1912, Auer told his version of the story to the New York magazine ''[[Musical Courier]]'':

<blockquote>When Tchaikovsky came to me one evening, about thirty years ago [actually thirty-four], and presented me with a roll of music, great was my astonishment on finding this proved to be the Violin Concerto, dedicated to me, completed and already in print. [This was the reduction for violin and piano, printed in 1878; the publication of the full score did not take place until 1888.] My first feeling was one of gratitude for this proof of his sympathy toward me, which honored me as an artist. On closer acquaintance with the composition, I regretted that the great composer had not shown it to me before committing it to print. Much unpleasantness might then have been spared us both....</blockquote>

[[Image:Leopold Auer.jpg|thumb|right|Leopold Auer]]

<blockquote>Warmly as I had championed the symphonic works of the young composer (who was at that time not universally recognized), I could not feel the same enthusiasm for the Violin Concerto, with the exception of the first movement; still less could I place it on the same level as his purely orchestral compositions. I am still of the same opinion. My delay in bringing the concerto before the public was partly due to this doubt in my mind as to its intrinsic worth, and partly that I would have found it necessary, for purely technical reasons, to make some slight alterations in the passages of the solo part. This delicate and difficult task I subsequently undertook, and re-edited the violin solo part, and it is this edition which has been played by me, and also by my pupils, up to the present day. It is incorrect to state that I had declared the concerto in its original form unplayable. What I did say was that some of the passages were not suited to the character of the instrument, and that, however perfectly rendered, they would not sound as well as the composer had imagined. From this purely aesthetic point of view only I found some of it impracticable, and for this reason I re-edited the solo part.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Tchaikovsky, hurt at my delay in playing the concerto in public and quite rightly too (I have often deeply regretted it, and before his death received absolution from him), now proceeded to have a second edition published, and dedicated the concerto this time to Adolf Brodsky, who brought it out in Vienna, where it met with much adverse criticism, especially from Hanslick. The only explanation I can give of the orchestral score still bearing my name is that when the original publisher, [[P. Jurgenson]], of Moscow, to suit the composer, republished the concerto, he brought out the piano score in the new edition, but waited to republish the orchestral score until the first edition of the it should be exhausted. This is the only way I can solve the problem of the double dedication.</blockquote>

<blockquote>... The concerto has made its way in the world, and after all, that is the most important thing. It is impossible to please everybody.<ref>''Musical Courier'', January 12, 1912. As quoted in Steinberg, 485–486.</ref></blockquote>

The first performance was eventually given by [[Adolph Brodsky]] on December 4, 1881 in [[Vienna]], under the baton of [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]]. Tchaikovsky changed the dedication to Brodsky. Critical reaction was mixed. The influential critic [[Eduard Hanslick]] called it "long and pretentious" and said that it "brought us face to face with the revolting thought that music can exist which stinks to the ear". Hanslick also wrote that "the violin was not played but beaten black and blue", as well as labeling the last movement "odorously Russian".

The violinist who did much early work to make the work popular with the public and win a place for it in the repertoire was [[Karel Halí?]] (who in 1905 was to premiere the revised version of the [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] [[Violin Concerto (Sibelius)|Violin Concerto]]).  When Tchaikovsky attended a Leipzig performance of the work in 1888, with Hali? as soloist, he called the event "a memorable day".<ref>John Warrack, Tchaikovsky, p. 211</ref>

The Polish premiere of the concerto was given in Warsaw in 14 January 1892, with [[Stanis?aw Barcewicz]] on violin and the composer conducting.  They also played the ''[[Sérénade mélancolique]]'' for the first time in Poland on that occasion.<ref>[http://www.tchaikovsky-research.net/en/Works/Concertos/TH056/index.html Tchaikovsky Research: Sérénade mélancolique]</ref><ref>[http://www.tchaikovsky-research.net/en/Works/Concertos/TH059/index.html Tchaikovsky Research: Violin Concerto]</ref>

==Use in popular media==
The violin concerto has a central role in the 2009 French comedy film ''[[Le Concert]]'' and is played during the final scene.

Hudson Soft was founded on May 18, 1973. Initially, it dealt with [[personal computer]] products, but later expanded to the development and publishing of [[video game]]s, [[mobile content]], video game peripherals and [[Record label|music recording]].

Hudson is best known for developing game series such as [[Bomberman]], [[Adventure Island (video game)|Adventure Island]], and [[Bonk's Adventure]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allgame.com/company.php?id=13375&tab=developed&sort=rating_desc|title=List of Hudson Soft Co.

==History==
Hudson Soft Ltd. was founded in [[Sapporo]], [[Japan]] on May 18, 1973 by brothers Yuji and Hiroshi Kudo. The founders grew up admiring [[train]]s, and named the business after their favorite, the Hudson locomotives (called the "[[4-6-4]]", and (especially Japanese [[JNR Class C62|C62]]). Hudson began as a shop called '''CQ Hudson''' (CQ????), selling radio [[telecommunication]]s devices and [[art]] [[photograph]]s. In September 1975, Hudson Soft began selling [[personal computer]]-related products, and in March 1978 started developing and selling [[video game]] packages.<ref name="hudsonrg1">{{cite web |url=http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/upload/media/scans/HudsonRG_Part1.pdf |title=Hudson Profile&nbsp;— Part 1 (RG)|last=McFerran |first=Damien|work=Issue 66 |year=2008 |publisher=[[Retro Gamer]] Magazine |pages=68–73|accessdate=2011-01-19}}</ref>

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Hudson Soft favored a quantity over quality approach for the marketing of video games.<ref name="FM-7 Museum">{{cite web|url=http://www.retropc.net/fm-7/museum/softhouse/hudsonsoft/5007.html|title=Oh!FM-7????????|accessdate=2012-12-31}}</ref> At one point, the company released up to 30 different computer software per month; none of which were hugely successful.<ref name="FM-7 Museum"/> Things changed in late 1983, when Hudson started to prioritize quality over quantity.<ref name="FM-7 Museum"/> Hudson became [[Nintendo]]'s first third-party software vendor for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] and its title for this console, ''[[Lode Runner]]'', sold 1.2 million units after its 1984 release.<ref name="History">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050407151508/http://www.hudson.co.jp/corp/coinfo/history.html|year=2005|title=Company history (archives)|publisher=Hudson Soft|accessdate=2012-12-31}}</ref>

The business continued developing video games on the Famicom and computer platforms ([[MSX]], [[NEC PC-8801]], [[ZX Spectrum]], among others), and was reorganized as Hudson Soft Co., Ltd. in July 1985.<ref name="History"/> A caravan was held at sixty venues throughout Japan, a first for the [[video game industry]].<ref name="History"/> ''[[Bomberman (video game)|Bomberman]]'' was released in December of this year on the Famicom and was considered a "big hit" by Hudson Soft.<ref name="hudsonrg2">{{cite web |url=http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/upload/media/scans/hudsonparttwo.pdf |title=Hudson Profile&nbsp;— Part 2 (RG)|last=McFerran |first=Damien|work=Issue 67 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Retro Gamer]] Magazine |pages=44–49|accessdate=2011-01-19}}</ref>

In July 1987, Hudson developed the "C62 System" and collaborated with [[NEC]] to develop the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] video game console. It achieved a second-best success to Famicom in Japan, but its release as the [[TurboGrafx-16]] in North America had less [[market share]] than Nintendo's new [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]] or [[Sega]]'s new [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]]. Throughout 1990, Hudson Soft developed and published video games for an array of systems. In 1994, the 32-bit [[Integrated circuit|semiconductor chip]] "[[HuC62]]" was independently developed by Hudson and used in NEC's [[PC-FX]] video game console.

Hudson Soft's head office was transferred to Tokyo in 2005. But the original Sapporo headquarters remained in operation as a secondary office.
   
Hudson Soft lost several key people starting in the mid-2000s. Co-founder Hiroshi Kudo left the company in November 2004 following financial losses.<ref name="2005 acquisition"/>  Shinichi Nakamoto, who was with the company since 1978 and creator of the ''[[Bomberman]]'' series, followed suit in 2006. Veteran [[Takahashi Meijin]] resigned in May 2011; he had joined Hudson Soft in 1982.<ref name="Takahashi Meijin">{{cite web|title=16-Shot Legend Takahashi Meijin Leaves Hudson|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2011/05/16_shot_legend_takahashi_meijin_leaves_hudson|accessdate=January 4, 2012|date=May 23, 2011|first=James|last=Newton}}</ref> Around 2010-2011, many employees migrated to [[Nintendo]]'s restructured [[Nd Cube]] studio which is headed by Hidetoshi Endo, himself a former Hudson Soft President.

===Relation with Konami===
The relation between Hudson Soft and Konami can be traced back as early as 1985, when Hudson ported Konami's arcade game ''[[Pooyan]]'' to the  [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]]. Moreover, Konami was a third party publisher for Hudson Soft's [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] in Japan. But the acquisition process of Hudson Soft by Konami would only begin in 2001.

Hudson Soft was severely hit by the collapse of its main bank [[Hokkaido Takushoku Bank|Hokkaido Takushoku]]. Seeking new financing alternatives, Hudson Soft entered the [[stock market]] for the first time in December 2000, listing on the [[Osaka Securities Exchange|NASDAQ Japan Exchange]]. This led to Konami  purchasing a stock allocation of 5.6 million shares in August 2001, becoming the company's largest shareholder. Within the terms of this purchase, Hudson acquired the Sapporo division of Konami Computer Entertainment Studio, renaming it Hudson Studio.<ref name="Hudson Studio"/>

In April 2005, capital was increased via an allocation of 3 million shares from a third party. Konami Corporation, holding 53.99% of all Hudson stock, became Hudson's majority shareholder and parent company.<ref name="2005 acquisition">{{cite web|title=Konami Gets Hudson Soft As Subsidiary|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=5271#.UOadEnfhdIp|accessdate=January 4, 2012|date=April 11, 2005|first=Simon|last=Carless}}</ref> Hudson continued to self-publish in Japan, but working closely with Konami.

In January 2011, Hudson Soft became a wholly owned subsidiary of Konami.<ref name="Parent">{{cite web|title=Konami acquiring Hudson|url=http://asia.gamespot.com/news/6286645.html|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=9 February 2011}}</ref> On April 1, 2011, Konami liquidated Hudson Entertainment (the subsidiary of Hudson Soft in [[California]]).<ref name="Parent">{{cite web|title=Konami Closes Hudson Entertainment|publisher= Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=9 February 2011}}</ref>

===Hudson Music Entertainment===
Hudson Soft's music recording label unit. Absorbed into Konami Music Entertainment on March 1, 2012.

==Video game releases==
{{Main|List of Hudson Soft games}}
Hudson Soft is responsible for series such as ''[[Bomberman]]'', ''[[Bonk (video game series)|Bonk]]'', and ''[[Adventure Island (video game)|Adventure Island]]''.

Hudson also released long-running video game series in Japan. ''[[Far East of Eden]]'' was a classic RPG set in a fictional era with Japanese themes. The series was up to number 4 when Hudson was absorbed into Konami, and was considered a hit in Japan. The second version of the game was widely regarded as one of the best RPGs ever released, ranked 12th by ''[[Famitsu]]'' among all games released in Japan. Hudson Soft also created the long-running and critically acclaimed game ''[[Momotaro Dentetsu]]'', a board game with locomotive themes. The comical game had 16 installments released in Japan. Before its absorption, Hudson had re-released some of its first hit games for the [[GameCube]] in Japan, including ''Adventure Island'', ''Star Soldier'', and ''Lode Runner''.

Hudson had a long history of creating games for other publishers. The most notable of these were the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, created for Nintendo. They developed the first eight console installments; however, ''[[Mario Party 9]]'' was developed by Nintendo subsidiary [[Nd Cube]], which consists of many former Hudson employees. Hudson also developed ''[[Fuzion Frenzy 2]]'' for Microsoft, which was released for the [[Xbox 360]] in January 2007.

An even more peculiar example of Hudson developing a game for another publisher is ''[[Bomberman 64: The Second Attack]]''. Unlike the two previous game for the Nintendo 64, which were all published by Nintendo, this one was published by [[Vatical Entertainment]].

'''Barbour's day gecko''' ('''''Phelsuma barbouri''''') is a [[species]] of [[lizard]] in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Gekkonidae]]. It is [[Endemism|endemic]] to central [[Madagascar]]. It is [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] and typically dwells on rocks. Barbour's day gecko feeds on [[insect]]s and [[nectar]].

==Etymology==
The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]], ''barbouri'', as well as the common name, Barbour's day gecko, are in honor of [[American people|American]] [[Herpetology|herpetologist]] [[Thomas Barbour]].<ref>Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M. 2011. ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. ISBN 978-1-4214-0135-5. (''Phelsuma barbouri'', p. 16).</ref> 

==Description==
This lizard is a middle-sized day gecko. It can reach a total length of about {{convert|13.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The body colour is brownish green or dark green. Both a dark brown dorso-lateral and a lateral stripe extend from head to tail. The extremities are normally brown. The tail is unicoloured green and slightly flattened.

==Geographic range==
This species inhabits the [[highland]]s of central Madagascar in the [[Ankaratra]] Mountains.

==Habitat==
In contrast to other lizards of the [[genus]] ''Phelsuma'', ''P. barbouri'' typically lives on stones on the ground or on rocks. The [[climate]] of their [[habitat]] is extremely harsh. There is a huge difference in temperature between night and day, and between different seasons. The maximum day temperature is {{convert|30|°C|°F}}. At night, it is cool and foggy.

==Diet==
These day geckos feed on various [[insect]]s and other [[invertebrate]]s. 

==Behaviour==
These animals often live in small groups. During the day, they flatten their bodies to catch as much sun as possible. This way they can reach their preferred body temperature. During the night and in the early morning, ''P. barbouri'' has a dark color but when basking, the body color becomes brighter.

==Reproduction==
The females glue their eggs under stones. Since additional females may deposit their eggs at the same location, as many as 50 eggs may be found together. At a temperature of {{convert|28|°C|°F}}, the young will hatch after approximately 55 days. The neonates measure {{convert|32|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a large terrarium which should provide many places to hide. Group breeding, however, is possible. The terrarium should be earth-based with a number of flat rocks present. It is important that there be some spot lights for basking. The daytime temperature should be around {{convert|29|°C|°F}}, while at night the temperature should drop to {{convert|20|°C|°F}}. In captivity, these animals can be fed [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]]s, [[Waxworm|wax moths]], [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]], [[mealworm]]s, and [[Housefly|houseflies]].

<!-- Even though Bejerot was criticizing concepts that are today known under the umbrella "harm reduction" and promoting criminal control projects that would today be known as "zero tolerance", he did not use those terms himself. -->
'''Nils Bejerot''' (September 21, 1921 – November 29, 1988) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] and [[criminology|criminologist]] best known for his work on [[drug abuse]] and for coining the phrase ''[[Stockholm syndrome]]''.<ref>[http://www.nilsbejerot.se/sexdagar_eng.htm Nils Bejerot: The six day war in Stockholm]</ref>

==Work==
<!-- This could be the basis of a biography, but somethings have to be written on his pre-1957 experiences, he was a student politician and a communist, something generally seen as relevant. -->
Nils Bejerot was born 1921 in [[Norrtälje]], [[Stockholm]]. His father worked as a bank teller at the local ''Upland Bank'' office.  Not an avid student, he was more interested in [[scouting]]. In 1936 the family moved to [[Östhammar]] after his father was assigned to another bank office. At the age of 15, Berjerot was found to have bleeding in the lungs due to [[tuberculosis]] and was admitted to a [[sanatorium]] for a total of three years. However, Bejerot described this time as a happy period in his life. The mood among the patients was good, despite the fact that approximately 1 / 3 part of them died. During his time in [[sanatorium]]s he met people of different ages with different experiences, and the discussions they had he later claimed encouraged him to study and become involved in political activity, becoming a member of the Communist Party and other Socialist-affiliated organizations. When he started to study medicine in 1947 his social and political commitments made him a slow student.<ref name="minnesbok">[http://www.nilsbejerot.se/minnesbok.pdf Nils Bejerot — forskaren, folkupplysaren, pionjären i kampen mot narkotikan, 1993 (A collection of essays about Nils Bejerot written by different authors after Nils Bejerots death, for ex the secretary of The Nobel price committee, collected by Carol Bejerot)]</ref>

On his first vacation he met English nurse Carol Maurice in the 320&nbsp;km railway between [[Samac]] and [[Sarajevo]] in then-[[Yugoslavia]], and they later married.<ref name="minnesbok" />

In 1952-54, Bejerot served as assistant at the [[Karolinska Institute]] hygienic institution after finishing basic medical education at Karolinska Institute. In the same period he wrote his book against the violence in comic books.

In 1954 while Bejerot is serving as deputy social medical officer at the Child and Youth Welfare Board of the City of Stockholm, Bejerot became, by coincidence, the first to diagnose and report a case of juvenile intravenous drug abuse by any public authority in Europe.

In 1956 [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s secret speech at the 20th Party Congress led Bejerot to question the whole communist system; the illusion of the glorious future of communism was definitely shattered when the [[Soviet Union]] invaded [[Hungary]], causing Bejerot to quit all activities in politics and focus on the study of medicine.<ref name="minnesbok"/>

In 1957 Bejerot received a medical degree from the [[Karolinska Institute]] in Stockholm.

From 1957 to 1962, Bejerot was trained in psychiatry at the [[Södersjukhuset]] and the [[Saint Göran Hospital]] in Stockholm.

From 1958 onwards, Bejerot worked as consulting psychiatrist to the Stockholm Police Department, and from 1965 as consulting physician to the Stockholm Remand Prison. His patients in that work was people put in custody by the police, many of them alcoholics or drug addicts from Stockholm City. Later he became Research Fellow in drug dependence at the Swedish National Medical Research Council, and then a reader in Social Medicine at the [[Karolinska Institute]].

In 1963, Bejerot studied epidemiology and medical statistics at the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], on a grant from the World Health Organization.<ref name="congre">[https://archive.org/stream/marihuanahashish00unit#page/n5/mode/2up  Marihuana-hashish epidemic and its impact on United States security: hearings before the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, Ninety-third Congress, second session [-Ninety-fourth Congress, first session&#93; .. (1974), page 170-]</ref>

In 1965 Bejerot started to engage in the Swedish debate on drug abuse, encouraging tough action against the new and rapidly growing problem. He followed closely a rather clumsy experiment with legal prescription of heroin, amphetamine, etc. to drug addicts, studies that formed the basis for his thesis on the epidemic drug spread. Bejerot claimed that the program should increase the number of drug addicts and showed through counting of injection marks that the number of drug addicts in Stockholm continued to grow fast during the experiment. The program was stopped in 1968.<ref name="bejer">[http://www.rns.se/swedish-addiction.asp Nils Bejerot: The Swedish addiction epidemic in a global perspective, a speech given in 1988 in France, the Soviet Union and USA.]</ref><ref>[http://www.cedro-uva.org/lib/boekhout.swedish.html The Swedish Drug Control System]</ref>

The concept ''epidemic drug use'' was probably inspired by the contemporary debate in Britain. A large government study in the UK, the second Brain Report (1965), described drug addiction as a "socially infectious condition". The second Brain report recommended the establishment of special treatment centers where heroin addicts could be isolated from the community and treated. Bejerot had studied epidemiology in London in 1963. From 1968 and onward was the difference between the [[epidemic]] type, the therapeutic type and the [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic type]] of drug abuse a repeated issue in Bejerot's writing and lectures.<ref name="bejer"/><ref>[http://www.drugtext.org/library/articles/92333.html Rachel Lart British Medical perception from Rolleston to brain, changing images of the addict and addiction]</ref><ref>[http://www.drugtext.org/Second-Brain-Report/drug-addiction-2.html DRUG ADDICTION, MINISTRY OF HEALTH, London, 1965]</ref>

In 1969 Bejerot became one of the founders of the Association for a Drug-Free Society (RNS), which played - and still play - an important role in shaping Swedish drug policies. RNS don't accept any of the state grants which are available.<ref>[http://www.rns.se/about-rns.asp RNS]</ref><ref>[http://www.rns.se/Inneh.aspx?b=Blogg&k=English&p=5205789014366969848 About RNS]</ref> Bejerot warned of the consequences of an ‘epidemic addiction’, prompted by young, psychologically and socially unstable persons who, usually after direct personal initiation from another drug abuser, begin to use socially nonaccepted, intoxicating drugs to gain euphoria.<ref>[http://www.unodc.org/pdf/research/Swedish_drug_control.pdf United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime: Sweden’s successful drug policy: a review of the evidence]</ref><ref>[http://www.rns.se/english.asp The Swedish National Association for a Drug-free Society (RNS)]</ref>

In 1972 Bejerots' reports were used as one of the reasons for increasing the maximum penalty for grave drug offences in Sweden to 10 years in prison.

In 1974 he was called to testify as one of 21 scientific experts on [[marijuana]] for a subcommittee of the [[United States Senate]] on the marijuana-hashish epidemic and its impact on United States security.<ref name="congre"/><ref>[http://www.aim.org/publications/aim_report/1986/01b.html Reed Irvine: THE MEDIA AS DRUG PROMOTERS, AIM Report January 1986]</ref>

In 1975 became Bejerot associate professor on a [[doctoral thesis]] about drug abuse and drug policy at the [[Karolinska Institute]].<ref>Drug Abuse and Drug Policy. An epidemiological and methodological study of drug abuse of intravenous type in the Stockholm police arrest population 1965–1970 in relation to changes in drug policy. 277 s. Munksgaard, Köpenhamn, 1975.</ref>

In 1979 Bejerot received an honorary title of professor, an honor that the Swedish government usually awards to only a few people a  year.<ref>http://nilsbejerot.se/om.htm</ref>

His research covered such wide areas as the epidemiology of drug abuse, the dynamics of drug dependence and the anomalies of public welfare policy. Bejerot gave an extensive number of lectures in many parts of Sweden. For 30 years he lobbied intensively for [[zero tolerance]], including possession and use of cannabis. He published about 600 papers and debate articles in different media, and published more than 10 books about the subject. In total he had about 100,000 participants of his 2-day courses.<ref>[http://nilsbejerot.se/film2_56.wmv Nils Bejerot. Video from a lecture about addition.]</ref> For many years he held lectures at ‘’Polishögskolan’’ (The Swedish Police College)  about drug abuse, mental problems and negotiation skills. He was teacher for almost every Swedish police officer, which gave him the epithet ‘’polisdoktorn ‘’ (The police doctor).<ref name="minnesbok" /><ref name="bejerh"/>

Bejerots theories about spread of drug abuse and proposals for an anti-drug policy have still a significant influence on the [[drug policy of Sweden]]. When [[R. Gil Kerlikowske]] the Director of National Drug Control Policy in May 2012 announced an updated version of U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s administration's drug policy he referred to what happened in the experiment with legal prescription of drugs in 1965 that was studied by Bejerot in his doctor thesis.<ref>[http://wfad.se/images/articles/WFAD_2012_-_Gil_R._Kerlikowske.pdf Principles of modern Drug policy, Statement of the Government of America, World Federation against drugs 3rd Forum, Stockholm, May 21 2012]</ref>

==Career highlights==
He is best known for several things:

* His role as a psychiatric adviser during the 1973 [[Norrmalmstorg robbery]], and his coinage of the term ''[[Stockholm Syndrome]]'' to refer to the way in which the hostages become grateful to the hostage-takers .<ref>[http://www.nilsbejerot.se/sexdagar_eng.htm Nils Bejerot: The six day war in Stockholm,New Scientist 1974, volume 61, number 886, page 486-487]</ref><ref>[http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/international/nyhetssidor/artikel.asp?programid=2054&artikel=3254778&nyheter=1 Majsan Boström: The Stockholm Syndrome, Sveriges Radio International, 2009]</ref> The term 'Stockholm Syndrome' has been used on millions of Internet pages.

* His strong opposition to legalization or prescription programs for [[narcotic]] [[illegal drug trade|drugs]]. He advocated [[zero tolerance]] for illegal use and possession of drugs, including all drugs not covered by prescription, something that today is law in [[Sweden]]. In the early 1980s, he became one of the "Top 10 opinion molders" in Sweden for this. Bejerot is by [[UNODC]] and many others recognized as founder of the Swedish strategy against recreational use of drugs. His demand for [[zero tolerance]] as a [[drug policy]] was for a long time seen as extreme, but during the late 1970s opinion changed. He is without doubt the person most responsible for changing the Swedish drug policy in a restrictive direction<ref name="bejerh">[http://www.nilsbejerot.se/om.htm About Nils Bejerot (written by his admirers)]</ref><ref>[http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/NR/rdonlyres/9BABA972-7D30-4808-8051-BF6D82341617/4127/200510712.pdf Socialstyrelsen.

M. Chatwin: On the Possibility of Policy Harmonisation for some Illicit Drugs in Selected Member States of the European Union]</ref> Many people considered Bejerot as a good [[humanism|humanist]] advocating a viable policy against narcotics and [[Robert DuPont]] considers him "the hero of the Swedish drug abuse story."<ref>[http://www.wfad08.org/_downloads/_pdf/DuPont-WFAD_Plenary_Talk.pdf Presentation at the World Forum Against Drugs (WFAD)Stockholm, Sweden September 8, 2008 by Robert L.

* His strong opposition against violence in [[comic book]]s, which was the subject of his 1954 book ''Barn, serie, samhälle'' (Children, Comics, Society), itself largely an adaptation of [[Fredric Wertham]]'s book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'', also published in 1954. He did not come back to this topic in his later books.

==Bejerot on factors that increase the risk of abuse==
Before Bejerot began to participate in the debate on drugs in 1965, it was the dominant view in Sweden that drug abuse was a private health problem and that law enforcement measures should be aimed at drug dealers. Before 1968, the maximum offence for a grave drug crime was one year in prison. Bejerot objected to this and stressed the importance of measures against the demand for drugs, against users, and their importance in the spread of addiction to new addicts.

Bejerot did not accept unemployment and poor private economy as explanations for increased use of illegal drugs. He pointed out, that alcohol abuse in the 1930s was comparatively limited in Sweden, despite high unemployment and economic depression.

Nils Bejerot stressed five main factors that cause increased risk of an individual of  becoming a drug abuser:

* Availability of the addictive substance
* Money to acquire the substance
* Time to use the substance
* Example of use of the substance in the immediate environment
* A permissive ideology in relation to the use of the substance.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23299086-5013477,00.html Noel Pearson: Agendas of addiction. The Australian, March 1, 2008]</ref>

Bejerot advanced the hypothesis that when addiction supervenes it is no longer a symptom but a morbid condition of its own. In the abuse stage one can willfully control their consumption and intoxicating themselves at will, but eventually - depending the product's addictive qualities, the dosage, the intensity of the abuse, individual factors etc. - the drug abuse can turn into [[drug dependency]],  the drug use receive the strength of an instinct. Then its development will not be affected by removal of the initiating factors,  the [[drug dependency]] has the strength and character of a natural drive, even though it is artificially-induced.<ref>[http://www.nilsbejerot.se/narkotikamissbruk.pdf Bejerot; Nordisk Medicin 7. I. 1971, bd 85, nr 1]</ref>

He compared addiction with a very deep love, writing that addiction is "an emotional fixation (sentiment) acquired through learning, which intermittently or continually expresses itself in purposeful, stereotyped behavior with the character and force of a natural drive, aiming at a specific pleasure or the avoidance of a specific discomfort."<ref>[http://www.nida.nih.gov/pdf/monographs/30.pdf Nils Bejerot in Theories of Drug abuse, Selected contemporary perspectives, page 246-255, NIDA, 1980]</ref>

This would however not mean that drug addiction was impossible to treat. The abuse was learned, hence it is also possible to relearn, how to live without drugs, and treatment of drug addicts should have a drug-free goal, differing with others who aimed at reduction of adverse effects, also known as [[harm reduction]]. Bejerot thus criticized programs of long methadone treatment of opiate users in programs that were not aimed at drug freedom.

The '''princeps senatus''' (plural ''principes senatus'') was the first member by precedence of the [[Roman Senate]]. Although officially out of the ''[[cursus honorum]]'' and owning no ''[[imperium]]'', this office brought enormous prestige to the senator holding it.

==Overview==
The ''princeps senatus'' was not a lifetime appointment. He was chosen by every new pair of [[Censor (ancient Rome)|censors]] (that is, every 5 years). Censors could, however, confirm a ''princeps senatus'' for a period of another 5 years. He was selected from [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] senators with [[consul]]ar rank, usually former censors. The successful candidate had to be a patrician with an impeccable political record, respected by his fellow senators.

The office was established around the year 275 BC.<ref>Ryan, Francis X. ''Rank and Participation in the Republican Senate'' (1998), pg. 170</ref> Originally, the position of the ''princeps'' was one of honor: he had the privilege of speaking first on the topic presented by the presiding [[magistratus|magistrate]]. This gave the position great ''dignitas'' as it allowed the ''princeps'' to set the tone of the debate in the Senate.  In the late Republic and in the [[Principate]], the office gained the prerogatives of the presiding magistrates and additional powers, namely:
* Summoning and adjourning the Senate
* Deciding its agenda
* Deciding where the session should take place
* Imposing order and other rules of the session
* Meeting, in the name of the Senate, with embassies of foreign countries
* Writing, in the name of the Senate, letters and dispatches

By 80 BC, it is believed that the status and function of the office was changed by the [[Constitutional reforms of Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]. Although the term remained, reflecting the [[Roman senator|senator]] who was named first in the roll of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] issued by the Censors, the prerogatives of the office were restricted. In particular, the honor of speaking first on any topic debated in the Senate, a measure of their [[Auctoritas|political clout]], was removed from them and transported to the [[Roman consul|consul designate]].<ref>[[Thomas Robert Shannon Broughton|Broughton, T. Robert S.]], ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol II'' (1952), pg. 127</ref>

After the fall of the [[Roman Republic]], the ''princeps senatus'' was the [[Roman Emperor]] (see also: [[princeps]]). However, during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], some others held the office; the future emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] held the office in 238, during the reigns of [[Maximinus Thrax]] and [[Gordian I]].

'''Chonburi''' ({{Lang-th|??????}} {{IPA-th|t????n.b?r??||th-chonburi.ogg}}) is a [[Provinces of Thailand|province]] (''changwat'') of [[Thailand]].  Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) [[Chachoengsao Province|Chachoengsao]], [[Chanthaburi Province|Chanthaburi]], and  [[Rayong Province|Rayong]]. To the west is the [[Gulf of Thailand]].  Chonburi has developed its tourism and logistics infrastructure; it is home to Thailand's largest tourist oriented city, Pattaya (also spelled Phatthaya), it is the only province outside the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Area]] to connect by eight lane motorway to Bangkok, it is home to Thailand's largest and primary seaport, it has a thriving migrant and expat population. Due to these factors, the province's population is growing rapidly, with currently some 1.7 million residents (albeit with a large floating or unregistered population).<ref name="citypopulation"/>  The registered population as of December 31, 2012 was 1.36 million<ref>http://stat.bora.dopa.go.th/stat/y_stat55.html</ref>

== History ==
From historical evidence, Mueang Chonburi has been settled since sometime during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] period of Thai history. The region for centuries was one of small towns such as Bang Sai, Bang Pla Soi, and Bang Phra. King [[Rama V]] combined these to form Chonburi Province.

== Etymology ==
The word "chon" originates from the [[Sanskrit]] word "jala" meaning ''water'', and the word "buri" from Sanskrit "puri" meaning "town" or "city". Hence the name of the province literally means "city of water".

== Geography ==
The province is on the [[Bay of Bangkok]], the northern end of the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. The [[Khao Khiao Massif|Khao Khiao]] mountain range stretches from the northwest to the southeast of the province, while the fertile plains of the north were long used for farming. In [[Laem Chabang]], in the south of the province, is one of the few deep-water harbours of Thailand.

The provincial permanent legal population has risen at nearly 4% annually from 1,040,865 in 2000 to 1,554,365 in 2010.<ref name="citypopulation">http://www.citypopulation.de/php/thailand-admin.php</ref> There is a large floating population of long term residents (non-Thai) without permanent status, on perpetual [[tourist visa]] and/or migrant workers (legal or not), as well as heavy, short term tourist influxes.

== Symbols ==
The [[Seals of The Provinces of Thailand|provincial seal]] shows the hill ''[[Khao Sam Muk]]'', on which a [[shrine]] is located. Legend tells that the spirit of that mountain protects the fishermen from harm. The spirit is that of an 18th-century a Chinese girl threw herself from the cliff when her parents refused to let her marry the man she loved.

The provincial tree and flower is the "New Guinea Rosewood" (''[[Pterocarpus indicus]]'', called ''Mai Pradu'' in Thai).

The provincial motto is ''Beautiful Beaches, Delicious Khao Lam, Sweet Sugar Cane, Delicate Basketry Products, and Buffalo Racing''.

== Administrative divisions ==

== Tourism ==
There has been heavy investment in the tourist city of Pattaya, the nation's primary port of Laem Chabang (at Si Ratcha),  Bangkok-Pattaya motorway, and Suvarnabhumi airport (outside but close to the province).  Pattaya is the destination of local and international tourism alike within the province, which has seen a spike in skyscrapers and malls. Some nine million visitors to the province were recorded in 2012, of which 6.1 million were from abroad, the largest of these being Russians with 2.2 million visitors.<ref>http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/Chon-Buri-sees-9mn-visitors-in-2012-30203664.html</ref>  The character of the city has been changing from "sin city" to one which caters to all visitors including families, albeit the "sin city" continues its seemingly unstoppable growth.  In addition the nationality of visitors to Pattaya and surrounds has been changing, with a surge of Russians and Chinese in the past five years, as well as migrant workers from Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar, opposed to being formerly dominated by Westerners and Thais.

Besides Pattaya, neighboring cities such as Banglamung, Si Ratcha, and even Muang Chonburi itself have developed over the past decade supporting a larger middle class and "longer stay" expat population.

'''''Phelsuma astriata semicarinata''''' is a [[subspecies]] of [[Seychelles day gecko]]. It is a small, slender [[gecko]], has a bright green colour and feeds on insects. It is found on different islands of the [[Seychelles]], where it often lives near human dwellings.

== Description ==
The body of this smallish [[day gecko]] is lime green with rost-coloured dots and bars on the back which are irregularly shaped. Those reddish dots form a thin mid-dorsdal stripe, which may be broken and may have some bars extending from it. There is a rust-coloured stripe between the nostril and the eye. On the head there is a  rust-coloured, v-shaped marking with two transverse bars. Males often have a bluish or turquoise coloured tail and lower back. On both sides of the snout, a reddish-brown stripe is extending from the nostrils to the eye. The undersurface of the body is white. These lizards reach a total length of about 12.5&nbsp;cm.
 
== Distribution ==
This gecko is endemic to the Seychelles island Praslin but it has also been introduced to [[La Réunion]], where it had been recorded first in 2004.<ref>{{fr}}[Mozzi, Déso & Probst, 2005. Un nouveau gecko vert introduit à la Réunion: Le Phelsuma astriata semicarinata (Cheke, 1982). - Bulletin Phaethon 21: 1-4 http://reptilvar.free.fr/Gecko_introduit_Reunion.pdf]</ref>

== Habitat ==
This species is typically found on coconut palms and banana trees. It often lives near human settlements.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on insects, small spiders, fruit, nectar and pollen.

== Reproduction ==
''Phelsuma astriata semicarinata'' normally lays two 10&nbsp;mm large eggs. The eggs are not glued to leaves, as this species is among the "non-gluer" variety.  Eggs should generally hatch in 70 - 75 days and should be incubated at approximately 25 degrees Celsius.<ref>Day Geckos in Captivity by Lean and Greg Christenson, Page 114 (2002)</ref>

== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
''Phelsuma astriata semicarinata'' should be housen in pairs. They need a vertically oriented and well planted terrarium with vertically oriented and horizontally oriented bambus sticks as thick as a thumb.

'''Lesser bushbabies''', or '''lesser galagos''', are [[strepsirrhine]] [[primate]]s of the genus '''''Galago'''''. They are classified, along with the bushbabies (genus ''[[Euoticus]]'') and the rest of the [[galago]]s (genus ''[[Otolemur]]''), in the family [[Galagidae]].<ref name=Groves/> They are probably the most numerous primate in Africa, and can be found in every large forest on the continent, Galagos also prefer savannahs, woodlands, riverine bush and the fringes of forests. .<ref name=LOM>[[David Attenborough]], ''[[Life of Mammals]]'', Episode 8: Life in the Trees. BBC Warner, 2003.</ref> They mark their territory by urinating on their hands and leaving traces on the trees they climb across, and they follow these detectable paths through the trees night after night, males will also urinate on females to mark them . They are related to [[Loris]]es, and have similar behavior and anatomy. They are much faster, however, and typical hunt by speed rather than by stealth.<ref name=LOM/> Primitive bushbabies are thought to have been the ancestors of all [[lemur]]s.<ref name=LOM/>

==Breeding== 
Lesser bushbabies usually give birth during the rainy season. The offspring are usually twins.<ref name="Dixson2012">{{cite book|last=Dixson|first=Alan F.|title=Primate Sexuality: Comparative Studies of the Prosimians, Monkeys, Apes, and Humans|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=khzhd2nXWM0C&pg=PT137|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=26 January 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-150342-9|page=137}}</ref> After the birth there is usually a second period of heat. A female’s gestation period is between 125-142 days and will usually consist of the female mating with up to 6 different males.

Lesser bushbaby mothers initially shelter their offspring in a nest or tree hollow, later on concealing the infants in foliage while they forage at night.<ref name="Dixson2012"/> In some species, such as [[galago#dwarf galago|dwarf galago]]s (''Galago demidoff'' group), the day-sleeping nests may be shared by groups of females or occasionally by visiting males.<ref name="Fleagle1999">{{cite book|last=Fleagle|first=John G.|title=Primate adaptation and evolution|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PgiGPYeVN0sC&pg=PA114|accessdate=10 July 2011|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-260341-9|page=114}}</ref>

==Diet==
Galagos generally consume insects and gums, however some have been known to eat small invertebrates. 

==Appearance==
Galagos are brown grey to light grey in color. With many showing a yellowish tint to the sides and limbs. They also have a distinct dark marking around the eye. 

==Behavior==
Galagos are tree dwelling primates and are capable of leaping great distances, using flattened disks on their feet and hands as a way of grasping branches. However they do walk on the ground sometimes, either bipedally or on all fours. Galagos are solitary foragers, however they do meet up at night in groups, and sleep during the day in groups of around 6. Calls are a big part of Galago life and there are up to 18 distinct calls. All these calls are part of three categories, defensive and aggressive, social contact and annuciatory. They also have a very highly developed hearing.

{{nihongo|'''''Athena'''''|???|Atena}} is a [[Platform game|platform]] [[arcade game]], produced and published in 1986 by [[SNK Playmore|SNK]]. It was later ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], developed by [[Micronics]]. Conversions were done also for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] in 1987 by [[Ocean Software]] under their [[Imagine Software|Imagine]] label. However, only the NES version was released for [[North America]]n homes until the [[PlayStation Network]] saw a release of the arcade original in 2011. The game's protagonist, Princess Athena, has gone on to appear in later [[fighting game]]s by SNK as a [[Player character|secret character]] or assistant to her descendant [[Athena Asamiya]], a frequent main character in these games.

==Plot==
Athena was the young, headstrong princess of the heavenly Kingdom of Victory. She was bored of the monotonous daily life in the palace and desired exciting adventures. One day, she opened the "Door Which Shouldn't Be Opened" in the basement of Castle Victory, said to lead to a savage and deadly place. As she dared cross the doorway, it caused her to fall from the skies and to another realm called Fantasy World, which was dominated by the evil Emperor Dante. After her flowing dress was lost while catching the wind for her fall, the perilous adventures of Princess Athena began as she landed in a wilderness overrun by beast-like warriors and more dangers than she could ever wish for. She readied to fight for her life and arm herself, with no other choice than to face the ruthless Dante and every obstacle on her way, to free this kingdom and make it back alive to her own.

After Athena defeats Dante, it all begins anew in the sequel, ''[[Athena: Full Throttle]]'', in which the princess, again bored, opens the "Door Which Shouldn't Be Opened '''B'''", disregarding her loyal maid Helene's advice, and they both fall to Elysium World where they face off against other villains.

Many of the game's elements are inspired by [[Greek mythology]] or [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman culture]], such as weapons, equipment, items and enemy designs. Princess Athena herself is named after the Greek goddess [[Athena]], while Dante is based on [[Cerberus]].

==Gameplay==
Upon landing, unarmed and mostly nude, the princess only has her kicks to fend off the approaching monsters, but she may collect the dead enemies's various weapons and also has the chance to find shields, headgear and armor to cover her body, however, these will be lost after withstanding some attacks. Her journey requires leaping and climbing as well as fighting through the land's eight hazardous worlds, each leading up to an oversized enemy that must be dealt with before proceeding to the next area. The use of certain weapons such as a hammer allows Athena to break through stone blocks, sometimes revealing not only armor but magic items such as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]'s sandals that, when worn, allow her to make great leaps.

The game features certain [[role-playing video game]] elements to complement the platform action. Princess Athena has to defeat enemies such as the final [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] by using various mythological weapons, items and equipment. Without some items, she cannot make it through the adventure.

==Princess Athena in other games==
Aside from ''[[Psycho Soldier]]'' introducing her modern-day descendant, [[Athena Asamiya]], Princess Athena faded out of SNK's spotlight until fourteen years later, when she appeared as Athena Asamiya's 'Another Striker', a special helper character, in ''[[The King of Fighters 2000]]''.

Afterwards, she becomes a secret boss in the dream match game ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos]]'' as an angelic being guarding the entrance to the Heaven World, which is patterned after the stages from her video game. By contrast, the [[Capcom]] character [[ghosts'n Goblins (series)#Characters|Red Arremer]] as another secret boss guards the entrance to the Hell World.

Due to her defeat (caused by the player's character) in ''SVC Chaos'', she is sent to the human world (Earth) by [[Kami]]sama for further training through the fighting tournament hosted by the organization WAREZ, in SNK's next dream match game ''[[NeoGeo Battle Coliseum]]'', as a playable hidden character. Although ''NGBC'' gives exhaustive background stories to every character, it is not a canonical continuation to any of their original games (neither is ''SVC Chaos'').

Also, aside from the above titles, she appears in the ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash]]'' [[trading card game]] series, as an SNK character card or as an Action/Counter card, and, in the final ''[[Days of Memories]]'' game, she makes a cameo as a foreign cousin of Athena Asamiya.

'''50''' ('''fifty''') is the [[natural number]] following [[49 (number)|49]] and preceding [[51 (number)|51]].

==In mathematics==
'''Fifty''' is the smallest number that is the sum of two non-zero [[square numbers]] in two distinct ways: 50 = 1<sup>2</sup> + 7<sup>2</sup> = 5<sup>2</sup> + 5<sup>2</sup>.<ref>de Koninck, J.M. (2009). ''Those fascinating numbers''. AMS Bookstore. p. 18. ISBN 0-8218-4807-0.</ref> It is also the sum of three squares, 50 = 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> + 5<sup>2</sup>. It is a [[Harshad number]].

There is no solution to the equation [[Euler's totient function|?]](x) = 50, making 50 a [[nontotient]]. Nor is there a solution to the equation x &minus; ?(x) = 50, making 50 a [[noncototient]].

The [[aliquot sum]] of 50 is [[43 (number)|43]] and its [[aliquot sequence]] is (50,43,1,0). Fifty is itself the aliquot sum of [[40 (number)|40]] and [[94 (number)|94]].

'''James Augustus Grant''', [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the Star of India|CSI]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society|FRGS]] (11 April 1827 — 11 February 1892) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[List of explorers|explorer]] of eastern equatorial Africa.

Grant was born at [[Nairn]] in the [[Scottish highlands|Scottish Highlands]], where his father was the parish minister, and educated at [[Nairn Academy]], [[Aberdeen Grammar School]] and [[Marischal College]], [[Aberdeen, Scotland|Aberdeen]]. In 1846 he joined the Indian army. He saw active service in the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Sikh War]] (1848–49), served throughout the [[Indian Mutiny]] of 1857, and was wounded in the operations for the relief of [[Lucknow]].

He returned to England in 1858, and in 1860 joined [[John Hanning Speke]] in the memorable expedition which solved the problem of the [[Nile]] sources.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bridges|first=Roy|title=Grant, James Augustus|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/lotw/7.html|work=Oxford DNB|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> The expedition left [[Zanzibar]] in October 1860 and reached [[Gondokoro]], where the travellers were again in touch with what they regarded civilization, in February 1863. Speke was the leader, but Grant carried out several investigations independently and made valuable botanical collections. He acted throughout in absolute loyalty to his comrade. <!-- [[Image:ST-grant.jpg|James Augustus Grant]] -->

In 1864 he published, as supplementary to Speke's account of their journey, ''A Walk across Africa'', in which he dealt particularly with "the ordinary life and pursuits, the habits and feelings of the [[Indigenous people|native]]s" and the economic value of the countries traversed. In 1864 he was awarded the patron's medal of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], and in 1866 given the [[Order of the Bath|Companionship of the Bath]] in recognition of his services in the expedition.

Grant served in the intelligence department of the [[Ethiopia|Abyssinian]] expedition of 1868; for this he was made [[Order of the Star of India|C.S.I.]] and received the Abyssinian medal. At the close of the war he retired from the army with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.

Grant had married in 1865, and he now settled down at Nairn, where he died in 1892. He was buried in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral.<ref>http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqSearch=%28Surname=%27grant%27%29&dsqPos=2</ref>

He made contributions to the journals of various learned societies, the most notable being the "Botany of the Speke and Grant Expedition" in vol. xxix. of the ''Transactions of the Linnaean Society''.

==Grant's illness in Africa (John Hayman MD)==
In his book, "A Walk across Africa" 20, Grant gives the following description of his illness, which broke out when they reached the native kingdom of Karague, on the western side of [[Lake Victoria]] in December 1861.

:('''page 151'''): "The following account of my own ailments I give, not with a wish to parade them, but in order to convey information:- Having had fevers twice a month, in December my usual complaint assumed a new form.  The right leg, from above the knee, became deformed with inflammation, and remained for a month in this unaccountable state, giving intense pain, which was relieved temporarily by a deep incision and copious discharge.  For three months abscesses formed, and other incisions were made; my strength was prostrated; the knee stiff and alarmingly bent, and walking was impracticable.  Many cures were attempted by the natives, who all sympathized  with me in my sufferings, which they saw were scarcely endurable; but I had great faith – was all along cheerful and happy, except at the crises of this helpless state, when I felt it would have been preferable to be nearer home.  The disease ran its course, and daily, to bring out the accumulated discharge, I stripped my leg like a leech. Bombay  (an interpreter) had heard of a poultice made of cow-dung, salt, and mud from the lake; this was placed on hot, but merely produced the effect of a tight bandage.  Baraka  (another interpreter) was certain a serpent had spat upon my leg- "it could not have been a bite".   Dr. M'nanagee, the sultan's brother, knew the disease perfectly; he could send me a cure for it – and a mild gentle peasant of the Wanyambo race came with his wife, a young pleasing like person, to attend me.  With the soft touch of a woman he examined the limb, made cuts over the skin with a penknife, ordered all lookers-on outside the hut, when his wife produced a scroll of plantain-leaf, in which was a black paste.  This was moistened from the mouth and rubbed into the bleeding cuts, making them smart; afterwards a small piece of lava was dangled against my leg and tied as a charm round the ankle. .....

:These  cures had no apparent effect, but the disease did improve.   By the fifth month the complaint had exhausted itself; at last I was able to be out of the hut inhaling the sweet air, and once more permitted to behold the works of God's creation in the beautiful lake and hills below me. 	

:('''page 187'''): By the end of March 1862 there were some hopes of my leaving Karague to join Speke in [[Uganda]].  The king had sent an officer and forty of his men to convey me up to the kingdom I so long wished to see.  .... .... Being unable to walk, I was placed in a wicker stretcher (14 April 1862), and trotted off on the heads  of four Waganda  (tribesmen of the area).<br />[[Image:James Augustus Grant.jpg|thumb|Capt Grant leaving Karague]]

:('''pages 189–90'''): On our journey, the stretcher was changed from head to the shoulder of the Waganda, who went at the rate of six miles an hour, jostling and paining my limb unmercifully. The coach and four, as I may term it, was put down every mile, or less, that the bearers might rest, laugh, joke, .... One great  difficulty was to make them carry the conveyance so that the country in front could be seen in travelling; this they, for some reason, refused to do, and persisted in carrying me head first, instead of feet   (fig 1-10).

:('''page 210'''): The stretcher which had carried me part of the way from Karague had been discarded, as the Waganda saw my only ailment was lameness and a stiff knee joint.

:('''page 246-7'''): (July 1862). Speke asked me whether I was able to make a flying march of it with him, while the baggage might be sent on towards Unyoro.  At that time I was positively unable to walk twenty miles a day, especially miles of Uganda marching, through bogs and over rough ground.  I therefore yielded reluctantly to the necessity of our parting; and I am anxious to be explicit on this point, as some have hastily inferred that my companion did not wish me to share in the gratification of seeing the river.  Nothing could be more contrary to the fact.  My state of health alone prevented me from accompanying Speke to set at rest for geographers the latitude of the interesting locality, as to which we were perfectly satisfied from native reports.

Grant's illness prevented him from being with Speke when Speke became the first white man to see the outpouring of the [[White Nile]] from Lake Victoria.  However, as small compensation, his may be the first recorded case and first description of [[Mycobacterium ulcerans]] infection ([[Buruli ulcer]]).  The print in his book shows Grant being carried on a wicker stretcher, leaving Karague.  Reasons for regarding the illness as Mycobacterium ulcerans infection are:-

# The explorers passed through an area where the disease is known to occur.
# They passed through this area at a time just after the present maximal seasonal incidence of the disease.
# The history of the lesion, with a [[prodromal fever]], swelling, followed by ulceration and a copious discharge would seem typical of the oedematous form of the disease, as occurs in the Congo.
# The disease was recognized by the local inhabitants who had a treatment for it, similar to the traditional remedies which may still be in use (Lunn H.F., personal communication).
# The history of the disease, with gradual healing after 6 months leaving residual scarring and contractures is characteristic of the more severe form of the illness.

'''''The Black Obelisk''''' ({{lang-de|Der schwarze Obelisk}}) is a [[novel]] written in 1956 by the [[Germany|German]] author [[Erich Maria Remarque]].  This novel paints a portrait of [[Germany]] in the early 1920s, a period marked by [[Inflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]] and rising [[nationalism]].

Ludwig, the [[protagonist]], is in his mid twenties; just like most of his friends, he is a [[World War I]] veteran.  Although aspiring to be a poet, he works for a friend, Georg, managing the office of a small tombstone company. He tries to earn some extra money as a private tutor to a son of a bookstore owner, and by playing the organ at the chapel of a local insane asylum.

Thanks to this diversity of activities, Ludwig interacts with a wide cross-section of the German population of his town and the surrounding villages and we are allowed to witness those interactions.  We see, for example, businessmen – some trying to stick to the old principles and going bankrupt, others speculating on stocks, exploiting the system and becoming rich in morally ambiguous ways.  We see war veterans – some highly critical of the old ways that led them to a failed war, others longing for the old days of military discipline and turning into inflexible nationalists hailing the virtues of their rising leader, [[Adolf Hitler]].

A lot of events are connected to women. Two of them leave Ludwig, just because he cannot float in the contemporary world of greed and money. He chose to stay "clean", maybe not by himself, but he cannot be anything other than true to his ideals and now he has to live with that choice. A third woman, probably the most important to him, is Genevieve Terhoven, whom he meets at the insane asylum. She is there for being schizophrenic and considers herself to be "Isabelle" most of the time. Ludwig gets more and more attached to her, feeling a "pure" love for her because she sees the world so differently.

A quote written from the book, "The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic" (''Aber das ist wohl so, weil ein einzelner immer der Tod ist — und zwei Millionen immer nur eine Statistik.'') is often instead attributed to Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]].

'''Olympia''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|???????}}; {{IPA-el|?olympia|anc}}; {{IPA-el|?olibia|mod}} ''Olympía''), a sanctuary of ancient [[Greece]] in [[Elis]] on the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula, is known for having been the site of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] in classical times.

The Olympic Games were held every [[Olympiad|four years]] throughout [[Classical Antiquity]], from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bickerman|first=E. J.|title=Chronology of the ancient world|year=1982|publisher=Cornell Univ. Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=0-8014-1282-X|pages=75|edition=2nd ed., 2nd print.}}</ref>
The first Olympic Games were in honor of [[Zeus]].

==Ancient site==
[[File:Map greek sanctuaries-en.svg|thumb|left|280px|Olympia among the main Greek [[Sanctuary|sanctuaries]]]]

The [[sanctuary]], known as the [[Altis]], consists of an unordered arrangement of various buildings. Enclosed within the [[temenos]] (sacred enclosure) are the [[Temple of Hera, Olympia|Temple of Hera]] (or Heraion/Heraeum), the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]], the [[Pelopion]], and the area of the altar, where the sacrifices were made. 

To the north of the sanctuary can be found the [[Prytaneion]] and the [[Philippeion]], as well as the array of [[Treasuries at Olympia|treasuries]] representing the various city-states. The [[Metroon]] lies to the south of these treasuries, with the Echo Stoa to the east. The [[hippodrome]] and later [[stadium]] were located east of the Echo Stoa. To the south of the sanctuary is the South Stoa and the [[Bouleuterion]], whereas the [[Palaestra at Olympia|Palaestra]], the workshop of [[Pheidias]], the [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasion]], and the [[Leonidaion]] lie to the west.

Olympia was also known for the gigantic [[ivory]] and [[gold]] [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|statue of Zeus]] that used to stand there, sculpted by [[Pheidias]], which was named one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]] by [[Antipater of Sidon]]. Very close to the [[Temple of Zeus]] which housed this statue, the studio of Pheidias was excavated in the 1950s. Evidence found there, such as sculptor's tools, corroborates this opinion. The ancient ruins sit north of the [[Alfeios River]] and south of Mount Kronos (named after the Greek deity [[Cronus|Kronos]]). The [[Kladeos]], a tributary of the Alfeios, flows around the area.

==History==
:''For a history of the Olympic Games, see [[Olympic Games]] or [[Ancient Olympic Games]].

===Prehistory===
Remains of food and burnt offerings dating back to the 10th century BC give evidence of a long history of religious activity at the site. No buildings have survived from this earliest period of use.<ref name="a">[http://sunsite.icm.edu.pl/olympics/classical/ Olympics through Time: Geometric and Archaic]</ref> Also, the charred remains of a ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' body were found at Olympia.

===Geometric and Archaic periods===
[[File:Olympia - Temple of Hera 3.jpg|thumb|200px|Ruins of the [[Temple of Hera (Olympia)|Temple of Hera]]]]

The first Olympic festival was organized on the site by the authorities of [[Elis]] in the 8th century BC – with tradition dating the first games at 776 BC. Major changes were made to the site around 700 BC, including levelling land and digging new wells. Elis' power diminished and at the beginning of the 7th century BC the sanctuary fell into the hands of the [[Pisa (Greece)|Pisatans]] in 676 BC. The Pisatans organized the games until the late 7th century BC.<ref name="a"/>

The earliest evidence of building activity on the site dates from around 600 BC. At this time the Skiloudians, allies of the Pistans, built the [[Temple of Hera (Olympia)|Temple of Hera]]. The [[Treasuries at Olympia|Treasuries]] and the [[Pelopion]] were built during the course of the 6th century BC. The secular structures and athletic arenas were also under construction during this period including the [[Bouleuterion]]. The first stadium was constructed around 560 BC, it consisted of just a simple track. The stadium was remodelled around 500 BC with sloping sides for spectators and shifted slightly to the east. Over the course of the 6th century BC a range of sports were added to the Olympic festival. In 580 BC, Elis, in alliance with Sparta, occupied Pisa and regained the control over the sanctuary.<ref name="a"/>

===Classical period===
[[File:Olympia-02.jpg|thumb|Silver [[Tetradrachm]] from Olympia, 360 BC.  Obverse: Head of [[Zeus]] wearing [[laurel wreath]]. Reverse: Head of the [[nymph|nymph Olympia]] wearing [[Headband|sphendone]]. O?YM?IA to right.]]

The [[Ancient Greece|classical period]], between the 5th and 4th centuries BC, was the golden age of the site at Olympia. A wide range of new religious and secular buildings and structures were constructed.<ref name="b">[http://sunsite.icm.edu.pl/olympics/classical/ Olympics through Time: Classical]</ref>

The [[Temple of Zeus]] was built in the middle of the 5th century BC. Its size, scale and ornamentation was beyond anything previously constructed on the site. Further sporting facilities, including the final iteration of the stadium, and the [[hippodrome]] (for chariot-racing) were constructed. The [[Prytaneion]] was built at the northwest side of the site in 470 BC.<ref name="b"/>

In the late classical period, further structures were added to the site. The [[Metroon]] was constructed near the Treasuries c.400 BC. The erection of the Echo Stoa, around 350 BC, separated off the sanctuary from the area of the games and stadium. The South Stoa was built at the southern edge of the sanctuary at approximately the same time.

===Hellenistic period===
[[File:Olimpia FilipTemple.JPG|thumb|Ruins of the [[Philippeion]]]]
[[File:GR-olympia-palaestra.jpg|thumb|[[Palaestra at Olympia]]]]

The late 4th century BC saw the erection of the [[Philippeion]]. Around 300 BC the largest building on the site, the [[Leonidaion]], was constructed to house important visitors. Due to the increasing importance of the games, further athletic buildings were constructed including the [[Palaestra]] (3rd century BC), [[Gymnasion]] (2nd century BC) and bath houses (c.300 BC). Finally, in 200 BC, a vaulted archway was erected linking the entrance of the stadium to the sanctuary.<ref name="c">[http://sunsite.icm.edu.pl/olympics/classical/ Olympics through Time: Hellenistic]</ref>

===Roman period===
During the Roman period, the games were opened up to all citizens of the [[Roman Empire]]. A programme of new buildings and extensive repairs, including to the Temple of Zeus, took place. In 150 AD, the [[Nympheum]] (or [[Exedra]]) was built. New baths replaced the older Greek examples in 100 AD and an aqueduct constructed in 160 AD.<ref name="d">[http://sunsite.icm.edu.pl/olympics/classical/ Olympics through Time: Roman]</ref>

The 3rd century saw the site suffer heavy damage from a series of earthquakes. Invading tribes in 267 AD led to the centre of the site being fortified with robbed material from its monuments. Despite the destruction, the Olympic festival continued to be held at the site until the last Olympiad in 393 AD, after which the Christian emperor [[Theodosius I]] implemented a ban. The Temple of Zeus was apparently destroyed around 426 AD following an edict by [[Theodosius II]] enforcing the ban on pagan festivals.  The workshop of Pheidias was turned into a [[Basilica]] and the site was inhabited by a Christian community.<ref name="d"/> Archaeological evidence suggests that small scale Olympic events (possibly in Christian guise) were still being held secretly until [[Justinian's plague]] and two earthquakes devastated it by the mid-6th century. Repeated floods ensured that the settlement was finally abandoned altogether in the early 7th Century. 
===Discovery and early excavations===

Over time the site was buried under alluvial deposits, up to 8 meters deep, long thought to be the result of river flooding. Modern research hypothesizes instead—based on the presence of mollusc and gastropod shells and foraminifera— that the site was buried by ocean waters resulting from repeated [[tsunamis]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Olympia Hypothesis: Tsunamis Buried the Cult Site On the Peloponnese|publisher=Science Daily|date=July 11, 2011|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110710204240.htm|accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>

The exact site was re-discovered in 1766 by the English antiquarian [[Richard Chandler]].<ref name="f">Sherry Marker, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&res=9B07EFDC1E3BF93BA25754C0A9629C8B63 "Where Athletes Once Ran"] in the ''New York Times'', July 18, 2004.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Gates|first=Charles|title=Ancient cities: the archaeology of urban life in the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece and Rome|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|page=234}}</ref>   The first excavation of the sanctuary at Olympia was not carried out until 1829, by the French "[[Morea expedition|Expedition Scientifique de Moree]]".

Since the 1870s, the excavation and preservation of Ancient Olympia has been the responsibility of the [[German Archaeological Institute at Athens]]. The first major excavation of Olympia began in 1875, funded by the German government after negotiation of exclusive access by [[Ernst Curtius]]. Other archaeologists responsible for the dig were [[Gustav Hirschfeld]], [[George Treu]], [[Adolf Furtwängler]] (who worked alongside architects), [[A. Boetticher]], [[Wilhelm Dörpfeld]], and [[Richard Borrmann]]. They excavated the central part of the sanctuary including the Temple of Zeus, Temple of Hera, Metroon, Bouleuterion, Philipeion, Echo Stoa, Treasuries and Palaestra. Important finds included sculptures from the Temple of Zeus, the [[Athena|Nike]] of [[Paeonius]], the [[Hermes]] of [[Praxiteles]] and many bronzes. In total 14,000 objects were recorded. The finds were displayed in a museum on the site.<ref name="e">[http://www.dainst.org/index_548_en.html Olympia] at the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut</ref>

===1900–1950===
Excavation was continued in a more limited way by Dörpfeld between 1908 and 1929 but a new systematic excavation was begun in 1936 on the occasion of the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]] under [[Emil Kunze]] and [[Hans Schleif]]. Their excavation focus was on the area to the south of the stadium, the South Stoa, bath complex and gymnasion.<ref name="e"/>

===1950 to present===
Between 1952 and 1966, Kunze and Schleil continued the excavation joined by architect [[Alfred Mallwitz]]. They excavated Pheidias' workshop, the Leonidaion and the north wall of the stadium. They also excavated the southeast section of the sanctuary and out of approximately 140 debris pits found many bronze and ceramic objects along with terracotta roof tiles.<ref name="e"/>

Mallwitz took charge of the excavations between 1972 and 1984 revealing important dating evidence for the stadium, graves, and the location of the Prytaneion. From 1984 to 1996, Helmut Kyrieleis took over the site and the focus shifted to the earlier history of the sanctuary with excavation of the Prytaneion and Pelopion.<ref name="e"/>

==Modern Olympia==
[[File:Stadio Olimpia 2007.JPG|thumb|The [[Stadium at Olympia|Olympia stadium]].]]
[[File:Olympia train station 2008.jpg|thumb|Olympia's train station.]]

The [[Olympic flame]] of the modern-day [[Olympic Games]] is lit by reflection of sunlight in a [[parabolic mirror]] in front of the Temple of [[Hera]] and then transported by a torch to the place where the games are held. When the modern Olympics came to [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the men's and women's [[shot put]] competition was held at the restored [[Stadium at Olympia|Olympia stadium]].

The town has a train station and is the easternmost terminus of the line of Olympia-[[Pyrgos (Ilia)]].  The train station with the freight yard to its west is located about 300 m east of the town centre. It is linked by [[Greece Interstate 74|GR-74]], and the new road was opened in the 1980s; the next stretch N and NE of Olympia opened in 2005. The distance from [[Pyrgos (Ilia)|Pyrgos]] is {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}}, about {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} SW of [[Lampeia]], W of [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] and [[Arcadia]] and {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Krestena]] and N of [[Kyparissia]] and [[Messenia]]. The highway passes north of the ancient ruins. A reservoir is located {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest, damming up the Alfeios River. The area is hilly and mountainous; most of the area within Olympia is forested.

[[Panagiotis Kondylis]], one of the most prominent modern Greek thinkers and philosophers, was born and raised in Olympia. When [[Pierre de Coubertin]], the founder of the International Olympic Committee, died in 1937, a monument to him was erected at ancient Olympia. Emulating [[Evangelis Zappas]], whose head is buried under a statue in front of the [[Zappeion]], his heart was buried at the monument.<ref>{{cite book |first= |last= |year= 1996 |title= The Modern Olympics – A Struggle for Revival |publisher= The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn= 0-8018-5374-5 |url= |authorlink= |author= David C.

==History==
Similar to other storied motorcycle manufacturers that have survived for decades, Moto Guzzi has experienced a series of business cycles and a series of ownership arrangements&mdash;some complex, some brief, some that have endured.

===1921&ndash;1966 - Origins===
Moto Guzzi was conceived by two aircraft pilots and their mechanic serving in the [[Regia Aeronautica|Corpo Aeronautico Militare]] (the Italian Air Corp, ''CAM'') during [[World War I]]: Carlo Guzzi, Giovanni Ravelli and Giorgio Parodi. Assigned to the same Miraglia Squadron based outside Venice,<ref name="carlo">{{cite web | url= http://www.liarsroma.com/guzzi.htm | title= Carlo Guzzi | language= Italian | accessdate= 2007-11-05}}</ref> the three became close, despite coming from different socio-economic backgrounds. The trio envisioned creating a motorcycle company after the war. Guzzi would engineer the motor bikes, Parodi (the son of wealthy Genovese ship-owners) would finance the venture, and Ravelli (already a famous pilot and motorcycle racer) would promote the bikes with his racing prowess. Guzzi and Parodi (along with Parodi's brother) formed Moto Guzzi in 1921. Ravelli, ironically, had died just days after the war's end in an aircraft crash and is commemorated by the eagle's wings that form [[Moto Guzzi#Logo, Guzzisti & brand loyalty|the Moto Guzzi logo]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Moto Guzzi website - Tradizione - The Origins|url=http://www.motoguzzi.com/en/tradizione|publisher=Moto Guzzi}}</ref>

[[Image:Moto Guzzi von Don Camillo.jpg|thumb|Moto Guzzi, Museum of [[Brescello]].]]
[[Image:GT500Norge01.jpg|right|thumb|The GT Norge, Moto Guzzi Museum, Mandello del Lario, driven {{convert|4000|mi|-2}} to the Arctic Circle in 1928.]]
Carlo Guzzi and Giorgio Parodi, along with Giorgio's brother Angelo, created a privately held silent partnership "Società Anonima Moto Guzzi" on 15 March 1921, for the purpose of (according to the original articles of incorporation) "the manufacture and the sale of motor cycles and any other activity in relation to or connected to metallurgical and mechanical industry".

The formation of the company hinged on an initial loan of two thousand Lira from the Parodis' father, Emanuele Vittorio, which he gave on 3 January 1919, offering the balance of the loan upon his review of the project's progress:
<blockquote>Dear Giorgio, you can let both your partners know that I will offer you for your first 1,500 or 2,000 Lire. Although with the condition that the sum, under no circumstances, shall be increased. Likewise, I reserve the right to supervise your progress before giving my agreement to this project.</blockquote>{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The company was legally based in Genoa, Italy, with its headquarters in Mandello. The very earliest motorcycles bore the name ''G.P.'' (Guzzi-Parodi), though the marque quickly changed to ''Moto Guzzi''. As the only actual shareholders, the Parodi's wanted to shield their shipping fortunes by avoiding confusion of name ''G.P.'' with Giorgio Parodi's initials. Carlo Guzzi initially received royalties for each motorcycle produced, holding no ownership in the company that bore his name. In 1946 Moto Guzzi formally incorporated as ''Moto Guzzi S.p.A.'' with Giorgio Parodi as chairman.

Carlo Guzzi's first engine design was a [[single-cylinder engine|horizontal single]] that dominated the first 45 years of the company's history in various configurations. Through 1934, each engine bore the signature of the mechanic who built it. As originally envisioned, the company used racing to promote the brand. In the [[1935 Isle of Man TT]], Moto Guzzi factory rider [[Stanley Woods]] performed an impressive double victory with wins in the [[Lightweight]] TT as well as the [[Senior TT]].

Until the mid-1940s, the traditional horizontal [[four-stroke]] single-cylinder 500&nbsp;cc engines outfitted with one overhead and one side valve (also known as: IOE, inlet over exhaust or F-head) were the highest performance engines Moto Guzzi sold to the general public. By contrast, the company supplied the official racing team and private racers with higher performance racing machines with varying overhead cam, multi-valve configurations and cylinder designs.

[[Image:Moto Guzzi Airone Sport 1949.jpg|thumb|left|Moto Guzzi Airone Sport 1949.]]
In the 1950s, Moto Guzzi, along with the Italian factories of [[Gilera]] and [[Mondial (motorcycle manufacturer)|Mondial]], led the world of [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]]. With durable and lightweight 250&nbsp;cc and 350&nbsp;cc bikes designed by Giulio Carcano, the firm dominated the middleweight classes. The factory won five consecutive [[List of Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Champions by year|350&nbsp;cc world championships]] between 1953 and 1957. In realizing that low weight alone might not continue to win races for the company, Carcano designed the [[Moto Guzzi Grand Prix 500 cc V8|V8 500&nbsp;cc GP race bike]]&mdash;whose engine was to become one of the most complex engines of its time. Despite the bike's having led many races and frequently posted the fastest lap time, it often failed to complete races because of mechanical problems. Ultimately, the V8 was not developed further as Moto Guzzi withdrew (together with the main competitors Gilera and Mondial) from racing after the [[1957 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1957 season]] citing escalating costs and diminishing motorcycle sales. By the time of its pull out from Grand Prix racing, Moto Guzzi had won 3,329 official races, 8 [[List of Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Champions|World Championships]], 6 [[List of Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Champions|Constructor's Championships]] and 11 [[Isle of Man TT]] victories.

The period after [[World War II]] was as difficult in Mandello del Lario as it was elsewhere in post-war Europe. The solution was production of inexpensive, lighter cycles. The 1946 "Motoleggera", a 65&nbsp;cc lightweight motorcycle became very popular in post-war Italy. A four-stroke 175&nbsp;cc scooter known as the "Galletto" also sold well. Though modest cycles for the company, the lighter cycles continue to feature Guzzi's innovation and commitment to quality. The step-through Galletto initially featured a manual, foot-shifted three-speed (160&nbsp;cc) configuration then later a four-speed (175&nbsp;cc) set-up by the end of 1952. The displacement was increased to 192&nbsp;cc in 1954 and electric start was added in 1961.

Moto Guzzi was limited in its endeavors to penetrate the important scooter market as motorcycle popularity waned after WWII. Italian scooter competitors would not tolerate an incursion from Moto Guzzi. By innovating the [[Moto Guzzi#Large-wheel scooter|first large-wheeled scooter]], Guzzi competed less directly with manufacturers of small-wheeled scooters such as Piaggio (Vespa) and [[Lambretta]]. To illustrate the delicate balance within the Italian post-war motorcycle and scooter markets, when Guzzi developed their own prototype for a small-wheeled scooter, Lambretta retaliated with a prototype for a small V-twin ''motorcycle'' threatening to directly compete on Moto Guzzi's turf. The two companies compromised: Guzzi never produced their small-wheeled scooter and Lambretta never manufactured the motorcycle. The drive train that Lambretta made in their 1953 motorcycle prototype remarkably resembles the ''V-twin + drive shaft'' arrangement that Guzzi developed more than ten years later, ultimately to become iconic of the company.

By 1964, the company was in full financial crisis. Emanuele Parodi and his son Giorgio had died, Carlo Guzzi had retired to private life, and direction passed to Enrico Parodi, Giorgio's brother. Carlo Guzzi died on 3 November 1964, in Mandello, after a brief hospital stay in Davos.<ref name="carlo" />

===1967&ndash;1973 - SEIMM years===
In February 1967, SEIMM (Società Esercizio Industrie Moto Meccaniche), a state controlled receiver, took ownership of Moto Guzzi. The SEIMM oversight saw Moto Guzzi adapting to a cultural shift away from motorcycles to automobiles. The company focused on popular lightweight mopeds including the Dingo and Trotter &ndash; and the 125&nbsp;cc Stornello motorcycle. Also during the SEIMM years Guzzi developed the 90° V twin engine, designed by Giulio Cesare Carcano, which would become iconic of Moto Guzzi.
[[Image:V7 750 speciale.jpg|thumb|Moto Guzzi, V7 750 Speciale from 1969]]
[[File:Moto Guzzi V 7 Sport 1972.jpg|thumb|Guzzi V7 Sport]]

Though Moto Guzzi has employed engines of myriad configurations, none has come to symbolize the company more than the air-cooled 90° [[V-twin]] with a longitudinal crankshaft orientation and the engine's transverse cylinder heads projecting prominently on either side of the bike. The original V-twin was designed in the early 1960s by engineer Giulio Cesare Carcano, designer of the DOHC V8 Grand Prix racer. The air-cooled, longitudinal crankshaft, transverse cylinder, pushrod V-twin began life with 700&nbsp;cc displacement and {{Convert|45|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} &ndash; designed to win a competition sponsored by the Italian government for a new police bike. The sturdy shaft-drive, air-cooled V-twin won, giving Moto Guzzi renewed competitiveness. This 1967 Moto Guzzi V7 with the original Carcano engine has been continuously developed into the 1,200&nbsp;cc, {{Convert|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} versions offered today (2006). [[Lino Tonti]] redesigned the motor for the 1971 Moto Guzzi V7 Sport. This engine is the basis of the currently used 750&nbsp;cc, 1,100&nbsp;cc and 1,200&nbsp;cc Guzzi engines. The longitudinal crankshaft and orientation of the engine creates a slight gyroscope effect, with a slightly asymmetrical behavior in turns.

===1973&ndash;2000 – De Tomaso years===
After experiencing financial difficulties in the late 1960s, De Tomaso Industries Inc. (D.T.I. Group or DTI), manufacturer of the [[De Tomaso]] sports and luxury cars, owned by Argentinian industrialist [[Alejandro de Tomaso]], purchased SEIMM (and thereby Moto Guzzi) along with [[Benelli (motorcycles)|Benelli]] and [[Maserati]] in 1973. Under Tomaso's stewardship, Moto Guzzi returned to profitability,<ref>{{cite web | url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030524/ai_n12695524 | title= Obituary: Alejandro de Tomaso | date=2003-05-24 | work= The Independent | accessdate= 2007-09-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080104153728/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030524/ai_n12695524 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-04}}</ref>
though other reports suggest a period of limited investment in Moto Guzzi followed attributed to DTI using Moto Guzzi financially prioritizing their automotive ventures.<ref name="SEC 1999">{{cite web | url= http://www.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/secarticle.asp?&sid=405728&symb=CPTX&guid=125634&type=1| title= Aprilia SECFiling 1999 | work= Dow Jones MarketWatch | accessdate= 2007-09-04}}</ref>

[[Image:MotoGuzzi850LeMans.jpg|thumb|Moto Guzzi Le Mans 850]]
In 1976, Guzzi released the [[Moto Guzzi Le Mans|850 Le Mans]], a cafe racer that was a stylistic masterpiece and still today considered one of the most iconic and sought-after of all Guzzis.{{According to whom|date=March 2013}} A marketing success that would compete with other Italian superbikes, it spawned four later models from Mark II to its culmination in the 1990s, the Mark V. The initial model is known widely but incorrectly as the Mark I. Technically, it is simply the 850 Le Mans. It was named in homage to the 24-hour endurance race and circuit in France. The Mark I had two production runs with slight modifications. The first run, known as Series 1, used the roundish CEV stop/taillight used on many Italian bikes of the decade. Less than 2,000 of the round taillight bikes were made and they are the most desirable Guzzi of the era.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The second production run, known as the Series 2 and totaling around 4,000 bikes, used a De Tomaso-designed rectangular taillight/reflector and modified rear guard. This was also used on the Mark II and SP models. The taillight and guard was the biggest change between Series 1 and 2 but other modifications included later inclusion of a tripmeter, black fork lowers, a more generous dual seat that replaced the split-prone original seat, exhaust pipe heel guards and inferior fuel taps. The extra cost compared to the "cooking" T3 model paid for performance items such as high-compression domed pistons, larger inlet and exhaust valves and Dell'Orto 36&nbsp;mm pumper carbs with filterless grey plastic velocity stacks. Most Mk I bikes were brilliant red although a very small number were painted in metallic ice blue. An exceedingly small number{{Clarify|date=March 2013}} of Series 2 bikes were white.

In 1979, a small-block version of the air-cooled V-twin designed by engineer Lino Tonti was introduced as the V35. Radical when introduced, the design featured horizontally split [[crankcase]]s and [[Heron cylinder head|Heron head]]s. The former was a common feature of contemporary Japanese motorcycle design, whilst the latter was [[Heron cylinder head#Applications|widely used in car engines]]. Both features allow more efficient mass production and also the design of the engine and associated components cut the weight from {{convert|548|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of the contemporary 850 T3 to the {{convert|385|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of the V35. The power of the original V35 at {{convert|35|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was competitive with engines of comparable displacement of the period &ndash; later, larger versions (V50, V65, V75) were rapidly outclassed by competing water-cooled engines. The Breva and Nevada today feature a descendent of Tonti's V35 engine: the 750&nbsp;cc V-twin, rated at {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.  With its ease of maintenance, durability and even, flat torque curve, the engine design remains suitable to everyday, real-world situations.

As Guzzi continued to develop the V-twin, power was increased in the mid-1980s when Guzzi created four-valve versions of the "small block" series. Of these, the 650 and the 750 were rated at {{convert|60|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|65|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} respectively. The production of the four-valve "small block" engines ended in the later 1980s.

Moto Guzzis have used an hydraulic integrated brake system, where the right front disc works off the handlebar lever, while the left front and the rear disc work off the foot brake.

The cartridge front fork used in Guzzi's motorcycles of the later 1970s and 1980s is a Guzzi invention. Instead of containing the damping oil in the fork, it is in a cartridge. Oil in the fork is purely for lubrication.

Still under the De Tomaso umbrella, in 1988, [[Benelli (motorcycles)|Benelli]] and SEIMM merged to create Guzzi Benelli Moto (G.B.M. S.p.A. ). During this period, Moto Guzzi existed as an entity within the De Tomaso owned G.B.M., but in 1996 celebrated its 75th birthday and the return of its name to Moto Guzzi S.p.A.  In 1996, De Tomaso became Trident Rowan Group, also known as TRG.

===2000&ndash;2004 - Aprilia years===
Under the helm of [[Ivano Beggio]], [[Aprilia|Aprilia S.p.A]] acquired Moto Guzzi S.p. A on 14 April 2000 for $65 million. According to the original press release,<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.epfguzzi.com/press41500.html| title= Aprilia Press Release  | date=2000-04-14 | accessdate= 2007-09-04}}</ref>
the intention had been that Moto Guzzi would remain headquartered in Mandello del Lario and would share Aprilia's technological, R&D capabilities and financial resources as well. The arrangement would remain short-lived, as Aprilia itself stumbled financially. At the same time Aprilia attempted to diversify in other areas of manufacturing, new Italian laws required helmets for motorcyclists and raising insurance rates for teenage motorcyclists, severely affected the company's profitability.  Nonetheless, Aprilia had committed large sums to renovating the Mandello Moto Guzzi factory &ndash; renovations that were ultimately completed.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.soundrider.com/archive/newsworthy/italian_buying_orgy.htm | title= Italian Buying Orgy}}</ref> [[Ducati Motor Holding]] again made an offer for Moto Guzzi during Aprilia's financial difficulties, as it had before, when Aprilia had purchased Moto Guzzi in 2000. Other potential buyers included [[Kymco]] and the [[Bombardier Recreational Products|BRP]] subsidiary [[Rotax]], Kymco reportedly making the highest offer.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.superbikeplanet.com/2004/Aug/040805a.htm | title= Aprilia rejects Ducati, Piaggio steps up}}</ref>

===2004 onwards - Piaggio years===
On 30 December 2004, [[Piaggio|Piaggio & C. S.p.A]] acquired Aprilia.<ref name="from Rider Magazine" />
Moto Guzzi S.p. A officially becomes a ''Unico Azionista'' of Piaggio, part of Immsi S.p.A. Investments have allowed introduction of a series of competitive new models in rapid succession.

In November 2007, Moto Guzzi unveiled the retro-themed 2008 V7 Classic at the Motorcycle and Bicycle Manufacturers show in Milan, Italy. It was available in Europe in mid-2008, and Moto Guzzi announced plans in late-2008 to make it available to US buyers.<ref>[http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/moto-guzzi-v7-classic.aspx "Moto Guzzi V7 Classic"] ''Motorcycle Classics'' Jan/Feb 2009</ref> The company has begun making limited collectors' editions of Guzzi originals.<ref>Moto Guzzi's Retro Ride 2013-04-15, Forbes page 106</ref>

===CARC===
[[Image:Guzzidrive.jpg|thumb|left|Griso 1100 CARC: Compact Reactive Drive Shaft.]]
''(Cardano Reattivo Compatto)'':  Above a certain power level the competing forces of drive-shaft arrangements can severely disrupt the suspension of a motorcycle (especially at application of throttle), a phenomenon called "[[shaft effect|shaft jacking]]".  Moto Guzzi introduced its first anti-jacking system with the Daytona in 1993 and evolved that design though the 2005 V11 Sport.   Guzzi later introduced their CARC system, emulating the BMW Paralever design and serving the same function. Kawasaki introduced its Tetra-lever system for similar reasons on the Kawasaki Concours 14 (also known as the 1400 GTR).  Arturo Magni (1925–2005) had sold "parallelogrammo" rear suspension kit in the early 1980s to resolve similar anti-torque issues.

Moto Guzzi's current Breva 750, Nevada 750, and California Vintage fall below the threshold that requires an anti-jacking drive-shaft system.

The Breva 1100, Norge, Bellagio, Stelvio and 1200 Sport feature Guzzi's recently patented [[swingarm]] system, marketed as ''Compact Reactive Shaft Drive'' &ndash; also known as Ca. R.C. or CARC &ndash; introduced with the Breva 1100 in 2005. The system separates the shaft final drive’s torque reaction from the suspension via floating torque arms and thereby eliminates the abruptness typical of shaft drive systems on acceleration or throttle-release &ndash; still providing a quiet, reliable and low maintenance drive system. Reviewers have observed excellent braking performance and drive train smoothness attributable to the CARC system.<ref name="from Motorcycle News">{{cite web | url= http://www.mcnews.com/mcn/model_eval/decgrisoEval.pdf| work= Motorcycle Consumer News | format= PDF | title= Review, Motorcycle News, Moto Guzzi Griso 1100 |date=December 2006 | accessdate= 2007-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.mcnews.com/mcn/model_eval/MotoguzzinorgeJuly07.pdf| format=PDF | work= Motorcycle Consumer News | title= Model Evaluation, Motorcycle News, Moto Guzzi's Norge 1200 |date=June 2007 |  accessdate= 2007-09-04}}</ref>

===Rear swingarm suspension===
By 1928, long-distance motorcycle travel was limited by the lack of an effective rear suspension design.  Until then, alternative designs sacrificed torsional rigidity &ndash; gaining comfort but severely compromising handling. Carlo Guzzi and his brother Giuseppe designed an ''elastic frame'' using a sheet-steel box enclosing four springs, together with a swingarm in tubes and sheet metal.  The first Moto Guzzi bike to employ the suspension was named the G.T. (for Gran Turismo, ''Grand Touring''), and to prove the suspension &ndash; and gain publicity for Moto Guzzi &ndash; the brothers conceived a challenging {{convert|4000|mi|-2|sing=on}} journey from Mandello del Lario to [[Capo Nord]] in northern [[Norway]]. Despite the very poor condition of European roads at that time, Giuseppe Guzzi reached the [[Arctic Circle]] in four weeks. The elastic frame rear suspension was immediately introduced to production machines, transforming the usability of the motorcycle as an everyday form of transportation.  In 2006, Moto Guzzi retraced the 'raid' of 1928 to introduce the Norge 1200. The word "Norge" is Norwegian for "Norway".

===First DOHC V8 motorcycle engine===
[[Image:04-7-09-22MandelloMuseoV8-1957.JPG|thumb|right|The DOHC V8 at the Moto Guzzi Museum, Mandello del Lario]]
{{Main|Moto Guzzi Grand Prix 500 cc V8}}
The Moto Guzzi Grand Prix V8, introduced in 1955, was a 500&nbsp;cc racing motorcycle fitted with a [[V8 engine]] using [[DOHC|dual overhead camshafts]] (DOHC). The engine was conceived by Giulio Carcano, Enrico Cantoni, Umberto Todero, [[Ken Kavanagh]] and Fergus Anderson just after the 1954 Monza Grand Prix and designed by Dr. Carcano.<ref name="v8 guzzi">{{cite web | url= http://www.motopaedia.com/Bikes/guzzi_v8_1955__1957.htm | title= Guzzi V8 (1955 - 1957) | work= www.motopaedia.com | accessdate= 2007-11-05
}}</ref> The bore and stroke of the engine were {{convert|44.0|x|40.5|mm|abbr=on}}: there were two valves per cylinder. Power was in the region of {{convert|80|bhp|abbr=on}} at 12,000&nbsp;rpm, approximately {{convert|10|to-|15|bhp|abbr=on}} more than the rival 4-cylinder MV Agustas and Gileras.

The engine and the bike were unprecedented. The motorcycle proved capable of achieving {{convert|172|mi/h|km/h|-1|abbr=on}}&mdash;thirty years before the speed was reached again in Grand Prix motorcycle racing. However, the ''Otto Cilindri'' proved difficult to ride, as well as complex and expensive to build and maintain&mdash;bikes suffered broken crankshafts, overheating and seizing&mdash;all in addition to the danger the bike posed to the racers themselves. By 1957 there were two bikes available and no one willing to race the bike without further development and the bike was withdrawn.

===Motorcycle wind tunnel===
[[Image:Soufflerie2004 03.jpg|thumb|right|Exterior View, The Moto Guzzi Wind Tunnel, Moto Guzzi Headquarters, Mandello del Lario, Italy]]
In 1950 Moto Guzzi created the first motorcycle [[wind tunnel]],<ref name="first"/> ''La Galleria del Vento'', capable of testing 1:1 prototypes at the Mandello del Lario works, thereby allowing the company to market an integral fairing. The wind tunnel enabled racers to mimic real-life riding conditions and optimize their seating and body position at varying racing speeds &ndash; an unprecedented advantage for racing and production motorcycles. In motorcycle prototyping, Moto Guzzi could refine the air stream around the motorcycle itself, develop an envelope of still air around the rider, reduce frontal area, optimize air penetration, and maximize fuel economy.

The wind tunnel design is a modification of the open-circuit Eiffel type (after [[Gustave Eiffel]], designer of the [[Eiffel tower]] in Paris), consisting of three sections. Air is drawn into the "Air Duct" with an aperture of {{convert|8.2|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}, air speed increases as it is passed through smaller and smaller diameters reaching max wind speed in the "Test Chamber" with a diameter of {{convert|2.6|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}, and finally is exhausted through the "Outlet/Discharge" duct containing the fan mechanism &ndash; a three-bladed variable speed propeller driven by a {{Convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} electric motor.

Located outside of the testing chamber adjacent to the central section, a control room houses fan mechanism controls and the measuring instruments. Outside of the chamber is a large dial "Scala Convenzionale" or "Conventional Scale"  to indicate the varying degree of resistance offered by the motorcycle (and rider) to the passing air. Around the circumference of the dial, red lights at each degree provide a visual indicator to the rider and test personnel. This large scale remains visible to the rider in the tunnel during testing and by repositioning himself on the bike he can determine the changing and optimal resistance. A second measurement tool was an alcohol-filled micro-manometer connected to a [[Pitot tube]] placed at a 90&ndash;degree angle to the airflow in the tunnel.

It is unknown to what extent the wind tunnel is used currently. The December 2005 press release for the Norge 1200 states that the bike was "thoroughly tested" in the Mandello wind tunnel.<ref name="prnewswire.com"/>
Aprilia, a company in the same group as Moto Guzzi, maintains a relationship with the aerodynamics program at the [[University of Perugia]], where computer simulations combined with practical tests (done in smaller tunnels using scale models) can more effectively and economically provide accurate testing and feedback.

===Truck-motorcycle hybrid===
The Ercole (Hercules), produced in 1928, was capable of carrying an 800&nbsp;lb (363&nbsp;kg) load.<ref name="iacctexas.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.iacctexas.com/newsletter/march.pdf|format=PDF|title=Moto Guzzi: The Rebirth of a Legend by Alex di Bagno, GM Moto Guzzi North America, 2001|accessdate=2007-09-07|work=iacctexas.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929072801/http://www.iacctexas.com/newsletter/march.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}</ref>
Guzzi built a range of "goods vehicles", from 50&nbsp;cc to 500&nbsp;cc, between 1928 and 1980.

===Large-wheel scooter===
[[File:MGScooter-S11-Wyrd.jpg|thumb|Moto Guzzi's Large Wheel Scooter]]
Though the design criteria of a [[scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]] have grown increasingly fluid, historically a scooter featured small wheels &ndash; especially in post-war Italy. The configuration, along with a compact engine, allowed the scooter its trademark step-through design. With the 1950 introduction of the Galletto 160, Moto Guzzi developed large-wheel scooter. The larger wheels afford greater gyroscopic force and thereby greater balance.{{dubious|date=February 2013}} Large-wheeled scooters also reduce vulnerability to pot-holes. The Galletto not only offered larger wheels, it carried its own spare.

==Motorcycle models==
[[Image:Moto Guzzi Stelvio.jpg|right|thumb|Moto Guzzi Stelvio]]
{{main|List of Moto Guzzi motorcycles}}
Moto Guzzi models currently in production include the Breva, Nevada Classic and Bellagio standards; [[Moto Guzzi California|California]] cruiser; Griso sport/standard hybrid; Norge 1200 [[sport touring|sport tourer]]/GT; 1200 Sport and MGS-01 Corsa [[sportbike]]s; Stelvio [[dualsport]].

Guzzi has made a number of historic racing and military motorcycles. The historic racing heritage is best epitomized in the Le Mans model range, still held today to be a styling masterpiece and motorcycle design as an art form.<ref>[[Moto Guzzi Le Mans]]</ref>

Through various periods of its history, Moto Guzzi has produced models specifically for military and police forces. The Italian police and military and various US police departments (e.g. [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]]) have used Moto Guzzi bikes in their fleets. Guzzi currently markets police versions of model range &ndash; the Breva (all three models) most commonly, as well as the Norge, adopted by [[Berlin]] police.<ref name="piaggiogroup.com/news">{{Cite web|url=http://www.piaggiogroup.com/news/2008/moto_guzzi_norge_for_berlin_police_en.htm|title=MOTO GUZZI TO SUPPLY BERLIN POLICE WITH "NORGE" TOURING MOTORCYCLES|accessdate=2010-06-26|year=2008|work=piaggiogroup.com/news}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Factory, company headquarters and museum==
Since 1921, Moto Guzzi headquarters have been located in [[Mandello del Lario]] on the Lecco branch of [[Lake Como]]. The facility began at a size of {{convert|300|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, and by the early 1950s Moto Guzzi covered {{convert|24000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} with a workforce of over 1,500.  As of 1999, the complex included one, two and three story buildings of over {{convert|54000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, operating at approximately 50% of production capacity.<ref name="SEC 1999"/>

During its ownership tenure, [[Aprilia]] considered moving the entire operation to [[Monza]], under protest from the Guzzisti and Mandello factory workers.  Instead, Aprilia renovated the factory in 2004 at a cost of $45 million.<ref name="iacctexas.com"/>

The original Mandello site remains home to the company's headquarters, the production facility, the historic wind tunnel, the company library, and the museum. The [[Moto Guzzi Museum]] displays models from the company's history, engines that retrace Guzzi's engineering history, and a series of important prototypes. The museum is open to the public, and includes a gift shop featuring books, clothing and accessories. Moto Guzzi currently employs roughly 250 to 300 employees, making over 10,000 bikes per year.

For decades, the Moto Guzzi factory carried a set of internally lit block letters along the rooftop (and also over the entry gate) spelling "Moto Guzzi". In May 2007, the original roof sign, old and worn, was replaced with a new brighter sign carrying the current official logo and script. At the same time, the factory entrance gate received a new rectangular version of the sign.

==Engineering, design and styling==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}

===Frame design===
Before the Tonti Frame, several Guzzis used a frame known as the Loop Frame.  It was at the time, considered sufficient.

Engineered by Lino Tonti, the Tonti Frame gave Moto Guzzi a new and up-to-date structural backbone for its cycles beginning with the V7 Sport of 1971. Tonti designed the frame with racing in mind, with the goals of mass centralization, lighter weight and compactness.  The frame is especially light and strong, and remains in use to this day in modified form in the small block Breva 750 and Nevada Classic and in the big block California. The design contrasted sharply with competitors' frame designs at the time of its introduction; many motorcycles were noted for their "hinge in the middle" feel. The frame tilts the engine slightly rearward.

The Tonti frame was engineered for stiffness using short, straight tubes working well with the engine design and allowing the main backbone to pass through the cylinder splay and connect the steering head to the swingarm in the shortest possible distance.

The frame hugs the engine tightly, giving 'Tonti' big-blocks a low center of gravity and compact overall dimensions. Unladen, 'Tonti' Guzzis are very small, low and easy to handle. Detachable lower-frame tubes accommodate engine access and can be modified for specific applications such as floorboards and pegs.

Dr. John Whittner later adapted a frame design known as the spine frame, a version of which would be incorporated into the early Daytona, Centauro, and 1100 Sports models.

===Styling===
{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}
Moto Guzzi also has its own design and styling studio at the Mandello del Lario works, and in recent years (beginning during the Aprilia tenureship), Moto Guzzi has used independent Italian agency Marabese Design for the V11, V10 Centauro, Breva 750 850 and 1100, Griso and Norge. Marabese Design was founded in 1997 and is led by Luciano Marabese along with Rodolfo Frascoli and Riccardo Marabese.  Moto Guzzi worked with [[Ghezzi & Brian]] on the MGS-01 Corsa.

It remains unclear what role Piaggio's Pontedera headquarters plays with the ongoing design of Moto Guzzi models.

== Logo ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[Image:Guzzi Logo 1936.jpg|thumb|right|The original logo]]
[[Image:Moto Guzzi Logo SEIMM.png|thumb|right|Logo from the SEIMM years]]
[[Image:Moto Guzzi Logo 1990s.jpg|thumb|right|Logo from the 1990s]]
[[Image:Motoguzzi.jpg|thumb|right|Current three-dimensional logo]]

Giovanni Ravelli, Giorgio Parodi and Carlo Guzzi had envisioned [[Moto Guzzi#1921.E2.80.931966 - Origins|the creation of a motorcycle company]] after [[World War I]]. When Ravelli was killed in a plane crash just days after the end of the war, Parodi and Guzzi chose to commemorate Ravelli by choosing as the emblem of their company, the symbol that represented their camaraderie and their common passion for flight: the insignia of the Italian Air Corp, ''l’aquila ad ali spiegate'', the winged eagle. Originally, the emblem consisted solely of the gold eagle (with wings spread) over the Moto Guzzi lettering, usually in a [[sans-serif]] typeface.  From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, the eagle was heavily stylized, with the upper edge of the outspread wings forming a smooth, horizontal line. The late eighties saw a return to the less stylized gold eagle. The nineties saw the eagle and Moto Guzzi script on a flat red oval with a gold band along its perimeter. Circa 2004, the emblem reached its current, three-dimensional form.

== Customer engagement ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Since 2001, Moto Guzzi has annually hosted ''Giornate Mondiali Guzzi'', also known as GMG or World Guzzi Days, inviting fans to Mandello. In 2006 over 15,000 Guzzi fans from over 20 countries traveled to Mandello for the event.<ref name="prnewswire.com"/> GMG 2007 took place on 14&ndash;16 September 2007, with 17,000 Guzzisti attending, the introduction of the Griso 8V, a Museum exhibit "''Moto Guzzi e i Motori''" (Moto Guzzi's Engines), display of the first Griso 8V off the assembly line (awarded by raffle), and 500 gift sets of commemorative [[intake valve]]s.  Another exhibit, "Guzzi Art", featured the work of students at the European Design Institute.

Moto Guzzi clubs include Moto Guzzi World Club, the official worldwide club of Moto Guzzi, formed 2002 at GMG, which publishes the quarterly ''Aquile''; Moto Guzzi National Owners Club. Moto Guzzi Club GB, formed in 1976 which publishes a bi-monthly magazine "Gambalunga".

In 1993 Amedeo Castellani built the Raceco Daytona that competed with sponsorship by 3xmotorcycles who were the importers of Moto Guzzi for the United Kingdom. At the end of its development in 1997 the Raceco Guzzi weighed only 175&nbsp;kg and developed a staggering 140&nbsp;bhp. It was taken to race and championship success by riders such as Ian Cobby, and Australian Grand Prix star Paul 'Angry Ant' Lewis. It is written by author Mick Walker this motorcycle won every race it entered and finished. The development to the motorcycle was such that Moto Guzzi used it on their stand at the Milan Motor Show and probably helped them develop the Moto Guzzi MGS-01.

The '''Conservative Party of Canada''' ({{lang-fr|Parti conservateur du Canada}}), colloquially known as the '''[[Tory|Tories]]''', is a [[political party]] in [[Canada]] which was formed by the merger of the [[Canadian Alliance]] (a political party which formed as a result of the [[Reform Party of Canada]]'s [[United Alternative]] initiative), and the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] in 2003. It is positioned on the right of the [[Politics of Canada|Canadian political spectrum]]. The party came to power in the [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006 federal election]] as a [[minority government]], a position it maintained after the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 election]], before winning its first [[majority government]] in  [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011]].

The current party leader is [[Stephen Harper]], who has been the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] since 2006.  He is the only leader the '''Conservative Party of Canada''' has ever had, thus it is accordingly almost indistinguishable from his personality, policies and tactics.  Several early leadership contenders including [[Belinda Stronach]] and [[Garth Turner]] departed the Conservative Party prior to its taking power, and since then deviation from Harper policies has tended to lead to rapid exclusion from his caucus.  No strong leadership contender has ever publicly challenged Harper for leadership of the Party from inside its ranks though [[Peter MacKay]], [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]] and several other current federal cabinet ministers remain influential in the Party.  Harper's close control of his caucus and cabinet, tendency to oust government agency heads who disagree even slightly, and close watch on his "back bench" have been noted often in international press, which often notes the unusually powerful executive power of a Canadian Prime Minister with a majority government.<ref>{{cite web|last=Klinkenborg |first=Verlyn |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/stephen_harper/index.html |title=Stephen Harper News - The New York Times |publisher=Topics.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>  At least one book has been written specifically on this topic, [http://www.harperland.ca/].  Of particular note is his close control of media contacts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ualberta.ca/centres/ccs/issues/freedomofthepressandprimeministerharpersmediapolicy.php |title=Home - The Centre for Constitutional Studies |publisher=Law.ualberta.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>

From time to time, "backbench" MPs break ranks on specific issues, leading to speculation that Harper has lost central control
[http://en.princearthurherald.com/news/detail/has-harper-lost-control-of-his-backbench-/?language_id=1].  This is notably evident on [[abortion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-notebook/backbench-tory-breaks-ranks-vows-aggressive-stand-against-abortion/article2183552/?service=mobile |title=Backbench Tory breaks ranks, vows aggressive stand against abortion - The Globe and Mail |publisher=M.theglobeandmail.com |date=2012-09-10 |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>   ''See abortion below.''  However, some cabinet ministers have managed to express different views publicly without evident sanction, notably [[James Moore (Canadian politician)|James Moore]] on the [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines|Northern Gateway]] pipeline, in which Moore took the position that the BC provincial government could refuse it regardless of what the federal government were to say or do.

===National Council===
The National Council is the party's national governing body that is elected by the Conservative Party membership at its bi-annual meetings.  A National Councillor is elected for a two-year term and cannot serve for more than three consecutive terms.<ref name="conservative.ca">http://www.conservative.ca/?page_id=37</ref>

Composition of the National Council is based on the following criteria;
* four members from a province with more than 100 seats in the House of Commons;
* three members from a province with between 52 - 100 seats;
* two from any province with between 26 - 50 seats;
* one member from each province with between 4 - 25 seats;
* one member from each territory;
* the Party leader;
* The Chair of the Conservative Fund Canada (in a non-voting role); and 
* the Executive Director (also in a non-voting role).<ref>http://www.conservative.ca/media/2012/06/Sept2011-Constitution-E.pdf</ref>

At present, the National Council has four members from Ontario; two each from Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec; one each from the remaining provinces and territories for a total of 19 members,<ref name="conservative.ca"/> plus the party leader and the two non-voting members for a total 22 members.

===President===
The party President is elected by National Council following their election. Since 2006, the President of the Conservative Party has been [[John Walsh (Canadian politician)|John Walsh]], a councillor representing Ontario.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservative.ca/?cc=john-walsh |title=John Walsh (President) &#124; Conservative Party of Canada |publisher=Conservative.ca |date=2003-10-16 |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>

===Executive Director===
The Executive Director answers to the party President, and is responsible for the day-to-day management and operations of the party.

From February 2009 to October 2013, the Executive Director was [[Dan Hilton]].

From October to December 2013, the Acting Executive Director was Dave Forestell.

[[Dimitri Soudas]] was named the new Executive Director in December 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/12/07/harper-loyalist-dimitri-soudas-named-executive-director-of-conservative-party-of-canada/ |title=Harper loyalist Dimitri Soudas named executive director of Conservative Party of Canada &#124; National Post |publisher=News.nationalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>  On March 30, 2014, Soudas was told to resign or be fired from the position after allegedly interfering with the nomination contest taking place in his fiancee's riding.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/dimitri-soudas-fired-as-conservative-party-executive-director-1.2592198 |title=Dimitri Soudas fired as Conservative Party executive director - Politics - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>

On March 30, 2014, [[Simon Thompson (politician)|Simon Thompson]] was named as interim Executive Director.  Thompson was previously the party's Chief Information Officer.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

In July 2014, Dustin Van Vugt was brought in as the Deputy Executive Director&nbsp;– a position created specifically for him.<ref>http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservatives-turn-to-dustin-van-vugt-to-replace-dimitri-soudas-1.2695409</ref>  Some media agencies, such as the CBC, suggested that this was a way for Thompson to begin handing over the work for the top job to Van Vugt, until his promotion to Executive Director could be formally ratified by the party's National Council. In October 2014, Van Vugt's position was unanimously ratified by the party's National Council, and Thompson became the Chief Operations Officer.<ref>http://www.conservative.ca/media/2014/10/october-nc-report.pdf</ref>

===Director of Political Operations===
The Director of Political Operations reports to the Executive Director, and is one of the most important positions within the party.  The person filling this role often has direct access to the party leader, due to their responsibilities for organizing the party's work on the ground and in preparing for the next election. With [[Stephen Harper]] as Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader, the Director of Political Operations has frequently moved from party positions to the Prime Minister's and other Minister's Offices, and then back to the party's headquarters, depending on the identified needs.

From the party's founding in 2004 until 2006, [[Ian Brodie]] was the party's Director of Political Operations.

With Stephen Harper forming a minority government in 2006, [[Doug Finley]] became the Director of Political Operations and Ian Brodie became the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff.

In 2009, Finley was appointed to the Senate and [[Jenni Byrne]], then Finley's Deputy, became the Director.

In August 2013, Byrne left the job to become the co-Deputy Chief of Staff in the Prime Minister's Office. [[Fred DeLorey]], then the party's Director of Communications, became the Director.

==Principles and policies==

[[File:Stephen Harper G8 2007.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[The Right Honourable]] [[Stephen Harper]], 22nd [[Prime Minister of Canada]] (2006-present) and Leader of the Conservative Party.]]

===Of historical predecessors===

The historical [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867–1942)|Conservative Party]] identified strongly with the [[British Empire]] and aimed instead to model Canadian political institutions after British ones opposing the policies of the Liberal Party which favoured Canadian nationalism and political independence from Britain as well as economically [[Continentalism#Continentalism in North America|continentalist]] policies such as [[free trade]] and further integration with the United States rather than greater political and economic ties with the British Empire and later on the Commonwealth.<ref name="North America">{{cite web|last=Hoberg|first=George|title=Canada and North American S35 Integration|url=http://economics.ca/cgi/jab?journal=cpp&view=v26s2/CPPv26s2p035.pdf|publisher=Canadian Public Policy|accessdate=11 February 2013}}</ref>

This policy was reversed when the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]], under the leadership of [[Brian Mulroney]], began to emphasize more power for [[market forces]] in the economy and reached a [[Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement|landmark free-trade deal]] with the United States in 1988.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brian Mulroney’s lasting legacy: Free Trade Agreement|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/editorials/brian-mulroneys-lasting-legacy-free-trade-agreement/article4586844/|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=3 October 2012}}</ref>  Mulroney however simultaneously pursued an utterly independent foreign policy similar to [[Pierre Trudeau]], taking strong stances against abuses by the state of [[Israel]], against the mining of harbours in [[Nicaragua]] by [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration, accepting refugees from Latin American regimes supported by the USA, and (in opposition to both Reagan and [[Margaret Thatcher]]) condemning and setting sanctions against [[South Africa]] [[apartheid]].  Foreign minister and former Prime Minister [[Joe Clark]] was the key spokesperson for the party in these matters.  He condemns and has not joined the post-2004 party, openly favouring [[Paul Martin]] of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] in 2006,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://can.politics.narkive.com/QOc5qiRs/joe-clark-favours-martin-over-harper-for-pm |title=Joe Clark favours Martin over Harper for PM |publisher=Can.politics.narkive.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>  and standing against arts <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/news-views/news/ex-tory-pm-condemns-harper-arts-cuts-2481/ |title=FFWD - Calgary News & Views - News - Ex-Tory PM condemns Harper arts cuts |publisher=Ffwdweekly.com |date=2008-09-04 |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref> and other policies.  [[David Crombie]], another Mulroney-era minister, who oversaw the [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]] report preparation, has also been critical of Reform-authored policies on natives.

===Since 2004===

====Foreign policy====

Reform favoured a more closely US-allied foreign policy.  It remains a matter of controversy to what degree these have affected '''Conservative''' policy or would continue to after the current administration.  While [[Stephen Harper]] did in Opposition openly (in the House) favour the non-UN-sanctioned 2003 attack on Iraq <ref>[http://www.macleans.ca/columnists/article.jsp?content=20070129_139786_139786 ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref> he later admitted this had been a mistake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/iraq-war-a-mistake-harper-admits-1.330207 |title=Iraq war a mistake, Harper admits &#124; CTV News |publisher=Ctvnews.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>  Conservative Party member resolutions express strong support for [[state of Israel]] and aggressive action against perceived sponsors of [[terrorism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

=====Refugees and deportations of Iraq War resisters=====

One matter on which parties differ sharply in Canada, is that on refugees and "draft dodgers".  Refugee policy changes including refusal of refugee status to those fleeing persecution by governments considered "safe" by Canada for most persons, and especially mandatory detention of refugees,<ref>{{cite web|author=By KATIE DEROSA, Victoria Times Colonist November 17, 2012 |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Mandatory+detention+refugee+claimants+already+proved+failure+critics/7563279/story.html |title=Mandatory detention for refugee claimants has already proved to be a failure, critics say |publisher=Vancouversun.com |date=2012-11-17 |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>  have been very controversial.

According to all 110 Conservative Party MPs, "[[conscientious objectors]]" to "wars not sanctioned by the [[United Nations]]" should not be given a special "program" to "remain in Canada", who voted on this issue in the [[Parliament of Canada]] on 3 June 2008.<ref name="Smith">{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/436575|title=MPs vote to give asylum to U.S. military deserters|first=Joanna|last=Smith|publisher=The Toronto Star|date=3 June 2008|accessdate=19 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/cmte/CommitteePublication.aspx?SourceId=222011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090213025638/http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=3204056&Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=2|archivedate=13 February 2009|title=Report&nbsp;— Iraq War Resisters/Rapport&nbsp;–Opposants à la guerre en Irak|publisher=House of Commons/Chambre des Communes, Ottawa, Canada|accessdate=9 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=2&DocId=3543213#Int-2506938|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090213022442/http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=2&DocId=3543213#Int-2506938|archivedate=13 February 2009|title=Official Report * Table of Contents * Number 104 (Official Version)|publisher=House of Commons/Chambre des Communes, Ottawa, Canada|accessdate=9 June 2008}}</ref> On 13 September 2008, this refusal to set up a “special program” was reiterated by a Conservative party spokeswoman after the first such [[conscientious objector]] (Robin Long) had been deported and sentenced to 15 months in jail.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/article/484115|title=Iraq war resister sentenced to 15 months|date=23 August 2008|first=Nick|last=Kyonka|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=13 September 2008}}</ref> This deportation occurred against the 3 June 2008 recommendation of a majority of elected representatives in Parliament.<ref name="Smith"/> (See [[Canada and Iraq War Resisters|details about two motions in Parliament concerning Canada and Iraq War Resisters]].)

=====China=====

Consistent in all recent Canadian governments is strong ties to [[China]].  In 2013, the Conservative administration approved the acquisition of [[Nexen]] by a Chinese firm.  It also advanced, as of 2013, [[FIPA]] agreement, containing guarantees that Chinese buyer would have the legal right to sue Canada in private settlement of inhibition to its activities by that government (including provincial or municipal for whom the federal government would be liable).  The actual extent or limit of these powers would not be publicly known and settlements would be private, in effect a "confidential lawsuit",<ref>{{cite web|author=Tuesday, August 12, 2014 4:09 PM EDT |url=http://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/2012/09/29/canadachina_investment_deal_allows_for_confidential_lawsuits_against_canada.html |title=Canada-China investment deal allows for confidential lawsuits against Canada &#124; Toronto Star |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2012-09-29 |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>  for instance a future BC or Canadian government reversing a federal approval of the [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines|Northern Gateway]] pipeline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouverobserver.com/sustainability/chinese-companies-can-sue-bc-changing-course-northern-gateway-says-policy-expert |title=Chinese companies can sue BC for changing course on Northern Gateway, says policy expert |publisher=Vancouver Observer |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>  The powers surrendered were so drastic as to be criticized heavily from many quarters,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/Harper+locking+into+China+deal/7545068/story.html |title=Article |publisher=canada.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>  even normally supportive financial press <ref>{{cite web|url=http://opinion.financialpost.com/2012/11/02/canada-china-trade-deal-is-too-one-sided/ |title=Canada-China trade deal is too one-sided &#124; Financial Post |publisher=Opinion.financialpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref> and are the subject of a current lawsuit.<ref>{{cite web|author=David P.

In other respects, Conservative MPs have sometimes been sharply critical of China particularly over [[human rights]] policies and especially treatment of the [[Falun Gong]].  These positions are not materially different than those of other parties.

====Parliamentary democracy====

Prior to winning election, Stephen Harper openly favoured the [[alternative vote]] method of selecting both MPs and Senators.

As the successor of the [[Western Canada|western-based]] Canadian Alliance (formerly the [[Reform Party of Canada]]), the party supports reform of the [[Canadian Senate|Senate]] to make it "elected, equal, and effective" (the "[[Triple-E Senate]]"). However, party leader Stephen Harper advised the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] to appoint the unelected [[Michael Fortier]] to both the Senate and to the Cabinet on 6 February 2006, the day his [[minority government]] took office.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090212072026/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060207/michael_fortier_060207], ''[[CTV News]]'', 7 February 2006</ref> On 22 December 2008 Prime Minister Harper asked the Governor General to fill all eighteen Senate seats that had been vacant at the time. It was earlier reported in ''[[Toronto Star|The Toronto Star]]'' that this action was "to kill any chance of a Liberal-NDP [[coalition government]] filling the vacancies next year".<ref>{{cite news|author=Bruce campion-smith Ottawa bureau chief|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/552046|title=Harper set to name 18 to Senate|publisher=thestar.com|date=11 December 2008|accessdate=28 April 2010|location=Toronto}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Harper to fill 18 Senate seats with Tory loyalists|author=CTV News|publisher=Ctv.ca|date=12 September 2008|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20081210/harper_senate_081210}}</ref>

The party introduced a bill in the parliament to have fixed dates for elections and, with the support of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], passed it. However, Ned Franks, a Canadian parliamentary expert, maintains that the Prime Minister still has the right to advise the Governor General to dissolve the parliament early and [[Dropping the writ|drop the writs for an election]].<ref>{{cite news|title=PM can override fixed-date vote: expert|publisher=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=15c68d91-edff-467f-9045-6f8c44c631d3|date=9 April 2008}}</ref>

=====Transparency and accountability=====

In 2006 the Conservatives campaigned strongly against Liberal abuses in the [[Sponsorship scandal]] and vowed to introduce several accountability measures that would hold even a [[majority government]] to account.  These included a [[Parliamentary Budget Office]] whose first head [[Kevin Page]] found himself often sharply at odds with Harper government policy and issued several reports scathing of Conservative practices, even sometimes being described as the "sharpest thorn in Harper's side".<ref>{{cite web|last=Radia |first=Andy |url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/canada-politics/parliamentary-budget-officer-kevin-page-biggest-thorn-stephen-165034340.html |title=Parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page: The biggest thorn in Stephen Harper’s side &#124; Canada Politics - Yahoo News Canada |publisher=Ca.news.yahoo.com |date=2012-06-21 |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>  Major media commentators often use Page's reports as a starting point for general criticisms of Harper's budgetary and transparency practices <ref>http://www.cbc.ca/player/Shows/Shows/The+National/At+Issue/ID/2331063078/</ref> including comedic rants.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Huffington Post Canada |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/01/30/rick-mercer-kevin-page-budget-officer_n_2581550.html |title=Rick Mercer Praises Kevin Page For Standing Up To The Tories (VIDEO) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.ca |date=2013-01-30 |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref>

While other accountability officers have been similarly ignored or critical, the influence and neutrality of the persons who were appointed, and the general public trust of their opinions, seems to be an indication of success on long term transparency.  The office is likely to continue under future admnistrations and be quite difficult to eliminate or ignore.

By contrast, agency discipline and [[Canadian Senate]] appointments have tended to reflect a more cynical view that parties in power tend to forget transparency and accountability promises made when out of power.

====Domestic issues====

In its founding documents, the Conservative Party avowed principles of lower taxes, smaller government, more [[decentralization]] of federal government powers to the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]], modeled after the [[Meech Lake Accord]], traditional religious and cultural values<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservative.ca/party/founding_principles/ |title=Founding Principles |publisher=Conservative.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-03-01}}</ref> and has in practice strongly supported [[Oil Sands]] and other controversial energy projects.<ref>{{Citation |first=Stephen |last=Leahy |title=Canada's environmental activists seen as 'threat to national security' |date=14 February 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/feb/14/canada-environmental-activism-threat |accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref> The Party has also both avowed and introduced legislation to reduce some gun controls and some MPs openly favour the [[death penalty]].

=====Abortion=====
The current Conservative government position on abortion is that a debate on abortion legislation will not take place in Parliament.  Party leader Stephen Harper stated that "As long as I’m prime minister we are not reopening the abortion debate".<ref>{{cite news|title=Harper says he won't reopen abortion debate |publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=21 April 2011|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadavotes2011/story/2011/04/21/cv-election-parenthood-042111.html#}}</ref>

The appointment of Dr. [[Henry Morgentaler]], an abortion rights activist, to the prestigious [[Order of Canada]], was deplored by some Conservative MPs. The Conservative government distanced itself from the award.<ref>{{cite news|title=Morgentaler 'honoured' by Order of Canada; federal government 'not involved'|publisher=CBC News |date=2 July 2008|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/07/02/morgentaler-reax.html#ixzz121c0mPs2}}</ref>

The Conservative government excluded the funding of [[abortion]]s in Canada's G8 health plan. Harper argued that he wanted to focus on non-divisive policies. This stance was opposed by the Liberals, [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|NDP]] and international health and women's groups.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maternal plan should unite Canadians: Harper|publisher=[[CBC News]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2010/04/27/maternal-health-harper.html|date=27 April 2010}}</ref> The [[Roman Catholicism in Canada|Archbishop of Quebec and Primate of Canada]], [[Marc Ouellet]], praised this decision, but urged Harper to do more "in defence of the unborn".<ref name=abortionrally>{{cite news|title=Anti-abortion activists praise Harper's maternal-health stand|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=13 May 2010|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/anti-abortion-activists-praise-harpers-maternal-health-stand/article1568191|location=Toronto}}</ref> In May 2010, 18 Conservative MPs addressed thousands of students at the [[pro-life]] 13th annual March for Life rally on [[Parliament Hill]].<ref name=abortionrally/>

=====Same-sex marriage=====
Party leader Stephen Harper has repeatedly stated that his government will not attempt to ban same-sex marriage in Canada. Same sex marriage was recognised nationwide in Canada in 2005 with the [[Civil Marriage Act]]. Harper most recently restated this commitment after news broke that a lawyer with the federal Justice Department was of the opinion that foreign same-sex couples visiting Canada to get married who are from regions where same sex marriage is illegal were not obligated to get divorced in Canada, since their marriage in their home region was never legitimate. Harper corrected the record and restated that his government will not legislate nor attempt to legislate same-sex marriage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/01/12/same-sex-marriage-in-canada-will-not-be-revisited-harper-says/|title=Gay marriage in Canada will not be revisited, Harper says|date=12 January 2012|accessdate=22 January 2012}}</ref>

The party had a [[free vote]] on whether the House wanted to reopen the issue of same-sex marriage, which was defeated. In March 2011, just ahead of the expected Canadian election, the Conservatives added one line about gay rights to the "Discover Canada" booklet for new immigrants which they had published in 2009: "Canada’s diversity includes gay and lesbian Canadians, who enjoy the full protection of an equal treatment under the law, including access to civil marriage". The Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism, [[Jason Kenney]], had previously removed mention of gay rights from the booklet published in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20110314/citizenship-guide-110314|title=Citizenship guide gets single sentence on gay rights|date=14 March 2011|accessdate=5 April 2011}}</ref>

=====Crime and law enforcement=====
Before the majority was achieved in 2011, Conservatives promised to re-introduce [[Internet surveillance]] legislation that they were not able to pass, bundling it with the rest of their crime bills.  They said they plan to fast track the legislation within 100&nbsp;days after taking office.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.techeye.net/security/canadian-conservatives-promise-big-brother-laws|title=Canadian conservatives promise "big brother laws": at least they are honest|publisher=TechEye|date=11 April 2011|accessdate=17 April 1011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/5733/125|title=Michael Geist – The Conservatives Commitment to Internet Surveillance|publisher=Michaelgeist.ca|date=9 April 2011|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2009/06/19/tech-internet-communications-electronic-police-bills-surveillance-follo-privacy.html|work=CBC News|title=Electronic snooping bill a 'data grab': privacy advocates|date=19 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/274527|title=New Canadian legislation will give police greater powers|publisher=Digitaljournal.com|date=21 June 2009|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2009/06/18/tech-internet-police-bill-intercept-electronic-communications.html|work=CBC News|title=ISPs must help police snoop on internet under new bill|date=18 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Matt Hartley and Omar El Akkad|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/tories-seek-to-widen-police-access-online/article1187507|title=Tories seek to widen police access online|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=18 June 2009|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref><ref>Canadian bill forces personal data from ISPs sans warrant – http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/18/canada_isp_intercept_bills/</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Jesse|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2011/04/13/harpers-promise-a-warrantless-online-surveillance-state/ |title=Harper's promise: a warrantless online surveillance state: Why ‘lawful access’ legislation is on its way and why that should worry you|publisher=Macleans.ca|date=13 April 2011|accessdate=17 April  2011}}</ref>  The Internet surveillance bill was later scrapped by the Conservatives and not put into law.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ibbitson|first=John |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/how-the-toews-sponsored-internet-surveillance-bill-quietly-died/article4179310/ |title=How the Toews-sponsored Internet surveillance bill quietly died |publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=18 June 2012|accessdate=12 August 2012}}</ref>

==History==

===Predecessors===
[[File:John A Macdonald (ca. 1875).jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Sir John A. Macdonald]], Prime Minister of Canada (1867–1873, 1878–1891), Canada's first Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal-Conservative Party, one of the party's predecessors.]]
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}

The Conservative Party is political heir to a series of right-of-centre parties that have existed in Canada, beginning with the [[Liberal-Conservative Party]] founded in 1854 by Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] and Sir [[George-Étienne Cartier]]. The party later became known simply as the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] after 1873. Like its historical predecessors and conservative parties in some other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]] (such as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party of the United Kingdom]]), members of the present-day Conservative Party of Canada are sometimes referred to as "Tories". The modern Conservative Party of Canada is also legal heir to the heritage of the historical conservative parties by virtue of assuming the assets and liabilities of the former [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] upon the merger of 2003.

[[File:Sir Robert Laird Borden, 1915.png|thumb|left|150px|[[Sir Robert Borden]], Prime Minister of Canada (1911–1920).]]
The first incarnations of the Conservative Party in Canada were quite different from the Conservative Party of today, especially on economic issues. The early Conservatives were known to espouse [[economic protectionism]] and [[British imperialism]], by emphasizing Canada's ties to the [[United Kingdom]] while vigorously opposing free trade with the [[United States]]; free trade being a policy which, at the time, had strong support from the ranks of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]].<ref name="North America"/> The Conservatives also sparred with the Liberal Party due to its connections with French Canadian nationalists including [[Henri Bourassa]] who wanted Canada to distance itself from Britain, and demanded that Canada recognize that it had two nations, [[English Canada]] and [[French Canada]], connected together through a common history. The Conservatives would go on with a popular slogan "one nation, one flag, one leader". {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

====Progressive Conservative Party of Canada====
The Conservative Party's popular support waned (particularly in western Canada) during difficult economic times from the 1920s to 1940s, as it was seen by many in the west as an eastern establishment party which ignored the needs of the citizens of [[Western Canada]]. Westerners of multiple political convictions including [[small c conservative|small-"c" conservatives]] saw the party as being uninterested in the economically unstable [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie]] regions of the west at the time and instead holding close ties with the business elite of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]. As a result of western alienation both the dominant Conservative and Liberal parties were challenged in the west by the rise of a number of protest parties including the [[Progressive Party of Canada]], the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF), the [[Reconstruction Party of Canada]] and the [[Social Credit Party of Canada]]. The Progressives once outpaced the Conservatives, and, in 1920, became [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]], though soon after, the Progressive Party folded. Its former leader [[John Bracken]] became leader of the Conservative Party in 1942 subject to several conditions, one of which was that the party be renamed the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[Image:John G. Diefenbaker.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[John Diefenbaker]], Prime Minister of Canada (1957–1963).]]
Meanwhile, many former supporters of the Progressive Conservative Party shifted their support to either the federal CCF or to the federal Liberals. The advancement of the provincially popular western-based conservative Social Credit Party in federal politics was stalled, in part by the strategic selection of leaders from the west by the Progressive Conservative Party. PC leaders such as [[John Diefenbaker]] and [[Joe Clark]] were seen by many westerners as viable challengers to the Liberals who traditionally had relied on the electorate in Quebec and Ontario for their power base. While none of the various protest parties ever succeeded in gaining significant power federally, they were damaging to the Progressive Conservative Party throughout its history, and allowed the federal Liberals to win election after election with strong urban support bases in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]. This historical tendency earned the Liberals the unofficial title often given by some political pundits of being Canada's "natural governing party". Prior to 1984, Canada was seen as having a [[dominant-party system]] led by the Liberal Party while Progressive Conservative governments therefore were considered by many of these pundits as [[caretaker government]]s, doomed to fall once the collective mood of the electorate shifted and the federal Liberal Party eventually came back to power.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[Image:Mulroney.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Brian Mulroney]], Prime Minister of Canada (1984–1993).]]
In 1984, the Progressive Conservative Party's electoral fortunes made a massive upturn under its new leader, [[Brian Mulroney]], an [[English language|anglophone]] [[Quebecer]] and former president of the [[Iron Ore Company of Canada]], who mustered a large coalition of westerners, aggravated over the [[National Energy Program]] of the Liberal government, suburban and small-town Ontarians, and soft [[Quebec nationalists]], who were angered over Quebec not having distinct status in the [[Constitution of Canada]] signed in 1982.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wooing nationalists is a risky courtship|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=7ae0209d-dfbf-4725-ad70-7175308efc93|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=9 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Gunter|first=Lorne|title=Shipbuilding contract is an iceberg waiting to be hit|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/10/19/ship-building-contract-is-an-iceberg-waiting-to-be-hit/|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=The National Post|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> This led to a huge landslide victory for the Progressive Conservative Party. Progressive Conservatives abandoned [[protectionism]] which the party had held strongly to in the past and which had aggravated westerners and businesses and fully espoused [[free trade]] with the United States and integrating Canada into a globalized economy. This was accomplished with the signing of the [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]] (FTA) of 1989 and much of the key implementation process of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which added [[Mexico]] to the Canada-U.S. free trade zone.<ref name="North America"/>

====Reform Party of Canada====
In the late 1980s and 1990s, federal conservative politics became split by the creation of a new western-based protest party, the populist and social conservative [[Reform Party of Canada]] created by [[Preston Manning]], son of [[Alberta]] Social Credit Premier [[Ernest Manning]]. It advocated deep [[decentralization]] of government power, abolition of [[official bilingualism]] and [[multiculturalism]], democratization of the [[Canadian Senate]], and suggested a potential return to [[capital punishment]], and advocated significant privatization of public services. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Westerners reportedly felt betrayed by the federal Progressive Conservative Party (PC), seeing it as catering to Quebec and urban Ontario interests over theirs. In 1989, Reform made headlines in the political scene when its first MP, [[Deborah Grey]], was elected in a [[by-election]] in Alberta, which was a shock to the PCs which had almost complete electoral dominance over the province for years. Another defining event for western conservatives was when Mulroney accepted the results of an unofficial Senate "election" held in Alberta, which resulted in the appointment of a Reformer, [[Stanley Waters]], to the Senate. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[Image:PrestonManning.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Preston Manning]], Reform party founder and leader from 1987 to 2000.]]

By the 1990s, Mulroney had failed to bring about Senate reform as he had promised (appointing a number of Senators in 1990). As well, social conservatives were dissatisfied with Mulroney's [[social progressivism]]. Canadians in general were furious with high unemployment, high debt and deficit, unpopular implementation of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST) in 1991, and the failed constitutional reforms of the [[Meech Lake Accord|Meech Lake]] and [[Charlottetown Accord|Charlottetown]] accords. In 1993, support for the Progressive Conservative Party collapsed, and the party's representation in the House of Commons dropped from an absolute majority of seats to only two seats. The 1993 results were the worst electoral disaster in Canadian history, and the Progressive Conservatives never fully recovered. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In 1993, federal politics became divided regionally. The Liberal Party took [[Ontario]], the [[Maritimes]] and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|territories]], the separatist [[Bloc Québécois]] took [[Quebec]], while the Reform Party took [[Western Canada]] and became the dominant conservative party in Canada. The problem of the split on the right was accentuated by Canada's [[single member plurality]] electoral system, which resulted in numerous seats being won by the Liberal Party, even when the total number of votes cast for PC and Reform Party candidates was substantially in excess of the total number of votes cast for the Liberal candidate. However, this was and remains a constant issue on the political left as well for the Liberals and NDP. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Merger===

====Rationale for the merger====
From 1993 to 2006, the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] was able to win three consecutive majority governments and one minority government under [[Paul Martin]].  Also during this time was a period of infighting between Progressive Conservatives and the up-and-coming Reform Party.  These two conservative parties fighting allowed the Liberal Party to remain in government, and even resulted in the separatist [[Bloc Québécois]] becoming the Official Opposition.

Conservatives began to notice that the only way to defeat the incumbent Liberals was to [[Unite the Right]] – to form one unified conservative party which could defeat the Liberals.

====Merger agreement====
In 2003, the [[Canadian Alliance]] (formerly the Reform Party) and Progressive Conservative parties agreed to merge into the present-day Conservative Party, with the Alliance faction conceding its populist ideals and some social conservative elements.

On 15 October 2003, after closed-door meetings were held by the Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservative Party, [[Stephen Harper]] (then the leader of the Canadian Alliance) and [[Peter MacKay]] (then the leader of the Progressive Conservatives) announced the "'Conservative Party Agreement-in-Principle", thereby merging their parties to create the new Conservative Party of Canada. After several months of talks between two teams of "emissaries", consisting of [[Don Mazankowski]], [[Bill Davis]] and [[Loyola Hearn]] on behalf of the PCs and [[Ray Speaker]] Senator [[Gerry St. Germain]] and [[Scott Reid (politician)|Scott Reid]] on behalf of the Alliance, the deal came to be.

On 5 December 2003 the Agreement-in-Principle was ratified by the membership of the Alliance by a margin of 96% to 4% in a national referendum conducted by postal ballot. On 6 December the PC Party held a series of regional conventions, at which delegates ratified the Agreement-in-Principle by a margin of 90% to 10%. On 7 December, the new party was officially registered with [[Elections Canada]]. On 20 March 2004, Harper was [[Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, 2004|elected leader]].

The merger was the culmination of the Canadian "[[Unite the Right]]" movement, driven by the desire to present an effective right-wing opposition to the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], to create a new party that would draw support from all parts of Canada and would not split the right-wing vote. The [[vote splitting|splitting]] of the right-wing vote contributed to Liberal victories in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]], [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 federal election]] and the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 election]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

====Opposition to the merger/defections====
The merger process was opposed by some elements in both parties. In the PCs in particular, the merger process resulted in organized opposition, and in a substantial number of prominent members refusing to join the new party. The opponents of the merger were not internally united as a single internal opposition movement, and they did not announce their opposition at the same moment. The reasons for dissent varied. [[David Orchard]] argued that his written agreement with [[Peter MacKay]], which had been signed a few months earlier at the [[Progressive Conservative leadership election, 2003|2003 Progressive Conservative Leadership convention]], excluded any such merger. Orchard announced his opposition to the merger before negotiations with the Canadian Alliance had been completed. Over the course of the following year, Orchard led an unsuccessful legal challenge to the merger of the two parties. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In October and November, during the course of the PC party's process of ratifying the merger, four sitting Progressive Conservative MPs — [[André Bachand (Progressive Conservative MP)|André Bachand]], [[John Herron (New Brunswick politician)|John Herron]], former [[Tory]] leadership candidate [[Scott Brison]], and former Prime Minister [[Joe Clark]] — announced their intention not to join the new Conservative Party caucus, as did retiring PC Party president [[Bruck Easton]]. Clark and Brison argued that the party's merger with the Canadian Alliance drove it too far to the right, and away from its historical position in Canadian politics. Brison, at first, voted for and supported the ratification of the Alliance-Tory merger, then crossed the floor to the Liberals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2003/12/10/brison_031210.html|title=MacKay slams Brison for joining the Liberals|publisher=CBC.ca|date=10 December 2003|accessdate=2011-03-28}}</ref> Soon afterward, he was made a parliamentary secretary in [[Paul Martin]]'s Liberal government, and became a full cabinet minister after the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]]. Herron also ran as a Liberal candidate in the election, but did not join the Liberal caucus prior to the election. He lost his seat to the new Conservative Party's candidate [[Rob Moore (politician)|Rob Moore]]. Bachand and Clark sat as independent Progressive Conservatives until an election was called in the spring of 2004, and then retired from Parliament.

On 14 January 2004, former Alliance leadership candidate [[Keith Martin (politician)|Keith Martin]], left the party, and sat temporarily as an independent. He was reelected, running as a Liberal, in the 2004 election, and again in 2006 and 2008. In the 38th Parliament (2004–05), Martin served as [[parliamentary secretary]] to Bill Graham, Canada's minister of defence. Additionally, three [[Canadian Senate|senators]], [[C. William Doody|William Doody]], [[Norman K. Atkins|Norman Atkins]], and [[Lowell Murray]], declined to join the new party and continue to sit in the upper house as a [[rump party|rump]] caucus of Progressive Conservatives.

In February 2005, Liberals attempted to exacerbate the split among Tory Senators by appointing two anti-merger  Progressive Conservatives, [[Nancy Ruth]] and [[Elaine McCoy]], to the Senate. Both joined the rump PC Senate caucus. However, this gambit was not entirely successful: in March 2006, Nancy Ruth joined the new Conservative Party and switched caucuses. In the early months following the merger, MP [[Rick Borotsik]], who had been elected as Manitoba's only PC, became openly critical of the new party's leadership. Borotsik chose not to run in the 2004 general election. Finally, following the 2004 federal election, Conservative Senator [[Jean-Claude Rivest]] left the party to sit as an independent (choosing not to join Senators Doody, Atkins and Murray in their rump Progressive Conservative caucus). Senator Rivest cited, as his reason for this action, his concern that the new party was too right-wing and  that it was insensitive to the needs and interests of Quebec. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Leadership election, 2004===
{{main|Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, 2004}}

In the immediate aftermath of the merger announcement, some Conservative activists hoped to recruit former Ontario Premier [[Mike Harris]] for the leadership. Harris declined the invitation, as did [[New Brunswick]] Premier [[Bernard Lord]] and [[Alberta]] Premier [[Ralph Klein]]. Outgoing Progressive Conservative leader [[Peter MacKay]] also announced he would not seek the leadership, as did former [[Democratic Representative Caucus]] leader [[Chuck Strahl]]. [[Jim Prentice]], who had been a candidate in the [[Progressive Conservative leadership election, 2003|2003 PC leadership contest]], entered the Conservative leadership race in mid-December but dropped out in mid-January due to an inability to raise funds so soon after his earlier leadership bid.

In the end, there were three candidates in the party’s [[Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, 2004|first leadership election]]: former [[Canadian Alliance]] leader [[Stephen Harper]], former [[Magna International]] CEO [[Belinda Stronach]], and former [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Ontario provincial PC]] Cabinet minister [[Tony Clement]]. Voting took place on 20 March 2004. A total of 97,397 ballots were cast.<ref>Tom Flanagan, ''Harper’s Team''. Montreal & Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2007, pg. 131</ref> Harper won on the first ballot with a commanding 68.9% of the vote (67,143 votes). Stronach received 22.9% (22,286 votes), and Clement received 8.2% (7,968 votes).<ref>Tom Flanagan, ''Harper's Team''. Montreal & Kingston: McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2007, pg. 133</ref>

The vote was conducted using a weighted voting system in which all of Canada’s 308 [[Electoral district (Canada)|ridings]] were given 100 points, regardless of the number of votes cast by party members in that riding (for a total of 30,800 points, with 15,401 points required to win). Each candidate would be awarded a number of points equivalent to the percentage of the votes they had won in that riding. For example, a candidate winning 50 votes in a riding in which the total number of votes cast was 100 would receive 50 points. A candidate would also receive 50 points for winning 500 votes in a riding where 1,000 votes were cast. In practice, there were wide differences in the number of votes cast in each riding across the country. More than 1,000 voters participated in each of the fifteen ridings with the highest voter turnout. By contrast, only eight votes were cast in each of the two ridings with the lowest levels of participation.)<ref name="Tom Flanagan 2007, p. 135">Tom Flanagan, ''Harper's Team''. Montreal & Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2007, pg. 135</ref> As a result, individual votes in the ridings where the greatest numbers of votes were cast were worth less than one percent as much as votes from the ridings where the fewest votes were cast.<ref name="Tom Flanagan 2007, p. 135"/>

The equal-weighting system gave Stronach a substantial advantage, because of the fact that her support was strongest in the parts of the country where the party had the fewest members, while Harper tended to win a higher percentage of the vote in ridings with larger membership numbers. Thus, the official count, which was based on points rather than on votes, gave her a much better result. Of 30,800 available points, Harper won 17,296, or 56.2%. Stronach won 10,613 points, or 34.5%. Clement won 2,887 points, or 9.4%.

The actual vote totals remained confidential when the leadership election results were announced; only the point totals were made public at the time, giving the impression of a race that was much closer than was actually the case. Three years later, Harper’s former campaign manager, [[Tom Flanagan (political scientist)|Tom Flanagan]], published the actual vote totals, noting that, among other distortions caused by the equal-weighting system, “a vote cast in Quebec was worth 19.6 times as much as a vote cast in Alberta.”<ref>Tom Flanagan, ''Harper’s Team''. Montreal & Kingston: McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2007, pg. 134</ref>

===2004 general election===
{{See also|Conservative Party candidates, 2004 Canadian federal election}}

Two months after Harper's election as national Tory leader, [[Liberal Party of Canada]] leader and Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]] called a [[Canadian federal election, 2004|general election]] for 28 June 2004. However, in the interim between the formation of the new party and the selection of its new leader, factional infighting and investigations into the [[Sponsorship Scandal]] significantly reduced the popularity of the governing Liberal Party. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

This allowed the Conservatives to be more prepared for the race, unlike the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 federal election]] when few predicted the [[snap election|early election call]]. For the first time since the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]], a Liberal government would have to deal with a united conservative front. The Liberals attempted to counter this with an early election call, as this would give the Conservatives less time to consolidate their merger. During the first half of the campaign, polls showed a rise in support for the new party, leading some pollsters to predict the election of a [[minority government|minority]] Conservative government. An unpopular provincial budget by Liberal Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]] hurt the federal Liberals' numbers in Ontario, as did a weak performance from Martin in the leaders' debates. The Liberals managed to narrow the gap and eventually regain momentum by targeting the Conservatives' credibility and motives, hurting their efforts to present a reasonable, responsible and moderate alternative to the governing Liberals. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Several controversial comments were made by Conservative MPs during the campaign. Early on in the campaign, Ontario MP [[Scott Reid (politician)|Scott Reid]] indicated his feelings as Tory language critic that the policy of [[official bilingualism]] was unrealistic and needed to be reformed. Alberta MP [[Rob Merrifield]] suggested as Tory health critic that women ought to have mandatory family counseling before they choose to have an abortion. BC MP [[Randy White (politician)|Randy White]] indicated his willingness near the end of the campaign to use the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]] of the [[Canadian Constitution]] to override the Charter of Rights on the issue of [[same-sex marriage]], and [[Cheryl Gallant]], another Ontario MP, compared abortion to terrorism. The party was also criticized for issuing press releases accusing both Paul Martin and [[Jack Layton]] of supporting [[child pornography]], although both releases were recalled within a few hours.

Harper's new Conservatives emerged from the election with a larger parliamentary [[caucus]] of 99 MPs while the Liberals were reduced to a minority government of 135 MPs, requiring the Liberals to obtain support from at least twenty-three opposition MPs in order to guarantee the passage of Liberal government legislation.

===Founding convention: Montreal, March 2005===
In 2005, some political analysts such as former Progressive Conservative pollster [[Allan Gregg]] and ''[[Toronto Star]]'' columnist [[Chantal Hébert]] suggested that the then-subsequent election could result in a Conservative government if the public were to perceive the Tories as emerging from the party's founding convention (then scheduled for March 2005 in Montreal) with clearly defined, moderate policies with which to challenge the Liberals. The convention provided the public with an opportunity to see the Conservative Party in a new light, appearing to have reduced the focus on its controversial social conservative agenda. It retained its populist appeal by espousing tax cuts, smaller government, a grassroots-oriented democratic reform, and more decentralization by giving the provinces more taxing powers and decision-making authority in joint federal-provincial programs. The party's law and order package was an effort to address rising homicide rates, which had gone up 12% in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/050721/d050721a.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080831051213/http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/050721/d050721a.htm|archivedate=31 August 2008 |title=Statistics Canada re spike in homicides |publisher=Statcan.ca |date=21 July 2005 |accessdate=2011-05-05}}</ref>

===2006 general election===
On 17 May 2005, MP [[Belinda Stronach]] unexpectedly [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] from the Conservative Party to join the Liberal Party. In late August and early September 2005, the Tories released ads through Ontario's major television broadcasters that highlighted their policies towards health care, education and child support. The ads each featured Stephen Harper discussing policy with prominent members of his [[Shadow Cabinet]]. Some analysts suggested at the time that the Tories would use similar ads in the expected [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]], instead of focusing their attacks on allegations of corruption in the Liberal government as they did earlier on.

An Ipsos-Reid Poll conducted after the fallout from the first report of the [[Gomery Commission]] on the sponsorship scandal showed the Tories practically tied for public support with the governing Liberal Party,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/news/pressrelease.cfm?id=2857|title=Grits Thrashed in Wake of Gomery Report|publisher=Ipsos-na.com|date=4 November 2005|accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref> and a poll from the Strategic Counsel suggested that the Conservatives were actually in the lead. However, polling two days later showed the Liberals had regained an 8-point lead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionalmanac.com/canada/polls.php|title=Canada Federal Election 2010 ? Public Opinion Polls ? National ? Election Almanac|publisher=Electionalmanac.com|accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref> On 24 November 2005, [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)|Opposition leader]] [[Stephen Harper]] introduced a [[motion of no confidence]] which was passed on 28 November 2005. With the confirmed backing of the other two opposition parties, this resulted in an election on 23 January 2006, following a campaign spanning the Christmas season.

The Conservatives started off the first month of the campaign by making a series of policy-per-day announcements, which included a [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] reduction and a child-care allowance. This strategy was a surprise to many in the news media, as they believed the party would focus on the [[sponsorship scandal]]; instead, the Conservative strategy was to let that issue ruminate with voters. The Liberals opted to hold their major announcements after the Christmas holidays; as a result, Harper dominated media coverage for the first few weeks of the campaign and was able "to define himself, rather than to let the Liberals define him". The Conservatives' announcements played to Harper's strengths as a policy wonk,<ref name="archive1">{{cite web|url=http://andrewcoyne.com/Essays/Newspapers/Campaign_strategies.html|title=andrewcoyne.com|publisher=Web.archive.org|accessdate=2010-04-28|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061116022016/http://andrewcoyne.com/Essays/Newspapers/Campaign_strategies.html|archivedate=16 November 2006}}</ref> as opposed to the 2004 election and summer 2005 where he tried to overcome the perception that he was cool and aloof. Though his party showed only modest movement in the polls, Harper's personal approval numbers, which had always trailed his party's significantly, began to rise relatively rapidly.

On 27 December 2005, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] announced it was investigating Liberal [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Finance Minister]] [[Ralph Goodale]]'s office for potentially engaging in [[insider trading]] before making an important announcement on the taxation of [[income trust]]s. The revelation of the criminal investigation and Goodale's refusal to step aside dominated news coverage for the following week, and it gained further attention when the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] announced they would also launch a probe. The income trust scandal distracted public attention from the Liberals' key policy announcements and allowed the Conservatives to refocus on their previous attacks on corruption within the Liberal party. The Tories were leading in the polls by early January 2006, and made a major breakthrough in Quebec where they displaced the Liberals as the second place party (after the Bloc Québécois). {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In response to the growing Conservative lead, the Liberals launched negative ads suggesting that Harper had a "hidden agenda", similar to the attacks made in the 2004 election. The Liberal ads did not have the same effect this time as the Conservatives had much more momentum, at one stage holding a ten-point lead. Harper's personal numbers continued to rise and polls found he was considered not only more trustworthy, but also a better potential Prime Minister than Paul Martin. In addition to the Conservatives being more disciplined, [[Newspaper endorsements in the Canadian federal election, 2006|media coverage of the Conservatives]] was also more positive than in 2004. By contrast, the Liberals found themselves increasingly criticized for running a poor campaign and making numerous gaffes. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

On 23 January 2006, the Conservatives won 124 seats, compared to 103 for the Liberals. The results made the Conservatives the largest party in the 308-member House of Commons, enabling them to form a minority government. On 6 February, Harper was sworn in as the 22nd Prime Minister of Canada, along with his [[Cabinet of Canada#Current Cabinet|Cabinet]].

===First Harper Government (2006–08)===
The [[Federal Accountability Act]] in response to the [[sponsorship scandal]], [[President of the Treasury Board (Canada)|President of the Treasury Board]], the Honourable [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]] introduced the bill to the [[Canadian House of Commons]] on 11 April 2006. The bill was passed in the House of Commons on 22 June 2006, and was granted [[royal assent]] on 13 December 2006.

The [[2006 Canadian federal budget]] was presented to the House of Commons by Finance Minister [[Jim Flaherty]] on 2 May 2006. The government announced that the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] would be lowered from 7% to 6% (and eventually to 5%); [[Income taxes in Canada|income tax]] [[tax cuts|cuts]] for middle-income earners, and $1,200-per-child [[day care|childcare]] payment (the "Universal Child Care Benefit") for Canadian parents. On 6 June 2006, the budget was introduced for third reading in the House of Commons and was declared passed by unanimous consent as the result of procedural confusion. (The [[Bloc Québécois]] had previously indicated that it would support the budget, and its passage was never in doubt.)

On 31 October 2006, Finance Minister [[Jim Flaherty]] announced that the government would begin taxing [[Income trusts#The Conservatives propose new rules for income trusts|income trusts]] in 2011, which went against one of their campaign promises, causing much consternation among supporters. On 22 November 2006, Harper introduced his own motion to recognize the Québécois as forming a "nation within a united Canada". Five days later, Harper's motion passed, with a margin of 266–16; all federalist parties, as well as the [[Bloc Québécois]], were formally behind it. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

During three by-elections held on 17 September 2007, mayor [[Denis Lebel]] captured the seat of Roberval for the Conservatives, taking it from the Bloc, while Bernard Barre ran a close second in Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot. This raised the Conservative total in the House of Commons to 126 members.Some believe these results indicate that the Conservatives have consolidated their position as the main federalist option in Quebec, outside of Montreal.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gazette|first=The|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=475783f1-664b-4acc-b118-1d75d22fd344&p=2|title=The by-election blues|publisher=Canada.com|date=8 September 2007|accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/article/257720|title=Liberals trounced in Quebec by-elections|publisher=thestar.com|date=18 September 2007|accessdate=28 April 2010|location=Toronto|first=Allan|last=Woods}}</ref>

The RCMP searched Conservative party headquarters in Ottawa on 15 April 2008 at the request of Elections Canada. Elections commissioner William Corbett requested the assistance of the Mounties. Elections Canada is probing Conservative party spending for advertisements during the 2006 parliamentary election campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5hxnGmWfP075hJVk25I6xUpzatDSA|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090213052523/http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5hxnGmWfP075hJVk25I6xUpzatDSA|archivedate=13 February 2009|title=RCMP raid Conservative party headquarters over election matter|publisher=The Canadian Press|accessdate=2008-04-15}}</ref>

The Conservative Party of Canada, having reached the $18.3 million advertising spending limit set out under the Canada Elections Act, transferred cash to 64 local campaign offices. The local campaigns sent the money back to national party headquarters to buy local television and radio advertisements for their candidates. Financial agents for at least 35 of those Conservative candidates later asked to be reimbursed for those expenses. Candidates who get 10% of the votes in their riding get a portion of their election expenses returned from Elections Canada. Elections Canada refused, saying the party paid for the ads, not the candidates. The Conservatives maintain they didn't break any rules.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2008/04/15/rcmp-tories.html|title=Mounties search Tory headquarters|publisher=CBC.ca|date=15 April 2008|accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>

On 26 May 2008, the Conservative Party recognized in a private-members bill the [[Holodomor|1932–33 famine in Ukraine]] as an act of genocide.

===2008 general election===
On 7 September 2008 Stephen Harper asked the Governor General of Canada to dissolve parliament. The [[Canadian federal election, 2008|election took place on 14 October]]. The Conservative Party returned to government with 143 seats, up from the 127 seats they held at dissolution, but short of the 155 necessary for a majority government. This is the third minority parliament in a row in Canada, and the second for Harper. The Conservative Party pitched the election as a choice between Harper and the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]]' [[Stéphane Dion]], whom they portrayed as a weak and ineffective leader. The election, however, was rocked midway through by the emerging global financial crisis and this became the central issue through to the end of the campaign. Harper has been criticised for appearing unresponsive and unsympathetic to the uncertainty Canadians were feeling during the period of financial turmoil, but he countered that the Conservatives were the best party to navigate Canada through the financial crisis, and portrayed the Liberal "Green Shift" plan as reckless and detrimental to Canada's economic well-being. The Conservative Party released its platform on 7 October.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canadavotes/realitycheck/2008/10/the_conservative_platform.html|title=Canada Votes – Reality Check – The Conservative platform|publisher=CBC.ca|accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref> The platform states that it will re-introduce a bill similar to [[Bill C-61 (39th Canadian Parliament, 2nd Session)|C-61]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/10/07/tech-conservatives.html|title=CBC News – Technology & Science – Conservatives pledge to reintroduce copyright reform|publisher=CBC.ca|date=7 October 2008|accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref>

===Second Harper Government (2008–11)===
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}
Some changes to Harper's cabinet were made on 30 October 2008.<ref>{{cite news|author=Canada|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081030.wcabinetn1030/BNStory/politics/home?cid=al_gam_mostview|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090211215305/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081030.wcabinetn1030/BNStory/politics/home?cid=al_gam_mostview|archivedate=11 February 2009|title=Shuffle reflects No. 1 priority: the economy|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=30 October 2008|accessdate=28 April 2010|location=Toronto}}</ref> On 4 December 2008, Harper asked [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Michaëlle Jean]] to prorogue Parliament in order to avoid a coalition of the Liberals and New Democratic Party taking power months after the 2008 election. The request was granted by Jean, and the prorogation lasted until 26 January 2009.

====Policy convention: November 2008====
The party’s second convention was held in Winnipeg in November 2008. This was the party's first convention since taking power in 2006, and media coverage concentrated on the fact that this time, the convention was not very policy-oriented, and showed the party to be becoming an establishment party. However, the results of voting at the convention reveal that the party’s populist side still had some life. A resolution that would have allowed the party president a director of the party’s fund was defeated because it also permitted the twelve directors of the fund to become unelected “ex-officio” delegates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.macleans.ca/tag/cpc-conventionwatch-2008|title=Convention Watch: 2008|publisher=Blog.macleans.ca|date=15 November 2008|accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Some politically incorrect policy resolutions were debated, including one to encourage provinces to utilize “both the public and private health sectors”, but most of these were defeated.

====Prorogation of Parliament 2008====
{{Main|2008 Canadian political dispute}}
After the Conservative Party released their economic statement on 27 November 2008, there was much criticism from Liberal Party, the NDP, and the Bloc Québécois. The opposition parties were against the cuts in public funding for political parties, reductions in pay equity, and reductions to the rights of public sector unions to strike, and they alleged that the Conservatives were not doing enough, and had no plan, to stimulate the weakening economy when the Finance Minister, Jim Flaherty, insisted that the government would "stay the course" and deliver a surplus budget in the coming year. As a result, these parties formed a coalition and planned to bring down the Conservative government through a non-confidence vote. Prime Minister Harper asked the Governor General, [[Michaëlle Jean]], to prorogue parliament to prevent the coming confidence vote. The Governor General granted this request 4 December; Parliament was prorogued until 26 January 2009. The subsequent backlash against the coalition temporarily propelled the Conservative polling numbers to majority territory, and resulted in the resignation of the Liberal leader Stephane Dion, the installation of Michael Ignatieff as interim-leader, and the Liberals backing away from support of a coalition.

====Prorogation of Parliament 2009/2010====
In a phone call to the Governor General on 30 December 2009, the Conservative Party under Stephen Harper requested the prorogation of parliament for the second time in slightly over a year, to last until March 2010. The request was granted.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/technology/Thousands+turn+rallies+protest+proroguing+Parliament/2477360/story.html|title=Thousands turn out at rallies to protest proroguing of Parliament|last=News Service|first=Canwest|date=24 January  2010|work=Canwest Publishing Inc|publisher=The Montreal Gazette|accessdate=28 January 2010}}</ref> In announcing prorogation to the public, the Prime Minister suggested that by suspending government operations, the country would be better able to enjoy the Vancouver Winter Olympics. Opposition parties disagreed, saying Harper sought the prorogation to avoid mounting pressure on his government over the [[Canadian Afghan detainee issue]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

====Conservatives become largest party in the Senate====
Prime Minister Harper filled five vacancies in the [[Senate of Canada]] with appointments of new Conservative senators on 29 January 2010. The appointments filled vacancies in Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and New Brunswick, and two vacancies in Ontario. The new senators were [[Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu]] of [[Quebec]], [[Bob Runciman]] of [[Ontario]], [[Vim Kochhar]] of Ontario, [[Elizabeth Marshall]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], and [[Rose-May Poirier]] of [[New Brunswick]]. Throughout his time as Prime Minister, Harper has appointed a total of 38 Senators, all of which exclusively represent The Conservative Party of Canada.

This changed the party standings in the Senate, which had been dominated by Liberals, to 51 Conservatives, 49 Liberals, and five others. A ''Globe and Mail'' article has suggested Harper may invoke Section 26 of the Constitution, as his predecessor [[Brian Mulroney]] did during the GST debate, to have an extra eight senators appointed, for a total of 113, thus granting Tories an absolute majority in the Red Chamber.<ref>''The CBC'', 3 January 2010, by Kady O'Malley.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/politics/insidepolitics/2010/01/sunday-senatewatch-five-vacancies-why-not-a-bakers-dozen-instead.html|title=UPDATED: Sunday SenateWatch: Five vacancies? Why not a baker's dozen instead?|publisher=CBC}}</ref> With the 29 November 2010 retirement of former Liberal Senator [[Peter Stollery]], Harper was in a position to appoint another Conservative Senator, bringing the Conservatives an absolute Senate majority with 53 of 105 seats. By the end of 2011 an additional four Liberals, a Progressive Conservative (not aligned with the Conservative Government), and one Conservative will reach the mandatory retirement age of 75.

====Conservatives found in contempt of Parliament 2011====
The Conservative government was defeated in a non-confidence vote on 25 March 2011, after a parliamentary committee consisting of an opposition majority, found the Conservatives in [[contempt of parliament]], thus triggering a general election.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/03/25/pol-defeat.html|work=CBC News|title=Government's defeat sets up election call|date=25 March 2011}}</ref> This was the first occurrence in Commonwealth history of a government in the Westminster parliamentary tradition losing the confidence of the House of Commons on the grounds of contempt of Parliament. The non-confidence motion was carried with a vote of 156 in favour of the motion, and 145 against.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=5072532&Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=40&Ses=3#Div-204 |title=Official Report * Table of Contents * Number 149 (Official Version) |publisher=.parl.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-05-05}}</ref>

===Third Harper Government (2011–present)===
The Conservative party was elected with a majority government (166 seats) on 2 May 2011, the first time any party had won a majority since the Liberals in 2000 and the first time that a conservative party had a majority since the PCs in 1988.

==Regional conservative parties==
{{Main|Conservative parties in Canada}}
The Conservative Party, while having no provincial wings, largely works with the former federal Progressive Conservative Party's provincial affiliates. There have been calls to change the names of the provincial parties from "Progressive Conservative" to "Conservative". However, there are other small "c" conservative parties with which the federal Conservative Party has close ties, such as the [[Saskatchewan Party]] and the [[British Columbia Liberal Party]] (not related to the federal [[Liberal Party of Canada]]). The federal Conservative Party has the support of many of the provincial Conservative leaders. In Ontario, successive provincial PC Party leaders [[John Tory]], [[Bob Runciman]] and [[Tim Hudak]] have expressed open support for Stephen Harper and the Conservative Party of Canada, with former [[Mike Harris]] cabinet members [[Tony Clement]], and [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]] now ministers in Harper's government.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In Quebec, business man [[Adrien D. Pouliot]] leads a new [[Conservative Party of Quebec (2009–present)|Conservative Party of Quebec]] which was formed in 2009 in the wake of the decline of the ''[[Action démocratique du Québec]]'' (ADQ) which had formerly won the support of many provincial conservatives.

Cross-support between federal and provincial Conservatives is more tenuous in some other provinces. In Alberta, relations have been strained between the federal Conservative Party and the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservatives]]. Part of the federal Tories' loss in the 2004 election was often blamed on then Premier Klein's public musings on health care late in the campaign. Klein had also called for a [[referendum]] on [[same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]]. With the impending 2006 election, Klein predicted another Liberal minority, though this time the federal Conservatives won a minority government. Klein's successor [[Ed Stelmach]] tried to avoid causing similar controversies, however Harper's surprise pledge to restrict [[bitumen]] exports drew a sharp rebuke from the Albertan government, who warned such restrictions would violate both the [[Constitution of Canada]] and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. The rise of the [[Wildrose Party]] in Alberta has caused a further rift between the federal Conservatives and the Albertan PCs, as some Conservative backbench MPs endorse Wildrose.  For the [[Alberta general election, 2012|2012 Alberta election]], Prime Minister Harper remained neutral and instructed federal cabinet members to also remain neutral while allowing Conservative backbenchers to back whomever they chose if they wish. Wildrose candidates for the concurrent [[Alberta Senate nominee election, 2012|Senate nominee election]] announced they would sit in the Conservative caucus should they be appointed to the Senate.

After the 2007 budget was announced the Progressive Conservative governments in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland & Labrador accused the federal Conservatives of breaching the terms of the [[Atlantic Accord]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

As a result relations worsened between the two provincial governments, leading Newfoundland & Labrador Premier [[Danny Williams (politician)|Danny Williams]] to denounce the federal Conservatives, which gave rise to his ABC ([[Anything But Conservative]]) campaign in the 2008 election. While separate, federal Conservative Party documents, such as membership applications, can be picked up from most provincial Progressive Conservative Party offices. Several of the provincial parties also contain links to the federal Conservative website on their websites. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The '''Progressive Party of Canada''' was a political party in [[Canada]] in the 1920s and 1930s. It was linked with the provincial [[United Farmers of Canada|United Farmers]] parties in several provinces and, in [[Manitoba]], ran candidates and formed governments as the [[Progressive Party of Manitoba]]. The party was part of a farmers' political movement that included provincial Progressive and United Farmers' parties.

The '''United Farmers''' movement in Canada rose to prominence after [[World War I]]. With the failure of the wartime [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Union]] government to alter a [[tariff]] structure that hurt farmers, various farmers movements across Canada became more radical and entered the political arena. The United Farmers movement was tied to the federal Progressive Party of Canada and formed provincial governments in [[Ontario]], [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]]. It rejected the [[National Policy]] of the [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867–1942)|Conservatives]] and also felt that the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] were not strong enough proponents of [[free trade]] and were too strongly tied to business interests. Generally, farmers groups formed alliances with [[Labour Party of Canada|Labour]] and socialist groups though, in power, they became closer to the Liberals causing ruptures in several provinces between United Farmer governments and their organizations.

==Origins==

The origins of the Progressive Party can, in many ways, be traced to the politics of compromise under [[Prime Ministers of Canada|Prime Minister]] Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]].  The most important issue to farmers in western Canada at the time was [[free trade]] with the [[United States of America|United States]].  The [[National Policy]] implemented by Prime Minister Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] in the 1890s forced farmers to pay higher prices for equipment, and to sell their produce for less.  After [[World War I]], however, neither of the major political parties supported free trade.

At the turn of the century voters in Western Canada began to consider an influx of radical political ideas.  From the [[United States]] came [[Progressivism]] and the [[Non-Partisan League]].  From [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the new immigrants brought [[Fabians|Fabian socialism]].  This mix of ideology and discontent led to discussion of forming an independent party, especially in the "[[Grain Growers' Guide]]", a magazine of the day. The first organizations of agricultural protest were the farmers’ organizations such as the [[Manitoba Grain Growers' Association]] and the [[United Farmers of Alberta]].

In the period immediately following [[World War I]] farmers' organizations across Canada were becoming more politically active and were entering electoral politics on the provincial level. The United Farmers of Ontario ran in the [[Ontario general election, 1919|1919 provincial election]] and, surprisingly, won.

In June 1919, [[Thomas Crerar]], [[Minister of Agriculture (Canada)|Minister of Agriculture]] in the [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist]] government of [[Robert Borden]], quit the Borden cabinet because Minister of Finance Thomas White introduced a budget that did not pay sufficient attention to farmers' issues. Farmer leader and MP [[John Archibald Maharg]] also withdrew his support from the government and joined Crerar. In 1919 and 1920 several [[by-election]]s were won by "United Farmers" candidates. In 1920, Crerar and his supporters founded the Progressive Party of Canada with Crerar as its first leader. The new party won 58 of the 235 seats in the [[Canadian federal election, 1921|1921 general election]].

==Elected to office==

Traditionally, the Progressive Party has been viewed as a western protest party, but some{{Who|date=March 2009}} now contest this. 
It is certain that its core of support was western. For example, almost all the MPs from Alberta were United Farmers of Alberta candidates who were allied to the Progressives (and included in the totals recorded above). That province had elected a UFA government just prior to the 1921 federal election.<ref>Wikipedia: United Farmers of Alberta</ref> 
But as the 1921 election shows, the Progressives began life as a truly national movement.  The Progressives won 24 of the 81 [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] seats in Ontario. At the time, the party viewed this as a disappointing result {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.  The Progressives received significant support in the Maritimes provinces as well, but only one seat in [[New Brunswick]]. At the provincial level,  farmers' parties became significant presences in both [[Nova Scotia]] and New Brunswick.

By taking a very decentralized approach, the Progressive Party copied the method used in the United States to build a national party in the U.S. Congress {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.Crerar was not the national leader of the party, but only the parliamentary leader.  The media regarded him as the leading spokesman of the party, although he had no official position outside of parliament. The party also had no national organization, relying instead on the [[Canadian Council of Agriculture]] to provide some degree of national structure.  Each candidate was free to promote any policies they desired{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.  Support for reforming the [[National Policy]] was a common denominator, but even this was not universal within the party.  The Progressives can barely even be called a party, and many have argued that the term "Progressive Movement" is perhaps more apt.

In the 1921 election, the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] won the largest number of seats but not a majority of the seats. Thus it formed a [[minority government]], which needed the support of the Progressive Party/UFA caucus to stay in office. The Progressives were divided over what to do, however.  A significant group of ex-Liberals, including Crerar, supported forming a [[coalition government]] with the Liberals.  This was resisted both by [[Montreal]] interests in the Liberal Party and the radical Progressives.  Some radical Progressives, who were followers of [[Henry Wise Wood]] of the UFA, supported a very different strategy{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. They wished to remain a decentralized party with each member simply representing his constituents.  The two groups agreed to refuse the position of [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]], normally accorded to the party with the second largest number of seats, and this was passed on to the third-largest party, the Conservative Party.

==Demise==

Crerar attempted to introduce certain attributes of a standard party to the Progressives, including [[whip (politics)|Parliamentary Whip]]s and a national party organization. These efforts were resisted, however, and in 1922, Crerar resigned as leader. He was replaced by [[Robert Forke]], another ex-Liberal who agreed with Crerar on most issues. The Progressives proved unsuccessful in Parliament and lost much of their moderate support in eastern Canada.  While in the 1921 election Crerar had toured the entire nation, Forke abandoned everything east of Manitoba.  In the [[Canadian federal election, 1925|1925 election]], the Progressives lost almost all of their Ontario members, but were still moderately successful in the west.

This left the party dominated by the radical [[Alberta]] wing, composed of [[United Farmers of Alberta]] MPs. Forke resigned as Progressive house leader on June 30, 1926, one day after Mackenzie King resigned as Prime Minister. Forke and most of the Manitoba Progressives made a deal with the Liberal Party and ran as [[Liberal-Progressive]]s in the [[Canadian federal election, 1926|1926 election]] prompted by the fall of the interim Conservative government of [[Arthur Meighen]]. The Liberals formed a stable [[minority government]] following the 1926 election with the support of the 7 elected Liberal-Progressive MPs, and Forke entered the [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]] [[Canadian Cabinet|cabinet]] as [[Minister of Immigration and Colonization (Canada)|Minister of Immigration and Colonization]].

The Alberta UFA MPs dropped the Progressive label. Identifying themselves as parliamentary representatives of the [[United Farmers of Alberta]], they elected 11 MPs in the 1926 election and 9 in 1930 - most of whom were members of the radical [[Ginger Group]] faction of left wing Progressive, Labour and United Farmer MPs. Most sitting United Farmers of Alberta MPs joined the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]], and all the UFA MPs were defeated at the polls in the [[Canadian federal election, 1935|election of 1935]] by the [[Social Credit Party of Canada]] political landslide.

Aside from Alberta electing nine UFA MPs in 1930, only three MPs were elected as Progressives in the 1930 election, [[Milton Neil Campbell]] and [[Archibald M. Carmichael]] of Saskatchewan and [[Agnes MacPhail]] of Ontario (who was known as a proponent of the United Farmers of Ontario). MacPhail successfully ran for re-election as a [[United Farmers of Ontario]]-[[Labour Party (Canada)|Labour]] candidate in the 1935 election but was defeated running under the same banner in 1940.

==Legacy==

After the collapse of the party, most Progressive voters returned to the Liberal Party. The Liberals had always viewed the Progressives as simply 'Liberals in a hurry', and for a large group of the party's supporters, this was true.  The most important example of this return to the Liberals is T.A. Crerar, who served with the Liberals for decades, first as a cabinet minister and then as a [[Canadian Senate|Senator]].

The more radical of the progressives split two ways. The [[Ginger Group]] was a faction formed in 1924 by radical Progressives and were later joined by several [[Labour Party (Canada)|Labour]] and Independent MPs. They would eventually form the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (the forerunner of the modern [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]]).

Others, especially the radical populists, would later turn towards [[Canadian social credit movement|Social Credit]] ideology, forming a definite line of western protest that continued to run through the [[Reform Party of Canada]] to the present day [[Conservative Party of Canada]] party.  Both the CCF and Social Credit had their roots in the [[United Farmers of Canada|United Farmers]] movement, from which a large number of MLAs were elected in New Brunswick, [[Nova Scotia]] and Manitoba, and which formed governments in Alberta, Ontario  and Manitoba. On Manitoba, the United Farmers of Manitoba changed their name to the [[Progressive Party of Manitoba]] after coming to power in 1922.

It could be argued that the United Farmers parties were provincial wings of the federal Progressive Party. The Conservative Party received the least of the Progressive's spoils, inheriting only the name.  More important than these effects on individual parties, the Progressive Party also had a great effect on Canada's governmental system—it was the first successful example of a third party in Canada. Despite the [[Duverger's Law]] of political science, the Canadian Parliament has always had a third, and sometimes a fourth or even fifth, party present ever since (although no third or fourth party has ever formed a national government in Canada.) The Progressives thus served both as a model and a [[cautionary tale]] for those that followed after.

==Historiography==

The study of the Progressive Party is almost wholly dominated by one author, [[W.L. Morton]], whose 1950 book, ''The Progressive Party in Canada'', won a [[Governor General's Award]], and had been the principal text on the Progressive Party ever since.  A great number of more recently published works on western politics cite only Morton’s book in their discussion of the Progressive Party. Morton, a [[Red Tory]], wrote in the context of a seemingly spreading Social Credit movement. Morton’s book was the first in a series exploring the origins of the Social Credit movement.

==Provincial parties==

=== Newfoundland ===
Though not part of the ''United Farmers'' movement, or indeed a movement of farmers at all, the [[Fisherman's Protective Union]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] provides an interesting case that parallels that of the ''United Farmers''. However Newfoundland was not part of Canada until 1949.

===Nova Scotia===
The United Farmers of Nova Scotia was formed in January 1920 at meetings that followed the annual convention of the Nova Scotia Farmers' Association. At an April meeting, 300 farmers approved the UFNA's constitution and the publication of a newspaper, ''United Farmer's Guide''. The movement nominated 16 candidates and elected 7 in the [[Nova Scotia general election, 1920|1920 general election]]. Aligning with the [[Labour Party (Canada)|Independent Labour Party]] they formed the [[official opposition]] with 11 MLAs (elected with a 30.9% of the popular vote).<ref>Craig Heron, ''The Workers' Revolt in Canada, 1917-1925'', University of Toronto Press, 1998</ref> [[Daniel G. McKenzie]], a successful farmer and former school-teacher from Malagash, was appointed party and opposition leader.<ref name=ufna>[http://www.nsfa-fane.ca/content%5Cresource%5Chistory%5Cnsfa/nsfah05.htm Nova Scotia Federation of Agriculture History, Chapter 3 1916-1930], retrieved January 12, 2008</ref>

The party began to lose its momentum in the fall when one of its founders, Major Hugh Dickson, was defeated in the Colchester by-election. In 1921, [[Nova Scotia Liberal Party]] Premier [[George Murray]] discredited the party in the eyes of the public when he offered to divide the government's budget surplus among members of the legislature. All but one United Farmer MLA accepted Murray's largesse.  Later that session another scandal rocked the party when it was revealed that MacKenzie had secretly accepted a government salary of $500. A series of defections followed and by 1925 the United Farmers of Nova Scotia had virtually ceased to exist.<ref name=ufna/>

===New Brunswick===
The [[New Brunswick general election, 1920|1920 provincial election]] elected 9 United Farmers and 2 [[Farmer-Labour]] MLAs who sat together and allowed the incumbent [[New Brunswick Liberal Association|Liberals]] to [[motion of confidence|maintain confidence]] in a [[minority government]] situation.  None of them were re-elected in the [[New Brunswick general election, 1925|1925 election]] and no other UF candidates were elected at subsequent elections.

===Ontario===
{{main|United Farmers of Ontario}}

In [[Ontario]], the [[United Farmers of Ontario]] formed government as a result of the [[Ontario general election, 1919|1919 provincial election]] with [[E.C. Drury]] as [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]]. After the government's defeat in [[Ontario general election, 1923|1923]] and the formal decision of the UFO to withdraw from electoral politics, most remaining UFO [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs) took to calling themselves "Progressives". In the [[Ontario general election, 1934|1934 provincial election]] the remaining Progressive MLAs under [[Harry Nixon]] ran as [[Liberal-Progressives]] in an alliance with the [[Ontario Liberal Party]] led by former UFO member [[Mitch Hepburn]]. The Liberal-Progressives subsequently joined the Liberal Party.

===Manitoba===
{{main|Progressive Party of Manitoba}}

The [[Progressive Party of Manitoba]] had merged with the [[Manitoba Liberal Party]] in the 1920s to form a Liberal-Progressive party there. Despite this, in 1942, Manitoba Premier [[John Bracken]], a Progressive, was persuaded to become the leader of the national [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]]. As a condition of his accepting the leadership, the party's name was changed to [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]]. The Progressive Party of Canada, however, refused to disband, and ran its own candidates in the subsequent federal election against Bracken's Tories. The party's electoral fortunes continued to decline, and most Progressives ended up joining either the Liberal Party or the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF), rather than the renamed Progressive Conservatives.

===Saskatchewan===
{{main|Progressive Party of Saskatchewan}}
The [[Progressive Party of Saskatchewan]] ran seven candidates and elected six members to the Saskatchewan legislature in the [[Saskatchewan general election, 1921|1921 general election]] despite the absence of a provincial organization due to the reluctance of the [[Saskatchewan Grain Growers' Association]] to break with the [[Saskatchewan Liberal Party]]. The Liberals had a tradition of consulting the SGGA about farm policy and of appointing prominent farm activists to cabinet such as [[Charles Dunning]] and [[John Maharg]]. A political crisis ensued the Liberal government in late 1921 in which Premier [[William Melville Martin]] angered the SGGA by campaigning for the federal [[Liberal Party of Canada]] against the Progressive Party of Canada in the [[Canadian federal election, 1921|1921 federal election]]. Agriculture Minister Maharg, a former SGGA president, resigned from the Cabinet in protest and [[crossed the floor]] to sit as an Independent and become [[Leader of the Opposition (Saskatchewan)|Leader of the Opposition]]. Martin himself was forced to step down and the federal Progressives won 15 of 16 Saskatchewan seats in the federal election.  The SGGA subsequently authorized the creation of local political action committees across the province but were unable to build on the 1921 federal breakthrough and only ran 6 of a possible 63 candidates in the next two provincial elections. In the [[Saskatchewan general election, 1925|1925 provincial election]] the Progressives again won six seats and formed the [[official opposition]]. They were reduced to third party status and five seats in the [[Saskatchewan general election, 1929|1929 provincial election]] with the Liberals reduced to [[minority government]] status due to a strong showing by a revived [[Conservative Party of Saskatchewan]]. The Progressives joined with the Conservatives to force the Liberals from office on September 6, 1929 and formed a [[coalition government]] allowing the [[Conservative Party of Saskatchewan|Conservatives]] leader [[James Thomas Milton Anderson|James T.M. Anderson]] to take power as premier; one Progressive, [[Reginald Stipe]], was appointed to Anderson's cabinet as [[minister without portfolio]]. By the next election the Progressives had disappeared.<ref>Coneghan, Damian, [http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/progressive_party.html Progressive Party], ''Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan''</ref>

While the Progressives moved to the right, more radical farmers gravitated to the [[United Farmers of Canada (Saskatchewan Section)]] which was formed in 1926 by members of the Farmers' Union of Canada and the Saskatchewan Grain Growers' Association. As a result of the [[Dust Bowl]] farm crisis during the [[Great Depression]] the UFC (SS) became politicised and adopted a socialist platform. In 1930, in response to the Progressive-Conservative coalition, the UFC (SS) under the leadership of [[George Hara Williams]] decided to form a new political party. In 1932 it joined  with the [[Labour Party of Canada|Independent Labour Party]] in the province to form the [[Saskatchewan NDP|Farmer-Labour Group]]. Progressive MLA [[Jacob Benson]] joined the new party to become its first MLA. In the [[Saskatchewan general election, 1934|1934 provincial election]], the FLG returned five MLAs to the legislature and subsequently became the Saskatchewan section of the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]].

===Alberta===
{{main|United Farmers of Alberta}}
The [[United Farmers of Alberta]] formed was the governing party in Alberta from 1921 until its defeat in 1935. It also elected a number of MPs to the [[Canadian House of Commons]] who sat initially as Progressive Party MPs but were re-elected as UFA MPs beginning in 1926 due to a split in the Progressive movement.

The '''''Hartford Courant''''' is the largest daily [[newspaper]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Connecticut]], and is often recognized as the oldest continuously published newspaper in the [[United States]].  A morning newspaper serving most of the state north of [[New Haven]] and east of [[Waterbury]], its headquarters on Broad Street are a short walk from the [[Connecticut State Capitol|state capitol]]. It reports regional news with a chain of bureaus in smaller cities and a series of local editions. Beginning in 2000, it was owned by [[Tribune Company]], which later combined the paper's management and facilities with those of Tribune-owned [[WTIC-TV]] in Hartford.  In 2014, the newspapers were spun off to corporate parent [[Tribune Publishing]].

==History==

The ''Connecticut Courant'' began as a weekly on October 29, 1764, started by [[Thomas Green (printer)|Thomas Green]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connecticuthistory.org/the-oldest-continuously-published-newspaper-today-in-history/ |title=The Oldest Continuously Published Newspaper – Today in History |publisher=ConnecticutHistory.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-6212003.html |title=Spiked: how chain management corrupted America's oldest newspaper |publisher=[[HighBeam]] |work=[[The Nation]] |first=Bruce |last=Shapiro |authorlink=Bruce Shapiro |date=1987-12-19 |accessdate=2014-01-15}} {{Subscription required|date=January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8193695.html |title=First Colonial Newspaper Now on Exhibit in Boston |publisher=[[HighBeam]] |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |first=Gloria |last=Negri |date=1990-09-26 |accessdate=2014-01-15}} {{Subscription required|date=January 2014}}</ref> The word "[[courant]]", borrowed from the Dutch,  was a popular name for English-language newspapers. The daily ''[[Hartford]] Courant'' traces its existence back to the weekly, thereby claiming the title "America's oldest continuously published newspaper" and adopting as its slogan, "Older than the nation." (''[[The New Hampshire Gazette]]'', which started publication in 1756 and all but disappeared into other publications for most of a century, trademarked the title of oldest paper in the nation after being revived as a small biweekly in 1989. See also the ''[[New York Post]]'' as oldest daily, and ''Time'' magazine's view of "oldest" claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,870976,00.html |title=Newspapers: Who's the Oldest What? |work=[[Time (magazine) |Time]] |date=1964-05-01 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref>)

The ''Courant'' was purchased in 1979 by [[Times Mirror]], the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{-'}} parent company. The first years of out-of-town ownership are described by a former ''Courant'' reporter in a book titled ''Spiked: How Chain Management Corrupted America's Oldest Newspaper.'' <ref name=2007data>{{cite book |author=Andrew Kreig |title=Spiked: How Chain Management Corrupted America's Oldest Newspaper |year=1987 |location=Old Saybrook, Connecticut |publisher=Peregrine Press |isbn=978-0-933614-27-7 }}</ref> One criticism was that the new owners were more interested in awards, and less interested in traditional ''Courant'' devotion to exhaustive coverage of  local news.

The ''Courant'' won a 1992 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for inquiring into problems with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (a Connecticut company was involved in the construction), and it won a 1999 Pulitzer Prize in the Breaking News category for coverage of a 1998 [[Connecticut Lottery killings|murder-suicide]] that took five lives at [[Connecticut Lottery]] headquarters. A series of articles about sexual abuse by the head of a worldwide Catholic order, published since February 1997, constituted the first denunciation of [[Marciel Maciel]] known to a wider audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-marcial-maciel-sg,0,5607762.storygallery |title=Courant Coverage of the Rev.

In 2000, Times Mirror and the ''Courant'' became part of the [[Tribune Company]], one of the world's largest multimedia companies. Ironically, along the way, the ''Courant'' also acquired the [[Valley Advocate]] group of "alternative" weeklies started by two disgruntled ''Courant'' staff members in 1973.  Under new ownership, it is co-owned with two local television stations:  [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WTIC-TV]] and [[The CW]] affiliate [[WCCT-TV]].

The ''Courant'' is the most recent American newspaper to win the [[Society for News Design]]'s World's Best Designed Newspaper award (awarded in 2005).<ref>[http://www.medienhandbuch.de/news/die-zeit-worlds-best-designed-newspaper-2004-auszeichnung-erhalten-2328.html "'Die Zeit': World's Best Designed Newspaper 2004 Auszeichnung erhalten"] March 2, 2005 ''medienhandbuch.de'' accessed May 4, 2010</ref>  In 2006, the paper's investigation into mental health and suicides among Americans serving in the Iraq war was featured in the PBS documentary series [[Exposé: America's Investigative Reports]] in an episode entitled "Question 7". 

In late June 2006, the Tribune Co. announced that ''Courant'' publisher Jack W. Davis Jr. would by replaced by Stephen D. Carver, vice president and general manager of Atlanta, Ga., TV station WATL. In March 2009, Tribune replaced Carver with Richard Graziano, who was given a dual role as Courant publisher and general manager of Tribune's two Hartford television statons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} In May of the same year, Tribune announced that Jeff Levine, a newspaper executive with a background in marketing, would become "director of content" and that the editor or "print platform manager" of the ''Courant'' would report to Levine as would the news director of WTIC-TV. Shortly after that, the ''Courant's'' two highest ranking editors were let go.<ref>Staff, [http://newhavenindependent.org/archives/2009/05/check_out_the_n.php "Check Out The New 'Mr. Content'"] ''New Haven Independent'' May 17, 2009</ref><ref>http://www.hartfordadvocate.com/article.cfm?aid=13039 {{Dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref>

In recent{{When|date=May 2010}} years the ''Courant'' has offered early retirement and buyout packages to reduce staff as it continues to experience declines in advertising revenue. There have also been layoffs; the ''Courant'' announced in June 2008 that it would lay off about 25% of its newsroom staff. Moreover, in September 2008, it would reduce the number of pages in its weekday editions.

An unspecified number of newsroom layoffs were again announced in July 2011. Newsroom staff peaked in 1994 at close to 400 staff, down to 175 staff by 2008, and 135 staff in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courant.com/business/hc-layoffs-courant-20110707,0,4770389.story |title=Courant Trims Newsroom Jobs |first=Kenneth R. |last=Gosselin |work=Hartford Courant |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2014-01-15}} {{Self-published source|date=January 2014}}</ref>

On Nov. 18, 2013 Tribune Company announced the appointment of Rich Graziano as President/General Manager of WPIX-TV (PIX11) in New York City.  Also Tribune Company promoted experienced publishing executive Nancy Meyer to the position of Publisher of the Hartford Courant, effective immediately. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courant.com/business/hc-new-courant-publisher-1119-20131118,0,7272148.story |title=Nancy Meyer Named Courant Publisher |work=Hartford Courant |date=2013-11-13 |accessdate=2014-01-15}} {{Self-published source|date=January 2014}}</ref>

==Politics==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}

In its most recent endorsements for U.S. President, Connecticut Senator, and Connecticut Governor, the ''Courant'' endorsed the Democratic candidate each time. In all three cases, the state of Connecticut voted in agreement with the endorsement.

* [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. President]]: Democrat Barack Obama over Republican John McCain. "In its 244-year history, the ''Courant'' has endorsed only one Democratic candidate for president, Bill Clinton. Today we endorse a second Democrat, Sen. Barack Obama, with the hope that if elected, he governs from the middle as Mr. Clinton did. Mr. Obama must resist serving only his party's interests and instead serve the greater interests of a worried nation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courant.com/news/opinion/editorials/hc-endorsepresidential.artoct26,0,4200512.story |title=We Endorse Obama For President |work=Hartford Courant |date=2008-10-26 |accessdate=2014-01-15}} {{Self-published source|date=January 2014}}</ref>

* [[United States Senate election in Connecticut, 2010|2010 Connecticut Senate]]: Democrat Richard Blumenthal over Republican Linda McMahon. "We go with state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, the Democrat, in our hope that, if elected, he will advocate for Connecticut in Washington as successfully as he's advocated for the state's people from Hartford these past two decades."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/2010-10-24/news/hc-ed-blumenthal-for-senate-1024-20101024_1_connecticut-hartford-linda-mcmahon |title=Richard Blumenthal For U.S. Senate |work=Hartford Courant |date=2010-10-24 |accessdate=2014-01-15}} {{Self-published source|date=January 2014}}</ref>

* [[Connecticut gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 Connecticut Governor]]: Democrat Dan Malloy over Republican Tom Foley. "Connecticut voters have a tough choice in this year's gubernatorial race, and that is a good thing. Both major-party candidates, Democrat Dannel Malloy, 55, of Stamford, and Republican Tom Foley, 58, of Greenwich, are smart, forceful and energetic. Both are up to the job. Both agree the state needs to live within its means and improve its economy. However, Mr. Malloy's experience in municipal government persuades the ''Courant'' he is the best candidate."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/2010-10-24/news/hc-ed-malloy-for-governor-1024-20101024_1_health-care-home-care-republican-tom-foley |title=Dan Malloy For Governor |work=Hartford Courant |date=2010-10-24 |accessdate=2014-01-15}} {{Self-published source|date=January 2014}}</ref>

When two newspapers were published in Hartford, the ''Courant'' was editorially Republican and did not endorse a non-Republican for president until [[Bill Clinton]]. When the ''Hartford Times'' ceased publication in 1976, the ''Courant's'' editorial page took an independent stance. It has endorsed Republicans and Democrats.

While the ''Courant'' editorially has recently endorsed Republican presidential candidates, its editorial approach to state government in recent decades has traditionally been liberal and opposed to what it considers short-sighted conservatism. Its strong endorsement of former Senator [[Lowell Weicker]] was decisive in the 1990 gubernatorial election. It endorsed his Lieutenant Governor [[Eunice Groark]] for Governor in 1994. After Republican Governor [[John G. Rowland]] announced major development initiatives for downtown Hartford, the ''Courant'' endorsed his 1998 and 2002 re-election bids. In 2006 the ''Courant'' endorsed Democrat [[John DeStefano, Jr.]] for Governor, but he was defeated soundly by incumbent Governor [[M. Jodi Rell]].

The ''Courant's'' long-time law firm, Tyler Cooper & Alcorn, also happened to be the Connecticut Republican Party's law firm. That business relationship with the Republican Party ended when Tyler Cooper lawyers fought aggressively on behalf of the ''Courant'' to uncover a police report about an alleged domestic incident at Rowland's Middlebury home.

In July 2006 the ''Courant'' weighed in on the contentious Connecticut Democratic senate primary by endorsing incumbent [[Joe Lieberman]]. The ''Courant'' also endorsed his bid in the general election.

==Controversies==

===Sleepy's===
In August 2009, the ''Courant'' attracted some controversy over its firing of George Gombossy, a 40-year veteran of the paper and its consumer advocate at the time. Gombossy charged that the ''Courant'' had [[Spike (journalism)|spiked]] an article he had written about an ongoing investigation by the Connecticut attorney general accusing [[Sleepy's]] (a major advertiser in the paper) of selling used and bedbug-infested mattresses as new.<ref>[http://thelaurelct.com/2009/08/07/hartford-courant-losing-its-watchdog/ Hartford Courant losing its watchdog], The Laurel newspaperman's blog, retrieved August 17, 2009.</ref><ref>[http://consumerist.com/5338201/hartford-courant-consumer-columnist-fired-for-pissing-off-advertiser Hartford Courant Consumer Columnist Fired For Pissing Off Advertiser], Consumerist blog, retrieved August 17, 2009.</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/18/business/media/18courant.html Hartford Courant lays off consumer columnist], The New York Times, retrieved August 24, 2009</ref>

Gombossy's lawsuit against the ''Courant'' was thrown out by a Connecticut Superior Court judge in July 2010.  In his decision, Judge Marshall K. Berger, Jr. remarked that newspaper owners and editors have a "paramount" right to "control [the] content of their papers," further observing that in his role at the ''Courant'', Gombossy had "no constitutional right to publish anything."<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/2010-07-02/news/hc-gombossy-lawsuit-0702-20100701_1_dismisses-judge-george-gombossy Judge Dismisses Former Columnist's Lawsuit Against The ''Courant''], The Hartford Courant, retrieved July 6, 2010.</ref>

However, Gombossy's attorneys filed a second complaint, and Judge Berger reinstated the complaint.  The case headed to trial in the fall of 2011.

===Plagiarism===
In September 2009 the ''Courant's'' publisher, Richard Graziano, publicly apologized as the newspaper accepted a plagiarism charge.  Competitors had accused the ''Courant'' of taking its content without permission and refusing to give proper credit.<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard J.

A '''proof game''' is a type of [[retrograde analysis]] [[chess problem]]. The solver must construct a game starting from the initial [[chess]] position, which ends with a given position (thus proving that that position is reachable) after a specified number of moves. A proof game is called a '''shortest proof game''' if no shorter solution exists. In this case the task is simply to construct the shortest possible game ending with the given position.

When published, shortest proof games will normally present the solver with a diagram - which is the final position to be reached - and a caption such as "SPG in 9.0". "SPG" here is short for "shortest proof game" and the "9.0" indicates how many moves must be played to reach the position; 9.0 means the position is reached after black's ninth move, 7.5 would mean the position is reached after seven and a half moves (that is, after white's eighth move) and so on. Sometimes the caption may be more verbose, for example "Position after white's seventh move. How did the game go?".

Most published SPGs will have only one solution: not only must the moves in the solution be unique, their order must also be unique. They can present quite a strong challenge to the solver, especially as assumptions which might be made from a glance at the initial position often turn out to be incorrect. For example, a piece apparently standing on its initial square may turn out to actually be a promoted pawn (this is known as the ''Pronkin'' theme). There are some proofgames which have more than one solution, and the number of solutions is then given in the stipulation. The majority of SPGs have a solution from about six to about thirty moves, although examples with unique solutions more than fifty moves long have been devised.

A number of chess problem composers have specialised in SPGs, with one of the most notable examples being [[Michel Caillaud]] who did much to popularise the genre in the 1970s and 1980s.

}}
A relatively simple example is given to the right. It is a version by Andrei Frolkin of a problem by Ernest Clement Mortimer, and was published in ''Shortest Proof Games'' (1991). It is an SPG in 4.0. It is natural to assume that the solution will involve the white knight leaving g1, capturing the d7 and e7 pawns and the g8 knight, and then being captured itself, but in fact the solution carries an element of paradox quite common in SPGs: it is the knight that started on b8 that has been captured and the knight now on that square has come from g8. The solution (the only possible way to reach the position after four moves) is 1. Nf3 e5 2. Nxe5 Ne7 3. Nxd7 Nec6 4. Nxb8 Nxb8.

A more complex proofgame, with more solutions, can be seen in the second diagram. The solutions are: 1. b4 h5 2. b5 Rh6 3. b6 Rc6 4. bxc7 Rxc2 5. cxb8=Q Rxd2 6. Qd6 Rxd1 7. Qxd1 and 3. ... Rd6 4. bxc7 Rxd2 5. cxb8=B Rxc2 6. Bbf4 Rxc1 7. Bxc1, showing the Pronkin theme in both solutions (in the first solution with a queen, in the second solution with a bishop).

== Variations==
There are a number of variations on SPGs. The problem may carry a stipulation similar to "Find a game with 8.b7-b8=N mate", which simply means a game must be constructed starting from the initial position and ending on the given move number with the given move. Or it may be a ''one-sided proof game'', in which only white makes moves (this is the SPG analogue to the ''[[seriesmover]]'' in other types of chess problems). An alternative rule-set may also be specified (such as [[circe chess]] or [[losing chess]]), or a [[fairy piece]] may be substituted for an orthodox piece.

An SPG-type problem is to find the shortest game in which White's and Black's corresponding moves are mirror images of each other. Possible solutions are 1. d4 d5 2. Qd3 Qd6 3. Qh3 Qh6 4. Qxc8#, 1. d4 d5 2. Qd3 Qd6 3. Qf5 Qf4 4. Qxc8#, and 1. c4 c5 2. Qa4 Qa5 3. Qc6 Qc3 4. Qxc8#.

'''''Three Comrades''''' ({{lang-de|Drei Kameraden}}) is a [[novel]] first published in 1936 by the [[Germany|German]] author [[Erich Maria Remarque]]. It is written in first person by the main character Robert Lohkamp, whose somewhat disillusioned outlook on life is due to his horrifying experiences in the trenches of the [[World War I|First World War's]] French-German front. He shares these experiences with Otto Köster and Gottfried Lenz, his two comrades with whom he runs an auto-repair shop in late 1920s [[Berlin]] (probably). Remarque wrote the novel in exile and it was first published in Dutch translation as ''Drie kameraden'', with English translation following soon in ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' from January to March 1937 and in the book form in the same year. First German language edition was published in 1938 by exile publisher ''Querido'' in Amsterdam, but the novel was published in Germany only in 1951.

==Plot==
The city, which is never referred to by name (however, it is likely Berlin), is crowded by a growing number of jobless and marked by increasing violence between left and right. The novel starts out in the seedy milieu of bars where prostitutes mingle with the hopeless flotsam that the war left behind. While Robert and his friends manage to make a living dealing cars and driving an old taxi, economic survival in the city is getting harder by the day. It is in this setting that Robert meets Patrice Hollmann, a mysterious beautiful young woman with an upper-middle-class background. Their love affair intensifies as he introduces her to his life of bars and races and Robert's [[nihilism|nihilistic]] attitude slowly begins to change as he realizes how much he needs Pat.

The story takes an abrupt turn as Pat suffers a near-fatal lung hemorrhage during a summer holiday at the sea. Upon their return, Robert and Pat move in with each other but her days in the city are numbered, as she is scheduled to leave for a Swiss mountain sanatorium come winter. It is this temporal limitation of their happiness which makes their remaining time together so precious.

After Pat has left for Switzerland, the political situation in the city heats up and Lenz, one of the comrades, is killed by a militant, not mentioned in the book by the actual name but supposed to be a Nazi. On top of this, Otto and Robert face bankruptcy and have to sell their workshop. In the midst of this misfortune, a telegram arrives informing them of Pat's worsening state of health. The two remaining comrades don't hesitate and drive the thousand kilometers to the [[tuberculosis]] sanatorium in the Alps to see her.

Reunited, Robert and an increasingly moribund Pat celebrate their remaining weeks before her inevitable death amidst the snow-covered summits of Switzerland. It is in the last part of the book that this beautiful love story finds closure and leaves the main character, a nihilist who has found love, forever changed.

'''Chillán''' ({{IPA-es|t?i??an}} or {{IPA-es|t?i??an|}}) is a [[List of cities in Chile|city]] in the [[Biobío Region|Bio Bío Region]] of [[Chile]] located about {{convert|400|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the country's capital, [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]], near the geographical center of the country. It is the capital of [[Ñuble Province]] and, with a population of approximately 175,000 people (253,000 the [[Chillán Conurbation]] for 2012), the most populated urban center of this province.  Within the city are a railway station, an inter-city bus terminal, an agricultural extension of the [[University of Concepción]], and a regimental military base.  The city includes a modern-style enclosed shopping mall in addition to the multi-block open-air street market where fruits, vegetables, crafts and clothing are sold.  The nearby mountains are a popular skiing destination.

==History==
{{unreferencedsect|date=September 2011}}
Chillán was founded in 1580 at the site of [[Chillán Viejo]] as '''San Bartolomé de Chillán''' by [[Martín Ruiz de Gamboa]], who was campaigning against the local indigenous peoples at the time.  However, this moniker did not fare well, and was replaced by the current name, which in the local Indian language means "where the Sun is sitting".

From its foundation, Chillán has been at the heart of Chile's rich agricultural region. It is also in a region of seismic activity, suffering from devastating earthquakes throughout its history; the [[1939 Chillán earthquake]] left over 30,000 dead and mobilized international help. 

Chile's [[Folk hero|national hero]], [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], was born in Chillán in 1778. He was the force behind [[Chilean War of Independence|Chile's Independence]] from [[Spain]], being elected [[President of Chile|Supreme Director]] and declaring independence after the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] against the Spanish in 1817. His later victory at the [[Maipo]] battlefield cemented the country's freedom. He died in exile in [[Peru]] in 1842.

==Climate==
Chillán has a [[mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa'').<ref>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J. Grieser |author3=C. Beck |author4=B. Rudolf |author5=F.

Temperatures can occasionally exceed {{convert|30|C|1}} anytime from October to April. The average annual precipitation is {{convert|1128|mm|in|0}} but it is highly variable from year to year with 1982 being the wettest year at {{convert|1813|mm|in|0}} and 1998 being the driest year at only {{convert|473|mm|in|0}}.<ref name="DMC" />

The air in Chillán is the fourth-most polluted in Chile, after [[Santiago]], [[Temuco]], and  [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]].   "As in [[Temuco]], the main cause of air pollution in Chillán is the use of wood-burning stoves: about 62% of all households in Chillán use firewood as their main source of heating."<ref>[http://en.mercopress.com/2007/06/29/severe-air-pollution-plagues-chilean-cities Severe air pollution plagues Chilean cities] Friday, June 29th 2007 - 21:00 UTC]</ref>

==Demographics==
According to the 2002 [[census]] by the [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]], the commune of Chillán spans an area of {{convert|511.2|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} and has 161,953 inhabitants (77,007 men and 84,946 women). Of these, 148,015 (91.4%) lived in [[urban area]]s and 1,938 (8.6%) in [[rural area]]s. The population grew by 8.3% (12,442 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.<ref name="INE"/>

The [[demonym]] for a person from Chillán, used for more than 400 years by local residents, is ''Chillanejo'', yet this is not found in the Royal Spanish Academy Dictionary, which only recognizes ''Chillanense''.<ref>[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=chillanense Chillanense - DRAE (Royal Spanish Academy Dictionary)]</ref>

===Notable people===
In addition, Chillán has offered a number of great artists to the world. A very notable example is  [[Claudio Arrau]], the world famous [[pianist]].  Additionally there is [[Ramón Vinay]], the tenor who was "the" [[Otello]] of the 1950s. His recording of the role with Toscanini is a perennial classic. He was a regular at the [[New York]]'s [[Metropolitan Opera]], where he sang both tenor and baritone roles. One of his last performances at this house was as the [[Barber of Seville]]'s Basilio, a bass role. He retired from the stage in 1969, in a performance of Otello at [[Teatro Municipal (Santiago)|Santiago's Municipal Theatre]].

Other "chillanejos" are also part of Chile's best artistic and literary traditions: writer [[Marta Brunet]], sculptor [[Marta Colvin]], painter [[Pacheco Altamirano]]; and numerous others who, however, did not reach the international acclaim achieved by Arrau and Vinay.

==Administration==
As a commune, Chillán is a third-level [[administrative division of Chile]] administered by a [[municipal council]], headed by an [[alcalde]] who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is [[Sergio Zarzar Andonie]] (ILE).<ref name="Munitel"/><ref name="Official"/>

Within the [[electoral divisions of Chile]], Chillán is represented in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] by Carlos Abel Jarpa  ([[Social Democrat Radical Party|PRSD]]) and Rosauro Martínez ([[National Renewal (Chile)|RN]]) as part of the 41st electoral district, (together with [[Coihueco]], [[Pinto, Chile|Pinto]], [[San Ignacio, Chile|San Ignacio]], [[El Carmen, Chile|El Carmen]], [[Pemuco]], [[Yungay, Chile|Yungay]] and [[Chillán Viejo]]). The commune is represented in the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] by Victor Pérez Varela ([[Independent Democratic Union|UDI]]) and Mariano Ruiz -Esquide Jara ([[Christian Democratic Party|PDC]]) as part of the 13th senatorial constituency (Biobío-Coast).

==Transport==
Nowadays, the city of Chillán is connected to Chile's capital Santiago by both a modern highway and a rebuilt railway system that makes the trip in less than five hours.

[[File:Euston Tower 2004.jpg|thumb|250px|Euston Tower, London]]
{{coord|51|31|32.1|N|00|08|21.4|W|type:landmark_scale:3000|display=title}}
'''Euston Tower''' is a [[skyscraper]] located in the [[London Borough of Camden]]. It is a typical example of an [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] skyscraper, constructed with a steel frame and glass [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain walls]]. It is situated at the intersection of [[Tottenham Court Road]] and [[Euston Road]], the official address being 286 Euston Road.

Euston Tower is {{convert|124|m|ft|0}} high, and has 36 floors. It was designed by [[Sidney Kaye]] and is aesthetically very similar to the [[CIS Tower]] and [[New Century House]] (1962), both in Manchester.

==History==
Among Londoners, the Euston Tower was most famous for being the home of [[Capital Radio]] from 1973 until 1997, when it moved to [[Leicester Square]]. It was common for Capital to announce itself as broadcasting "from the top of the Euston Tower", but in fact Capital's offices and studios were all based in the ground- and first-floor podium sections rather than in the actual skyscraper section. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] station [[Thames Television]] occupied premises adjacent to the tower from 1970 to 1992 although these have subsequently been redeveloped.

Originally, the base of the tower was a raised platform with a series of walkways at the first floor connecting the tower with the other buildings on the Euston Centre. Recent renovation work by [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] has seen cafes and shops open in the base. An [[HM Revenue and Customs]] office is located there. The upper 10 floors are the London home of the international design and engineering firm [[WS Atkins PLC]], with Ablestoke Financial Planning LLP based on the 32nd floor. The development around Euston Tower is now branded ''[[Regent's Place]]'' and is managed by [[British Land]].

'''David Barrett''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|OBC}} (born October 2, 1930 in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]), commonly known as '''Dave Barrett''', is a retired [[politician]] and [[social worker]] in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. He was the [[List of Premiers of British Columbia|26th]] [[Premier of British Columbia|Premier]] of British Columbia for three years between 1972 and 1975.

==Political career==
Barrett was first elected to British Columbia's legislature in the [[British Columbia general election, 1960|1960 election]] as a [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia|Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (soon to become the [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia]]) member for the electoral district of Dewdney. He had to fight to be allowed to run as he was a civil servant, as at the time civil servants were barred from running for office.

He became known for his public speaking ability and held his seat through four elections. He ran for the provincial leadership of the NDP, but lost to [[Thomas Berger (Canadian politician)|Tom Berger]]. However, Berger lost the [[British Columbia general election, 1969|1969 election]], a contest that the NDP had been expected to win. He resigned, and there was a quick campaign to draft Barrett as party leader.

Barrett led the NDP to its first provincial victory against the stagnating [[Social Credit Party of British Columbia|Social Credit]] government of [[W.A.C. Bennett]] in the [[British Columbia general election, 1972|1972 election]]. He became [[List of British Columbia premiers|Premier]] on September 15, 1972.  

His government was criticized for its spending, quickly taking the government from surplus to debt. The NDP argued that the deficit was not entirely its fault as it had introduced modern accounting practices, and were caught by the huge liabilities that the Socred government had hidden off the books.

The Barrett government substantially reformed the welfare system, initiated a number of reforms such as establishing the province's Labour Relations Board, and expanded the [[public sector]]. The NDP also introduced more democracy into the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]] through the introduction of question period and full Hansard transcripts of legislative proceedings in the province.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.bc.ca/hansard/8-5.htm#4 |title='&#39;Legislative Assembly of British Columbia.'&#39; Hansard Services. FAQ |publisher=Leg.bc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-04-21}}</ref> The NDP also brought in the [[Agricultural Land Reserve]] (ALR) to protect the small supply of farm land in BC. The [[Insurance Corporation of British Columbia]] (ICBC) was formed to provide government car insurance.  Both the ALR and ICBC are still functioning.

On social policy, in 1973, B.C. banned corporal punishment in all schools.

The NDP passed a new law on average every three days while in power. The pace of change was enough to scare the centre and centre-right into uniting together under the Social Credit banner to oppose the NDP. Social Credit gained [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs) from both the Conservatives and the Liberals.

Barrett called a [[snap election]] in 1975, and was defeated by the Social Credit Party, then led by [[William R. Bennett|Bill Bennett]], son of the man Barrett had defeated in the previous election. Bennett's campaign focused on attacking the Barrett government's handling of provincial finances.

In terms of raw numbers (but not percentage), the NDP increased its popular vote in the [[British Columbia general election, 1975|1975 election]].  However, its vote outside of the Vancouver area plummeted, costing it 20 seats and its majority. Barrett was personally defeated in the Coquitlam seat he had held since its creation in a 1965 redistribution, losing to Socred challenger [[George Herman Kerster]] by only 18 votes. In June 1976, he was returned to the legislature in a by-election in Vancouver East, after sitting NDP MLA [[Robert Arthur Williams]] stepped aside. He remained an MLA for that riding until 1984, continuing to lead the NDP against Bennett's Socreds in the [[British Columbia general election, 1979|1979]] and [[British Columbia general election, 1983|1983 elections]].

The Forensic Audit of the Nanaimo Commonwealth Holding Society revealed that the day before Bob Williams resigned he received $80,000, 4 years MLA pay at the time, from the NCHS. One time NPD MLA, Minister and MP David Stupich was later convicted of stealing that money from Nanaimo Charities.

<ref>http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/bob-williams-nchs-deal-1.205953</ref>

On October 6, 1983, Barrett was forcibly removed from the Legislative Assembly chamber by the [[Serjeant-at-Arms]] for failing to abide by the Speaker's ruling. This was the first incident in the legislature's history where security staff had to intervene and remove a member from chamber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/provincial-territorial-politics/provincial-territorial-politics-general/ndp-leader-booted-from-bc-legislature.html |title=1983: NDP leader booted from BC legislature |publisher=Archives.cbc.ca |date=1983-10-06 |accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref>

Barrett was elected Member of Parliament for the riding of [[Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca]] in 1988.  He ran for the leadership of the federal [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] in 1989, losing narrowly on the fourth ballot to [[Audrey McLaughlin]] at the [[New Democratic Party leadership elections|party's leadership convention]]. Rival candidate [[Simon De Jong]] agreed to support Barrett in exchange for being named [[Party Whip]]. De Jong forgot that he was wearing a microphone as part of a CBC documentary on the convention and the back-room discussions leaked to the press.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/federal_politics/clips/12754/ |title=First woman to lead a national party - CBC Archives |publisher=Archives.cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-04-21}}</ref> The surrounding controversy hurt De Jong but was short-lived. During the campaign, Barrett argued that the party should be concerned with [[Western Alienation|Western alienation]], rather than focusing its attention on [[Quebec]]. The Quebec leadership of the NDP strongly opposed Barrett's candidacy, and future Quebec MP [[Phil Edmonston]] threatened to resign from the party if Barrett became leader.<ref name=Cdnencyc>{{cite web|title=David Barrett|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/david-barrett/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref> 

During contentious attempts to amend Canada's constitution, Barrett opposed the 1987 [[Meech Lake Accord]], but reluctantly endorsed the 1992 [[Charlottetown Accord]] to comply with party policy.  He later referred to the party's support for the Accord as a mistake.

He lost his seat in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]] to [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] candidate [[Keith Martin (politician)|Keith Martin]].

==Political legacy==
Some have felt that Barrett would have made a more effective leader than McLaughlin, since the NDP had long been the voice of western discontent, but the party had never had much of a presence in Quebec. In 1989, the [[Nouveau Parti démocratique du Québec|Quebec New Democratic Party]] adopted a [[Quebec sovereignty|sovereigntist]] platform and severed its ties with the federal NDP. Although Edmonston would win the NDP its first seat in Quebec through a by-election, he was a [[Quebec nationalist]] who clashed with the party over its position on [[Canadian federalism]] and against decentralization and devolving powers to Quebec. Barrett's warnings about Western alienation would prove prophetic in the 1993 federal election, as the Reform Party replaced the NDP as the protest voice west of Ontario.

==Post-political life==
In 1998-2000 Barrett chaired two inquiries into the [[Leaky condo crisis]] in B.C. entitled ''The Commission of Inquiry into the Quality of Condominium Construction in British Columbia.''  The first of what became known as the "Barrett Commissions" was to investigate the cause of the crisis and make recommendations to prevent reoccurrence.  The second was to make recommendations following the collapse of the New Home Warranty program.<ref>[http://www.bccassn.com/BCCA%20Archives/Issue%20Update/1999/Issue%20Update%20–%201999,%20August%20-%20BARRETT%20TO%20LEAD%20SECOND%20INQUIRY%20INTO%20LEAKY%20CONDOS.pdf ''BARRETT TO LEAD SECOND INQUIRY INTO LEAKY CONDOS'', British Columbia Construction Association, Issue Update August 1999].

Barrett is retired from active politics and, for reasons of health and beginning in 2010, from public life altogether. Since 2000, Barrett has served on [[American Income Life Insurance Company]]'s Labour Advisory Board as an Honorary Member.<ref>{{cite web|title=Labour Advisory Board|url=http://www.ailife.com/main/company.aspx?submenu=Partners|publisher=American Income Life Insurance Company|accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref> In 2003, he supported [[Bill Blaikie]]'s bid to become leader of the federal NDP. In 2005, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]], and in 2012 a member of the [[Order of British Columbia]].

'''Chantal Anne Akerman''' ({{IPA-fr|ak??man|lang}}; born 6 June 1950) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[film director]], artist, and professor of film at the [[City College of New York]].<ref>[http://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/Chantal-Akerman.cfm Chantal Akerman Faculty Page] at [[City College of New York]]</ref> Akerman's best-known film, ''[[Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles]]'' (1975), broke new ground and still exemplifies a dedication to the ellipses of conventional narrative cinema.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Early life==
Akerman was born to an observant [[Jewish]] family in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. Her grandparents and her mother were sent to [[Auschwitz]]; only her mother came back. This is a very important factor in her personal experience. Her mother's anxiety is a recurrent theme in her filmography. Akerman claims that, at the age of 15, after viewing [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Pierrot le fou]]'' (1965), she decided, that same night, to make movies. At 18, she entered the Institut National Supérieur des Arts du Spectacle et des Techniques de Diffusion, a Belgian film school. During her first term, however, Akerman chose to leave and make ''Saute ma ville,'' a thirteen-minute black-and-white picture in 35mm. She partially subsidized ''Saute ma ville'' from shares she sold on the Antwerp diamond exchange, procuring its remaining budget through her clerical work. In 1971, ''Saute ma ville'' premiered at the Oberhausen short-film festival.<ref>{{cite book|last=Margulies|first=Ivone|title=Nothing Happens|year=1996|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham and London|isbn=0-8223-1723-0|pages=2}}</ref> That year, she moved to New York, where she remained until 1972.

At [[Anthology Film Archives]] in New York, Akerman was impressed with the work of [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Jonas Mekas]], [[Michael Snow]] and [[Andy Warhol]]. She states that Snow's ''[[La Région Centrale]]'' introduced her to the relations among film, time and energy. Her 1972 feature ''Hotel Monterey'' and shorts L''a Chambre 1'' and ''La Chambre 2'' reveal the influence of structural filmmaking through these films' usage of long takes. These protracted shots serve to oscillate images between abstraction and figuration. Akerman's films from this period also signify the start of her collaboration with cinematographer [[Babette Mangolte]], the director of photography on ''Jeanne Dielman''.

In 1973, Akerman returned to Belgium and in 1974 received critical recognition for her feature ''Je tu il elle''. In 1991, she was a member of the jury at the [[41st Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale 1991">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1991/04_jury_1991/04_Jury_1991.html |title=Berlinale: 1991 Juries |accessdate=2011-03-21 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>  In 2011, she joined the full-time faculty of the MFA Program in Media Arts Production at the [[City College of New York]].

==Identity aesthetics==
According to the book ''Images in the Dark'' by Raymond Murray, Akerman refused to have her work ghettoized and denied the New York Gay Film Festival the right to screen ''Je tu il elle''.  "I will never permit a film of mine to be shown in a gay film festival."{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The ''' British Columbia Social Credit Party''', whose members are known as '''Socreds''', was the governing [[political party]] of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], for more than 30 years between the [[British Columbia general election, 1952|1952 provincial election]] and the [[British Columbia general election, 1991|1991 election]]. For four decades, the party dominated the British Columbian political scene, with the only break occurring between the [[British Columbia general election, 1972|1972]] and [[British Columbia general election, 1975|1975 elections]] when the [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia]] was in power.

Although founded to promote [[social credit]] policies of [[monetary reform]], the Social Credit Party became a political vehicle for fiscal conservatives and later social conservatives in BC, who discarded the social credit ideology.

The party essentially collapsed within one term of its 1991 defeat.  It has not been represented in the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]] since 1996, and only existed in a nominal fashion until 2013 where the party was deregistered for failing to nominate more than 2 candidates in 2013 provincial election.

==History==
===Pre-1952===

Prior to 1952, the social credit movement in British Columbia was divided between various factions. The Social Credit League of British Columbia nominated candidates for the first time in the [[British Columbia general election, 1937|1937 election]], but did not do so in the [[British Columbia general election, 1941|1941 election]].

In the [[British Columbia general election, 1945|1945 election]], these factions formed an alliance to field 16 candidates, who won a total of 6,627 votes (1.42% of the provincial total.)

This alliance broke down before the [[British Columbia general election, 1949|1949 election]], and three separate groups nominated candidates:
* the Social Credit Party,
* the British Columbia Social Credit League, and 
* the [[Union of Electors]].
Collectively, they nominated 28 candidates, who won a total of 14,326 votes, 2.05% of the popular vote in that election.

===W.A.C. Bennett era===

For the [[British Columbia general election, 1952|1952 provincial election]], the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|Liberal]]-[[British Columbia Conservative Party|Conservative]] provincial coalition government switched the electoral system from [[first past the post]] to the [[Instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]],    The coalition was nervous about the growing popularity of the socialist [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (forerunner of the NDP).  With the expectation that Conservative voters would list the Liberals as their second choice and vice versa, the two parties believed they'd garner enough votes between them to stay in power.

Meanwhile, the Social Credit League went into the election under the interim leadership of the Reverend [[Ernest George Hansell]], Member of the federal Parliament for the Alberta riding of Macleod since 1935. Hansell was hand-picked by Alberta premier [[Ernest Manning]], as the Alberta Socreds still dominated their BC sister.  However, much to the Socreds' own surprise, the party garnered enough second preference votes to become the largest party in the legislature with 19 seats, one more than the CCF, while the Liberals and Conservatives were practically wiped out.  The Socreds persuaded an independent Labour [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLA) to support them, allowing them to form a [[minority government]].  

As not even the Socreds expected to win the election, they now found themselves with the task of electing a leader who would become the province's new premier.  Party president [[Lyle Wicks]] called a leadership convention at which only elected MLAs could vote. The 19 newly elected Social Credit MLAs chose former [[British Columbia Conservative Party|BC Conservative]] MLA [[W. A. C. Bennett]], one of only three Socreds with previous experience in the legislature, to lead the new government over [[Philip Gaglardi]].  Bennett had only joined the Socreds in December, doing so with the tacit support of the federal Tory caucus.  The federal Tories were displeased that their provincial counterparts had sat out the previous two elections so as not to embarrass their Liberal partners. <ref name="Morley, J. Terence p. 91">Morley, J. Terence; Ruff, Norman J.; Swanson, Neil A.; Wilson, R. Jeremy; and Young, Walter D., ''The Reins of Power: Governing British Columbia'', p. 91, Douglas & McIntyre, Vancouver, 1983</ref>  Nine months into the new term, Bennett changed the electoral system back to first past the post, and deliberately lost a confidence vote in order to force [[British Columbia general election, 1953|a new election in 1953]].  At this election, Social Credit won an outright majority.

Although the party was ostensibly the British Columbia wing of the [[Canadian social credit movement]], Bennett jettisoned the old ideology, remembering that the Alberta Socreds had tried and failed to implement it soon after winning their first term in government.  Instead, he converted it into a populist conservative party.  It became a political vehicle to unite opponents of the CCF/NDP in hopes of shutting it out of power.

The BC Social Credit Party drifted away from both Social Credit and from the federal Social Credit Party as many supporters of the federal Liberals and Tories joined it.  While Bennett made sporadic appearances for the federal Socreds, their relationship was tenuous at best.  Finally, in 1971, the BC Socreds formally severed their ties to the federal Socreds in order to make it easier for staunch Tories and Liberals to support it at the provincial level. <ref name="Morley, J. Terence p. 91" />

Despite being a [[free enterprise]] party, the Bennett government formed BC Hydro in 1961 by [[nationalization|nationalizing]] the province's largest private hydroelectric concern to make sure that it could not oppose the government's hydroelectric dam construction program. It also formed the [[BC Ferries]] in 1958, and established the [[Bank of British Columbia]], which was 25% owned by the provincial government.

===Bill Bennett era===

Following the party's defeat in the [[British Columbia general election, 1972|1972 election]] by the NDP, W.A.C. Bennett's son, [[William R. Bennett]], took over the leadership of the party, and modernized it, putting populism behind.  Instead, the party became a coalition of [[Liberal Party of Canada|federal Liberals]], Christian conservatives from the province's Bible Belt, and fiscal conservatives from the corporate sector with the latter firmly in control. On its return to power in the [[British Columbia general election, 1975|1975 election]], the party, for the most part, eschewed the megaprojects of the elder Bennett (with the exception of [[Expo 86]] and the [[Coquihalla Highway]]), and embraced a fiscally conservative program. 

As a result, the party built up a small political engine that managed to win the [[British Columbia general election, 1983|1983 election]], in spite of Bennett's controversial "Restraint" program. This was nicknamed the "Baby Blue Machine", and consisted of political advisors primarily imported from the [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party]]. It never became a major political apparatus like the [[Big Blue Machine]] in Ontario did, as Bennett decided to retire in 1986.

All Socred governments attempted to curb the power of [[Labor union|trade unions]] and also limited [[social welfare]] spending.

===Bill Vander Zalm era===

Under Bennett's successor, [[Bill Vander Zalm]], control of the party shifted from urban fiscal conservatives to social conservatives.  Although Vander Zalm led the Socreds to a fourth consecutive term in government in the election later that year, the coalition had already begun to unravel.  Many moderate Socreds began drifting to the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|Liberals]], a trend that would come back to haunt the party later. This process was exacerbated by Vander Zalm's eccentricity, and the constant scandals that plagued his government. As well, Vander Zalm allowed his principal secretary, [[David Poole (BC)|David Poole]], to amass a substantial amount of power, despite being unelected. Longtime cabinet minister [[Grace McCarthy]] resigned in protest.

===Decline===
Vander Zalm was forced to resign in a [[conflict of interest]] scandal in 1991, and was succeeded as party leader and premier by Deputy Premier [[Rita Johnston]], who became the first female head of government at any level in Canada. Johnston then defeated McCarthy in the subsequent [[British Columbia Social Credit Party leadership elections#1991 leadership convention|leadership election]] and continued as premier. Johnston had been close to Vander Zalm for several years, leading many to believe her selection as leader had been a mistake. Even NDP opposition leader [[Mike Harcourt]] admitted later that he preferred Johnston over McCarthy, as McCarthy would likely have been a much tougher opponent in an election.
  
Facing a [[British Columbia general election, 1991|statutory general election]], Johnston was unable to make up any ground.  She also had little time to reunite the party following the bruising leadership contest with McCarthy.  Social Credit was roundly defeated, losing almost half of its vote from 1986.  Johnston herself lost her own seat to NDP challenger [[Penny Priddy]].  Furthermore, many moderate Socred supporters defected to the Liberals, continuing a trend that dated back to Vander Zalm's tenure.  The Liberals vaulted from no seats in the legislature to the Official Opposition.  The combined effect was to decimate the Socreds, who were relegated to third place with only seven seats.  More party infighting occurred as McCarthy was elected to replace Johnston.

McCarthy didn't get a chance to get into the legislature until February 1994, when she ran in a by-election for [[Matsqui]], a longtime Socred stronghold.  She lost to Liberal [[Mike de Jong]] by fewer than 100 votes. After that defeat, Social Credit collapsed with dramatic speed.  Four of the six remaining Social Credit MLAs elected in 1991 left the party to join the [[British Columbia Reform Party]], leaving Social Credit without official status in the legislature. McCarthy resigned as leader shortly thereafter, and [[Larry Gillanders]] was elected to succeed her.

After that, Abbotsford MLA [[Harry de Jong]] resigned (and briefly contemplated taking up the leadership of the [[Family Coalition Party of British Columbia|Family Coalition Party]]). The BC Liberals took the riding in the ensuing by-election, with Social Credit in a distant third.

By 1995, the only remaining Socred MLA was [[Cliff Serwa]] from Okanagan West, which contained much of the Bennetts' former territory. ''Vancouver Sun'' legislative columnist [[Vaughn Palmer]] commented at the time on the irony of [[Kelowna]], centre of the Bennett dynasty from 1952 to 1986, now being represented by two fringe party MLAs: Serwa and [[Progressive Democratic Alliance]] MLA [[Judi Tyabji]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Social Credit went into the [[British Columbia general election, 1996|1996 provincial election]] in an extremely precarious position.  It had not had a full-time leader in the legislature at any point during the previous session.  Even worse, Serwa had announced his retirement, leaving it without any incumbents for the first time since 1952.  Gillanders took part in the debate of leaders of major parties, but pulled out of the campaign just before the vote and urged all non-socialist parties to present a united front against the NDP. The party was completely shut out of the legislature, garnering only 0.6 percent of the vote.  At this point, the party was largely considered a dead force in BC politics, with most of its remaining members joining Reform or the Liberals.  The collapse of the British Columbia Socreds within only one term of losing power was especially remarkable considering their Alberta counterparts managed to stay in the legislature for a decade after their defeat in 1971.

In 2001, at the behest of former leader Vander Zalm, the Social Credit Party merged with other provincial right-wing parties to form the [[British Columbia Unity Party|Unity Party]], but soon left due to dissatisfaction with the way the party was run. 

In the [[British Columbia general election, 2001|2001 provincial election]], what remained of the party ran only two candidates. [[Grant Mitton (politician)|Grant Mitton]] achieved a respectable showing in [[Peace River South]], placing second with 1,726 votes (17.4%).  The other candidate, party president Carrol Barbara Woolsey, in [[Vancouver-Hastings]], placed 5th of 6 candidates with 222 votes (1.15% of the total).  The party hadn't had a full-time leader since 2000; Mitton was the ''de facto'' leader during the campaign.  Mitton subsequently left to become leader of the [[British Columbia Party]], leaving Woolsey as ''de facto'' party leader. In the [[British Columbia general election, 2005|2005 election]], only two Socreds filed: Woolsey, who won 254 votes (1.28% of the total) in Vancouver-Hastings, and Anthony Yao, who won 225 votes (0.95% of the total) in [[Port Coquitlam-Burke Mountain]]. 

Since 2001, the party has existed in name only.  Its Website has been updated only sporadically since 2005, and has not been updated at all since February 2012. The party did not field any candidates in the [[British Columbia general election, 2009|2009 general election]]; most of its constituency associations had been de-registered in 2008. In the [[British Columbia general election, 2013|2013 election]], Woolsey was the only Socred candidate, again in Vancouver-Hastings, receiving 355 votes. British Columbia election law mandates de-registration of parties that run fewer than two candidates in two consecutive elections; the party was deregistered by Election BC on June 7, 2013.

==Party leaders==
* [[Andrew Henry Jukes]], 1937-48, leader of the Union of Electors faction, 1948-49.
* No leader as such of the Social Credit Party/Social Credit League emerged until the 1952 election. However, Eric Martin and [[Lyle Wicks]] were the most obvious figures of a collective leadership. At the 1952 party convention Wicks, W.A.C. Bennett and Rev. Hansell were nominated for the party leadership. Wicks and Bennett both withdrew in favour of Hansell who was the hand-picked choice of Alberta Social Credit leader and Premier [[Ernest Manning]]. Following the election, Wicks, who was party president, called a second leadership convention at which only Social Credit MLAs could vote. This was won by Bennett.
* Reverend [[Ernest George Hansell]], M.P. for Macleod (Alberta), leader for the 1952 election.
*[[W. A. C. Bennett]] (July 15, 1952 - November 24, 1973) *

*[[Jack Weisgerber]] (interim) (March 7, 1992 - November 6, 1993)
*[[Grace McCarthy]] (November 6, 1993 - May 1994)
*[[Lyall Franklin Hanson]] (interim) (May 1994)

*[[Larry Gillanders]] (November 4, 1994 - May 24, 1996)
*[[Ken Endean]] (interim) (May 1996 - March 1997)
*[[Mike Culos]] (April 1997 - April 2000)
*[[Eric Buckley]] (April 2000 - October 2000)

*[[Garde Gardom]]
*[[Pat McGeer]]
*[[Rafe Mair]]
*[[Phil Gaglardi]]
*[[Tom Northcott]], a prominent singer, stood unsuccessfully for the provincial legislature.

'''Catherine Breillat''' ({{IPA-fr|b??ja|lang}}; born 13 July 1948) is a French filmmaker, novelist and Professor of Auteur Cinema at the [[European Graduate School]].<ref>See: [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/catherine-breillat/biography/ Catherine Breillat Faculty Page] at [[European Graduate School]]. Retrieved 2010-07-25.</ref> She has often courted controversy with her films' frank treatment of sexual themes. For example, her 1976 debut film, ''[[A Real Young Girl]]'', was banned until 1999.{{where|date=March 2014}}

==Life and career==
Breillat was born in [[Bressuire]], [[Deux-Sèvres]], but grew up in [[Niort]]. She decided to become a writer and director at the age of twelve after watching [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Gycklarnas afton]]'', believing she had found her "fictional body" in [[Harriet Andersson]]'s character, Anna.<ref name=cinefils>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpH-V6kkOwI |title=CATHERINE BREILLAT on INTIMACY - cine-fils.com |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref>

She started her career after studying acting at Yves Furet's "Studio d'Entraînement de l'Acteur" in Paris together with her sister, actress [[Marie-Hélène Breillat]] (born 2 June 1947) in 1967. At the age of 17, she had her novel published,'' l'Homme facile'' (''Easy Man''). The French government banned it for readers under 18 years old. A film based on the novel was made shortly after the publication of the book, but the producer went bankrupt and the distributor [[Artedis]] blocked any commercial release of the film for twenty years although it had been given an R rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/culture/0101278980-breillat-veut-racheter-son-film-pierre-richard-muller-d-artedis-en-possede-les-droits-une-vraie-jeune-fille-1976-de-catherine-breillat-avec-charlotte-alexandra-hiram-keller-bruno-balp-rita-meiden-geor |title=Breillat veut racheter son film.

Breillat is known for films focusing on sexuality,<ref>Emma Wilson, "Deforming femininity: Catherine Breillat's <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Romance</span>" ''France on Film: Reflections on Popular French Cinema'' ed. Lucy Mazdon. London: Wallflower (2001): 146. ''Romance'' "is part of a larger and sustained project in Breillat's art to consider, challenge and reinvent female sexuality."</ref> intimacy, gender conflict, and [[sibling rivalry]]. Breillat has been the subject of controversy for her explicit depictions of [[Sexual violence|sexuality and violence]]. She cast the [[pornstar]] [[Rocco Siffredi]] in her films ''[[Romance (1999 film)|Romance]]'' (''Romance X'', 1999) and ''Anatomie de l’enfer'' (''[[Anatomy of Hell]]'', 2004). Her novels have been best-sellers.

Her work has been associated with the [[New French Extremity|cinéma du corps/cinema of the body]] genre.<ref name=jq>Palmer, Tim, ''Brutal Intimacy: Analyzing Contemporary French Cinema'', Wesleyan University Press, 2011.</ref> In an interview with ''[[Senses of Cinema]]'', she described [[David Cronenberg]] as another filmmaker she considers to have a similar approach to sexuality in film.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Though Breillat spends most of her time behind the camera, she has acted in a handful of movies, making her film debut in 1972 as Mouchette in [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]''.

In 2004, Breillat suffered a [[cerebral hemorrhage]], causing a [[stroke]] that paralyzed her left side.<ref name="Parisien 2009, p. 13">"Quand Christophe Rocancourt et Catherine Breillat se dechirent" Le Parisien; Thursday July 9, 2009, p. 13</ref> After five months of hospitalization and a slow rehabilitation, she gradually returned to work, producing ''Une vieille maîtresse'' (''[[The Last Mistress]]'') in 2007.  This film was one of three French films officially selected for the [[Cannes Film Festival]] of that year.

In 2007, Breillat met notorious [[confidence trick#Terminology|conman]] [[Christophe Rocancourt]], and offered him a leading role in a movie that she was planning to make, based on her own novel ''Bad Love'', and starring [[Naomi Campbell]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Secher|first=Benjamin|title=Catherine Breillat: 'All true artists are hated'|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3672302/Catherine-BreillatAll-true-artists-are-hated.html|accessdate=15 January 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=5 April 2008}}</ref>  Soon after, she gave him [[Euro|€]]25,000 to write a screenplay titled ''La vie amoureuse de Christophe Rocancourt'' (''The Love Life of Christophe Rocancourt''), and over the next year and a half, would give him loans totalling an additional €678,000.<ref name=Figaro>{{cite news|last=de Mallevoüe|first=Delphine|title=Christophe Raconcourt sort de prison et prépare un livre|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2012/02/17/01016-20120217ARTFIG00667-huit-mois-de-prison-ferme-pour-rocancourt.php|accessdate=15 January 2013|newspaper=[[Le Figaro]]|date=18 February 2012|language=French}}</ref> In 2009, a book written by Breillat was published, in which she alleged that Rocancourt had taken advantage of her diminished mental capacity, as she was still recovering from her stroke.<ref>{{cite web|last=Groves|first=Don|title=Breillat's new twist on Sleeping Beauty|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/films/blog-articles/120022/breillat-s-new-twist-on-sleeping-beauty|work=[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]|accessdate=15 January 2013|date=9 August 2010}}</ref> The book is titled ''Abus de faiblesse'', a French legal term usually translated as "abuse of weakness".<ref>{{cite web|last=Roxo|first=Alexandra|title=A Conversation with Catherine Breillat (THE SLEEPING BEAUTY)|url=http://www.hammertonail.com/interviews/a-conversation-with-catherine-breillat-the-sleeping-beauty/|work=Hammer to Nail|accessdate=15 January 2013|date=7 July 2011}}</ref> In 2012, Rocancourt was convicted of ''abus de faiblesse'' for taking Breillat's money, and sentenced to prison.<ref name=Figaro />

In September 2010, Breillat's second fairy-tale based film, ''La belle endormie'' (''Sleeping Beauty''), opened in the Orizzonti sidebar in the 67th [[Venice Film Festival]].<ref name=ejlyman>Lyman, Eric J., "'La Belle endormie' to premiere at Venice fest", "The Hollywood Reporter", 19 July 2010 [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/world/news/e3ied526ffc296810ce8b90979fc1796c33] Access date: Thursday August 19, 2010.</ref>

{{As of|2011}}, although Breillat had moved on to other projects, she still hoped to film ''Bad Love'', but had not yet been able to find financing to do so.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=Eric|title='Sleeping Beauty' Director Catherine Breillat: 'To Be An Artist is To Be Alone.'|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/interview_sleeping_beauty_director_catherine_breillat_to_be_an_artist_is_to|work=[[IndieWire|Indiewire]]|publisher=SnagFilms|accessdate=15 January 2013|date=6 July 2011}}</ref> However somewhat ironically, a film adaptation of her book ''Abus de faiblesse'', directed by Breillat and starring [[Isabelle Huppert]], began production in 2012, and was screened at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Keslassy|first=Elsa|title=Breillat to helm 'Abus de faiblesse'|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118048516/|accessdate=15 January 2013|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine){{!}}Variety]]|date=12 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kolesnikov-Jessop|first=Sonia|title=Isabelle Huppert Hopes to Work With More Asian Film Directors|url=http://encn.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/847645/isabelle-huppert-hopes-to-work-with-more-asian-film-directors|work=[[Louise Blouin Media|ARTINFO]]|publisher=Louise Blouin Media|accessdate=15 January 2013|date=12 December 2012}}</ref>

'''Amphisbaenia''' (called '''amphisbaenians''' or '''worm lizards''') is a group of usually legless [[squamate]]s, comprising over 180 extant species. Amphisbaenians are characterized by long bodies, reduction or loss of the limbs, and rudimentary eyes. As many species possess a pink body coloration and scales arranged in rings, they have a superficial resemblance to [[earthworms]]. All are limbless except for ''[[Bipes (genus)|Bipes]]'', which retains forelimbs. Although superficially similar to the [[snake]]s and [[Dibamidae]], recent phylogenetic studies suggest that they are most closely related to the [[Lacertidae]]. Amphisbaenians are widely distributed, occurring in North America, Europe, Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. Most species are less than {{convert|6|in|mm}} long. Little is known of them outside of their anatomy, and even that is difficult to study due to the mechanics of dissecting such small animals.

==Description==
[[image:Amphisbaenia 1.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Close-up of the head of'' Rhineura'']]
Despite a superficial resemblance to some primitive snakes, amphisbaenians have many unique features that distinguish them from other reptiles. Internally, their right lung is reduced in size to fit their narrow bodies, whereas in snakes, it is always the left lung. Their skeletal structure and skin are also different from those of other squamates.<ref name=EoR>{{cite book |editor=[[Harold Cogger|Cogger, H.G.]] & [[Richard G. Zweifel|Zweifel, R.G.]]|author= Gans, Carl|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 212–215|isbn= 0-12-178560-2}}</ref> Both genetic and recent fossil evidence indicate that amphisbaenians lost their legs independently from snakes.<ref>Muller, J et al. (2011). "Eocene lizard from Germany reveals amphisbaenian origins." ''Nature'' '''473''': 364–367.</ref>

The head is stout, not set off from the neck, and either rounded, sloped, or sloped with a ridge down the middle. Most of the skull is solid bone, with a distinctive single median tooth in the upper jaw. It has no outer ears, and the eyes are deeply recessed and covered with skin and scales. These rudimentary eyes have a [[cornea]], [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]], and complex [[ciliary body]] which allows them to detect light but they are reduced in size and do not have an [[anterior chamber of eyeball|anterior chamber]].<ref>Foureaux, G., Egami, M.I., Jared, C., Antoniazzi, M.M., Gutierre, R.C., Smith, R.L., 2010. Rudimentary eyes of squamate fossorial reptiles (amphisbaenia and serpentes). John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ. 293(2): 351-7.</ref> The body is elongated, and the tail truncates in a manner that vaguely resembles the head. Their name is derived from [[Amphisbaena]], a mythical serpent with a head at each end. The four species of ''[[Bipedidae|Bipes]]'' are unusual in having a pair of forelimbs, but all limbless species have some remnants of the pelvic and pectoral girdles embedded within the body musculature.

The skin of amphisbaenians is only loosely attached to the body, and they move using an accordion-like motion, in which the skin moves and the body seemingly just drags along behind it. Uniquely, they are also able to perform this motion in reverse just as effectively.

Amphisbaenians are carnivorous, able to tear chunks out of larger prey with their powerful, interlocking teeth. Like lizards, some species are able to shed their tails ([[autotomy]]). Most species lay eggs, although at least some are known to be [[Vivipary|viviparous]].<ref name=EoR/>

The white worm lizard (''Amphisbaena alba'') is often found in association with [[leafcutter ant]]s. This reptile is thought to forage in the ants' deep galleries where the insects deposit their waste. The larvae of certain large beetles live in these galleries and it is these on which the reptile preys.<ref>[[Ross Piper|Piper, Ross]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Press (publisher)|Greenwood Press]].</ref>

==Taxonomy==
[[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomic]] classification of amphisbaenians was traditionally based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphological characters]] such as the number of preanal pores, body [[Annulus (zoology)|annuli]], and tail [[Annulus (zoology)|annuli]]. Such characters are vulnerable to [[convergent evolution]]; in particular, loss of the forelimbs and the evolution of specialized shovel-headed and keel-headed morphs appear to have occurred multiple times in the history of the group.<ref>Kearney, Maureen, and Bryan L. Stuart. "Repeated evolution of limblessness and digging heads in worm lizards revealed by DNA from old bones." PROCEEDINGS-ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON B 271 (2004): 1677-1684.</ref> Classifications based on [[mitochondrial DNA]] sequences and [[nuclear DNA]] sequences better reflect their true evolutionary history, and are now being used to distinguish [[genera]] of amphisbaenians.<ref>Mott, T., Vieites, D.R., 2009. Molecular phylogenetics reveals extreme morphological homoplasy in Brazilian worm lizards challenging current taxonomy. Molecular Phylogenetics & Evolution. 51(2): 190-200.</ref><ref>Vanzolini, P.E., 2002. An aid to the identification of the South American species of Amphisbaena (Squamata, Amphisbaenidae). Pap. Avulsos Zool, São Paulo, 42(15): 351-362.</ref>

The most ancient branch of the tree is the Rhineuridae. The remaining five families form a group to the exclusion of rhineurids. Bipedidae, Blanidae and Cadeidae represent the most ancient divergences within this grouping, with the Trogonophidae and Amphisbaenidae diverging more recently.<ref>Vidal, Nicolas, et al. "Origin of tropical American burrowing reptiles by transatlantic rafting." Biology Letters 4.1 (2008): 115-118.</ref>

The Amphisbaenia has usually been considered a [[suborder]] of squamates. However, more recent studies indicate that it is part of the [[Lacertoidea]] clade of lizards, ranked only as a [[superfamily (zoology)|superfamily]], so it is now commonly described as an unranked [[clade]].

Living polymerization is desirable because it offers precision and control in macromolecular synthesis.  This is important since many of the novel/useful properties of polymers result from their microstructure and molecular weight.   Since [[molecular weight]] and [[dispersity]] are less controlled in non-living polymerizations, this method is more desirable for materials design<ref name=Cowie /><ref name=Principles />

In many cases, living polymerization reactions are confused or thought to be synonymous with controlled polymerizations.  While these polymerization reactions are very similar, there is a distinct difference in the definitions of these two reactions.  While living polymerizations are defined as polymerization reactions where termination or chain transfer is eliminated, controlled polymerization reactions are reactions where termination is suppressed, but not eliminated, through the introduction of a dormant state of the polymer.<ref name=Cowie /><ref name=Principles />  However, this distinction is still up for debate in the literature.

The main living polymerization techniques are:
* [[Living anionic polymerization]]
* [[Living cationic polymerization]]
* Living [[ring-opening metathesis polymerization]]
* [[Living free radical polymerization]]
* Living chain-growth polycondensations

==History==
Living polymerization was demonstrated by [[Michael Szwarc]] in 1956 in the anionic polymerization of [[styrene]] with an [[alkali metal]] / [[naphthalene]] system in [[tetrahydrofuran]] ([[THF]]) (see figure in "Living anionic polymerizations" section below). After initial addition of monomer to the initiator system, the  [[viscosity]] would increase (due to increased polymer chain growth), but eventually cease after depletion of monomer concentration.  However, he found that addition of ''more'' monomer caused an increase in viscosity, indicating growth of the polymer chain, and thus concluded that the polymer chains had never been terminated.<ref>Webster, O. W. ''Science'', '''1991''', ''251'', 8877.</ref>  This was a major step in polymer chemistry, since control over when the polymer was quenched, or terminated, was generally not a controlled step.  With this discovery, the list of potential applications expanded dramatically.

Today, living polymerizations are used widely in the development of various types of polymers or plastics.  This is because chemists now have easy control of the chemical makeup of the polymer and, thus, the structural and electronic properties of the material.  This level of control rarely exists in non-living polymerization reactions, leaving this method as the preferred synthetic route if attainable.<ref name=Principles /><ref name="McNeil 1" />  The most common types of living polymerization reactions are anionic, cationic, free-radical, or ring-opening in nature, the specifics of each are discussed in the techniques section.  In addition, while [[copolymers]] are possible to create using non-living polymerization reactions, the types of copolymers and the precise control of the chemical structure was expanded through the discovery of living polymerizations.<ref name=Principles />

==Characteristics==

===Characteristics of Living Polymerization===
[[File:Nonlivingpolymanimation.gif|thumb|300px|right| Figure 1: Rate of initiation is slower than the rate of propagation, leading to the formation of active species at different points in time during the polymerization.]]
[[File:living polymerization animation.gif|thumb|300px|right|Figure 2: Rate of initiation is instantaneous in comparison to the rate of propagation, causing all the active species to form simultaneously, and chain growth to occur at the same rate.]]
One of the key characteristics of a living polymerization is that the chain termination and transfer reactions are essentially eliminated from the four elementary reactions of [[Chain-growth polymerization]] leaving only [[Initiation (chemistry)|initiation]] and (chain) propagation reactions.

'''Fast Rate of Initiation'''

Another key characteristic is that the rate of initiation (meaning the dormant chemical species generates the active chain propagating species) must be much faster than the rate of chain propagation. This would allow all of the active species to form before chain propagation begins so all of the chains grow at the same rate (the rate of propagation). Conversely, if initiation is much slower than chain propagation (i.e. initiation is the [[rate determining step]]) then the active species will form at different points during the reaction leading to  wider distribution between the individual polymer chains [[degree of polymerization]] (or chain length) and molecular weight (figure 1 and 2).

'''Low Dispersity'''

[[Dispersity| Dispersity (?)]] or polydispersity index (PDI) is an indication of the broadness in the distribution of polymer chains [http://goldbook.iupac.org/LT07156.html living polymers] tend to have low ? due to the absence of chain termination pathways as well as the rate of initiation being much faster than the rate of propagation. If chain termination are present then chains will "die" or become inactive at various times during the polymerization which leads to polymer chains with varying x<sub>n</sub>.  As stated in the previous section, if the rate of propagation is much slower than the rate of initiation then all of the initiators will form the active species before the onset of propagation (see figure 1 and 2). When both of these characteristics are considered it becomes apparent that the concentration of active chains, that is those undergoing polymerization, becomes essentially constant.  Both of these characteristics extend the lifetime of the propagating chain allowing for synthetic manipulation, co-block polymer formation and end group functionalization to be performed on the living chain. Increasing the lifetime of the propagating polymer chain allows for more control of the resulting polymers structure and properties since there is an inherent structure-property relationship in polymers.

'''Predictable Molecular Weight'''
Since termination and chain transfer are absent in living polymerization then each initiator that generates an active species will be responsible for one chain. This offers control over the  average degree of polymerization, which is related to M<sub>n</sub> (number average molecular weight), in living polymerizations by controlling the monomer ([M]<sub>o</sub>) to initiator ([I]<sub>o</sub>) ratio. For an ideal living system, assuming efficiency for generating active species is 100%, where each initiator generates only one active species the [[Kinetic chain length]] (average number of monomers the active species reacts with during its lifetime) at a given time can be estimated by knowing the concentration of monomer remaining. The number average molecular weight, [[Molar mass distribution#number average molecular mass|M<sub>n</sub>]], increases linearly with percent conversion during a living polymerization

==Living Polymerization Techniques==

===Living anionic polymerization===
{{Main|Living anionic polymerization}}
As early as 1936, [[Karl Ziegler]] proposed that anionic polymerization of styrene and butadiene by consecutive addition of monomer to an alkyl lithium initiator occurred without chain transfer or termination. Twenty years later, living polymerization was demonstrated by Szwarc through the [[anionic addition polymerization|anionic polymerization]] of [[styrene]] in [[THF]] using [[sodium naphthalenide]] as celerator.<ref>M. Szwarc, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' '''1956''', 178, 1168.</ref><ref>Szwarc, M.; Levy, M.; Milkovich, R. ''[[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]'' '''1956''', 78, 2656.</ref><ref>US 4 158 678 (priority date 30 June 1976).</ref>

[[File:Wiki Anion2.png|center|600px|This is showing one of the first examples of a living anionic polymerization.  Note the absence of a termination or chain transfer step.]]

Here, the naphthalene anion acts as the initiator of the polymerization by activating the styrene.  However, note that (with no impurities present for quenching and no solvent for chain transfer) there is no route for termination to occur.  Therefore, these terminal anions will stay on the ends of the polymer until a quenching agent is introduced.

It is believed that the dianion of the polymer shown above is formed for this reaction, allowing the propagation to occur at either end of the chain.  However, notice that there is no termination step (given impurities are not present to quench).  This is the basis for anionic living polymerizations, where the terminal radical will exist until free monomer is available for additional propagation, or is quenched from an outside source.

====Living ?-olefin polymerization====

[[Alpha-olefins|?-olefins]] can be polymerized through an anionic coordination polymerization in which the metal center of the catalyst is considered the counter cation for the [[anionic]] end of the alkyl chain (through a M-R coordination). Ziegler-Natta initiators were developed in the mid-1950s and are heterogeneous initiators used in the polymerization of alpha-olefins. Not only were these initiators the first to achieve relatively high molecular weight poly(1-alkenes) (currently the most widely produced thermoplastic in the world PE([[Polyethylene]]) and PP ([[Polypropylene]])<ref>{{cite book|last=Craver|first=C., Carraher,C.|title=Applied Polymer Science: 21st Century|year=2000|publisher=Elsevier|pages=1022–1023.}}</ref> but the initiators were also capable of stereoselctive polymerizations which is attributed to the [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[Crystal structure]] of the heterogeneous initiator.<ref name=Principles /> Due to the importance of this discovery Ziegler and Natta were presented with the [http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1963/ 1963 Nobel Prize in chemistry]. Although the active species formed from the Ziegler-Natta initiator generally have long lifetimes (on the scale of hours or longer) the lifetimes of the propagating chains are shortened due to several chain transfer pathways ([[Beta-Hydride elimination]] and transfer to the co-initiator) and as a result are not considered living.<ref name=Principles />

Metallocene initiators are considered as a type of Ziegler-Natta initiators due to the use of the two-component system consisting of a [[Transition metal]] and a group I-III metal co-initiator (for example [[Methylalumoxane]] (MAO) or other alkyl aluminum compounds). The [[Metallocene]] initiators form homogenous single site [[catalyst]]s that were initially developed to study the impact that the catalyst structure had on the resulting polymers structure/properties; which was difficult for multi-site heterogenous Ziegler-Natta initiators.<ref>{{cite book|last=Craver|first=C., Carraher,C.|title=Applied Polymer Science: 21st Century|year=2000|publisher=Elsevier|pages=1022–1023}}</ref>  Due to the discrete single site on the metallocene catalyst researchers were able to tune and relate how the ancillary ligand (those not directly involved in the chemical transformations) structure and the symmetry about the chiral metal center affect the microstructure of the polymer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Coates|first=Geoffrey W.|title=Precise Control of Polyolefin Stereochemistry Using Single-Site Metal Catalysts|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=April 2000|volume=100|issue=4|pages=1223–1252|doi=10.1021/cr990286u}}</ref>  However, do to chain breaking reactions (mainly Beta-Hydride elimination) very few metallocene based polymerizations are known.<ref name=Principles />

By tuning the steric bulk and electronic properties of the ancillary ligands and their [[substituent]]s a class of initiators known as [[Chelation|chelate]] initiators (or post-metallocene initiators) have been successfully used for [[Stereospecificity|stereospecific]] living polymerizations of alpha-olefins. The chelate initiators have a high potential for living polymerizations because the ancillary ligands can be designed to discourage or inhibit chain termination pathways. Chelate initiators can be further broken down based on the ancillary ligands; ansa-cyclopentyadienyl-amido initiators, alpha-diimine chelates and phenoxy-imine chelates.<ref name=Principles />  
*Ansa-cyclopentadienyl-amido (CpA) initiators 
[[File:ACp initiators.png|thumb|300|right|a.) Shows the general form of CpA initiators with one Cp ring and a coordinated Nitrogen b.) Shows a the CpA initiator used in the living polymerization of 1-hexene (5)]]
CpA initiators have one [[Cyclopentadienyl]] substituent and one or more nitrogen substituents coordinated to the metal center (generally a Zr or Ti) (Odian).  The dimethyl(pentamethylcyclopentyl)zirconium acetamidinate in figure___ has been used for a stereospecific living polymerization of 1-hexene at -10 deg C. The resulting poly(1-hexene) was [[Tacticity#Isotactic polymers|isotactic]] (stereohemistry is the same between adjacent repeat units) confirmed by <sup>13</sup>C-NMR. The multiple trials demonstrated a controllable and predictable (from catalyst to [[monomer]] ratio) M<sub>n</sub> with low ?. The polymerization was further confirmed to be living by sequentially adding 2 portions of the monomer, the second portion was added after the first portion was already polymerized, and monitoring the ? and M<sub>n</sub> of the chain. The resulting polymer chains complied with the predicted M<sub>n</sub> (with the total monomer concentration = portion 1 +2) and showed low ?<ref name="Ansa chelates">{{cite journal|last=Jayaratne|first=K.|author2=Sita |title=L|journal=J. Am. Chem.  Soc.|issue=14|pages=958–959}}</ref>   suggesting the chains were still active, or living, as the second portion of monomer was added (5).
*?-diimine chelate initiators
?-diimine chelate initiators are characterized by having a [[Imine|diimine]] chelating ancillary ligand structure and which is generally coordinated to a late transition (i.e. Ni and Pd) metal center.

===Living cationic polymerization===
{{Main|Living cationic polymerization}}
Monomers for living cationic polymerization are electron-rich alkenes such as vinyl ethers, [[isobutylene]], [[styrene]], and N-vinylcarbazole. The initiators are binary systems consisting of an electrophile and a Lewis acid. The method was developed around 1980 with contributions from Higashimura, Sawamoto and Kennedy.  Typically, generating a stable carbocation for a prolonged period of time is difficult, due to the possibility for the cation to be quenched by a ?-protons attached to another monomer in the backbone, or in a free monomer.  Therefore a different approach is taken<ref name=Cowie>{{cite book|last=Cowie|first=J.M.G.|title=Polymers chemistry and physics of modern materials|year=2007|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=Boca Raton|isbn=9780849398131|edition=3rd ed / J.M.G. Cowie and Valeria Arrighi}}</ref><ref name=Principles /><ref name=Goethals />

[[File:Wiki Cation.png|right|400px|This is an example of a controlled/living cationic polymerization.  Note that the "termination" step has been placed in equilibrium with an "initiation" step in either direction.  Nu: is a weak nucleophile that can reversibly leave, while the MXn is a weak Lewis acid M bound to a halogen X to generate the carbocation.]]

In this example, the carbocation is generated by the addition of a Lewis acid (co-initiator, along with the halogen "X" already on the polymer - see figure), which ultimately generates the carbocation in a weak equilibrium.  This equilibrium heavily favors the dormant state, thus leaving little time for permanent quenching or termination by other pathways.  In addition, a weak nucleophile (Nu:) can also added to reduce the concentration of active species even further, thus keeping the polymer "living".<ref name=Cowie /><ref name=Principles /><ref name=Goethals>{{cite journal|last=Goethals|first=E|author2=Duprez, F |title=Carbocationic polymerizations|journal=Progress in Polymer Science|date=February 2007|volume=32|issue=2|pages=220–246|doi=10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2007.01.001}}</ref>  However, it is important to note that '''by definition, the polymers described in this example are not technically living''' due to the introduction of a dormant state, as termination has only been decreased, not eliminated (though this topic is still up for debate).  But, they do operate similarly, and are used in similar applications to those of true living polymerizations.

===Living ring-opening metathesis polymerization===
Given the right reaction conditions [[ring-opening metathesis polymerization]] (ROMP) can be rendered living. The first such systems were described by [[Robert H. Grubbs]] in 1986 based on [[norbornene]] and [[Tebbe's reagent]] and in 1978 Grubbs together with [[Richard R. Schrock]] describing living polymerization with a [[tungsten]] carbene complex.<ref>"Ring-opening polymerization of norbornene by a living tungsten alkylidene complex" R. R. Schrock, J. Feldman, L. F. Cannizzo, R. H. Grubbs ''[[Macromolecules]]''; 1987; 20(5); 1169–1172. {{DOI|10.1021/ma00171a053}}</ref>

Generally, ROMP reactions involve the conversion of a cyclic olefin with significant ring-strain (>5 kcal/mol), such as cyclobutene, norbornene, cyclopentene, etc., to a polymer that also contains double bonds.  The important thing to note about ring-opening metathesis polymerizations is that the double bond is usually maintained in the backbone, which can allow it to be considered “living” under the right conditions.<ref name=Grubbs>{{cite journal|last=Bielawski|first=Christopher W.|author2=Grubbs, Robert H. |title=Living ring-opening metathesis polymerization|journal=Progress in Polymer Science|date=January 2007|volume=32|issue=1|pages=1–29|doi=10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2006.08.006}}</ref>

For a ROMP reaction to be considered “living”, several guidelines must be met:<ref name=Grubbs />
# Fast and complete initiation of the monomer. This means that the rate at which an initiating agent activates the monomer for polymerization, must happen very quickly.
# How many monomers make up each polymer (the degree of polymerization) must be related linearly to the amount of monomer you started with.
# The [[dispersity]] of the polymer must be < 1.5.  In other words, the distribution of how long your polymer chains are in your reaction must be very low.
With these guidelines in mind, it allows you to create a polymer that is well controlled both in content (what monomer you use) and properties of the polymer (which can be largely attributed to polymer chain length).  It is important to note that living ring-opening polymerizations can be anionic ''or'' cationic.

[[File:Wiki LivingROMP2.png|center|500px|The catalytic cycle of a living ring-opening metathesis polymerization with a metal catalyst.  Note that the ring can be any size, but should contain some significant ring strain on the alkene.]]

Because living polymers have had their termination ability removed, this means that once your monomer has been consumed, the addition of more monomer will result in the polymer chains continuing to grow until all of the additional monomer is consumed.  This will continue until the metal catalyst at the end of the chain is intentionally removed by the addition of a quenching agent.  As a result, it may potentially allow one to create a [[block copolymer|block]] or [[gradient copolymers|gradient copolymer]] fairly easily and accurately.  This can lead to a high ability to tune the properties of the polymer to a desired application (electrical/ionic conduction, etc.) <ref name=Principles>{{cite book|last=Odian|first=George|title=Principles of polymerization|year=2004|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=0471274003|edition=4. ed.}}</ref><ref name=Grubbs />

===Living free radical polymerization===
{{Main|Living free radical polymerization}}  
Starting in the 1970s several new methods were discovered which allowed the development of living polymerization using [[radical (chemistry)|free radical]] chemistry. These techniques involved [[catalytic chain transfer]] polymerization, iniferter mediated polymerization, stable free radical mediated polymerization (SFRP), [[atom transfer radical polymerization]] (ATRP), [[reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer]] ([[RAFT (chemistry)|RAFT]]) polymerization, and iodine-transfer polymerization.

In “living” radical polymerization (or controlled radical polymerization (CRP)) the chain breaking pathways are severely depressed when compared to conventional radical polymerization (RP) and CRP can display characteristics of a living polymerization. However, since chain termination is not absent, but only minimized, CRP technically does not meet the requirements imposed by IUPAC for a living polymerization (see introduction for IUPAC definition). This issue has been up for debate the view points of different researchers can be found in a special issue of the Journal of Polymer Science titled   [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1099-0518(20000515)38:10%3C%3E1.0.CO;2-C/issuetoc Living or Controlled ?]. The issue has not yet been resolved in the literature so it is often denoted as a “living” polymerization, quasi-living polymerization, pseudo-living and other terms to denote this issue.

There are two general strategies employed in CRP to suppress chain breaking reactions and promote fast initiation relative to propagation. Both strategies are based on developing a dynamic equilibrium amongst an active propagating radical and a dormant species.<ref name="Braunecker CRP" />

The first strategy involves a reversible trapping mechanism in which the propagating radical undergoes an activation/deactivation (i.e. [[Atom-transfer radical-polymerization]]) process with a species X. The species X is a persistent radical, or a species that can generate a stable radial, that cannot terminate with itself or propagate but can only reversibly "terminate" with the propagating radical (from the propagating polymer chain)P*. P* is a radical species that an propagate (k<sub>p</sub>) and irreversibly terminate (k<sub>t</sub>) with another P*.  X is normally a  nitroxide (i.e. [[TEMPO]] used in [[Nitroxide Mediated Radical Polymerization]]) or an organometallic species. The dormant species (P<sub>n</sub>-X) can be activated to regenerate the active propagating species (P*) spontaneously, thermally, using a catalyst and optically.<ref name="Braunecker CRP">{{cite journal|last=Braunecker|first=Wade A.|author2=Matyjaszewski, Krzysztof |title=Controlled/living radical polymerization: Features, developments, and perspectives|journal=Progress in Polymer Science|date=January 2007|volume=32|issue=1|pages=93–146|doi=10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2006.11.002}}</ref><ref name=Matyjaszewski>{{cite web|last=Matyjaszewski|title=Features of Controlled "Living" Polymerization|url=http://www.cmu.edu/maty/crp/feature-development-crp/features.html#feature%202}}</ref>  
[[File:reversible trapping.png|center|400px]]

The second strategy is based on a degenerative transfer (DT) of the propagating radical between transfer agent that acts as a dormant species (i.e. [[Reversible addition?fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization]]). The DT based CRP's follow the conventional kinetics of radical polymerization, that is slow initiation and fast termination, but the transfer agent (Pm-X or Pn-X) is present in a much higher concentration compared to the radical initiator.The propagating radial species undergoes a thermally neutral exchange with the dormant transfer agent through atom transfer, group transfer or addition fragment chemistry.<ref name="Braunecker CRP" />

===Living chain-growth polycondensations===

Chain growth polycondensation polymerizations were initially developed under the premise that a change in substituent effects of the polymer, relative to the monomer, causes the polymers end group to be more reactive this has been referred to as “reactive intermediate polycondensation”. The essential result is monomers preferentially react with the activated polymer end groups over reactions with other monomers.  This preferred reactivity is the fundamental difference when categorizing a polymerization mechanism as chain-growth as opposed to [[step-growth polymerization|step-growth]] in which the monomer and polymer chain end group have equal reactivity (the reactivity is uncontrolled). Several strategies were employed to minimize monomer-monomer reactions (or self-condensation) and polymerizations with low D and controllable Mn have been attained by this mechanism for small molecular weight polymers.<ref name="Yokozawa 1">{{cite journal|last=Yokozawa, Yokoyama|first=T., A.|journal=Prog. Polym. Sci.|year=2007|volume=32|pages=147–172}}</ref> However, for high molecular weight polymer chains (i.e. small initiator to monomer ratio) the Mn is not easily to controlled, for some monomers, since self-condensation between monomers occurred more frequently due to the low propagating species concentration.<ref name="Yokozawa 1"/>

====Catalyst-transfer Polycondensation====

Catalyst transfer polycondensation (CTP) is a chain-growth polycondensation mechanism in which the monomers do not directly react with one another and instead the monomer will only react with the polymer end group through a catalyst-mediated mechanism.<ref name="Yokozawa 1" />  The general process consists of the catalyst activating the polymer end group followed by a reaction of the end group with a 2nd incoming monomer. The catalyst is then transferred to the elongated chain while activating the end group (as shown below).<ref name="Yokozawa 2">{{cite journal|last=Miyakoshi|first=Ryo|author2=Yokoyama, Akihiro |author3=Yokozawa, Tsutomu |title=Catalyst-Transfer Polycondensation.

Catalyst transfer polycondensation allows for the living polymerization of ?-conjugated polymers and was discovered by Tsutomu Yokozawa in 2004 <ref name="Yokozawa 2"/> and Richard McCullough.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Iovu|first=Mihaela Corina|author2=Sheina, Elena E. |author3=Gil, Roberto R. |author4= McCullough, Richard D. |title=Experimental Evidence for the Quasi-"Living" Nature of the Grignard Metathesis Method for the Synthesis of Regioregular Poly(3-alkylthiophenes)|journal=Macromolecules|date=October 2005|volume=38|issue=21|pages=8649–8656|doi=10.1021/ma051122k}}</ref> This was further refined by Ted Pappenfus in 2008 with the addition of a Grignard catalyst to initiate polymerization.<ref name="Pappenfus 2">{{cite journal|last=Pappenfus|first=Ted|title=Polymerization of Poly(3-hexylthiophene) using Grignard Reagents and Ni-Catatalyst|journal=Organic Letters|date=December 2008|volume=10|issue=8|pages=1553–1556|doi=10.1021/ol8002018}}</ref> In CTP the propagation step is based on organic cross coupling reactions (i.e. [[Kumada coupling]], [[Sonogashira coupling]], [http://www.organic-chemistry.org/namedreactions/negishi-coupling.shtm Negishi coupling]) top form carbon carbon bonds between difunctional monomers. When Yokozawa and McCullough independently discovered the polymerization using a metal catalyst to couple a [[Grignard Reaction|Grignard reagent]] with an organohalide making a new carbon-carbon bond. The mechanism below shows the formation of poly(3-alkylthiophene) using a Ni initiator (L<sub>n</sub> can be [[1,3-Bis(diphenylphosphino)propane| 1,3-Bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp)]]) and is similar to the conventional mechanism for [[Kumada coupling]] involving an [[Oxidative Addition|oxidative addition]], a [[transmetalation]] and a [[Oxidative Addition|reductive elimination]] step. However there is a key difference, following reductive elimination in CTP, an  associative complex is formed (which has been supported by intra-/intermolecular oxidative addition competition experiments <ref name="McNeil 1">{{cite journal|last=McNeil|first=Anne; Bryan, Zachary|title=Evidence for a preferential intramolecular oxidative addition in Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions and their impact on chain-growth polymerizations|journal=Chem.

Whereas in a coupling reaction the newly formed alkyl/aryl compound diffuses away and the subsequent oxidative addition occurs between an incoming Ar-Br bond and the metal center. 
The associative complex is essential to for polymerization to occur in a living fashion since it allows the metal to undergo a preferred intramolecular oxidative addition and remain with a single propagating chain (consistent with chain-growth mechanism), as opposed to an intermolecular oxidative addition with other monomers present in the solution (consistent with a step-growth, non-living, mechanism).<ref name=Kiriy>{{cite journal|last=Kiriy|first=Anton|author2=Senkovskyy, Volodymyr |author3=Sommer, Michael |title=Kumada Catalyst-Transfer Polycondensation: Mechanism, Opportunities, and Challenges|journal=Macromolecular Rapid Communications|date=4 October 2011|volume=32|issue=19|pages=1503–1517|doi=10.1002/marc.201100316}}</ref><ref name="Bryan 8395–8405">{{cite journal|last=Bryan|first=Zachary J.|author2=McNeil, Anne J. |title=Conjugated Polymer Synthesis via Catalyst-Transfer Polycondensation (CTP): Mechanism, Scope, and Applications|journal=Macromolecules|date=12 November 2013|volume=46|issue=21|pages=8395–8405|doi=10.1021/ma401314x}}</ref> The monomer scope of CTP has been increasing since its discovery and has included poly(phenylene)s, poly(fluorine)s, poly(selenophene)s and poly(pyrrole)s.<ref name=Kiriy /><ref name="Bryan 8395–8405"/>

===Living group-transfer polymerization===
'''Group-transfer polymerization''' also has characteristics of living polymerization.<ref>''Polymer chemistry: a practical approach'' 2004 Fred J. Davis</ref> It is applied to alkylated [[methacrylate]] monomers and the initiator is a [[silyl ketene acetal]]. New monomer adds to the initiator and to the active growing chain in a [[Michael reaction]]. With each addition of a monomer group the trimethylsilyl group is transferred to the end of the chain. The active [[chain-end]] is not ionic as in anionic or cationic polymeriation but is covalent. The reaction can be catalysed by bifluorides and bioxyanions such as ''tris(dialkylamino)sulfonium bifluoride'' or ''tetrabutyl ammonium bibenzoate''. The method was discovered in 1983 by [[Owen Webster|O.W. Webster]]<ref>"Group-transfer polymerization. 1. A new concept for addition polymerization with organosilicon initiators" O. W. Webster, W. R. Hertler, D. Y. Sogah, W. B. Farnham, T. V. RajanBabu ''[[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]'', 1983, 105 (17), pp. 5706–5708 {{DOI|10.1021/ja00355a039}}</ref> and the name first suggested by [[Barry Trost]].

==Applications==
Living polymerizations can be (and in some cases are) used industrially for many different applications.  They can range from self-healing materials for space equipment to the easy design of copolymers for ion-exchange membranes in fuel cells,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Hae-Seung|author2=Roy, Abhishek |author3=Lane, Ozma |author4=Dunn, Stuart |author5= McGrath, James E. |title=Hydrophilic–hydrophobic multiblock copolymers based on poly(arylene ether sulfone) via low-temperature coupling reactions for proton exchange membrane fuel cells|journal=Polymer|date=February 2008|volume=49|issue=3|pages=715–723|doi=10.1016/j.polymer.2007.12.023}}</ref> nanoscale lithography,<ref name="In 7855–7860">{{cite journal|last=In|first=Insik|author2=La, Young-Hye |author3=Park, Sang-Min |author4=Nealey, Paul F. |author5= Gopalan, Padma |title=Side-Chain-Grafted Random Copolymer Brushes as Neutral Surfaces for Controlling the Orientation of Block Copolymer Microdomains in Thin Films|journal=Langmuir|date=August 2006|volume=22|issue=18|pages=7855–7860|doi=10.1021/la060748g}}</ref> etc..  While living polymerizations are still not widely used industrially, the field is rapidly growing, as well as the list of practical applications.

===Self-healing materials===
[[Self-healing material]]s are materials in which repair, or “heal”, themselves upon damage from an external force through the use of living polymers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wu|first=Dong Yang|author2=Meure, Sam |author3=Solomon, David |title=Self-healing polymeric materials: A review of recent developments|journal=Progress in Polymer Science|date=May 2008|volume=33|issue=5|pages=479–522|doi=10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2008.02.001}}</ref>  For example, if a crack forms in the material, it proceeds to repair the crack and restore itself to its original, undamaged form.  It achieves this by incorporating monomer-containing beads into a material made of a living polymer (with a terminally active chain).  This has been achieved recently [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/first-self-healing-polymer-created-in-spanish-lab/] using a polyurethane derivative, with beads of monomer embedded in the material that become opened upon cracking of the material.<ref name=Odriozola>{{cite journal|last=Rekondo|first=Alaitz|coauthors=Martin, Roberto; Ruiz de Luzuriaga, Alaitz; Cabañero, Germán; Grande, Hans J.; Odriozola, Ibon|title=Catalyst-free room-temperature self-healing elastomers based on aromatic disulfide metathesis|journal=Materials Horizons|year=2014|volume=1|issue=2|pages=237|doi=10.1039/c3mh00061c}}</ref>

[[File:Polymerization in situ.jpg|Polymerization in situ]]

The polymer that makes up the material is designed as a living polymer, with reactive terminal end-groups that bind to the freshly provided monomer upon damage to the microbeads.  This addition of monomer to the polymer chain increases the polymer chain to a length that fills the once open crack, in essence reconnecting all of the pieces back into one.  According to Odriozola and coworkers, this application is originally designed for space equipment (in the event of debris damaging the equipment).

===Copolymer Synthesis and Application===

[[Copolymer]]s are polymers consisting of multiple different monomer species, and can be arranged in various orders, three of which are  seen in the figure below.

[[File:Copolymer forms.png|left|300px|Various common forms of copolymers.  Here, the two different colored circles represent two different monomers.]]

While there exist others (alternating copolymers, graft copolymers, and stereoblock copolymers), these three are more common in the scientific literature.<ref name=Cowie />  In addition, block copolymers can exist as many types, including triblock (A-B-A), alternating block (A-B-A-B-A-B), etc.

Of these three types, block and gradient copolymers are commonly synthesized through living polymerizations, due to the ease of control living polymerization provides.  Copolymers are highly desired due to the increased flexibility of properties a polymer can have compared to their homopolymer counterparts.  The synthetic techniques used range from ROMP to generic anionic or cationic living polymerizations.<ref name=Cowie /><ref name=Principles />

Copolymers, due to their unique tunability of properties, can have a wide range of applications.  One example (of many) is nano-scale [http://www.nist.gov/mml/msed/electronics_materials/templatedassembly.cfm lithography] using block copolymers.  One used frequently is a block copolymer made of polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) (abbreviated PS-''b''-PMMA).  This copolymer, upon proper thermal and processing conditions, can form cylinders on the order of a few tens of nanometers in diameter of PMMA, surrounded by a PS matrix.  These cylinders can then be etched away under high exposure to UV light and acetic acid, leaving a porous PS matrix.<ref name="In 7855–7860"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Yuanjun|author2=Gong, Yanchun |author3=He, Longbin |author4=Xie, Bo |author5=Chen, Xi |author6=Han, Min |author7= Wang, Guanghou |title=Formation of periodic nanoring arrays on self-assembled PS-b-PMMA film under rapid solvent-annealing|journal=Nanoscale|year=2010|volume=2|issue=10|pages=2065|doi=10.1039/c0nr00207k}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=E.?W.|author2=Montague, M.?F. |author3=Solak, H.?H. |author4=Hawker, C.?J. |author5= Nealey, P.?F. |title=Precise Control over Molecular Dimensions of Block-Copolymer Domains Using the Interfacial Energy of Chemically Nanopatterned Substrates|journal=Advanced Materials|date=4 August 2004|volume=16|issue=15|pages=1315–1319|doi=10.1002/adma.200400763}}</ref>

The unique property of this material is that the size of the pores (or the size of the PMMA cylinders) can be easily tuned by the ratio of PS to PMMA in the synthesis of the copolymer.  This can be easily tuned due to the easy control given by living polymerization reactions, thus making this technique highly desired for various nanoscale patterning of different materials for applications to catalysis, electronics, etc.

'''Tonnage''' is a measure of the [[cargo]]-carrying capacity of a [[ship]]. The term derives from the taxation paid on ''[[Tun (unit)|tun]]s'' or casks of wine, and was later used in reference to the weight of a ship's cargo; however, in modern maritime usage, "tonnage" specifically refers to a calculation of the volume or cargo volume of a ship. Tonnage should not be confused with [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]], which refers to the actual weight of the vessel.

Measurement of tonnage can be complicated, not least because it is used to assess [[fee]]s on [[commerce|commercial]] [[shipping]].

== Tonnage measurements ==
'''[[Gross tonnage]]''' ('''GT''') is a function of the volume of all of a ship's enclosed spaces (from [[keel]] to [[funnel]]) measured to the outside of the hull framing. The numerical value for a ship's GT is always smaller than the numerical values for both its ''gross register tonnage'' and the GRT value expressed equivalently in cubic meters rather than cubic feet (for example, 0.5919 GT = 1 GRT = 2.8316&nbsp;[[cubic metre|m<sup>3</sup>]]; 200 GT = 274 GRT = 775,88&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>; 500 GT = 665 GRT = 1,883.07&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>; 3,000 GT = 3,776 GRT = 10,692.44&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>), though by how much depends on the vessel's design (volume). There is a sliding-scale factor. Gross tonnage is therefore a kind of capacity-derived index that is used to rank a ship for purposes of determining manning, safety, and other statutory requirements and is expressed simply as GT, which is a unitless entity, even though its derivation is tied to the cubic meter unit of volumetric capacity.

Tonnage measurements are now governed by an IMO Convention (International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969 (London-Rules)), which applies to all ships built after July 1982. In accordance with the convention, the correct term is now GT, which is a function of the moulded volume of all enclosed spaces of the ship.

GT is calculated by using the formula : <math>
GT = K \cdot V
</math>, where ''V'' = total volume in m<sup>3</sup> and ''K'' = a figure from 0.22 to 0.32, depending on the ship's size (calculated by : <math>
K = 0.2 + 0.02 \cdot\log_{10}V
</math>). For a ship with a total volume of 10,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>, the gross tonnage would be 0.28&nbsp;×&nbsp;10,000 = 2,800 GT. GT is consequently a measure of the overall size of the ship. For a ship with a total volume of 80,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>,the gross tonnage would be 0.2980617&nbsp;×&nbsp;80,000 = 23,844.94 GT.

'''[[Net tonnage]]''' ('''NT''') is based on a calculation of the volume of all cargo spaces of the ship. It indicates a vessel's earning space and is a function of the moulded volume of all cargo spaces of the ship.

A commonly defined measurement system is important, since a ship's registration fee, harbour dues, safety and manning rules, and the like may be based on its gross tonnage (GT) or net tonnage (NT).

'''[[Gross register tonnage]]''' ('''GRT''') represents the total internal [[volume]] of a vessel, where one register ton is equal to a volume of 100 [[cubic foot|cubic feet]] (2.83168&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>), a volume that, if filled with fresh water, would weigh around 2,800&nbsp;kg or 2.8 [[tonne]]s. The definition (and calculation) of the internal volume is complex; for instance, a ship's hold may be assessed for [[Bulk cargo|bulk grain]] (accounting for all the air space in the hold) or for [[:wikt:bale#Etymology 3|bale]]s (omitting the spaces into which bulk, but not baled cargo, would spill). If ''V'' stands for the total internal volume in m<sup>3</sup>, then the GRT equals ''V''&nbsp;/&nbsp;2.83168, so for a ship of 10,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> total internal volume, the gross register tonnage is 10,000&nbsp;/&nbsp;2.83168 = 3531.47 GRT. Gross register tonnage was replaced by ''gross tonnage'' in 1994 under the Tonnage Measurement convention of 1969, and is no longer a widely used term in the industry.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/static?dom=ontology&xml=sectionL.xml ''CWP Handbook of Fishery Statistical Standards'']. Retrieved May 10, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.imo.org/Conventions/contents.asp?topic_id=259&doc_id=685 ''International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969''], International Maritime Organisation. Retrieved May 10, 2006.</ref>

'''[[Net register tonnage]]''' ('''NRT''') is the volume of cargo the vessel can carry—that is, the gross register tonnage less the volume of spaces that do not hold [[cargo]] (e.g., [[engine]] compartment, [[Ship's wheel|helm]] station, and [[crew]] spaces, again with differences depending on which [[port]] or [[country]] does the calculations). It represents the volume of the ship available for transporting [[freight]] or [[passenger]]s. It was replaced by ''net tonnage'' in 1994, under the Tonnage Measurement convention of 1969.

The '''Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS)''' is based on ''net tonnage'', modified for Panama Canal purposes. PC/UMS is based on a mathematical formula to calculate a vessel's total volume; one PC/UMS net ton is equivalent to 100 cubic feet of capacity.<ref>[http://www.pancanal.com/eng/general/peajes-en-el-canal.html ''Panama Canal Tolls''], from the [[Panama Canal Authority]]. Retrieved May 10, 2006.</ref>

'''Suez Canal Net Tonnage (SCNT)''' is derived with a number of modifications from the former net register tonnage of the [[Moorsom System]] and was established by the International Commission of Constantinople in its Protocol of 18 December 1873. It is still in use, as amended by the ''Rules of Navigation'' of the Suez Canal Authority, and is registered in the Suez Canal Tonnage Certificate.

'''[[Thames Measurement|Thames measurement tonnage]]''' is another volumetric system, generally used for small vessels such as [[yacht]]s; it uses a formula based on the vessel's length and beam.

== Weight measurements ==
While not tonnage in the proper sense, the following methods of ship measurement are often incorrectly referred to as such:

'''Lightship or lightweight''' measures the actual weight of the ship with no [[fuel]], passengers, [[cargo]], water, and the like on board.

'''[[Deadweight tonnage]]''' (often abbreviated as '''DWT''', for deadweight tonnes) is the displacement at any loaded condition minus the lightship weight. It includes the crew, passengers, cargo, [[fuel]], water, and stores. Like displacement, it is often expressed in long tons or in metric tons.

'''[[Metric Tonnes per Centimetre Immersion|Metric tonnes per centimetre immersion]]''' (usually abbreviated to '''TPC''' or '''TPCMI''') is the number of metric tonnes (1,000 kg) that need to be loaded on the ship for the salt water [[Draft (hull)|draft]] (draught) to increase by one centimetre. The TPCMI is used to calculate the draft of the vessel with a given deadweight tonnage of cargo loaded. For a typical Panamax bulk carrier with a TPCMI of 80, the ship will sink (i.e., its draft will increase) by one centimetre for every 80 tonnes of cargo loaded. 

'''[[Imperial Tons per Inch immersion|Imperial tons per inch immersion]]''' (usually abbreviated to '''TPI''') is the number of imperial long tons (2,240 lb) that need to be loaded on a vessel for the draft to increase by one inch. Old imperial TPI measurements are still occasionally used within the United States and the Panama Canal. As no ship has been measured by a classification society since the 1950s using imperial measures, modern TPI figures are therefore a conversion from the original metric measurements and should not be relied upon to be accurate.

== Non-maritime usage of the term ''tonnage'' ==<!--linked from [[PT boat]]-->

Tonnage can refer to the quantity of a mineral or the mineral ore extracted from a mine. It may refer to the production of any commodity that is normally expressed in tons or tonnes. The term can also apply to the total weight drawn by a railway locomotive, or the total weight of freight passing over a railway line or road. 

The tonnage may be expressed in short tons (2,000 lb), metric tons or tonnes (1,000 kg), or in long tons (2,240 lb). Often this distinction is not of any importance, however sometimes it is critical to define the exact units in which the tonnage is expressed.

== Origins ==
Historically, tonnage was the tax on ''tuns'' ([[cask]]s) of [[wine]] that held 954 litres (252 gallons) of wine and weighed 1016 kilograms (2,240 [[pound (mass)|pounds]]). This suggests that the unit of weight measurement, the [[long ton]] (1,016 kg or 2,240&nbsp;lb), and tonnage share the same etymology. The confusion between weight-based terms ([[deadweight]] and [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]]) stems from this common source and the eventual decision to assess dues based on a ship's [[deadweight]] rather than counting the tuns of wine. In 1720 the [[Builder's Old Measurement]] Rule was adopted to estimate deadweight from the length of [[keel]] and maximum breadth or [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of a ship. This overly simplistic system was replaced by the [[Moorsom System]] in 1854 and calculated internal volume, not weight. This system evolved into the current set of internationally accepted rules and regulations.

When steamships came into being, they could carry less cargo, size for size, than could sailing ships. In addition to spaces taken up by boilers and steam engines, steamships carried extra fresh water for the boilers and coal for the engines. Thus, to move the same volume of cargo as a sailing ship, a steamship would be considerably larger than a sailing ship.

Harbour dues are based on tonnage. In order to prevent steamships operating at a disadvantage, various tonnage calculations were established to minimise the disadvantage presented by the extra space requirements of steamships. Rather than charging by length, displacement, or the like, charges were calculated based on the viable cargo space. As commercial cargo sailing ships are now largely extinct, gross tonnage is becoming the universal method of calculating ships' dues, and is also a more straightforward and transparent method of assessment.

'''Sir Henry Moore, 1st Baronet''' (1713 – 11 September 1769) was a [[Great Britain|British]] colonial leader who served as governor of [[Jamaica]] and as royal Governor of [[Province of New York]] from 1765 to 1769.

==Early life==
Moore was born in [[Jamaica]] to a prominent plantation family, and was educated toward the law.  Moore was active in Jamaica's colonial affairs, and by 1756 he had risen to the rank of Governor.  As in many royal colonies of the time, the governor was frequently absent, collecting his fees and salary from London, with a local Lieutenant and council forming the actual government.  Moore gained considerable reputation for leadership by suppressing a slave revolt during his first year in office.

==Career in New York==
Moore's reward for good performance as Jamaica's governor was first to be made a [[Baronet]], and then in 1764 he was named royal governor for New York.  He arrived in [[New York City]] with his family in November 1765.  Relations between the colonies and England were strained by this time, but not yet in open rebellion.  New York City had seen riots and protests over the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]].  The new governor calmed these by meeting directly with [[Isaac Sears]], a leader of the [[Sons of Liberty]].  Moore agreed with Sears and the colony's assembly to suppress the Stamp Act, and gained additional goodwill by reducing military fortifications within the city.  His openness and courtesy earned him floral tributes while other colonial governors were being burned in effigy.

However, during the next few years, he actively used military force to suppress rural riots by tenants of the large estate owners.  He ordered General [[Thomas Gage]] to actively pursue and suppress this form of rebellion.  This did not seem to bring him any increased difficulty in governing, for two reasons: that the Sons of Liberty also feared the introduction of rural problems into the city, believing that they should be the only ones to use riots as a bargaining tactic; and that the assembly at the time was dominated by the patroons, or large estate owners.
In December 1767 Moore even dissolved the assembly to allow the patroons to make up through new elections some of the numbers they had lost earlier.

==Death==
Moore died suddenly while in office at New York City in 1769.  The duties of governor then fell on Lieutenant Governor [[Cadwallader Colden]], whose term was much less peaceful.  Moore left with the respect of almost all the colony's leadership, the only exception being certain religious fundamentalists angered by his efforts to create a theatre or playhouse.

==Personal==
Moore married Catherine Maria Long, member of another prominent Jamaica family, in 1765.  They had several children, and after Henry's death, Catherine moved to England.  Catherine's Peak ''(altitude 1158 meters)'' in Jamaica is named after her, as local legend reports her to be the first woman to climb the peak.

'''Norma Jean Lollis Hill''' (February 11, 1931 – November 7, 2000) was an eyewitness to the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], on November 22, 1963.<ref name="CNN, November 9, 2000">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title='Lady in Red' JFK assassination witness dies at 69 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/US/11/09/kennedy.hill.reut/ |newspaper=CNN.com |location= |publisher= |agency=Reuters |date=November 9, 2000 |accessdate=July 20, 2014}}</ref><ref name="DeShong">{{cite news |last=DeShong |first=Rae D. |date=November 10, 2000 |title=Eyewitness to JFK assassination |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=20001110&id=3rNRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iG8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6745,7390659 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post Gazette |location= |publisher= |agency= |page=C14 |accessdate=July 20, 2014}} Syndicated from the ''Dallas Morning News''.<!-- Originally published November 9, 2000, p. 35A. --></ref> Hill was known as the "Lady in Red" because of the long red raincoat she wore that day, as seen in [[Zapruder film|Abraham Zapruder's film of the assassination]].<ref name="CNN, November 9, 2000"/><ref name="DeShong"/> A teacher by profession, she was a consultant for [[Oliver Stone]]'s 1991 film ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' and co-wrote ''JFK: The Last Dissenting Witness'' with Bill Sloan.<ref name="CNN, November 9, 2000"/><ref name="DeShong"/>

Many of Hill's claims have been both disputed and embraced. While official sources have considered her an unreliable witness for a number of legitimate reasons, other researchers investigating the assassination and the conclusions of the [[Warren Commission]] consider her a highly credible witness. Critics point to her statement that she saw [[Jack Ruby]], the killer of  assassin [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], at the scene of the assassination in [[Dealey Plaza]] when other witnesses placed him in the offices of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' at the time. Others point to significant circumstantial evidence of an apparent smear campaign to undermine the testimony and credibility of Hill, the closest civilian witness to the assassination and its immediate aftermath.

Jean Hill was a consistent critic of the official report of the [[Warren Commission]] since its release and in 1992 she co-wrote a book entitled ''The Last Dissenting Witness''. In this book she made the assertion that her reported testimony before the Warren Commission was fabricated by the commission, a claim also made by others about Warren Commission testimony.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Groden|first1=Robert J.|last2=Livingstone|first2=Harrison Edward |title=High Treason: The Assassination Of President John F.

==Background and early life==

Hill was born and raised in Ferguson, Oklahoma. After her parents divorced in 1943, she moved with her father to [[Wewoka, Oklahoma]] where she later graduated from Wewoka High School. Upon graduation, Hill enrolled at [[Oklahoma Baptist University]]. She dropped out after two years after marrying Bill Hill.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sloan|first1=Bill|last2=Hill|first2=Jean|title=JFK: The Last Dissenting Witness|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=1-455-60670-7|pages=48–49}}</ref> The couple had two children, Jeanne and Billy.<ref name="CNN, November 9, 2000"/> Hill eventually returned to college and earned a degree in elementary education in 1955. Hill worked as a teacher in [[Oklahoma City]] until 1962 when the family moved to Dallas for Bill Hill's job at Science Research Associates.<ref>Sloan p.49</ref>

Shortly after moving to Dallas, Hill and her husband separated. To support herself and her children, Hill got a job as a teacher with the [[Dallas Independent School District|Dallas public school system]].<ref> Sloan p.93</ref> Jean and Bill Hill's divorce was finalized in August 1964.<ref>Sloan p.143</ref>

==Eyewitness to the assassination of John F. Kennedy==
[[Image:hill and moorman.png|thumb|200px|right|Jean Hill (left) and [[Mary Moorman]] (right) as captured in Frame 298 of the [[Zapruder film]], just less than one second before the fatal head shot.]]

Hill was present along with her friend [[Mary Moorman]] across from the [[grassy knoll]], and was one of the very nearest witnesses to President Kennedy when the shots were fired at him. Moorman can be seen in the Zapruder film taking pictures, which Hill stated were later taken and bleached out by unknown parties. At Zapruder frame 313, when Kennedy was shot in the head, Hill was only 21 feet (6.4 m) away, leftward, and slightly behind him. In her Warren Commission testimony, she stated that a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent told her right after the attack that another Secret Service agent, watching from the courthouse, saw a bullet strike "at my feet" and kick up debris. Hill was also one of several witnesses who stated that at the end of the assassination they saw smoke lingering near the grassy knoll picket fence corner.

She testified to the [[Warren Commission]] that after the assassination she watched a man running from near the [[Texas School Book Depository]] toward the picket fence area. After watching this man, Hill crossed the street and was one of many witnesses and authorities who first ran toward the grassy knoll after the shots ended.

:"Mrs. Jean L. Hill stated that after the firing stopped she saw a white man wearing a brown overcoat and a hat running west away from the Depository Building in the direction of the railroad tracks. She has since stated when she saw a photo of Jack Ruby after his killing of Lee Harvey Oswald she now believes he was the man she saw running. You can see in the Zapruder film that she was clearly looking into the direction of the Texas School Book Depository while the president is right in front of her which appears to support her story of looking at someone running just after the assassination. There are no other witnesses who claim to have seen a man running toward the railroad tracks. Examination of all the available films of the area following the shooting, reexamination of the interviews with individuals in the vicinity of the shooting, and the interviews with members of the Dallas police department and the Dallas Country sheriff's office failed to corroborate Mrs. Hill's recollection or to reveal the identity of the man described by Mrs. Hill".<ref>The President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy Report, p. 640</ref>

Hill stated that she received death threats and that the brake lines of her automobile were cut after the assassination. Hill apparently always thought of herself as a survivor after many of the other witnesses to the assassination died shortly after President Kennedy's death under what some considered to be mysterious circumstances. The assertions of the mysterious deaths connected with the assassination became a much more well known part of the popular conspiracy debate after appearing in the [[epilogue]] of the film ''[[Executive Action (film)|Executive Action]]'', which purports to show how a conspiracy ''could'' have been carried out. The film's epilogue states that "of 18 witnesses: all but two of whom died from unnatural causes within three years of the assassination". A [[voice-over]] then says that "an [[actuary]] of the British newspaper ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' calculated the probability that all these people who witnessed the assassination would die within that period of time to be 100,000 trillion to one".<ref>''Executive Action'' script, Wakeford/Orloff Productions and National General Pictures, Dalton Trumbo, Donald Freed (story) and Mark Lane (story) screenwriters</ref>

There were significant problems with the film's actuarial assertions, which were completely inaccurate due to an error in communication. This  inaccurate information has sometimes been used over the years since to argue for a conspiracy despite being refuted by the editor of the very newspaper that produced them. The number given in ''The Sunday Times'' article on February 26, 1967 was in fact ''100,000 trillion'' to one, and the editor of the newspaper told the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] in 1978 that the article was "based on a careless journalistic mistake and ''should not have been published'' - that the odds would have been ''much lower''." <ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol4/html/HSCA_Vol4_0234a.htm HSCA Hearings], vol. 4, p. 463–465. Robert M. Musen, vice president and senior actuary at [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company]], estimated that the odds of 15 people out of 2,479 in the Warren Commission index dying within a three-year period, assuming a median age of 40, would be 98.16 percent, or one out of 1.2. Assuming a median age of 35, the number would be 57.09 percent, or one out of 1.75. [[Vincent Bugliosi]], ''Reclaiming History'' (2007), p. 1013–14.</ref>

Jean Hill adamantly refuted the Warren Commission's single gunman findings and was sure, based on what she saw the day of the assassination and on her experience afterward, that there was a conspiracy. In this a large majority of Americans agree with her according to [[Gallup Poll|Gallup Research]].<ref name="gallup.com">[http://www.gallup.com/poll/165893/majority-believe-jfk-killed-conspiracy.aspx ''Majority in U.S. Still Believe JFK Killed in a Conspiracy: Mafia, federal government top list of potential conspirators''] Gallup Poll published November 15, 2013</ref> 61% of the American public in 2013 believed that "others besides Lee Harvey Oswald were involved" in the assassination.<ref name="gallup.com"/> The same poll also found however that the 61% figure "is the lowest found in nearly 50 years" of Gallup polling on the question.<ref name="gallup.com"/>

According to Gary Mack, curator of the [[Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza]], changes in Hill's story over time led some researchers of the Kennedy assassination to consider Hill a "controversial witness".<ref name="DeShong"/> Others argue that "information was suppressed in order to discredit Hill as a reliable witness"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKhillJ.htm|title=Jean Hill|last=Simkin|first=John|date=September 1997|publisher=spartacus-educational.com|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}</ref> and that her testimony was both reliable and that "the strong patriotic convictions that bound Jean Hill to defy the official report of the Warren Commission",<ref name="Roman History pages 66-67">{{cite book|last=Pagán|first=Victoria Emma|title=Conspiracy Narratives in Roman History|year=2004|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=0-292-70561-1|pages=67–69}}</ref> and the fact that "she received no compensation, and a lifetime of woe"<ref>Pagán 2004 p.67</ref> add significant credibility to her testimony and also at the same time call into deeper question the conduct of some officials on the day of the assassination and in the investigation that followed. The controversy over Hill's testimony continues as a part of the larger debate and ongoing research into the Kennedy assassination.

==Later life and death==
Hill was reported to have avoided publicity for nearly 25 years after testifying to the Warren Commission.<ref name="CNN, November 9, 2000"/><ref name="DeShong"/> She continued working for the Dallas Public School System until her retirement a few years before death.<ref name="DeShong"/>

She worked as a consultant for Oliver Stone's 1991 film ''JFK'',<ref name="CNN, November 9, 2000"/><ref name="DeShong"/> and was portrayed in the movie by [[JFK (film)|Ellen McElduff]]. In 1992, Hill and Dallas journalist Bill Sloan released ''"JFK: The Last Dissenting Witness"''.<ref name="CNN, November 9, 2000"/><ref name="DeShong"/><ref name="Publishers Weekly">{{cite web|title=JFK |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-88289-922-0|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=July 20, 2014|author=Publishers Weekly|authorlink=Publishers Weekly|date=March 1, 1992}}</ref> Stone wrote the foreword for the book.<ref name="Publishers Weekly"/> ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said ''The Last Dissenting Witness'' "was often engaging, sometimes infuriating" and that Hill's "story is salutary for those overly respectful of official authority."<ref name="Publishers Weekly"/> This view was also held by other authors.<ref name="Roman History pages 66-67"/> Hill spoke to various groups about her experience of the Kennedy Assassination and its controversial aftermath during the last few years of her life.<ref name="CNN, November 9, 2000"/><ref name="DeShong"/>

==History==
[[File:Australian Census 2011 demographic map - Australia by SLA - BCP field 1078 English Total Responses.svg|thumb|right|400px|Australian Census 2011 demographic map – Australia by SLA – BCP field 1078 English Total Responses]]

From the beginning of the [[History of Australia (1788-1850)|colonial era]] until the mid-20th century, the vast majority of settlers to Australia were from the [[British Isles]], with the English being the dominant group, followed by the Irish and Scottish. Among the leading ancestries, increases in Australian, Irish, and German ancestries and decreases in English, Scottish, and Welsh ancestries appear to reflect such shifts in perception or reporting. These reporting shifts at least partly resulted from changes in the design of the census question, in particular the introduction of a tick box format in 2001.<ref>http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/af5129cb50e07099ca2570eb0082e462!OpenDocument Australia Bureau of Statistics</ref>

Until 1859, 2.2 million (73%) of the free settlers who immigrated were British.<ref>[http://www.ancestryeurope.lu/press/press-releases/uk/2008/06/historical-records-reveal-oz-ancestors-of-16-million-brits/ HISTORICAL RECORDS REVEAL OZ ANCESTORS OF 16 MILLION BRITS]</ref>

Between 1987 and 1999, the [[Anglo-Celtic]] component of Australia's population declined from 75 per cent to 70 per cent.<ref>Khoo, Siew-An, Peter McDonald, and Siew-Ean Khoo, eds. The Transformation of Australia's Population: 1970-2030. UNSW Press, 2003, p. 165.</ref> In 1999, the Anglo-Celtic share of the Australian population was calculated as 69.9%.<ref>[http://elecpress.monash.edu.au/pnp/free/pnpv7n4/v7n4_3price.pdf]</ref>

A 1996 study of the ethnic origins of the Australian people shows:<ref>{{citation | last=Jupp | first=James | year=2001 | title=The Australian people: an encyclopedia of the nation, its people and their origins | edition=2 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=978-0-521-80789-0|page=83-85}}</ref>
*12,438,600 people had [[English Australian|English]] origins.
*5,454,200 people had [[Irish Australian|Irish]] origins.
*5,393,800 people had [[Scottish Australian|Scottish]] origins.
*768,100 people had [[Cornish Australian|Cornish]] origins.
*727,800 people had [[Welsh Australian|Welsh]] origins.
*46,600 people had [[Manx Australian|Manx]] origins.

Just over three-quarters of the Australian ancestry group stated no other ancestries. Among the 24% who did report another ancestry, the ancestries most commonly stated were English (reported by 13% of the total Australian ancestry group), Irish (3%), Scottish (1%), German (1%) and Italian (1%). The number of people reporting Australian ancestry in 2001 was almost double the 3.4 million (24% of the population) who gave Australian as their ancestry in the 1986 Census. This reflected a shift to reporting Australian ancestry among Australian-born people with Australian-born parents. Among these people, the proportion stating Australian ancestry increased from 33% to 56%, making this the group most likely to state Australian ancestry in 2001. There was also a substantial increase in reporting of Australian ancestry among Australian-born people with one parent born in Australia and one born overseas. Of this group, 33% stated Australian ancestry in 1986 and 49% in 2001. The explicit inclusion of Australian as an ancestry response in the 2001 Census (through its inclusion among the tick box answers) seems likely to have influenced this change. However, a real change in cultural affiliations may also have contributed. Compared with 1986, some people may have placed more value or relevance on their Australian affiliations and less on historic ties to England.<ref>http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/af5129cb50e07099ca2570eb0082e462!OpenDocument Australia Bureau of Statistics</ref>

==Demography==
Anglo-Celtic is not a category in the Australian census. At the 2006 [[Census of Australia]]<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/636F496B2B943F12CA2573D200109DA9?opendocument 1301.0 – Year Book Australia, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> respondents could nominate up to two ancestries (although 65% of respondents nominated just one).  Out of a total of 19,855,288 responses, 6,283,647 (31.6%) responses indicated English ancestry, 1,803,740 (9.1%) indicated Irish ancestry, 1,501,204 (7.6%) indicated Scottish ancestry, 113,242 (0.7%) indicated Welsh ancestry, 1,864 (0.01%) indicated Manx ancestry, and 5,686 (0.3%) indicated British ancestry.<ref>[20680-Ancestry (full classification list) by Sex – Australia http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/download?format=xls&collection=Census&period=2006&productlabel=Ancestry (full classification list) by Sex&producttype=Census Tables&method=Place of Usual Residence&areacode=0]</ref>

The United Kingdom remains the leading source of immigrants to Australia. In 2005–06 22,143 persons born in the United Kingdom settled in Australia, representing 21.4% of all migrants. At the 2006 Census (excluding overseas visitors)<ref>[20680-Country of Birth of Person (minor groups) by Sex – Australia http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/download?format=xls&collection=Census&period=2006&productlabel=Country of Birth of Person (minor groups) by Sex&producttype=Census Tables&method=Place of Usual Residence&areacode=0]</ref> 1,038,165 persons identified themselves as having been born in the United Kingdom (5.2% of the Australian population), while 50,251 identified themselves as Irish born.

The Anglo-Celtic element in the population is expected to drop to 62 percent by 2025.<ref>B. Yeoh, M. Charney, T. Kiong, Approaching Transnationalisms: Studies on Transnational Societies, Multicultural Contacts, and Imaginings of Home, 2003, p. 108</ref>

Tasmania could have the nation's highest proportion of citizens of Anglo-Celtic origin, possibly as high as 85 percent. On the evidence of statistics of ethnic derivation Tasmania could also be considered more British than New Zealand (where the Anglo-Celtic majority has fallen below 75 percent).<ref>[http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/B/Britishness.htm Britishness – University of Tasmania]</ref>

==Controversy and criticism==
Some have argued that the term is entirely a product of [[multiculturalism]]. For example, historian [[John Hirst (historian)|John Hirst]] wrote in 1994: "Mainstream Australian society was reduced to an ethnic group and given an ethnic name: Anglo-Celt."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22482184-7583,00.html | work=The Australian | title=Multiculturalism becomes poison for social capital | date=26 September 2007}}</ref> 

According to Hirst:

<blockquote>In the eyes of multiculturalists, Australian society of the 1940s, 150 years after first settlement, is adequately described as Anglo-Celtic. At least this acknowledges that the people of Australia were Irish and Scots as well as English, but it has nothing more substantial than a hyphen joining them. In fact a distinct new culture had been formed. English, Scots and Irish had formed a common identity - first of all British and then gradually Australian as well. In the 1930s the historian [[Keith Hancock|W.K. Hancock]] could aptly describe them as Independent Australian Britons.<ref name="Hirst">John Hirst, ''Sense and Nonsense in Australian History'', Black Inc. Agenda, Melbourne (ISBN 978-0-9775949-3-1), page 12</ref></blockquote>

The Australian journalist Siobhan McHugh has argued that the term "Anglo-Celtic" is "an insidious distortion of our past and a galling denial of the struggle by an earlier minority group", [[Irish Australian]]s, "against oppression and demonisation... In what we now cosily term "Anglo-Celtic" Australia, a virtual social [[apartheid]] existed at times between [Irish] Catholics and [British] Protestants", which did not end until the 1960s.

The term was also criticised by the historian [[Patrick O'Farrell]] as  "a grossly misleading, false, and patronising convenience, one crassly present-oriented. Its use removes from consciousness and recognition a major conflict fundamental to any comprehension not only of Australian history but of our present core culture."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/how-the-irish-rose-above-australias-social-apartheid-20091014-gvyg.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=How the Irish rose above Australia's social apartheid – The Sydney Morning Herald | date=14 October 2009}}</ref>

==Culture==
In 1967, British migrants in Australia formed an association to represent their special interests: the United Kingdom Settlers' Association, which subsequently became the [http://britishaustraliancommunity.com/wp/ British Australian Community].

'''Volker Schlöndorff''' (born 31 March 1939) is a [[Berlin]]-based [[Germany|German]] filmmaker who has worked in Germany, France and the United States. He was a prominent member of the [[New German Cinema]] of the late 1960s and early 1970s, which also included [[Werner Herzog]], [[Wim Wenders]] and [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]].

He won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] as well as the [[Palme d'or]] at the [[1979 Cannes Film Festival]] for ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]'' (1979), the film version of the novel by [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[Günter Grass]].<ref>[http://www.egs.edu/faculty/volker-schloendorff/biography/ Volker Schlöndorff] at [[European Graduate School]]. Biography and bibliography. (Retrieved May 14, 2010)</ref>

==Early life==
Volker Schlöndorff was born in [[Wiesbaden]], [[Germany]] to the physician Dr. Georg Schlöndorff. In 1956 his family moved to [[Paris]], where Schlöndorff won awards at school for his work in philosophy. He graduated in political science at the [[Sorbonne]], while at the same time studying film at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Cinematographiques, where he met [[Louis Malle]]. Malle gave him his first job as his assistant director on ''[[Zazie in the Metro (film)|Zazie in the Metro]]'', which continued with the films ''[[A Very Private Affair]]'', ''[[The Fire Within]]'' and ''[[Viva Maria!]]''. Schlöndorff also worked as assistant director on [[Alain Resnais]]'s ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]'' and [[Jean-Pierre Melville]]'s ''[[Léon Morin, Priest]]''. During this time he also made his first short film, ''[[Wen kummert's|Who Cares?]]'' about French people living in [[Frankfurt]] in 1960. In 1963 he collaborated with filmmaker [[Jean-Daniel Pollet]] on the 40 minute documentary ''[[Méditerranée (1963 film)|Méditerranée]]''. The film has been highly regarded since its initial release, gaining praise from [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and consistently appearing in the popular book ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]''.

==Early film career==
Schlöndorff returned to Germany to make his feature film debut ''[[Der junge Törless|Young Törless]]''. Produced by Louis Malle and based on the famous novel ''[[The Confusions of Young Törless]]'' by [[Robert Musil]], the film debuted at the [[1966 Cannes Film Festival]]. Taking place at a semi-military Austrian boarding school, Törless witnesses the bullying of a fellow student but does nothing to prevent it despite his superior and mature intellect. He gradually begins to accept his personal responsibility for the abuse by doing nothing to stop it and runs away from the school. The comparison to pre-war Germany were obvious and the film was highly praised upon release, winning the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI Prize]] at Cannes.<ref name="Wakeman">Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 2. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1988. 983-987.</ref>

The [[New German Cinema]] movement unofficially began in 1962 with the [[Oberhausen Manifesto]], calling new young German filmmakers to revitalize filmmaking in Germany, much like the [[French New Wave]] and [[British New Wave]] of the previous few years. Although not among the initial group of filmmakers involved, Schlöndorff was quick to align himself with the group and ''[[Der junge Törless|Young Törless]]'' is considered one of the most important films of the [[New German Cinema]].

Schlöndorff's next film was ''[[A Degree of Murder]]'', a counter-culture saturated film with a musical score by [[Rolling Stones]] guitarist [[Brian Jones]]. The film stars Jones' then girlfriend (and later [[Keith Richards]] wife) [[Anita Pallenberg]] as a young waitress who accidentally kills her boyfriend and hides the body with the help of two male friends. The film was very popular upon release amongst "swinging sixties" youths.<ref name="Wakeman"/>

He then made another film that spoke to the counter culture generation, ''[[Michael Kohlhaas - Der Rebell]]''. Set in medieval Germany, Michael Kohlhaas is a horse trader who has been cheated by a local nobleman and nearly starts a revolution to get revenge. The film starred [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]], [[Anna Karina]] and [[Anita Pallenberg]] and was made in both German and English versions.<ref name="Wakeman"/>

Schlöndorff then adapted [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s first play [[Baal (1970 TV Movie)|Baal]] for television and cast an actor named [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] in the lead role, along with [[Margarethe von Trotta]], whom Schlöndorff would marry the following year. Schlöndorff adapted the story of a self-destructive poet to modern day Munich and the film was shown on German TV in 1970. He then made another TV movie ''[[Sudden Wealth of the Poor People of Kombach]]'', again starring Fassbinder. The film depicts 7 peasants in 19th Century Germany who rob the local tax collection cart but are so conditioned by their poverty that they cannot handle their newfound wealth.<ref name="Wakeman"/>

''[[The Morals of Ruth Halbfass]]'' examined a group of people who have lost their sense of morals and co-starred von Trotta. Von Trotta would both star in and co-write Schlöndorff's next film, ''[[A Free Woman]]''. The film took a feminist look at the condition of modern women in Munich. von Trotta portrays Elizabeth Junker, a recently divorced woman who must struggle to live her life independently as her husband has everything come easily to him, including the villa and son that they had shared together as a married couple. The film is loosely based on von Trotta's experiences with her divorce from her first husband.<ref name="Wakeman"/>

Schlöndorff then completed the TV movie ''[[Übernachtung in Tirol]]'' in 1974, an adaptation of the [[Henry James]] short story ''Les raisons de Georgina'' for German TV and directed his first opera in Frankfurt, a production of [[Leoš Janá?ek]]'s ''[[Ká?a Kabanová]]'' in 1974.

==International success as a filmmaker==
Schlöndorff (and the New German Cinema movement as a whole) had his first financial hit film with ''[[The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum (film)|The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum]]'' in 1975. Based on the [[The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum|novel]] of the same name by [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel Prize]] winning German author [[Heinrich Böll]], Schlöndorff both co-wrote and co-directed the film with [[Margarethe von Trotta]] in her directorial debut. The film stars [[Angela Winkler]] as Blum, who after falling in love and spending the night with a young army deserter becomes the victim of a corrupt police investigation and predatory tabloid newspaper, which cast her as both a terrorist and a prostitute. The newspaper is based upon the real right-wing German tabloid ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'', whose publisher [[Axel Springer]] was the inspiration for the character Werner Tötges.

West Germany was in a political hysteria over the activities of the terrorist group the [[Red Army Faction]], and the police and journalistic activities depicted in both the book and the film accurately portrayed that era as reminiscent of [[McCarthyism]] in 1950s USA, including illegal police raids, phone tapping and tabloid smears. Böll himself was heavily attacked after the books publication, but both the novel and the film were hugely successful in West Germany.<ref name="Wakeman"/>

After directing his second opera ''[[We Come to the River]]'' in 1976, Schlöndorff followed ''The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum'' with the equally political ''[[Coup de Grâce (1976 film)|Coup de Grâce]]'' in 1976. Based on a novel by French author [[Marguerite Yourcenar]], the film stars von Trotta (who again co-wrote the script) as Sophie von Reval, a young left-wing aristocrat who sides with the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] after being rejected by a young German soldier preparing to fight the Red Army in 1919. The film depicts the same time period and subject matter that von Trotta would later revisit in the film ''[[Rosa Luxemburg (film)|Rosa Luxemburg]]''.

A supporting actress in ''[[Coup de Grâce (1976 film)|Coup de Grâce]]'' was Valeska Gert, a former cabaret dancer, circus performer and silent film actress who had worked with [[Greta Garbo]] and [[G. W. Pabst]]. This led to the documentary about her life ''[[Just for Fun, Just for Play]]'' in 1977.

Schlöndorff then contributed to the omnibus film ''[[Germany in Autumn]]'', in which nine German filmmakers (including [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], [[Alexander Kluge]], [[Edgar Reitz]] and author [[Heinrich Böll]]) made short films depicting the hysteria and political chaos in west Germany the [[German Autumn]] of 1977.<ref name="Wakeman"/>

Schlöndorff's next film was the most successful and ambitious of his career, and perhaps the most important film of post-war Germany: ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]'', released in 1979. The film was based on the [[The Tin Drum|novel]] by [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel Prize]] winning author [[Günter Grass]], who for years had rejected proposed adaptations of his book until giving Schlöndorff his approval (and assistance) to make the film.<ref name="Wakeman"/>

''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]'' stars [[David Bennent]] as the protagonist Oscar Matzerath, who, after receiving a tin drum on his third birthday, makes the conscious choice to stop growing and remain a three-year-old for the rest of his life. He hurls himself down a flight of stairs so as to give the adults around him a rational explanation for his handicap, and later discovers that he has the ability to tactically shatter glass with the power of his high-pitch scream, which he evokes whenever anyone attempts to take his tin drum away from him. The film co-stars [[Angela Winkler]] as Oscar's mother and [[Mario Adorf]] and [[Daniel Olbrychski]] as the German and [[Kashubians|Kashubian]] (Pole) who may both be his biological fathers. The film mostly takes place from the end of [[World War I]] to the end of [[World War II]] (when Oscar is 20) in the city of [[Danzig]], [[Poland]]. Danzig is most famous for being the site of the first battle of the war at the polish [[Defense of the Polish Post Office in Danzig|Post Office]], which Oscar takes part in.

The film was widely hailed as a masterpiece<ref name="Wakeman"/> and shared the [[Palme d'or]] at the [[1979 Cannes Film Festival]] with ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', as well as winning the 1979 [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]].

In 1980 Schlöndorff collaborated with [[Stefan Aust]], [[Alexander Kluge]] and Alexander von Eschwege on the documentary ''[[The Candidate (1980 film)|The Candidate]]'', a film about the political campaign of arch-conservative [[Franz Josef Strauss]].

Schlöndorff next made ''[[Die Fälschung|The Circle of Deceit]]'' in 1981. Based on the novel by [[Nicolas Born]], the film concerns the politics and moral struggles of war photographers. The film stars [[Bruno Ganz]] and [[Jerzy Skolimowski]] as photojournalists covering the [[Lebanon Civil War]] in Beirut in 1975.

== Hollywood and later career ==
Schlöndorff's first English language film was ''[[Swann in Love (film)|Swann in Love]]'', an adaptation of the first two volumes of [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''. The film was shot in France and financed by [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]], and stars [[Jeremy Irons]], [[Ornella Muti]], [[Alain Delon]] and [[Fanny Ardant]].

Schlöndorff then went to the United States to make a TV adaptation of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[Death of a Salesman (1985 film)|Death of a Salesman]]'', starring [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Willy Loman]] and [[John Malkovich]] as Biff. Both actors won [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy]]'s for their performances and Schlöndorff was nominated for an Emmy for his direction. The film premiered on Television in 1985 and was released theatrically throughout Europe over the following years.

Schlöndorff followed this with another TV Movie in the US, ''[[A Gathering of Old Men (film)|A Gathering of Old Men]]'', based on the [[A Gathering of Old Men|novel of the same name]] by [[Ernest J. Gaines]]. The film stars [[Richard Widmark]], [[Holly Hunter]] and [[Louis Gossett, Jr.|Lou Gossett Jr.]] and concerns [[racism#Racial discrimination|racial discrimination]] in 1970s Louisiana.

Schlöndorff returned to theatrical films with the Hollywood science fiction film ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (film)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'' in 1990. The film's story takes place in a dystopia near future where most women are sterile due to pollution. Kate ([[Natasha Richardson]]) is arrested after attempting to flee to Canada and forced to become a "Handmaid". Handmaids are fertile women who are enslaved by the state and put in the households of wealthy men - who have "ceremonial" sex with them in the hope of conceiving a child. She becomes the Handmaid of the Commander ([[Robert Duvall]]), Fred, who is married to Serena Joy ([[Faye Dunaway]]). To save herself from execution, Kate - renamed "Offred," since she now is attached to Fred's household - allows the Commander's driver ([[Aidan Quinn]]) to impregnate her and falls in love with him. The film was in competition at the [[40th Berlin International Film Festival]].

This was quickly followed by ''[[Voyager (film)|Voyager]]'' in 1991. The film stars [[Sam Shepard]] as a man who survives a plane crash, then finds the love of his life ([[Julie Delpy]]) on his next trip and begins to question the rationale of his good luck after having spent most of his life being cruel to others. The film was based on the novel ''[[Homo Faber (film)|Homo Faber]]'' by [[Max Frisch]] and was not a success financially.

In 1992 he directed the concert film ''[[The Michael Nyman Songbook]]'', then made the first of his two documentaries on famous director [[Billy Wilder]], ''[[Billy Wilder, How Did You Do It?]]'', in which he and German critic Hellmut Karasek interviewed Wilder about his career over the course of two weeks in 1988. It was aired on German TV in 1992, and shown on [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] in the USA under the title ''Billy Wilder Speaks'' in 2006. Schlöndorff had been a great admirer of Wilder for many years and sought his advice during the making of ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]''

Appalled at plans of destroying the historic film studios [[Potsdam-Babelsberg|Babelsberg]], Schlöndorff mounted a one-man campaign to save them in the early 1990s.<ref name="articles.latimes.com">Mary Williams Walsh (September 22, 1996), [http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-22/entertainment/ca-46386_1_studio-babelsberg The Savior of Babelsberg (Well, Almost)] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> He served as the chief executive for the [[Universum Film AG|UFA]] studio in Babelsberg between 1992 and 1997.<ref name="articles.latimes.com"/> During that time, he helped [[Jiang Wen]] finish editing his 1994 film ''[[In the Heat of the Sun]]'' at in Germany, with the studio’s full financial support. He also helped to get the film selected for the [[51st Venice International Film Festival]].<ref>Edward Wong (October 16, 2013), [http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/cinema-heavyweights-open-german-film-festival/ Cinema Heavyweights Open German Film Festival] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

In 1996 he contributed to the French TV series ''[[Lumière sur un massacre]]'' with the episode "Le parfait soldat".

Schlöndorff returned to Germany in 1996 to make ''[[The Ogre (1996 film)|The Ogre]]'', his most well regarded feature film since ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]''. Based on a novel by [[Michel Tournier]] and starring [[John Malkovich]] as the titular Abel Tiffauges, the film revisited many of the themes and time period of ''The Tin Drum''. Tiffauges is a slow-witted French soldier who has been accused of child molestation. After being captured by the Nazis and put in an internment camp, he is made a servant at an elite German training camp and kidnaps local children, officially as a way to recruit them for the camp, but in his mind to protect them. The film was screened in competition at the [[1996 Venice Film Festival]] and won the UNICEF award. The film was released in Germany in 1996 and gained positive reviews. On the audio commentary for ''The Tin Drum'', Schlöndorff said that he had wanted to film a sequel to ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]'', as the film was based only on the first two thirds of the novel. But because actor David Bennent was too old to reprise the role and he did not want to recast Oscar, he considers ''[[The Ogre (1996 film)|The Ogre]]'' to be an unofficial sequel to his masterpiece.

Schlöndorff returned to Hollywood for the [[Neo-noir]] ''[[Palmetto (film)|Palmetto]]'' in 1998. In a classic noir plot, the film stars [[Woody Harrelson]] as a falsely accused journalist who was sent to jail after uncovering corruption in the local government. After getting out of jail and unable to find work, he encounters Rhea Malroux ([[Elisabeth Shue]]), a [[femme fatale]] who propositions him to help her extort money from her millionaire husband. The film was not a financial success and has so far been Schlöndorff's last film in the US.

Schlöndorff returned to Germany to make the 2000 film ''[[The Legend of Rita]]''. Loosely based upon the lives of members of the [[Red Army Faction]] who exiled to East Germany in the 1970s, the film centers around Rita, who most closely resembles real RAF member Inge Viett. Rita abandons the revolution and live in East Germany under protection of the secret service, but much risk discovery and consequences for her past crimes after German unification.

After the documentary ''[[Ein Produzent hat Seele oder er hat keine]]'' and a contribution to the [[anthology film|omnibus film]] ''[[Ten Minutes Older]]'' (both in 2002), Schlöndorff made ''[[The Ninth Day]]'' in 2004. The film is Schlöndorff's third film to center around the [[World War II]] and is based on the diary of [[Father Jean Bernard]]. [[Ulrich Matthes]] plays Father Henri Kremer, a Catholic Priest who is interned at [[Dachau concentration camp]] during the second World War. He is inexplicably released for 9 days and sent to Luxembourg. There he meets a young SS Soldier who informs him that his mission there is to convince the local bishop to cooperate with the Nazi Party, in which case he will not be sent back to Dachau. He is thus faced with the moral dilemma of betraying his faith or returning to the concentration camp.

Schlöndorff then completed the TV Movie ''[[Enigma - Eine uneingestandene Liebe]]'' in 2005. In 2006 he returned to the city of Danzig to film ''[[Strike (2006 film)|Strike]]'', a docudrama about labor strikes at the [[Gda?sk Shipyard]] during the [[Polish 1970 protests]], and itself is a history of the [[Solidarity Movement]] in Poland leading up to the Fall of Communism.

Schlöndorff's ''[[Ulzhan]]'' (2007) stars [[Philippe Torreton]] as a treasure hunter on his way home who has lost his soul and Ayanat Ksenbai as Ulzhan, the woman who falls in love with him. [[David Bennent]] also co-starred. In the summer of 2012, he worked with Andrew Turner, who had formerly been a runway model for the late [[Alexander McQueen]]. Schlöndorffs [[World War II]]-era film ''Diplomacy'', dedicated to his friend [[Richard C. Holbrooke]] debuted at the [[64th Berlin International Film Festival]]. Set in 1944, it explores how the Swedish consul general in Paris, [[Raoul Nordling]], helped persuade the Nazi military governor of Paris, [[Dietrich von Choltitz]], not to obey Hitler’s orders to destroy the historic city should it fall into enemy hands.<ref>Rachel Donadio (February 9, 2014), [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/movies/europes-painful-past-colors-a-film-festival.html Europe’s Painful Past Colors a Film Festival] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

==Personal life==
Schlöndorff was married to fellow film director [[Margarethe von Trotta]] from 1971 to 1991 and helped raise her son from her first marriage. He is currently married to Angelika Schlöndorff, and the couple has one daughter.<ref>Peter Craven and Volker Schlöndorff. [http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4194708,00.html Talking Germany.] [[Deutsche Welle]]. April 26, 2009.</ref>

He formed a production company that produced both his and von Trotta's films, Bioskop.

In 1991, he was the Head of the Jury at the [[41st Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale 1991">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1991/04_jury_1991/04_Jury_1991.html |title=Berlinale: 1991 Juries |accessdate=2011-03-21 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>

'''Dorylaeum''' or '''Dorylaion''' ({{lang-el|?????????}}) was an ancient city in [[Anatolia]]. It is now in ruins near the city of [[Eski?ehir]], [[Turkey]].

Its original location was about 10km southwest of Eski?ehir, at a place now known as Karaca Hisar; about the end of the fourth century B.C. it was moved to a location north of modern Eski?ehir.<ref name="catholic">''Catholic Encyclopedia''</ref>

The city existed under the [[Phrygia]]ns but may have been much older. It was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] trading post. It also was probably a key city of the route the Apostle Paul took on his Second Missonary Voyage in 50 AD.

After the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071 it was taken by the [[Seljuk Turks]].

Dorylaeum was the site of two battles during the [[crusades]]. In 1097, during the [[First Crusade]], the crusaders defeated the Seljuks there, in their first [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|major victory]].<ref name="Dorylaeum">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-02-17|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05136b.htm|title=Dorylaeum}}</ref> During the [[Second Crusade]] it was the site of [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1147)|a major defeat]], which effectively ended the German contribution to the crusade.

[[Byzantine emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]] fortified Dorylaeum in 1175, but according to some authorities the Turks recaptured it in 1176 after the [[Battle of Myriokephalon]].<ref name="Dorylaeum"/> However, the contemporary Byzantine historian [[Niketas Choniates]] relates that Manuel did not destroy the fortifications of Dorylaeum, as he had agreed to do as part of the treaty he negotiated with the [[Sultanate of Rûm|Seljuk]] Turkish sultan [[Kilij Arslan II]] immediately after Myriokephalon. The sultan's response to this development was not a direct attack on Dorylaeum but the dispatch of a large army to ravage the rich [[Maeander|Meander]] valley to the south.<ref>Treadgold, p. 649.</ref>

Dorylaeum was described by the Muslim author al-Harawi (died 1215) as a place of medicinal hot springs on the frontier at the end of Christian territory.<ref>Lindner, p. 62</ref>

==Ecclesiastical history==

Dorylaeum became a bishopric under the [[Byzantine Empire]].

Seven bishops are known from the fourth to the ninth century, the most famous being [[Eusebius of Dorylaeum|Eusebius]]. The see is mentioned as late as the twelfth century among the suffragans of [[Synnada]], but must have been suppressed soon after.

Dorylaeum is included in the [[Catholic Church]]'s list of [[titular see]]s.<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ISBN 978-88-209-9070-1), p. 883</ref>

The school from which the university grew was founded in 1743, making it one of the oldest in the nation. However, UD was not chartered as an institution of higher learning until 1833. Its original class of ten students included [[George Read (signer)|George Read]], [[Thomas McKean]], and [[James Smith (political figure)|James Smith]], all three of whom would go on to sign the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]].

== History ==
[[Image:UD Fall Time 2010.jpg|right|thumbnail|The University of Delaware Green]]
The University of Delaware traces its founding to 1743, when Presbyterian minister [[Francis Alison]] opened up his "Free School" in his home in [[New London, Pennsylvania]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  The school changed its name and location several times, ending up as the Academy of Newark in 1769 (chartered by the colonial government).  Since Delaware was part of the Pennsylvania colony until 1776, the academy was denied charter as a college in order to prevent its competing with the [[University of Pennsylvania]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} (then known as the '''College of Philadelphia''').  In 1833, the Delaware General Assembly passed "An Act to Establish a College at Newark", and the next year, Newark College opened.  It changed its name in 1843 to Delaware College and it merged with the Academy of Newark. The school closed from 1859 until 1870 (Newark Academy separated from the college in 1869).  It reopened in 1870 due to the support of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Where to educate, 1898-1899.

On October 23, 2009 the University of Delaware signed an agreement with [[Chrysler]] to purchase a {{convert|272|acre|km2|adj=on}} closed vehicle assembly plant adjacent to the University for expansion for $24.25 million as part of Chrysler's bankruptcy restructuring plan.<ref>{{Cite news|title = UD, Chrysler reach agreement for plant sale|date = October 23, 2009|url = http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009910240360|archiveurl = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/delawareonline/access/1885653141.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+23%2C+2009&author=&pub=The+News+Journal&edition=&startpage=n%2Fa&desc=UD%2C+Chrysler+reach+agreement+for+plant+sale|archivedate = 2009|work = [[The News Journal]]|location = Wilmington, Delaware}}{{Closed access}}</ref>  Plans call for this facility to be repurposed into a "world-class research facility".<ref>{{cite news

In 1891, prominent Philadelphia architect [[Frank Furness]] designed Recitation Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/image_gallery.cfm?RecordId=F2A42DF5-44F6-405B-9FB3FB33A6B8B350|title= Image Gallery: Delaware State College Recitation Hall |work=Philadelphia Architects and Buildings|year=2013|publisher=[[Athenaeum of Philadelphia]]|archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20120224223150/http://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/image_gallery.cfm?RecordId=F2A42DF5-44F6-405B-9FB3FB33A6B8B350|archivedate = February 24, 2012|accessdate = July 25, 2013|deadurl = no}}</ref>

Several buildings (Wolf, Sussex, and Harter Halls) were designed by [[Frank Miles Day]] who also designed the formal campus landscape. From 1918 to 1952, [[Marian Cruger Coffin]] was appointed the University's landscape architect, a position which required her to unite the university's two separate campuses (the men's to the north and the women's to the south) into one cohesive design.<ref>Ben-Joseph, E., Ben-Joseph, H.D., & Dodge, A.C. ''[http://web.mit.edu/ebj/www/LAatMIT/LAatMIT.htm Against all Odds: MIT's Pioneering Women of Landscape Architecture]''. MIT, Cambridge, MA, 2006.</ref> This was a challenge since the linear mall design of each was out of alignment with the other. Coffin solved this problem by linking them with a circle instead of curving the straight paths (Morris Library faces this circle today) which rendered the misalignment unnoticeable to the pedestrian.<ref>Hail, M.W. "[http://www.udel.edu/PR/Messenger/93/2/40.html The Art of Landscaping]". University of Delaware ''Messenger'', Vol. 2, No. 2, p. 4, (Winter) 1993.</ref>

The recent history of the university has been marked by massive construction projects. North, or Laird, Campus, formerly home to the Pencader Complex, has been entirely redesigned and renamed Independence Complex. This began with the construction of a [[Marriott Courtyard]] run by the HRIM (Hotel Restaurant and Institutional Management) department. Three new residence hall buildings have also been built and named after the three University alumni who signed the Declaration of Independence, [[George Read (signer)|George Read]], [[Thomas McKean]], and [[James Smith (political figure)|James Smith]] (who signed for Pennsylvania). The third Delaware signer, [[Caesar Rodney]], already had a residence hall complex named after him on West Campus. A fourth residence hall opened for the Fall of 2008, was named Independence Hall; the building is split into East and West wings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facilities.udel.edu/rhalls.aspx |title=University of Delaware Facilities Website – Residence Halls Information |publisher=University of Delaware |accessdate=December 12, 2010|archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20101031030146/http://www.facilities.udel.edu/rhalls.aspx|archivedate = October 31, 2012|deadurl = no}}</ref>

New academic buildings have also been constructed recently. The David and Louise Roselle Center For The Arts, with new facilities for the school's music and theater programs, was opened in 2006. Also in 2006, Jastak-Burgess Hall opened, now home to the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature. In 1998, Gore Hall opened on the Green and connects to Smith Hall via an overpass on South College Avenue. In 2012, construction began on the {{currency|71 million|USD}} East Campus Residence Hall Complex, construction being done by [[Skanska USA]] and the design by the Delaware local firm [[ABHA Architects]].<ref name="PBJ20120905">{{Citation |first=Natalie |last=Kostelni |publication-date=September 5, 2012 |title=Skanska holds topping out for $71M U.

In 2006, the proportion of the University's funding coming from this source was 18.6%.<ref name=Malcolm5Jul2011/>  {{As of|2011}}, this proportion has decreased to 11.9% as a result of decreasing appropriations.<ref name=Malcolm5Jul2011/>

== Study abroad ==
The University of Delaware was the first American university to begin a [[study abroad]] program, which was later adopted by many other institutions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kochanek |first=Lisa |url=http://www.udel.edu/PR/SpecialUDelivery/vol1no1/anniversary.html |title=Study abroad celebrates 75th anniversary |publisher=University of Delaware |date=July 7, 1923 |accessdate=December 12, 2010|archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20100408131614/http://www.udel.edu/PR/SpecialUDelivery/vol1no1/anniversary.html|archivedate = April 8, 2010|deadurl = no}}</ref> The program began when Professor [[Raymond Watson Kirkbride]] took a group of 9 students to Paris, France during the fall semester of 1923.  Since this initial trip, the University of Delaware has expanded its study abroad program, which now encompasses over 80 different programs in more than 40 subjects to over 45 countries on all seven [[continents]] making it one of the largest programs in the country. As of 2006–2007, approximately 45% of all Delaware undergraduate students take advantage of study abroad experiences prior to completing their baccalaureate degrees.

Delaware's study abroad program offers many options for students.  Undergraduates have the option of studying abroad for a five-week winter or summer session, or an entire semester.

In 2006, the new Center for the Arts building opened.  This building has a number of recital halls and a large number of practice rooms, most with upright pianos.  The practice rooms are locked and cannot be used by students who are not music majors or in an official UD ensemble.  The university employs a tiered access system, with larger rooms and rooms with grand pianos being reserved for certain groups of students.  In addition the music department also uses their old building, with offices, classrooms, practice rooms, and recital halls.  This building has public-access practice rooms with pianos.

In 2005, the University of Delaware Chorale, under the direction of Dr. Paul D. Head and accompanied by Betsy Kent, were invited to perform at the [[American Choral Directors Association]]'s International Convention in Los Angeles.  In April 2007, the Chorale won the Grand Prix at the Tallinn International Choral Festival in Estonia, having scored higher than 40 other choirs from around the world. In 2010 the Chorale competed in two categories of the 42nd Annual Tolosa Choral Competition in Tolosa, Spain; They received a Bronze and a Silver award. UD-16, a chamber ensemble of Chorale also competed in Tolosa in two categories and won two Silver awards.

=== Alcohol abuse ===
A campus website claims that a 1993 study by the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] found that high-risk drinking at UD exceeded the national norm. On this survey, a majority of students reported [[binge drinking]] more than once in a two-week interval. The average consumption for students was nine drinks per week, while 29% reported that they drink on 10 or more occasions per month. Ironically, UD students were found to be more aware of policies, prevention programs, and enforcement risks than the national average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cte.udel.edu/aboutteach/spr98/bishop.html |title=Bishop, Binge Drinking in College |publisher=University of Delaware |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070828135307/http://cte.udel.edu/aboutteach/spr98/bishop.html |archivedate=August 28, 2007}}</ref>

In 2005, on the Newark campus of the university 1140 students were picked up by the campus police for alcohol-related violations. Of these, 120 led to arrests.

=== Power Plant controversy ===
The University has agreed to lease 43 acres on the STAR campus to [[The Data Centers]] (TDC) for the construction of the data center. The data center plan includes a [[combined cycle|combined heat cycle]] plant that will be capable of generating 279 [[megawatt]]s of energy.<ref>{{cite press release|title=September 3 Public Meeting- Questions and Answers|date=September 3, 2013|url=http://www.thedatacenters.com/star-campus-project/item/download/8_2f2b8d78a4c3d8047268a5491afe1801|format=PDF|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> TDC claims that the power plant is critical to ensuring an uninterrupted electrical power supply to the facility, which is critical for data integrity. The TDC business plan also calls for sale of excess electricity.

[[File:Swiss yodelers.jpg|thumb|305px|right|New Glarus yodelers in traditional Swiss garb. (1922).]]

'''Yodeling''' (also '''yodelling''' or '''jodeling''') is a form of singing which involves repeated changes of pitch during a single note. The singer quickly switches between the low-pitch [[chest register]] (or "chest voice") and the high-pitch [[head register]] or [[falsetto]]. The English  word ''yodel'' is derived from the [[German (language)|German]] (and originally [[Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]]) word ''jodeln'', meaning "to utter the syllable ''jo''" (pronounced "yo" in English). This vocal technique is used in many cultures worldwide.<ref>[http://www.furious.com/perfect/yodel.html Perfect Sound Forever - Online Music Magazine]</ref>

Alpine yodeling was a longtime rural tradition in Europe, and became popular in the 1830s as an entertainment in theaters and music halls. In Central Africa, yodeling was a form of communication announcing the yodeler's location and identity. In the United States, traveling [[minstrels]] were yodeling in the 1800s, and in 1920 the [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor recording company]] listed 17 yodels in their catalogue. Music historians credit the first [[country music|country]] recording to include yodeling to [[Riley Puckett]] in 1924. In 1928, blending Alpine yodeling with traditional work, blues, hobo, and cowboy music, [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] released his recording "Blue Yodel No. 1".  Rodger's [[Blue Yodel]]  created an instant national craze for yodeling in the United States and, according to a black musician who lived near Rodgers in Mississippi, everyone, both black and white alike, began to copy Rodgers. The popularity lasted through the 1940s, but by the 1950s it became rare to hear yodeling in Country or Western music.<ref name="Tosches1996">{{Cite book | last=Tosches | first=Nick | year=1996 | title=Country: the twisted roots of rock 'n' roll | publisher=Da Capo Press | isbn=978-0-306-80713-8|page=110 | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==History==

Most experts agree that yodeling was used in the [[Central Alps]] by herders calling their stock or to communicate between Alpine villages. The multi-pitched "yelling" later became part of the region's traditional lore and musical expression. The earliest record of a yodel is in 1545, where it is described as "the call of a [[Herder|cowherd]] from [[Appenzell]]".<ref>{{Cite book | last=Ling | first=Jan | year=1997 | title=A history of European folk music | publisher=University Rochester Press | isbn=978-1-878822-77-2 |page=32 | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In [[Music of Iran|Persian]] classical music, singers frequently use ''tahrir'' ("[[tremolo]]" in English), a yodeling technique that oscillates on [[neighbor tone]]s. It is similar to the Swiss yodel, and is used as an ornament or trill in phrases which have long syllables, and usually falls at the end of a phrase.<ref>[http://fis-iran.org/en/resources/classicalpersian/modes/vocalstyling Persian Vocal Stylings]</ref> Tahrir is also prevalent in [[Music of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani]], [[Music of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]], [[Music of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]], [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]], [[Music of Armenia|Armenian]], [[Music of Afghanistan|Afghan]], and [[Music of Central Asia|Central Asian]] musical traditions, and to a lesser extent in [[Music of Pakistan|Pakistani]] and some [[Music of India|Indian]] music.

In [[Music of Georgia|Georgian traditional music]], yodeling takes the form of ''krimanchuli'' technique, and is used as a top part in three/four part [[polyphony]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008hzpg#p006b969 Example of Svaneti polyphony and yodelling in the Guria province in Georgia (BBC Radio 4)]</ref>

In [[Central Africa]] [[Pygmy music|Pygmy singers]] use yodels within their elaborate polyphonic singing, and the [[Shona people|Shona]] people of [[Zimbabwe]] sometimes yodel while playing the [[mbira]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Mbira Singing|work=Erica Azim|accessdate=December 24, 2009|quote=Huro (singing) includes mahon'era – low-pitched syllabic singing without meaning; chigure/magure – high pitched syllabic singing without meaning, including yodelling; and song texts|url=http://mbira.org/mbirasinging.html}}</ref>  The [[Mbuti]] of the Congo incorporate distinctive whistles and yodels
into their songs.  Living from hunting and gathering, they sing hunting and harvest songs and use yodelling to call each other. In 1952, [[ethnomusicologist]] [[Hugh Tracey]] recorded their songs and they have  been released on compact discs.

Human voices have at least two distinct vocal registers, called the "head" and "chest" voices.<ref>Titze, I.R. (1994). Principles of Voice Production, Prentice Hall, ISBN 978-0-13-717893-3.</ref> Most people can sing tones within a certain range of lower [[pitch (music)|pitches]] in their chest voice and tones within a certain range of higher pitch in their head voice. [[Falsetto]] is an "unsupported" register forcing vocal cords in a higher pitch without any head or chest voice air support. The range of overlap between registers, called the [[passaggio]], can be challenging for untrained singers. Experienced singers can control their voices in this range, easily switching between registers. Yodeling is a version of this technique in which a singer might change register several times in only a few seconds and at a high [[volume (sound)|volume]]. Repeated alternation between registers at a singer's passaggio pitch range produces a very distinctive sound. For example, in the famous "Yodel - Ay - EEE - Oooo", the "EEE" is sung in the head voice while all other syllables are in the chest voice.
	 	
[[Bart Plantenga]], author of ''Yodel-Ay-Ee-Oooo: The Secret History of Yodeling Around the World'', explains the technique:
<blockquote>
"The basic yodel requires sudden alterations of vocal register from a low-pitched chest voice to high falsetto tones sung on vowel sounds: AH, OH, OO for chest notes and AY or EE for the falsetto. Consonants are used as levers to launch the dramatic leap from low to high, giving it its unique ear-penetrating and distance-spanning power."<ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/sep/22/worldmusic Why it's time we learned to love yodelling] The Guardian: Music, Sept. 22, 2006.</ref>
</blockquote> 	
The best places for Alpine-style yodelling are those with an [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]]. Ideal natural locations include not only mountain ranges but lakes, rocky gorges or shorelines, and high or open areas with one or more distant rock faces.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://yodel.askdefine.com/ Define yodel | Dictionary and Thesaurus<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Yodeling in the United States ==

It is thought that yodeling was first introduced to the United States by German immigrants in Pennsylvania in the early 1800s.  As the new settlers traveled south through the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and beyond into the [[Deep South]] they came into contact with Scots-Irish immigrants, Scandinavians (practitioners of a unique yodeling called kölning), and other nationalities including African slaves who communicated with "[[field hollers]]", described by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in 1853 as a "long, loud, musical shout, rising and falling and breaking into falsetto".

In 1839, the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]ese [[Minstrels]] toured the United States and started an American craze for Alpine music.  During the 1840s, dozens of German, Swiss, and Austrian singing groups crisscrossed the country entertaining audiences with a combination of singing, yodeling, and “Alpine harmony.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.19thcenturyguitar.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=54&Itemid=74 |title=Yodeling Mountaineers: The Alpine Roots of the American Guitar |publisher=19thcenturyguitar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>  The success of the European groups led to the formation of many American family singing groups as well.  The most popular was the [[Hutchison Family Singers]] who toured, singing harmony and yodeling.  [[Minstrel show]]s parodied the Hutchison's yodeling with their own, calling it "Tyrolesian business".  In 1853, [[Christy's Minstrels]]  [[burlesque]]d (mocked)  the Hutchinson Family singing 'We Come from the Hills with Tyrolean Echo'.<ref>[http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/b_yodel.htm America's Blue Yodel<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
[[File:Sleep, Baby, Sleep (Watson).ogg|thumb|Sleep, Baby, Sleep (Watson, 1911)]]
Other traveling American minstrels were yodeling in the United States as well.  Tom Christian was the first American yodeling minstrel, appearing in 1847 in Chicago.  Recordings of yodelers were made in 1892 and in 1920 the [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] recording company listed 17 yodels in their catalogue, many of them by George Watson, the most successful yodeler of the time.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://victor.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/talent/detail/40193/Watson_George_P._vocalist_yodeling |title=Victor Discography: George P.

Watson (vocalist : yodeling)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In 1897 Watson recorded the song, "Sleep, Baby, Sleep" <ref>[http://www.loc.gov/jukebox/recordings/detail/id/8559 Browse All Recordings | Sleep, baby sleep, Take 1 (1901-02-15) | National Jukebox LOC.gov<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> which was later recorded in 1927 by [[Riley Puckett]] as the second yodeling record ever made (the first was "Rock All Our Babies to Sleep").  "Sleep Baby Sleep" was also the first song ever recorded by [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] (at the [[Bristol sessions]]); Rodgers would eventually come to be known as the father of both country music and American yodeling when he combined the yodel with southern African-American blues.<ref name="Tosches1996" />

The American [[minstrel show]] consisted of comic skits, variety acts, dancing, and music, performed by [[white people]] in [[blackface]] or, especially after the [[American Civil War]], [[black people]] in blackface.  Minstrel shows toured the same circuits as opera companies, circuses, and Europea  entertainers, with venues ranging from lavish opera houses to makeshift tavern stages. When the European Tyrolese Minstrels toured the U.S. for several years in the early 1840s and created an American craze for Alpine yodeling music, four unemployed white actors decided to stage an African-American—style spoof of this group's concerts. Calling themselves [[Dan Emmett]]'s Virginia Minstrels, the performance was wildly popular and most historians mark this production as the beginning of minstrelsy in the U.S.  According to jazz historian [[Gary Giddins]]:
:Though antebellum (minstrel) troupes were white, the form developed in a form of racial collaboration, illustrating the axiom that defines – and continues to define – American music as it developed over the next century and a half : African American innovations metamorphose into American popular culture when white performers learn to mimic black ones.<ref name="musicals101.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicals101.com/minstrel.htm |title=Minstrel shows |publisher=Musicals101.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>

By the 1880s the minstrel show had been replaced by [[Vaudeville]] and [[American Burlesque]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA02/easton/vaudeville/vaudevillemain.html |title=Vaudeville, A History |publisher=Xroads.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref> By around 1905, more than 20 years before Jimmie Rodgers introduced his blue yodel, African Americans were touring the country singing and yodeling.  The most noted  yodelers of that time were Monroe Tabor ("The Yodeling Bellboy" - though he was not a bellboy), Beulah Henderson (who appeared in black face), and Charles Anderson (who played a singing "mammy" and a female impersonator in several of his acts).  Tabor performed  with the  Dandy Dixie Minstrels.   In New York in 1908, a 'well-known critic' reported: 
:Monroe Tabor sang "A Tear, a Kiss, a Smile".  Mr Tabor is a new tenor with a good voice, which suffers only from a lack of training...While there was not quite enough comedy and ragtime, the Yoodle song, "Sleep, Baby, Sleep", was greatly in atonement and showed Monroe Tabor to be unexcelled as a yoodler.

And from a 1917 review:

:...and Monroe Tabor yodeled as only J K Emmett Sr, of yore could do.  At the Avenue Theater in December 1917, "When My Ship Comes Sailing Home" was a fine tenor solo by Tabor, who has no superiors as a yodeler.<ref name="mustrad.org.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/b_yodel.htm |title=America's Blue Yodel |publisher=Mustrad.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>

Known as The Jolly Hendersons, Beulah Henderson toured with her husband Billy from 1905 through 1910.  Billed as "The Classy Colored Comedy Pair", Beulah was featured as "America's only Colored Lady Yodeler".  In Indianapolis in 1911 manager Tim Owsley noted:

:The Jolly Hendersons offered a clean, bright and snappy act of singing, talking and dancing.  Each song rendered by the jolly pair won for them an encore.  Mr Henderson is a real clever light comedian, while his partner, Miss Henderson , is just as clever as a singing and talking soubrette.  In fact she is one of the first lady yodlers that we have had the pleasure of hearing.

Charles Anderson began touring with a [[vaudeville]] show in 1909, singing a combination of blues and yodeling.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=scp47Y9cLtgC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=Charles+Anderson+yoddler+vaudeville#v=onepage&q=Charles%20Anderson%20yoddler%20vaudeville&f=false |title=Ramblin' on My Mind: New Perspectives on the Blues - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2008-01-02|accessdate=2012-09-24|isbn=9780252091124}}</ref>  A 1913 St. Louis review reports:
:The Male Mockingbird, Charles Anderson, the man with the golden voice, is some character singer, imitator, and impersonator.  As an imitator, Anderson has the best on the market skinned, his violin imitation intermezzo went big, and was one of the best imitations of a musical instrument heard in this neck of the woods for many moons.  "Sleep Baby Sleep", a lullaby sung in costume of an old nurse went big.  The yodeling in this song was excellent.  "Baby Seals Blues", as rendered by Anderson, was worth going to hear.  After a quick change, Anderson reappeared as the polished gentleman and sang "When the Cuckoo Sings", instantly winning the hearts of the audience with his perfect yodehng, causing said audience to cheer like mad for more.<ref name="mustrad.org.uk"/>

Country blues singer [[Lottie Kimbrough]], billed as The Kansas City Butterball (she was a rather large woman), sang in [[speakeasy]]s and [[nightclubs]]. Kimbrough recorded her music from 1924 through 1929 and is now best known for her collaborations with Winston Holmes. Holmes supplied a series of yodels, vocalized bird calls and train whistles on some of their recordings.  A good recording of Kimbrough and Holmes singing Wayward Girl Blues (1924) is available on YouTube.

When music critic [[Abbe Niles]] heard the Blue Yodel recordings released by Jimmie Rodgers in 1928 he was impressed by how distinctively black Rodgers' Blue Yodel recordings sounded, yodeling and all.  In his opinion  Rodgers was a "white man gone black".  In his 1928 record review column, writing under the heading 'White man singing black songs', Niles acknowledged that Rodgers' first Blue Yodel had "started the whole epidemic of yodeling blues that now rages - though Clarence Williams wrote a good one five years ago."  Niles went on to advise his readers to add [[race records]] to their collections saying, "Listening to race records is nearly the only way for white people to share the Negroes' pleasures without bothering the Negroes."<ref name="mustrad.org.uk"/>

Authors Lynn Abbott & Doug Seroff write:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upress.state.ms.us/books/842 |title=Ragged but Right: Black Traveling Shows, "Coon Songs," and the Dark Pathway to Blues and Jazz |publisher=Upress.state.ms.us |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>

<blockquote>While some of the blue yodels heard on late 1920s Race recordings - those by the Mississippi Sheiks, for example - probably do owe something to Jimmie Rodgers' phenomenal success, others - like Billie Young's ''When They Get Lovin' They's Gone'' (accompanied by Jelly Roll Morton on Victor 23339,1930), Lottie Kimbrough and Winston Holmes' ''Lost Lover Blues'' (Gennett 6607, 1928), and Clint Jones' ''Mississippi Woman Blues'' and ''Blue Valley Blues'' (Okeh 8587, 1928) - seem more deeply connected to these precedent recordings by Charles Anderson, and to the venerable line of African-American yodelers they represent.  There is no reason to doubt that Jimmie Rodgers, who could not resist a show, was exposed to and influenced by the black yodeler-blues singer tradition.  Its practitioners were thoroughly entrenched in minstrelsy and vaudeville, and accessible to all races of people.  Perhaps Jimmie even saw Charles Anderson himself perform, or heard some of Anderson's crystalline blues and yodeling 78s, before rising to immortality on his own great 'Blue Yodel' recordings.  At any rate, the Freeman references strongly suggest that Charles Anderson and his generation of black professional yodelers had introduced the blue yodel in African-American entertainment before Jimmie Rodgers recorded.</blockquote>

====Early years====

Most music historians say that the first country music record to include yodeling was "Rock All Our Babies to Sleep" sung by [[Riley Puckett]], a blind singer from Georgia. In [[1924 in country music]], his recording was one of the top hits of that year.  Another early yodeler was [[Emmett Miller]], a [[minstrel show]] performer, also from Georgia.  In the 1920s, Miller recorded the song "[[Lovesick Blues]]", which was later a major hit for country singer [[Hank Williams]]. [[Bob Wills]], the King of [[Western Swing]], was also influenced by Miller (see the sound file above with Will's singer Tommy Duncan singing "Blue Yodel No. 1" in 1937)<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6DRpU7pU5mIC&pg=PA525&dq=yodeling+Georgia#v=onepage&q=yodeling%20Georgia&f=false |title=Write Me a Few of Your Lines: A Blues Reader - Steven Carl Tracy - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24|isbn=1558492062|year=1999}}</ref>  In the early 1920s, African-American Winston Holmes started a record label, Merritt Records, and was a performer himself. His vocals included bird calls, train whistles and yodels. He managed and made some songs with blues singer [[Lottie Kimbrough]] in the twenties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mademoisellemontana.wordpress.com/category/usa/ |title=USA " Mademoiselle Montana's Yodel Heaven |publisher=Mademoisellemontana.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>

In 1923 and 1924 black performer Charles Anderson recorded eight sides for the [[Okeh]] label which gave a summary account of his vaudeville repertoire during the previous decade.  Five of the recorded songs are yodels : "Sleep, Baby, Sleep", "Comic Yodle Song", "Coo Coo" (J K Emmett's Cuckoo Song, adapted for Anderson's famous 60-second sustained soprano note), "Laughing Yodel" and "Roll On Silver Moon", a sentimental ballad, similar to Jimmie Rodgers' various Southern ballad recordings. Some historians credit white singer Riley Puckett with the first recorded yodeling record.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

====Jimmie Rodgers====

Another famous early yodeler was [[The Singing Brakeman]] Jimmie Rodgers, who recorded dozens of popular songs in the late 1920s and early 1930s.  While working on the railroad he learned blues techniques from African American [[gandy dancer]]s, and eventually created his characteristic sound - a blend of traditional work, blues, [[hobo]], and cowboy songs and his trademark "[[Blue Yodel]]."  His first blue yodel, known as “Blue Yodel No. 1" ([[T For Texas]]), was recorded  in the Trinity Baptist Church at Camden, New Jersey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=38042#535368 |title=Origins of yodeling in Country Music |publisher=mudcat.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>  When the song was released in February 1928 it became “a national phenomenon and generated an excitement and record-buying frenzy that no-one could have predicted”.<ref name="lilly">[http://www.markbrine.com/country_music_roots/jimmie_rodgers.htm ‘Jimmie Rodgers: Life & Time’]{{dead link|date=November 2013}} by John Lilly (citing ''Jimmie Rodgers: The Life and Times of America's Blue Yodeler'' by Nolan Porterfield, University of Illinois Press, 1992).</ref>  Rogers sang about everyday affairs and woes that many Americans of that time could relate to.  Here are the lyrics of "Blue Yodel No. 3":

:''She’s long she’s tall, she six feet from the ground

According to a black musician who lived near Rodgers in Mississippi, everyone, both black and white alike, began to copy Rodgers:  "Every one who could pick a guitar started yodeling like Rodgers."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=VpeGEPCKsesC&pg=PA110&dq=yodeling+Georgia#v=onepage&q=yodeling%20Georgia&f=false |title=Country: The Twisted Roots Of Rock 'n' Roll - Nick Tosches - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1996-08-22 |accessdate=2012-09-24|isbn=0786750987}}</ref>  Rodgers died in 1933. Many performers that followed him claimed that he had been a big influence in their singing style and career.

====The Lion Sleeps Tonight====

One famous yodeling tune known the world-over is the song "[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]", also known as "Wimoweh".  It was first recorded by [[Solomon Linda]] and the Evening Birds in South African in 1939.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Malan  |first=Rian  |authorlink=Rian Malan |coauthors= |title=Where Does The Lion Sleep Tonight?|url=http://www.3rdearmusic.com/forum/mbube2.html |work= |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=May 25, 2000}} Originally published as, "In the Jungle".</ref>  Linda, a singer of [[Zulu people|Zulu]] origin, wrote the song, originally titled "Mbube" ({{lang-zu|lion}}), while working for the [[Gallo Record Company]] as a cleaner and record packer.  According to South African journalist Rian Malan:
<blockquote>"Mbube" wasn't the most remarkable tune, but there was something terribly compelling about the underlying chant, a dense meshing of low male voices above which Solomon yodeled and howled for two exhilarating minutes, occasionally making it up as he went along. The third take was the great one, but it achieved immortality only in its dying seconds, when Solly took a deep breath, opened his mouth and improvised the melody that the world now associates with these words:
:::<poem>''In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight.''<ref>{{Cite news |last=Malan  |first=Rian  |authorlink=Rian Malan |coauthors= |title=Where Does The Lion Sleep Tonight?|url=http://www.3rdearmusic.com/forum/mbube2.html |work= |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=May 25, 2000}}</ref></poem></blockquote>

By 1948 the song had sold about 100,000 copies in Africa and among black South African immigrants in Great Britain and had lent its name to [[Mbube (genre)|a style]] of African [[a cappella]] music that evolved into ''[[isicathamiya]]'' (also called ''mbube''), popularized by [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]].<ref>Frith, Simon, [http://books.google.com/books?id=bxsUdjSnGZcC&printsec=frontcover ''Popular music: critical concepts in media and cultural studies, Volume 4''], London : Routledge, 2004. ISBN 978-0-415-33270-5.</ref>  It was covered internationally by many 1950s pop and folk revival artists, including [[The Weavers]], [[Jimmy Dorsey]], [[Yma Sumac]], [[Miriam Makeba]], and [[The Kingston Trio]]. In 1961, it became a number one hit in the U.S. as adapted by the [[doo-wop]] group [[The Tokens]]. It went on to earn at least 15 million US dollars in royalties from covers and film licensing. Then, in the mid-nineties, it became a pop "supernova" when it was used in the film  ''[[The Lion King]]'', its [[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|spin-off TV series]] and [[The Lion King (musical)|live musical]].

====Radio====

Other than the [[National Barn Dance]], broadcast out of Chicago starting in 1924, and the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1925, American Country Western performers had only live performances and records to promote their music.  When radio [[History of Radio#Audio broadcasting (1919 to 1950s)|grew in popularity]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s, the powerful recording company [[RCA Victor]] feared that free music would  devastate their record business. RCA first attempted to prevent artists from appearing on the radio and then successfully stopped the growth of more powerful FM stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/music/inside/cron.html |title=Inside The Music Industry - Chronology - Technology And The Music Industry &#124; The Way The Music Died &#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref> But radio ownership grew from 2 out of 5 U.S. homes in 1931 to 4 out of 5 homes in 1938, and stations began to broadcast live shows featuring  various artists, sometimes with a live audience. Some artists remained in their home area, but many traveled a circuit covering dozens of [[AM broadcasting|low-power AM]] stations throughout the country, introducing the various styles of singing to others outside of their region.  A Georgia radio station of that era lists "cowboy Roy Lykes", the "Yodeling Fence Rider" from Texas, in its 1934 roster. Lykes is described as "a real cowboy" who "wears regulation cowboy shoes to get him in the mood".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=UzSc88iNbXkC&pg=PA124&dq=yodeling+Georgia#v=onepage&q=yodeling%20Georgia&f=false |title=Pickin' on Peachtree: A History of Country Music in Atlanta, Georgia - Wayne W.

==Notable performers==

===United States===

Known as the "Texas Drifter," [[Goebel Reeves]] claimed to have taught Jimmie Rodgers to yodel.  Reeves came from a middle-class background, but chose the life of a [[hobo]].  His most famous song, "[[Hobo's Lullaby]]," has been covered by numerous singers, notably [[Woody Guthrie]] and his son [[Arlo Guthrie|Arlo]].
 
In 1934 yodeler [[Elton Britt]] recorded what was to become his signature song, "Chime Bells".  Like so many others of that era, Britt listened to  records of Jimmie Rodgers, which inspired him to learn how to yodel. Eventually he became renowned for his ability to sustain his yodel for an unusually long time, a skill he reportedly learned while swimming underwater for several minutes at a time.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hillbilly-Music.com |url=http://www.hillbilly-music.com/artists/story/index.php?id=10019 |title=Elton Britt |publisher=Hillbilly-Music.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>  Swiss-American Country singer [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] yodels and is known for her version of "Chime Bells" as well.

Blue yodeler [[Cliff Carlisle]] was one of the most prolific recording artists of the 1930s, and a pioneer in the use of the Hawaiian [[steel guitar]] in country music. He frequently released songs with sexual connotations including barnyard metaphors (which became something of a trademark).<ref>{{cite web|last=Ankeny |first=Jason |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p42692 |title=Cliff Carlisle - Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>

[[Jack Guthrie]], the cousin of [[Woody Guthrie]], performed in the thirties and early forties.  Known as "Oklahoma's Yodeling Cowboy", he developed a style of singing and yodeling influenced by his idol, Jimmie Rodgers, and his experiences as a bucking-horse rider and [[rodeo]] performer.<ref>[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/G/GU005.html GUTHRIE, LEON JERRY "JACK" (1915-1948)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Hank Snow]] was one of the great country legends of the 1950s, but he had actually been singing in Canada for years where he was known as "The Yodeling Ranger".  He admired Jimmie Rodgers as well,  and learned to yodel by listening to his records.  He even named his son Jimmie Rodgers Snow.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p1811/biography Hank Snow - Music Biography, Credits and Discography : AllMusic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Tommy Duncan]], vocalist for "Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys", was a good yodeler.  (See the sound file above with Duncan singing Rodger's "Blue Yodel No. 1" in 1937) [[Bob Wills]] is considered by music authorities to be the co-founder of Western Swing.
[[File:Rosalie Allen.jpg|thumb|Rosalie Allen, 1947]]

[[The DeZurik Sisters]] were two of the first women to become stars on both the ''[[National Barn Dance]]'' and the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', largely a result of their original yodeling style.  [[Carolina Cotton]]<ref>[http://www.hillbilly-music.com/artists/story/index.php?id=12787 Hillbilly-Music.com - Carolina Cotton<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and [[Patsy Montana]] were early cowgirl yodeling singers as well.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=M8p_WFCDe7AC&pg=PA224&dq=yodeling+technique&hl=en&ei=DWxhTt6RNsnIgQfhm9HHAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=yodeling%20technique&f=false Country - Richard Carlin - Google Books<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Patsy Montana's signature song, "[[I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart]]"  was again popularized in 1946 by [[Rosalie Allen]], a "singing cowgirl" from Pennsylvania, who went on to host her own "western" radio show in New York City.  [[Margo Smith]] covered it in the 1970s, and singer/yodeler [[LeAnn Rimes]] again brought the song back in the 1990s.  In 1996 Rimes also recorded "[[The Cattle Call]]", a "[[singing cowboy]]" song written by cowboy yodeler [[Tex Owens]], with legendary singer [[Eddy Arnold]].  "The Cattle Call" was Arnold's signature song, but it has been recorded by many artists including [[Emmylou Harris]] and even [[Elvis Presley]].<ref>[http://mademoisellemontana.wordpress.com/2009/04/13/cattle-call-from-tex-owens-to-people-like-us/ Cattle Call: from Tex Owens to People Like Us | Mademoiselle Montana's Yodel Heaven<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Singing cowboy]] [[Roy Rogers]] yodeled, as did his box office competitor [[Gene Autry]].  (See the sound file above in which Autry sings the Jimmie Rodgers song "Blue Yodel No. 5")  [[Zeke Clements]], known as "The Dixie Yodeler" acted in "singing cowboy" Westerns and also provided the voice of Bashful, the yodeling dwarf, in [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)]].

Yodeler [[Hannes Schroll|Hannès Schroll]] was the voice for the [[Goofy holler]], a stock [[sound effect]] that is used frequently in [[Walt Disney]] cartoons and films. It is the cry Goofy makes when falling or being launched into the air, which could be transcribed as "yaaaaaaa-hoo-hoo-hooey!"

"[[Yodelin' Slim Clark]]", hailed from [[Maine]] and performed for 70 years.  (See the sound file above "The Old Chisholm Trail" recorded by Clark in 1956.)<ref>[http://www.yodelingslimclark.com/ Yodeling Slim Clark<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Yodeler Don Walser was from Texas.  Though widely known in Texas, his singing career didn't really take off until he was 60 years old in 1994.  In 2000 he received a lifetime "Heritage" award from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and he and his band played at the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]].<ref>[http://www.markrubin.com/war/ Don Walser circa 1964<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  [[Jimmie Davis]], who served two terms as the  Governor of Louisiana, was also a successful country singer who yodeled.

Perhaps yodeler [[Bill Haley]] of ''[[Bill Haley and the Comets]]'' has one of the strangest histories of all.  Bill Haley zoomed to fame as the "King of Rock and Roll" when his song "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" was featured in the popular film [[Blackboard Jungle]].  But it is  little-known that Haley and his band had been around for years doing [[Western swing]] music with Haley featured as a yodeler.  Haley was born in 1925 and "Rock Around the Clock" made the scene in 1955 and at that time he and his band were using the name the Comets.  However, prior to that time they had gone under the names the ''Down Homers'', the ''Texas Range Riders'', the ''Four Aces of Western Swing'' and finally, ''[[The Saddlemen]]''.  At one point in the 1940s, Bill Haley was even awarded Indiana State Yodeling Champion for his skill, perhaps something that his skillful manager [[Colonel Tom Parker]] felt not important to mention to his screaming teenage rock 'n' roll fans.<ref>[http://www.hillbilly-music.com/artists/story/index.php?id=13813 Hillbilly-Music.com - Bill Haley and the Saddlemen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://wn.com/Bill_Haley__Yodel_Your_Blues_Away Bill Haley Yodel Your Blues Away<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.reocities.com/nemsbook/h/billhaley.htm Bill Haley: Before the Comets - NEMSbook<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Yodler [[Kenny Roberts (musician)|Kenny Roberts]] was another member of the ''Down Homers''; he taught Bill Haley to yodel before he did a stint in the Navy when Haley took his place in the band.  In later years Roberts was popular on children's TV shows where he used to leap over two feet in the air while playing guitar and yodeling.

Jazz singer [[Leon Thomas]], best known for his work with [[Pharoah Sanders]], particularly the 1969 song "The Creator Has a Master Plan" from Sanders' ''[[Karma (Pharoah Sanders album)|Karma]]'' album, was known to break out into yodeling in the middle of a vocal. Thomas said he learned to yodel from listening to African Pygmy singers.  This style has influenced singers [[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]], [[Tim Buckley]] and [[Bobby McFerrin]], among others.

[[Slim Whitman]] performed for over 60 years.  Whitman avoided the "down on yer luck" songs, preferring instead to sing laid-back romantic melodies about simple life and love. Critics dubbed his musical style "countrypolitan," due to its fusion of country music and a more sophisticated [[crooner]] vocal style. Pop singer [[Michael Jackson]] cited Whitman as one of his ten favorite vocalists.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Marsh | first1 = Dave | first2 = James | last2 = Bernard | title = The New Book of Rock Lists | location = New York | publisher = Simon & Schuster | year = 1994 | page =  362}}</ref> Beatles [[George Harrison]] and [[Paul McCartney]] cite Whitman as an early influence<ref>{{cite book | last = Harrison | first =  George | title = [[The Beatles Anthology]] | location = New York | publisher =  Chronicle Books | year =  2000 | page = 28 }}</ref> {{Sfn|Miles|1997|p=21}}<ref name="Larkin">Larkin, Colin (1993).

[[Stompin' Tom Connors]] of Canada is also noted for yodeling in some of his songs.

Pop rock singer [[Avril Lavigne]], with a singing style very much influenced by Irish singer [[Dolores O'Riordan]] who is well known for her yodeling, is known for yodeling in some of her songs, especially in her early works, although one can also hear slight yodeling in songs from her newer albums as well, such as "Let Me Go" and "Falling Fast". The singer's yodeling style is very discrete, and yet noticeable.

===Europe===

Yodeling is a major feature of folk music ([[Volksmusik]]) from Switzerland, Austria, and southern Germany and can be heard in many contemporary folk songs, which are also featured on regular TV broadcasts. [[Stefanie Hertel]] is a German yodeler and popular performer of Alpine folk music. Hertel has won numerous prizes as a performer; in 1992, she won the [[Grand Prix der Volksmusik]] with the song "Über jedes Bacherl geht a Brückerl"

[[Franzl Lang|Franz "Franzl" Lang]], known as the Yodelking (German: Jodlerkönig), is a famous yodeler from [[Bavaria]]. Lang also plays the guitar and the accordion and he has authored several books on yodeling. [[Ursprung Buam]] is an Austrian folk music trio from Zillertal, Tyrol. One of the most popular touring groups in Austria, Ursprung Baum often tours Germany and many places across the European Union, as well as the Tirolean festival scene. [[Oesch’s die Dritten]] is a Yodel Volksmusik family group from the [[Bernese Oberland]], Switzerland.

[[Bobbejaan Schoepen]] was an extremely accomplished, successful, and versatile Belgian entertainer, entrepreneur, singer-songwriter, guitarist, comedian, actor, and professional whistler. 
In 1948 "De Jodelende Fluiter" ("The Yodeling Whistler") was Schoepen's first hit.  In 1953, he was one of the first Europeans  to appear at the "Grand Ole Opry" in the United States.<ref>[http://chawedrosin.wordpress.com/2010/06/14/bobbejaan-schoepen-the-yodeling-whistler/ Bobbejaan Schoepen: The Yodeling Whistler | The Chawed Rosin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Outside of regional ''Volksmusic'', [[Karl Denver]] was a Scottish singer who had a series of yodel-based hit singles in the early 1960s. Most famous of these was a 1961 version of "[[Wimoweh]]".

[[Harry Hopkinson]]  (1902 – 1979) has been credited as one of the world's greatest yodelers. He used the stage name Harry Torrani and was billed as the "Yodeling Cowboy from Chesterfield".  [[Frank Ifield]], an Australian-English singer, released a double A-sided single record, "Lovesick Blues" and "She Taught Me How to Yodel" in the UK in 1962.  It reached number 1 in the UK charts, and also reached number 44 in the U.S.Billboard Hot 100.

In England, [[Edith Sitwell]] featured a "Jodelling Song" as part of her series of poems ''[[Façade (entertainment)|Façade]]'', set to music by [[William Walton]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jodelling Song - Italian Opera|url=http://www.italianopera.org/lieder/l231920.htm|publisher=Italian Opera|accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref>

One of the earliest songs to portray an unusual marriage between yodeling and rock music was "[[Hocus Pocus (instrumental)|Hocus Pocus]]" by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] band [[Focus (band)|Focus]] released in 1971. Irish singer [[Dolores O'Riordan]] is renowned for her yodelling particularly in tracks such as "Dreams", one of several Riordan-penned singles from the double platinum album Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? by The Cranberries.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

===The Tarzan yell===
The [[Tarzan yell]] is the yodel-like call of the character [[Tarzan]], as portrayed by actor [[Johnny Weissmuller]] in the films based on the character created by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], starting with ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]'' ([[1932 in film|1932]]). The yell was a creation of the movies, based on what Burroughs described in his books as "the victory cry of the bull ape."

'''''Engel v. Vitale''''', 370 U.S. 421 (1962), was a [[landmark decision|landmark]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that ruled it is unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official [[school prayer]] and encourage its recitation in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]].

==Background of the case==
The case was brought by a group of families of public school students in [[New Hyde Park, New York]] who complained that the voluntary prayer written by the state board of regents to "Almighty God" contradicted their religious beliefs. They were supported by groups opposed to the school prayer including rabbinical organizations, [[Ethical Culture]], and Judaic organizations. The prayer in question was:<ref>Legal Information Institute, [http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0370_0421_ZC.html Engel v. Vitale]. ''Cornell''.</ref>
{{quote|"Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our country. Amen."}}

The plaintiffs argued that opening the school day with such a prayer violates the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] ([[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|as applied to the states]] through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]]), which says in part, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion".  The governments of twenty-two states signed on to an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief urging affirmation of the [[New York Court of Appeals]] decision that upheld the constitutionality of the prayer.<ref>The ''amicus curiae'' was joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, and West Virginia.</ref>  The [[American Jewish Committee]], the [[Synagogue Council of America]], and the [[American Ethical Union]] each submitted briefs urging the Court to instead reverse and rule that the prayer was unconstitutional.

==The Court's decision==
In an opinion delivered by Justice [[Hugo Black]], the Court ruled that government-written prayers were not to be recited in public schools and were an unconstitutional violation of the Establishment Clause. This was decided in a vote of 6-1, because before the decision could be announced, Justice Felix Frankfurter suffered a cerebral stroke that forced him to retire, and Justice Byron White took no part in the case.<ref>

|accessdate=2012-05-30
}}</ref>

The Court explained the importance of separation between church and state by giving a lengthy history of the issue, beginning with the 16th century in England.  It then stated that school's prayer is a religious activity by the very nature of it being a prayer, and that prescribing such a religious activity for school children violates the Establishment Clause. The program, created by government officials to promote a religious belief, was therefore constitutionally impermissible.

The Court rejected the defendant's arguments that people are not asked to respect any specific established religion; and that the prayer is voluntary.  The Court held that the mere promotion of a religion is sufficient to establish a violation, even if that promotion is not coercive.  The Court further held that the fact that the prayer is vaguely worded enough not to promote any particular religion is not a sufficient defense, as it still promotes a family of religions (those that recognize "Almighty God"), which still violates the Establishment Clause.

==Subsequent jurisprudence==
''Engel'' became the basis for several subsequent decisions limiting government-directed prayer in school. In ''[[Wallace v. Jaffree]]'' (1985), the Supreme Court ruled Alabama's law permitting one minute for prayer or meditation was unconstitutional. In ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'' (1992), the court prohibited clergy-led prayer at middle school graduation ceremonies. ''Lee v. Weisman'', in turn, was a basis for ''[[Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe|Santa Fe ISD v. Doe]]'' (2000), in which the Court extended the ban to school-organized ''student''-led prayer at high school football games.

[[Cornish Language Partnership]].</ref> (Carrek Los yn Cos), meaning "hoar rock in woodland",<ref>Cornish Place Names, page 122|author=O.J.Padel</ref> also known colloquially by locals as simply ''the Mount'' is a small [[tidal island]] in [[Mount's Bay]], [[Cornwall]], United Kingdom. The island is a [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] and is linked to the town of [[Marazion]] by a man-made [[causeway]] of granite [[Sett (paving)|setts]], passable between mid-tide and low water. It is managed by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], and the castle and chapel have been the home of the [[St Aubyn baronets|St Aubyn]] family since approximately 1650. The earliest buildings, on the summit, date to the 12th century, the harbour is 15th century and the village and summit buildings were rebuilt from 1860 to 1900, to give the island its current form.<ref name="cas">{{cite book|last1=Herring|first1=Peter|title=St Michael's Mount Archaeological Works, 1995-8|date=2000|publisher=Cornwall Archaeological Unit|location=Truro|isbn=1-898166-49-8}}</ref>

Its [[Cornish language]] name — literally, "the grey rock in a wood" — may represent a folk memory of a time before Mount's Bay was flooded, indicating a description of the Mount set in woodland. Remains of trees have been seen at low tides following storms on the beach at [[Perranuthnoe]], but [[radiocarbon dating]] established the submerging of the hazel wood at about 1700 BC.<ref name="ictis">{{cite journal |author=Gavin de Beer |date=June 1960 |title=Iktin |journal=The Geographical Journal |volume=126 |issue=2 |pages=160–167 |url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1793956?uid=3739656&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21105141733603 |accessdate=16 September 2012 |doi=10.2307/1793956}}</ref>

Historically, St Michael's Mount was a Cornish counterpart of [[Mont Saint-Michel]] in [[Normandy]], [[France]] (which shares the same tidal island characteristics and the same conical shape), when it was given to the [[Benedictine]]s, religious order of Mont Saint-Michel, by [[Edward the Confessor]] in the 11th century.<ref name="Blackford" >{{cite book |author=Oscar Blackford |title=Cornish Church Guide |year=1925 |publisher=Truro |pages=159–62 |isbn= }}</ref>

St Michael's Mount is one of forty-three (unbridged) tidal islands which can be walked to from mainland [[Great Britain|Britain]] and part of the island is designated as a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] in 1995 for its [[geology]].<ref> {{cite book |author=Peter Caton|title=No Boat Required – Exploring Tidal Islands|year=2011|isbn=978-1848767-010}}</ref><ref name=sssi>{{cite web |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/2000121.pdf |title=St Michael's Mount |date=31 March 1995|publisher=Natural England |accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>

==Pre-history==
There is evidence of people living in the area during the [[Neolithic British Isles|Neolithic]] (from circa 4000 to 2500 [[Common Era|BCE]] years) with the discovery of a leaf-shaped [[flint]] [[arrowhead]], which was found in a shallow pit on the lower eastern slope and now within the modern gardens. Other pieces of flint have been found, and at least two could be [[Mesolithic]] (circa 8000 to 3500 BCE).<ref name=cas /> During the Mesolithic, Britain was still attached to mainland Europe via [[Doggerland]], and [[archaeologist]] and [[Prehistory|prehistorian]] [[Caroline Malone]] noted that during the Late Mesolithic, the [[British Isles]] were something of a "technological backwater" in European terms, still living as a [[hunter-gatherer]] society whilst most of southern Europe had already taken up [[agriculture]] and sedentary living.<ref name=malone>{{cite book|last1=Malone|first1=Caroline|title=Neolithic Britain and Ireland|date=2001|publisher=Tempus|location=Stroud|isbn=0-7524-1442-9}}</ref> At this time the Mount would likely to have been an area of dry ground surrounded by a marshy forest. Any Neolithic or Mesolithic camps are likely to have been destroyed by the later extensive building operations, but it is reasonable to expect the Mount to have supported either a seasonal or short-term camp for Mesolithic people.<ref name=cas />

None of the flints, so far recovered, can be positively dated to the [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]] (circa 2500 to 800 BCE) although any summit cairns would have most likely been destroyed when building the castle. A [[hoard]] of [[copper]] weapons, once thought to have been found on the Mount, are now thought to have been found on nearby [[Marazion Marsh]]. Defensive stony banks on the north-eastern slopes are likely to date to the early 1st millennium BC, and are considered to be a [[Promontory fort|cliff castle]].<ref name=cas /> The Mount may be the ''Mictis'' of [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]], mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Naturalis Historia]]'' (IV:XVI.104), and the ''[[Ictis]]'' of [[Diodorus Siculus]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Both men had access to the now lost texts of the ancient Greek geographer [[Pytheas]] who, is said to have, visited the island in the fourth century BC. If this is true, it is one of the earliest identified locations in the whole of western Europe and particularly on the island of Britain, although the account of [[John of Worcester]] in the 11th century would point to this association being very unlikely.

==History==
[[Image:England-Saint-Michaels-Mount-1900-1.jpg|thumb|St Michael's Mount in 1900]]
It may have been the site of a monastery in the 8th – early 11th centuries and [[Edward the Confessor]] gave it to the [[Normandy|Norman]] abbey of [[Mont Saint-Michel]].<ref name="Pevsner">{{cite book |author=Nikolaus Pevsner, Enid Radcliffe |title=Cornwall |year=1970 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780140710014 |pages=193–195 }}</ref> It was a [[priory]] of that abbey until the dissolution of the [[Alien priories|alien houses]] by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], when it was given to the abbess and Convent of Syon at [[Isleworth]], [[Middlesex]]. It was a resort of [[pilgrimage|pilgrim]]s, whose devotions were encouraged by an [[indulgence]] granted by [[Pope Gregory VII|Pope Gregory]] in the 11th century.

The monastic buildings were built during the 12th century and in 1275 an earthquake destroyed the original priory church, which was rebuilt in the late 14th century. It is still in use today. The priory was seized by the Crown, when [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] went to [[Hundred Years' War#Resumption of the war under Henry V: 1415–1429|war in France]] and it became part of the endowment for the [[Syon Monastery|Brigittine Abbey]] of Syon at [[Twickenham]] in 1424. Thus ended the connection with Mont St Michel.<ref name="Pevsner" /><ref>{{cite book|last=McCabe|first=Helen|title=Houses and Gardens of Cornwall|year=1988|publisher=Tabb House|location=Padstow|isbn=0907018580}}</ref>

Henry Pomeroy captured the Mount, on behalf of [[John of England|Prince John]], in the reign of [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford]], seized and held it during a siege of twenty-three weeks against 6,000 of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV's]] troops in 1473. [[Perkin Warbeck]] occupied the Mount in 1497. [[Humphrey Arundell]], governor of St Michael's Mount, led the rebellion of 1549. During the reign of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], it was given to [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], Earl of Salisbury, by whose son it was sold to [[Francis Bassett|Sir Francis Bassett]]. During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], Sir Arthur Bassett, brother of Sir Francis, held the Mount against the parliament until July 1646.

In 1755 the [[Lisbon earthquake]] caused a [[tsunami]] to strike the Cornish coast over {{convert|1000|mi|km}} away. The sea rose six feet in ten minutes at St Michael's Mount, ebbed at the same rate, and continued to rise and fall for five hours. The 19th-century French writer [[Arnold Boscowitz]] claimed that "great loss of life and property occurred upon the coasts of Cornwall."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=8993 |title=Sources of Cornish History – The Lisbon Earthquake |date=12 September 2011 |publisher=Cornwall Council |accessdate=16 September 2012 }}</ref>

In the late 19th century the skeleton of an [[anchorite]] was discovered when a chamber was found beneath the castle's chapel.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} When the anchorite died of illness or natural causes, the chamber had been sealed off to become his tomb.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The Mount was sold in 1659 to [[John St Aubyn (Parliamentarian)|Colonel John St Aubyn]]. His descendant, Lord St Levan, continues to be the "tenant" of the Mount but has ceased to be resident there, his nephew, James St Aubyn, taking up residency and management of the Mount in 2004.

Little is known about the village before the beginning of 18th century, save that there were a few fishermen's cottages and monastic cottages. After improvements to the harbour in 1727, St Michael's Mount became a flourishing seaport, and by 1811 there were fifty-three houses and four streets. The pier was extended in 1821<ref>{{cite news|title=St Michael's Mount|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wbritonad/cornwall/Newmag-1812-32/1821-Vol-IIIJanDec.html|accessdate=27 December 2012|newspaper=New Monthly Magazine|date=May 1821|page=259}}</ref> and the population peaked in the same year, when the island had 221 people. There were three schools, a [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan chapel]], and three public houses, mostly used by visiting sailors. The village went into decline following major improvements to nearby [[Penzance]] harbour and the extension of the railway to Penzance in 1852, and many of the houses and buildings were demolished.

The Mount was fortified during the [[Second World War]] during the [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II|invasion crisis of 1940–41]]. Three [[British hardened field defences of World War II|pillboxes]] can be seen to this day.{{sfn|Foot|2006|pp=88–93}}

Sixty-five years after the Second World War, it was suggested based on interviews with contemporaries that the former Nazi foreign minister and one time ambassador to Britain, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], had wanted to live on the Mount after the planned German conquest. Archived documents revealed that during his time in Britain in the 1930s, in which he had initially proposed an alliance with Nazi Germany, Ribbentrop frequently visited Cornwall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/03/nazi-foreign-minister-planned-cornwall-retirement |title=Nazi foreign minister planned to own Cornwall as his retirement home |date=3 October 2010 |author=Vanessa Thorpe |publisher=The Observer |accessdate=16 September 2012 }}</ref>

In 1954, the 3rd Baron St Levan gave most of St Michael's Mount to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], together with a large endowment fund.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The [[St Aubyn Baronets|St Aubyn family]] retained a 999-year lease to inhabit the castle and a licence to manage the public viewing of its historic rooms. This is managed in conjunction with the National Trust.

==The island today==
The chapel is extra-[[Diocese|diocesan]], and the [[castle]] is the official residence of [[Baron St Levan|Lord St Levan]]. Many relics, chiefly armour and antique furniture, are preserved in the castle. The chapel of [[Michael (archangel)|St Michael]], a fifteenth-century building, has an embattled tower, in one angle of which is a small [[turret]], which served for the guidance of ships. Chapel Rock, on the beach, marks the site of a [[shrine]] dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], where pilgrims paused to worship before ascending the Mount. A few houses are built on the hillside facing Marazion, and a spring supplies them with water. There is a row of eight houses at the back of the present village; they were built in 1885 and are known as Elizabeth Terrace. A spring supplies them with water. Some of the houses are occupied by staff working in the castle and elsewhere on the island. The island cemetery (currently no public access) contains the graves of former residents of the island and several drowned sailors. There are also buildings that were formerly the steward's house, a changing-room for bathers, the stables, the laundry, a barge house, a sail loft (now a restaurant), and two former inns. A former [[bowling green]] adjoins one of the buildings.

The harbour, widened in 1823 to allow vessels of 500 tons to enter, has a pier dating from the 15th century which was subsequently enlarged and restored. [[Queen Victoria]] landed at the harbour from the royal yacht in 1846, and a brass inlay of her footstep can be seen at the top of the landing stage. King [[Edward VII]]'s footstep is also visible near the bowling-green. In 1967 the [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Mother]] entered the harbour in a [[pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnace]] from the [[HMY Britannia|royal yacht Britannia]].

One of the most noteworthy points of interest on the island is the [[St Michael's Mount Tramway|underground railway]], which is still used to transport goods from the harbour up to the castle. It was built by miners around 1900, replacing the pack horses which had previously been used. Due to the steep gradient, it cannot be used for passengers. The National Trust currently does not permit public access or viewing of the railway.

Some studies indicate that any rise in ocean waters as well as existing natural erosion would put some of the Cornwall coast at risk, including St. Michael's Mount.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/oct/13/conservation |title=South-west England's treasures in danger |date=13 October 2008 |author=Steven Morris |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=16 September 2012 }}</ref>

===Local government===
[[Image:St Michaels Mount.jpg|thumb|right|St Michael's Mount]]
Until recent times both the Mount and the town of Marazion formed part of the parish of [[St Hilary, Cornwall|St Hilary]].<ref name="Blackford" /> St Michael's Mount forms its own [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] for local government purposes. Currently, this takes the form of a parish meeting as opposed to a parish council (that is, a yearly meeting of electors that does not elect councillors). The current chairman of the St Michael's Mount parish meeting is James St Aubyn.

==Geology==
The rock exposures around St Michael's Mount provide an opportunity to see many features of the [[geology of Cornwall]] in a single locality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/geomincentre/02MOUNTS%20BAY.pdf |title=Marazion to Porthleven (virtual geological field excursion) |publisher=University of Exeter |accessdate=16 September 2012 }}</ref> The Mount is made of the uppermost part of a [[granite]] intrusion into [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] [[Devonian]] [[mudstone]]s or [[pelite]]s. The granite is itself mineralised with a well-developed sheeted [[greisen]] vein system. Due to its geology the southern coast of the island was designated a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] in 1995.<ref name=sssi/>

===Granites===
There are two types of granite visible on the Mount. Most of the intrusion is a [[tourmaline]] [[muscovite]] granite which is variably [[porphyritic]]. This is separated from a [[biotite]] muscovite granite by [[pegmatite]]s.

===Devonian Pelites===
Originally laid down as mudstones these pelites were regionally metamorphosed and deformed (mainly [[Fold (geology)|folded]] here) by the [[Variscan orogeny]]. They were then affected by the [[intrusion]] of the granite, which caused further contact metamorphism, locally forming a [[hornfels]], and mineralisation.

===Mineralisation===
The best developed mineralisation is found within the uppermost part of the granite itself in the form of sheeted greisen veins. These steep W-E trending veins are thought to have formed by [[hydraulic fracturing]] when the fluid pressure at the top of the granite reached a critical level. The granite was fractured and the fluids altered the granite by replacing [[feldspar]]s with [[quartz]] and muscovite. The fluids were also rich in [[boron]], [[tin]] and [[tungsten]] and tourmaline, [[wolframite]] and [[cassiterite]] are common in the greisen veins. As the area cooled the veins became open to fluids from the surrounding [[country rock (geology)|country rock]] and these deposited sulphides e.g. [[chalcopyrite]] and [[stannite]]. Greisen veins are also locally developed within the pelites.

==Folklore==
In prehistoric times, St Michael's Mount may have been a port for the [[Tin mining in Britain|tin trade]], and [[Gavin de Beer]] made a case for it to be identified with the "tin port" Ictis/Ictin mentioned by [[Posidonius]].<ref name="ictis" />

It is claimed that [[Michael (archangel)|St Michael, the Archangel]] appeared to local fishermen on the Mount in the 5th century AD,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stmichaelsmount.co.uk/Our-Island-Story/Timeline-of-The-Mount.aspx |title=Timeline of The Mount |publisher=St. Michael's Mount |accessdate=16 September 2012 }}</ref> which according to author Richard Freeman Johnson is perhaps a nationalistic twist to a myth.<ref>{{cite book |author=Richard Freeman Johnson |coauthors= |title=Saint Michael the Archangel in medieval English legend |year=2005 |publisher=Boydell Press |pages=68 |isbn= 1-84383-128-7 }}</ref>

The chronicler [[John of Worcester]]<ref>Noted by de Beer 1960:162f as "Florence of Worcester" in Thomas Forester's edition, London, 1854:206.</ref> relates under the year 1099 that St Michael's Mount was located five or six miles (10&nbsp;km) from the sea, enclosed in a thick wood, but that on the third day of November the sea overflowed the land, destroying many towns and drowning many people as well as innumerable oxen and sheep; the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' records under the date 11 November 1099, "The sea-flood sprung up to such a height, and did so much harm, as no man remembered that it ever did before".<ref>{{cite journal |author=James Ingram, tr |year=1923 |title= |journal=The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle |volume=180 }}</ref> The Cornish legend of [[Lyonesse]], an ancient kingdom said to have extended from Penwith toward the [[Isles of Scilly]], also talks of land being inundated by the sea. One of the earliest references to the Mount (originally named 'Dynsol' or 'Dinsol'), was in the mid 11th century when it was 'Sanctus Michael beside the sea'.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Padel|first1=O J|title=The Cornish background of the Tristan Stories|journal=Cambridge Medieval Studies|volume=1|pages=53-81}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Padel|first1=O J|title=Cornish Place-name Elements|date=1985|publisher=English Place-names Society Volumes 56/57}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
The Mount has featured in a number of films, including the 1979 film ''[[Dracula (1979 film)|Dracula]]'' where it was prominently featured as the exterior of ''[[Castle Dracula]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Derek Pykett|title=British Horror Film Locations|date=2008|publisher=McFarland|page=41|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=atktMkuOvPwC&dq=1979+dracula+st+michael%27s+mount&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref> It appeared in the 1983 [[James Bond]] film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', as two guided missiles armed with nuclear warheads fly over the English countryside and out to sea, passing directly over St Michael's Mount. In the 2003 film ''[[Johnny English]]'' it was used as the exterior of the character [[Pascal Sauvage]]'s French chateau and in 2012, it was a [[filming location]] for the fantasy adventure movie ''[[Mariah Mundi and the Midas Box]]''.

"Mt Saint Michel Mix + Saint Michaels Mount" is the title of an experimental electronic track by musician [[Aphex Twin]], who grew up in Cornwall and in [[Michael Moorcock]]'s series of Fantasy novels about [[Corum Jhaelen Irsei|Prince Corum]], a fictionalised version of St Michael's Mount appears as Moidel's Mount.

It was one of the locations used on [[BBC One 'Balloon' idents|BBC One "Balloon" Idents]] which were used on the channel from 4 October 1997 to 29 March 2002.

The '''Reunion Island day gecko''' ('''''Phelsuma borbonica borbonica''''') is a [[subspecies]] of [[gecko]]s.  It is diurnal and lives in northern [[Réunion]]. It typically dwells on [[banana tree]]s and feeds on [[insect]]s and [[nectar]].

== Description ==
This lizard belongs to the middle-sized  day geckos. It can reach a total length of about 16&nbsp;cm. The colour can vary, depending on which population they belong to. The body colour is bluish green or dark green. The head has a yellowish colour, finely mottled with brown. On the back and tail there are brownish or red-brick coloured dots which form a network of reticulated bars. The read spots on the head and neck are smaller and denser than those on the back. The ventral surface is yellowish with brown marbling.

== Distribution ==
This species only inhabits northern part of [[Réunion]]. It was found at; Les Hauts du Brûlé,   Les Hauts Mensiol, Morne de Patates à Durand, near Bois de Nèfles, Belle-Vue, La Bretagne, Beaumont les Hauts, near St.Marie and Les Hauts de la Perrière near St. Suzanne.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, [[pollen]] and nectar. 

== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be between 25 and 28°C. The humidity should be maintained between 75 and 100. In captivity, these animals can be fed with [[cricket]]s, [[wax moth]]s, [[Tephritidae|fruit flies]], [[mealworm]]s and [[housefly|houseflies]].

The '''American coot''' (''Fulica americana''), also known as a '''mud hen''', is a bird of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Rallidae]]. Though commonly mistaken to be ducks, American coots belong to a distinct order. Unlike the webbed feet of ducks, coots have broad, lobed scales on their lower legs and toes that fold back with each step in order to facilitate walking on dry land.<ref name=Cornell /> Coots live near water, typically inhabiting [[wetlands]] and open water bodies in North America. Groups of coots are called '''covers''' or '''rafts'''. The oldest known coot lived to be 22 years old.<ref name=Cornell />

The American coot is a migratory bird that occupies most of North America. It lives in the Pacific and southwestern United States and Mexico year-round and occupies more northeastern regions during the summer breeding season. In the winter they can be found as far south as Panama.<ref name=Cornell /> Coots generally build floating nests and lay 8–12 eggs per clutch.<ref name=Cornell /> Females and males have similar appearances, but they can be distinguished during aggressive displays by the larger ruff (head plumage) on the male.<ref name="Gullion 2">{{cite journal|last=Gullion|first=Gordon W.|title=The Displays and Calls of the American Coot|journal=The Wilson Bulletin|year=1952|volume=64|issue=2|pages=83–97|url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4158081?uid=3738800&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21102449516981|accessdate=11 July 2013}}</ref> American coots eat primarily algae and other aquatic plants but also animals (both vertebrates and invertebrates) when available.<ref name=Hoyo />

The American coot is listed as “Least Concern” under the IUCN conservation ratings. Hunters generally avoid killing American coots because their meat is not as sought after as that of ducks.<ref name=Cornell />

Much research has been done on the breeding habits of American coots. Studies have found that mothers will preferentially feed offspring with the brightest plume feathers, a characteristic known as chick ornaments.<ref name=davies>{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=Nicholas B. |last2=Krebs |first2=John R. |last3=West |first3=Stuart A. |title=Behavioural Ecology |year=2012 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=West Sussex, UK |isbn=9781405114165 |chapter=8}}</ref> American coots are also susceptible to conspecific brood parasitism and have evolved mechanisms to identify which offspring are theirs and which are from parasitic females.<ref name="Shizuka 2009 223–226" />

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Fulica americana.jpg|thumb|left|Note feet and red top of frontal shield]]
The American coot was first described by [[Johann Friedrich Gmelin]] in 1789. A member of the [[Rallidae]] family, it has three subspecies: ''Fulica americana alai'', ''F. a. caribaea'', and ''F. a. ardesiaca''.<ref name=Hoyo /> These subspecies, however, are sometimes considered to be their own separate species. Including these 'subspecies', there are 11 members of the genus Fulica distributed across the globe.<ref name=tree>{{cite web|title=Fulica|url=http://tolweb.org/Fulica/90226|publisher=Tree of Life Web Project|accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref>

Coot [[fossil]]s from the Middle [[Pleistocene]] of [[California]] have been described as ''Fulica hesterna'' but cannot be separated from the present-day American coot.<ref name=Olson>{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=Storrs L.|title=The Pleistocene Rails of North America|journal=Museum of Natural History|year=1974}}</ref> However, the Pleistocene coot ''Fulica shufeldti'' (formerly ''F. minor''), famously known as part of the [[Fossil Lake]] fauna, quite possibly was a [[paleosubspecies]] of the American coot (as ''Fulica americana shufeldti'') as they only differed marginally in size and proportions from living birds.<ref name=Jehl>{{cite journal|last=Jehl|first=Joseph R.|title=Pleistocene Birds from Fossil Lake, Oregon|journal=The Condor|year=1967|volume=69|issue=1|url=http://sora.unm.edu/node/101598|pages=24–27|doi=10.2307/1366369}}</ref> Thus, it seems that the modern-type American coots [[evolved]] during the mid-late [[Pleistocene]], a few hundred thousand years ago.<ref name=Olson /><ref name=Jehl />

The American coot's genus name, ''[[Fulica]]'', is a direct borrowing of the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for "coot".<ref>{{cite book|last=Jobling|first=James A.|title=Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names|year=2009|publisher=Christopher Helm Publishers|isbn=978-1408125014|pages=165}}</ref> The [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''americana'' means "America".<ref>{{cite book|last=Jobling|first=James A.|title=Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names|year=2009|publisher=Christopher Helm Publishers|isbn=978-1408125014|pages=44}}</ref>

==Description==
The American coot measures {{convert|34|-|43|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|58|-|71|cm|in|abbr=on}} across the wings. Adults have a short, thick, white bill and white [[frontal shield]], which usually has a reddish-brown spot near the top of the bill between the eyes. Males and females look alike, but females are smaller. Body mass in females ranges from {{convert|427|to|628|g|lb|abbr=on}} and in males from {{convert|576|to|848|g|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name = "CRC">''CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses'' by John B.

===Vocalizations===
The American coot has a variety of repeated calls and sounds. Male and female coots make different types of calls to similar situations. Male alarm calls are ''puhlk'' while female alarm calls are ''poonk''. Also, stressed males go ''puhk-cowah'' or ''pow-ur'' while females call ''cooah''.<ref name="Hoyo">{{cite book|last=Hoyo|first=Josep del|title=Handbook of the Birds of the World|year=1996|publisher=Lynx Edicions|isbn=8487334202}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:AirborneCoot.jpg|thumb|left|American coot on take-off]]
American coots are found near water reed-ringed lakes and ponds, open marshes, and sluggish rivers. They prefer freshwater environments but may temporarily live in saltwater environments during the winter months.<ref name=Hoyo/>

The American coot's breeding habitat extends from [[marsh]]es in southern [[Quebec]] to the [[Pacific]] coast of [[North America]] and as far south as northern [[South America]]. Birds from temperate North America east of the Rocky Mountains [[bird migration|migrate]] to the southern [[United States]] and southern [[British Columbia]]. It is often a year-round resident where water remains open in winter. The number of birds that stay year-round near the northern limit of the species' range seems to be increasing.<ref name=Henninger>{{cite journal|last=Henninger|first=W. F.|title=A Preliminary List of Birds in Seneca County, Ohio|journal=The Wilson Bulletin|year=1906|volume=18|issue=2|pages=47–60|url=http://sora.unm.edu/node/123938|jstor=4154076}}</ref><ref name=OOH>{{cite web|title=American Coot|url=http://www.ohiobirds.org/obba2/pdfs/species/AmericanCoot.pdf|publisher=Ohio Ornithological Society|accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref>

Autumn migration occurs from August to December, with males and non-breeders moving south before the females and juveniles. Spring migration to breeding ranges occurs from late February to mid-May, with males and older birds moving North first. There has been evidence of birds travelling as far north as Greenland and Iceland.<ref name=Hoyo />

==Behavior==
[[File:American Coot Flock.jpg|thumb|left|The American coot is regularly found in sizable flocks.]]
The American coot is a highly [[wikt:gregarious|gregarious]] species, particularly in the winter, when its flocks can number in the thousands.<ref name = "Dunne"/>

===Feeding===

The American coot can dive for food but can also forage and scavenge on land. It is [[omnivorous]], eating plant material, [[arthropod]]s, [[fish]], and other aquatic animals. Its principal source of food is aquatic vegetation, especially [[algae]]. During breeding season, coots are more likely to eat aquatic insects and [[mollusk]]s—which constitute the majority of a chick's diet.<ref name=Hoyo/>

===Breeding===
The coot mating season occurs during May and June.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Allison|title=American Coot|url=http://www.biokids.umich.edu/critters/Fulica_americana/|work=BioKids|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=11 July 2013|author2=Rudi Berkelhamer}}</ref> Coot mate pairings are [[monogamous]] throughout their life, given they have a suitable territory. A typical reproductive cycle involves multiple stages: [[pairing]], [[nest]]ing, [[copulation]], egg deposition, [[Avian incubation|incubation]], and [[hatching]].<ref name=gordon>{{cite journal|last=Gullion|first=Gordon|title=Reproductive Cycle in American Coots|journal=Auk|date=October 1954|volume=71|issue=4|pages=366–412|url=http://sora.unm.edu/node/20283|jstor=4081536|doi=10.2307/4081536}}</ref>
The American coot typically has long [[courtship]] periods. This courtship period is characterized by [[Beak#Billing|billing]], bowing, and nibbling. Males generally initiate billing, which is the touching of bills between individuals. As the pair bond becomes more evident, both males and females will initiate billing only with each other and not other males or females. After a pair bond is cemented, the mating pair looks for a territory to build a nest in. A pair bond becomes permanent when a nesting territory is secured. [[Copulation]] behavior among coot pairs always falls under the same general pattern.<ref name=gordon/> First the male chases the female. Then, the female moves to the display platform and squats with her head under the water. The male then mounts the female, using his claws and wings to balance on the female's back while the she brings her head above the water. [[Sexual intercourse]] usually takes no longer than two seconds.<ref name=gordon/>

====Nests====
[[File:Nesting-american-coot.jpg|thumb|Nesting American coot]]
The American coot is a prolific builder and will create multiple structures during a single breeding season. It nests in well-concealed locations in tall reeds. There are three general types of structures: display platforms, egg nests and brood nests.
* Display platforms are used as roosting sites and are left to decompose after copulation. 
* Egg nests are typically {{Convert|30|cm|in|abbr = on}} in diameter with a {{Convert|30|-|38|cm|in|abbr = on}} ramp that allows the parents to enter and exit without tearing the sides of the nests. Coots will often build multiple egg nests before selecting one to lay their eggs in. 
* Brood nests are nests that are either newly constructed or have simply been converted from old egg nests after the eggs hatch. They are simply larger egg nests. 
Since American coots build on the water, their structures disintegrate easily and have short life spans. Egg and brood nests are actually elaborate rafts, and must be constantly added to in order to stay afloat. Females typically do the most work while building.<ref name=gordon/>

====Egg-laying and clutch size====
Females deposit one egg a day until the [[clutch]] is complete. Eggs are usually deposited between sunset and midnight. Typically, early season and first clutches average two more eggs than second nestings and late season clutches. Early season nests see an average of 9.0 eggs per clutch while late clutches see an average of 6.4 eggs per clutch. There is an inverse relationship between egg weights and laying sequence,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Alisauskas|first=Ray T.|title=Variation in the Composition of the Eggs and Chicks of American Coots|journal=The Condor|date=Feb 1986|volume=88|issue=1|pages=84–90|url=http://sora.unm.edu/node/103649|jstor=1367757|doi=10.2307/1367757}}</ref> wherein earlier eggs are larger than eggs laid later in the sequence. It is possible to induce a female coot to lay more eggs than normal by either removing all or part of her clutch. Sometimes, a female may abandon the clutch if enough eggs are removed. Coots, however, do not respond to experimental addition of eggs by laying fewer eggs.<ref name=continuouslaying>{{cite journal|last=Arnold|first=Todd W.|title=Continuous Laying by American Coots in Response to Partial Clutch Removal and Total Clutch Loss|journal=The Auk|date=July 1992|volume=109|series=3|pages=407–421|url=http://sora.unm.edu/node/25126|jstor=4088356}}</ref>

The American coot is a persistent re-nester, and will replace lost clutches with new ones within two days of clutch-loss during deposition. One study showed that 68% of destroyed clutches are eventually replaced. Re-nested clutches are typically smaller than original clutches by one or two eggs, but this could be attributed to differences in time and habitat quality instead of food or nutrient reserves and availability.<ref name=factorsaffecting>{{cite journal|last=Arnold|first=Todd W.|title=Factors Affecting Renesting in American Coots|journal=The Condor|date=May 1993|volume=95|issue=2|pages=273–281|url=http://sora.unm.edu/node/104704|jstor=1369349|doi=10.2307/1369349}}</ref>

Younger females reproduce later in the season and produce smaller eggs than older females. Their offspring are also smaller. However, there is no difference in [[avian clutch size|clutch size]] between older and younger females like in other avian species.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Richard D.|title=Effects of Age on Reproduction in American Coots|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|date=Jan 1980|volume=44|series=1|pages=183–189|jstor=3808364|doi=10.2307/3808364}}</ref>

====Incubation and hatching====
[[Avian incubation|Incubation]] start time in the American coot is variable, and can begin anywhere from the deposition of the first egg to after the clutch is fully deposited. Starting incubation before the entire clutch has been laid is an uncommon practice among birds.<ref name=anexperimentalstudy>{{cite journal|last=Fredrickson|first=Leigh H.|title=An Experimental Study of Clutch Size of the American Coo|journal=The Auk|date=July 1969|volume=86|series=3|pages=541–550|url=http://sora.unm.edu/node/21886|jstor=4083414|doi=10.2307/4083414|issue=3}}</ref> Once incubation starts it continues without interruption. Male and female coots share incubation responsibility, but males do most of the work during the 21-day incubation period. Females will begin to re-nest clutches in an average of six days if clutches are destroyed during incubation.<ref name=factorsaffecting />

Hatch order usually follows the same sequence as laying order. Regardless of clutch size, eight is the typical maximum size of a [[Offspring|brood]]. Egg desertion is a frequent occurrence among coots because females will often deposit more than eight eggs. Brood size limits incubation time, and when a certain number of chicks have hatched the remaining eggs are abandoned. The mechanism for egg abandonment has not yet been discovered. Food resource constraints may limit the number of eggs parents let hatch, or the remaining eggs may not provide enough visual or tactile stimulation to elicit incubation behavior.<ref name=anexperimentalstudy /> An American coot can be forced to hatch more eggs than are normally laid. These additional offspring, however, suffer higher [[mortality rate]]s due to inadequacy in brooding or feeding ability.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ryan|first=Mark R.|author2=James J. Dinsmore|title=A Quantitative Study of the Behavior of Breeding American Coots|journal=The Auk|date=May 1979|volume=96|pages=704–713|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v096n04/p0704-p0713.pdf}}</ref>

====Maternal effects====
[[Hormones]] that are passed down from the mother into the egg affect offspring growth, behavior, and social interactions. These nongenetic contributions by the mother are known as [[maternal effect]]s. In the American coot, two levels of [[androgen]] and [[testosterone]] variation have been discovered—within-clutch and among-clutch variation. Within the same clutch, eggs laid earlier in the sequence have higher testosterone levels than eggs laid later in the sequence. Females that lay three clutches deposit more androgens into their yolks than females who lay only one or two clutches.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reed|first=Wendy L.|author2=Carol M. Vleck|title=Functional significance of variation in egg-yolk androgens in the American coot|journal=Oecologia|date=March 2001|volume=128|pages=164–171|url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~cvleck/pdf/2001Oec.pdf|doi=10.1007/s004420100642|issue=2}}</ref>

===Brood parasitism===
The American coot has a mixed reproductive strategy, and [[conspecific]] [[Brood parasite|brood parasitism]] is a common alternative reproductive method. In one 4-year study, researchers found that 40% of nests were parasitized, and that 13% of all eggs were laid by females in nests that were not their own.<ref name = lyon>{{cite journal|last=Lyon|first=Bruce|author2=et al.|title=Conspecfic brood parasitism as a flexible female reproductive tactic in American coots|journal=Animal Behavior|date=October 1992|volume=46|pages=911–928|url=http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/lyon/Lyon%20reprints/Lyon_1993.pdf|doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1273|issue=5}}</ref> Increasing reproductive success under social and ecological constraints is the primary reason for brood parasitism. Floater females without territories or nests use brood parasitism as their primary method of reproduction, if they breed at all. Other females may engage in brood parasitism if their partially complete clutches are destroyed. Conspecific brood parasitic behavior is most common among females trying to increase their total number of offspring. Food supply is the limiting factor to chick survival and starvation is the most common cause of chick morbidity. Parasitic females bypass the parental care constraint of feeding by laying additional parasitic eggs in addition to their normal nest.<ref name=lyon />

When a parasitic female lays her egg in a host female’s nest, the host female experiences a deposition rate of two eggs per day. Host females may recognize parasitic eggs when the egg deposition pattern deviates from the traditional one egg per day pattern.<ref name=continuouslaying /> The occurrence of brood parasitism may be influenced by the body size of the potential parasitic female relative to the potential host female. Parasitic females are generally larger than their host counterparts, but on average, there is no size difference between the parasite and the host.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lyon|first=Bruce|author2=et al.|title=Ecological and social constraints on conspeci?c brood parasitism by nesting female American coots (Fulica americana)|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|year=2003|volume=72|pages=47–61|url=http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/lyon/Lyon%20reprints/Lyon_2003_JAE.pdf|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2656.2003.00674.x}}</ref>

The American coot, unlike other parasitized species, has the ability to recognize and reject conspecific parasitic chicks from their brood.<ref name="Shizuka 2009 223–226">{{cite journal|last=Shizuka|first=Daizaburo|author2=Lyon, Bruce E.|title=Coots use hatch order to recognize and reject conspecific brood parasitic chicks|journal=Nature|volume=463|pages=223–226|doi=10.1038/nature08655|pmid=20016486|issue=7278|date=16 December 2009}}</ref> Parents aggressively reject parasite chicks by pecking them vigorously, drowning them, preventing them from entering the nest, etc. They learn to recognize their own chicks by imprinting on cues from the first chick that hatches. The first-hatched chick is a reference to which parents discriminate between later-hatched chicks. Chicks that do not match the imprinted cues are then recognized as parasite chicks and are rejected.<ref name="Shizuka 2009 223–226"/>

Chick recognition reduces the costs associated with parasitism, and coots are one of only three bird species in which this behavior has evolved. This is because hatching order is predictable in parasitized coots—host eggs will reliably hatch before parasite eggs. In other species where hatching order is not as reliable, there is a risk of [[Imprinting (psychology)|misimprinting]] on a parasite chick first and then rejecting their own chicks. In these species, the cost of accidentally misimprinting is greater than the benefits of rejecting parasite chicks.<ref name="Shizuka 2009 223–226"/>

===Chick ornaments===
[[File:Fulica americana3.jpg|thumb|American coot with two chicks]]
The first evidence for parental selection of exaggerated, ornamental traits in offspring was found in American coots.<ref name="Lyon 1994 240–242">{{cite journal|last=Lyon|first=Bruce|author2=et al.|title=Parental choice selects for ornamental plumage in American Coot chicks|journal=Nature|date=September 1994|volume=371|pages=240–242|doi=10.1038/371240a0|issue=6494}}</ref> Black American coot chicks have conspicuously orange-tipped ornamental [[plume (feather)|plume]]s covering the front half of their body that are known as “chick ornaments” that eventually get bleached out after six days. This brightly colored, exaggerated trait makes coot chicks more susceptible to predation and does not aid in thermoregulation, but remains selected for by parental choice. These plumes are not necessary for chick viability, but increased chick ornamentation increases the likelihood that a chick will be chosen as a favorite by the parents. Experimental manipulation of chick ornamentation by clipping the bright plumes has shown that parents prefer ornamented chicks over non-ornamented ones.<ref name="Lyon 1994 240–242"/>

==Predation==
The American coot is fairly aggressive in defense of its eggs and, in combination with their protected nesting habitat, undoubtedly helps reduce losses of eggs and young to all but the most determined and effective predators. [[American crow]]s, [[black-billed magpie]]s and [[Forster's tern]] can sometime take eggs. Mammalian predators (including [[red fox]]es, [[coyote]]s, [[skunk]]s and [[raccoon]]s) are even less likely to predate coot nests, though nests are regularly destroyed in usurpation by [[muskrat]]s. Conversely, the bold behavior of immature and adult coots leads to them falling prey with relative regularity once out of the breeding season. Regular, non-nesting-season predators include [[great horned owl]]s, [[northern harrier]]s, [[bald eagle]]s, [[golden eagle]]s, [[American alligator]]s, [[bobcat]]s, [[great black-backed gull|great black-backed]] and [[California gull]]s. In fact, coots may locally comprise more than 80% of the bald eagle diet.<ref name="Brisbin, Jr.Mowbray2002">{{cite journal|last1=Brisbin, Jr.|first1=I. Lehr|last2=Mowbray|first2=Thomas B.|last3=Poole|first3=A.|last4=Gill|first4=F.|title=American Coot (Fulica americana)|journal=The Birds of North America Online|year=2002|doi=10.2173/bna.697a|editor1-last=Poole|editor1-first=A|editor2-last=Gill|editor2-first=F}}</ref>

==In culture==
On the Louisiana coast, the [[Cajun]] word for coot is '''''pouldeau''''', from [[French (language)|French]] for "coot", ''poule d'eau'' – literally "water hen". Coot can be used for cooking; it is somewhat popular in [[Cajun cuisine]], for instance as an ingredient for [[gumbo]]s cooked at home by duck hunters.<ref name=Gumbo>{{cite web|last=Horst|first=Gerald|title=Chuck Buckley's Duck (Coot) Gumbo|url=http://www.louisianasportsman.com/details.php?id=4545|publisher=Louisiana Sportsman|accessdate=11 July 2013}}</ref>

The bird is the mascot of the [[Toledo Mud Hens]] [[Minor League Baseball]] team.<ref name="Toledo Mudhens">{{cite web|title=Toledo Mudhens|url=http://www.milb.com/index.jsp?sid=t512|publisher=Minor League Baseball|accessdate=11 July 2013}}</ref>

==Conservation and threats==
The American coot is listed under "least concern" by the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. They are common and widespread, and are sometimes even considered a pest. They are rarely the targets of hunters since their meat is not considered to be as good as that of ducks; although some are shot for sport, particularly in the southeastern United States. Because they are found in wetlands, scientists use them to monitor toxin levels and pollution problems in these environments.<ref name="Cornell">{{cite web|title=American Coot|url=http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/american_Coot/lifehistory|work=allaboutbirds.org}}</ref>

'''Lady Anne Clifford, 14th Baroness de Clifford, Countess Dowager of Dorset, Pembroke and Montgomery''' (30 January 1590 &ndash; 22 March 1676) was the only surviving child of [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland]] (1558&ndash;1605) by his wife [[Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland|Lady Margaret Russell]], daughter of [[Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford]].<ref name=dnb>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Clifford, Anne}}</ref><ref>[http://thepeerage.com/p2940.htm#i29392 Record for ''Anne Clifford, Baroness Clifford'' on ''thepeerage.com'']</ref> In 1605, she became the ''[[suo jure]]'' Baroness Clifford and hereditary [[High Sheriff of Westmorland]].<ref name=dnb/>

She was a patron of authors and literature; and her many letters and diary made her a literary personage in her own right.

==Early years==
Lady Anne was born on 30 January 1590 and baptised the following 22 February at Skipton Church in [[Yorkshire]].

Her parents' marriage was soured by the deaths of Anne's two elder brothers: her parents lived apart for most of her childhood.  Upon the death of her father which occurred on 30 October 1605, she succeeded to the title of ''[[suo jure]]'' Baroness Clifford but her father had willed his earldom and estates to his brother [[Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland]]. In her young adulthood she was involved in a long and complex legal battle to obtain the family estates,<ref>http://www.thePeerage.com</ref> (which had been granted by [[Edward II]] under [[primogeniture#Absolute cognatic primogeniture|absolute cognatic primogeniture]]) instead of the £15,000 willed to her. The main grounds were that she was 15 years old at the time. It was not until Francis' only son Henry died without a male heir in 1643 that she managed to secure the family estates, although it was 1649 before she could take possession.<ref>DeMers, p. 123.</ref>

She was brought up in an almost entirely female household&mdash;evoked in [[Emilia Lanier]]'s ''Description of Cookeham''&mdash;and given an excellent education by her tutor, the poet [[Samuel Daniel]]. As a child she was a favourite of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]]; she also danced in [[masque]]s with [[Anne of Denmark]], queen of King [[James I of England]]. She was the Nymph of the Air in Daniel's masque ''Tethys's Festival'', and filled roles in several of the early court masques of [[Ben Jonson]], including ''[[The Masque of Beauty]]'' (1608) and ''[[The Masque of Queens]]'' (1609).

==Marriages==
Lady Anne's first husband was [[Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset]], whom she married on 27 February 1609. After his death in 1624, she married [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Philip Herbert, Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery]] in 1630. She was Herbert's second wife; his first wife, [[Susan de Vere, Countess of Montgomery|Lady Susan de Vere]] had died the year before. Both marriages were reportedly difficult; contemporaries sometimes cited Lady Anne's unyielding personality as a cause. (Her cousin [[Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford]] compared her to the [[Rhone River]].)<ref>Richardson, p. 117.</ref> A more sympathetic view would blame some of the troubles in her first marriage on her husband's spendthrift extravagance and his infidelities.

She bore five children by her first husband&mdash; although none of their three sons survived to adulthood. Her two surviving daughters both married and had issue. A central conflict with her second husband lay in her decision to allow her younger daughter to make her own choice of husband. The younger daughter, Lady Isabella Sackville (1622-1661), married James, 3rd Earl of Northampton. Lady Anne's elder daughter, Lady Margaret Sackville (1614-1676) married John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet (1609-1664) and had eleven children. Isabella's children died without issue, and Lady Isabella's inheritances from Lady Anne subsequently reverted to the Earls of Thanet.

[[File:Clifford Family.jpg|thumb|right|A [[triptych]] portrait of the Clifford family. Lady Anne is depicted on the left panel, aged 15, and on the right, aged 56]]

==Arts patron==
She was an important patron of authors and literature; her letters, and the diary she kept from 1603 to 1616, have made her a secondary literary figure in her own right. [[John Donne]] is reported to have said that she could "discourse of all things from Predestination to Slea-silk". The artist [[Jan van Belcamp]] painted a [[triptych]] portrait of Anne Clifford to her own design and specifications. Titled "The Great Picture," it portrays Lady Anne at three points in her life&mdash;at age 56, at age 15, and before birth in her mother's womb. In connection with the painting, Anne Clifford dated her own conception to 1 May 1589&mdash;certainly an unusual act of precision.<ref>Snook, p. 1</ref>

In 1656, she erected the [[Countess Pillar]] in memory of her late mother. She restored churches at [[Appleby-in-Westmorland]], [[Ninekirks]], [[Brougham, Cumbria|Brougham]] and [[Mallerstang]]. She was also responsible for the improvement and expansion of many of the Clifford family's castles across Northern [[England]], including those at [[Pendragon Castle|Pendragon]] (Mallerstang), [[Brough Castle|Brough]], [[Skipton Castle|Skipton]], [[Appleby Castle|Appleby]], and [[Brougham Castle|Brougham]]. After moving north, she rotated her residences amongst her castles, living in various ones for several months to a year at a time. She died in Brougham, in the same room where her father had been born and her mother had died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.castlexplorer.co.uk/england/appleby/appleby.php|title=Appleby Castle|accessdate=1 December 2007|publisher=Castle Explorer}}</ref>

She served as [[High Sheriff of Westmorland]] from 1653 to 1676. At her death, aged 86, she was the Dowager Countess of Dorset, Pembroke, and Montgomery. Her tomb is in [[St Lawrence's Church, Appleby|St Lawrence's Church, Appleby-in-Westmorland]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

[[File:EnglandBirmingham.svg|thumb|Location of the Birmingham area within England.]]
'''Brummie''' (sometimes '''Brummy''') is a colloquial term for the inhabitants, [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] and [[dialect]] of [[Birmingham]], England, as well as being a general adjective used to denote a connection with the city, locally called ''Brum''. The terms are all derived from [[Brummagem]] or Bromwichham, historical variants or alternatives to Birmingham.

==Accent==
The Brummie accent is an example of a [[regional accents of English|regional accent]] of [[English language|English]].

Examples of celebrity speakers include, comedian [[Jasper Carrott]], hip-hop and garage musician [[Mike Skinner (musician)|Mike Skinner]], rock musicians [[Ozzy Osbourne]] (and all other members of the original [[Black Sabbath]]), [[Roy Wood]], [[Jeff Lynne]] ([[Electric Light Orchestra|ELO]] founders), [[Rob Halford]] ([[Judas Priest]]), [[Barney Greenway]] ([[Napalm Death]]), [[Dave Pegg]] (of [[Fairport Convention]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]),  broadcaster [[Les Ross]], politician [[Clare Short]], [[Special Air Service|SAS]] soldier and author [[John "Brummie" Stokes]] and many actresses and actors; [[Martha Howe-Douglas]], [[Donnaleigh Bailey]], [[Nicolas Woodman]], [[Sarah Smart]], [[John Oliver (entertainer)|John Oliver]] and [[Ryan Cartwright]].

It is not the only accent of the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], although the term Brummie is often erroneously used in referring to all accents of the region.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} It is markedly distinct from the traditional accent of the adjacent [[Black Country]], although modern-day population mobility has tended to blur the distinction. For instance, [[Dudley]]-born comedian [[Lenny Henry]], Daniel Taylor, [[Smethwick]]-born actress [[Julie Walters]], award winning soap actress [[Jan Pearson]], comedian [[Frank Skinner]], [[Bill Oddie]], and [[Adrian Chiles]] are sometimes mistaken for Brummie-speakers by people outside the West Midlands county.

Additionally, population mobility has meant that to a degree, the Brummie accent extends into some parts of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Solihull]], although much of the accent within the borough might be considered to be closer to contemporary RP. For example [[Solihull]]-born presenter [[Richard Hammond]] (despite often being referred to as a Brummie) does not speak with a strong Brummie accent.

The Brummie accent and the [[Coventry#Accent|Coventry accent]] are also quite distinct in their differences, despite only 17 miles ( 27&nbsp;km) separating the cities. To the untrained ear, however, all of these accents may sound very similar, just as British English speakers can find it hard to distinguish between different [[North American English regional phonology|North American accents]], or Australian and New Zealand accents.

As with all English regional accents, the Brummie accent also grades into [[Received Pronunciation|RP English]]. The accent of presenter [[Cat Deeley]] is listed by her voiceover agency, Curtis Brown, as "RP/Birmingham".

The strength of a person's accent varies greatly all across  Birmingham.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Like most cities, the accent changes relative to the area of the city. A common misconception is that everyone in Birmingham speaks the same accent. It could be argued Brummie is an accent rather than a dialect as in  Black Country which is a dialect with unique words and phrases, as in owamya? For How are you? Which many comment is not used in Brummie speech. Similarly Brummies pronounce 'I' as 'oy' whereas Black Country uses the dialect 'Ah' as in 'Ah bin' meaning I have been.

There are also differences between Brummie and [[Black Country]] accents not readily apparent to people from outside the West Midlands.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} A Black Country accent and a Birmingham accent can be hard to distinguish if neither accent is that broad. The phonetician John Wells has admitted that he cannot tell any difference between the accents.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wells |first=John |url=http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2011/06/black-country.html |title=John Wells’s phonetic blog: the Black Country |publisher=Phonetic-blog.blogspot.com |date=2011-06-13 |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref>  Urszula Clark has proposed the FACE vowel as a difference, with Birmingham speakers' using /??/ and Black Country speakers' using /æ?/.<ref>Handbook of Varieties of English, Mouton de Gruyter, 2004, page 148</ref>  She also mentions that Black Country speakers are more likely to use /??/ where most other accents use /ju?/ (in words such as new, Hugh, stew, etc.).<ref>Handbook of Varieties of English, Mouton de Gruyter, 2004, page 151</ref>

Below are some common features of a recognisable Brummie accent (a given speaker may not necessarily use all, or use a feature consistently). The letters enclosed in square brackets{{spaced ndash}}{{IPA|[]}}{{spaced ndash}}use the [[Help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]].  The corresponding example texts enclosed in double quotes (") are spelt so that a reader using [[received pronunciation]] (RP) can approximate the sounds.

* The vowel of ''mouth'' (RP {{IPA|[a?]}}) can be {{IPA|[æ?]}} or {{IPA|[æ?]}}
* The vowel of ''goat'' (RP {{IPA|[??]}}) can be close to {{IPA|[??]}} (so to an RP speaker, ''goat'' may sound like "gout")
* Final unstressed {{IPA|/i/}}, as in ''happy'', may be realized as {{IPA|[?i]}}, though this varies considerably between speakers
* The letters ''ng'' often represent {{IPA|/??/}} where RP has just {{IPA|/?/}} (e.g. ''singer'' as {{IPA|[si???]}}). See [[Phonological history of English consonants#''Ng''-coalescence|''Ng''-coalescence]]
* Both the vowels of ''strut'' and ''foot'' are pronounced {{IPA|[?]}}, as in northern England. See [[Phonological history of the high back vowels#Foot–strut split|foot–strut split]]
* The majority of Brummies use the Northern {{IPA|[a]}} in words like ''bath'', ''cast'' and ''chance'', although the Southern {{IPA|[??]}} is more common amongst older speakers.<ref>Handbook of Varieties of English, Mouton de Gruyter, 2004, pages 145-6</ref>
* The vowels in "price" and "choice" may be almost merged as {{IPA|[??]}} so that the two words would almost rhyme. However, the two are still distinct, unlike the Black Country dialect.
* In more old-fashioned Brummie accents, the FORCE set of words takes {{IPA|[???]}} and the PURE set takes {{IPA|[u??]}}, so both sets were in two syllables. In such an old-fashioned accent, the words ''paw, pour'' and ''poor'' would all be said differently: {{IPA|[p??]}}, {{IPA|[p???]}}, {{IPA|[pu??]}}.  In more modern accents, all three are said as {{IPA|[p??]}}<ref>John Wells, ''Accents of English'', page 364, [[Cambridge University Press]], 1981.</ref>
* Final unstressed {{IPA|/?/}} may be realised as {{IPA|[a]}}
* In a few cases, voicing of final {{IPA|/s/}} (e.g. ''bus'' as {{IPA|[b?z]}})
* Some rolling of prevocalic {{IPA|/r/}} (some speakers; e.g. in "crime")

Recordings of Brummie speakers with phonetic features described in [[SAMPA]] format can be found at the ''Collect Britain'' dialects site.<ref>[http://www.collectbritain.co.uk/ Collect Britain], Samples of Birmingham speech. (WMA format, with annotations on phonology, lexis and grammar.)</ref>

Rhymes and vocabulary in the works of [[William Shakespeare]] suggest that he used a local dialect (Birmingham and his birthplace, [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], are both in the English West Midland dialect area and only about 35 miles apart).{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Stereotypes===
A study was conducted in 2008 where people were asked to grade the [[intelligence]] of a person based on their accent and the Brummie accent was ranked as the least intelligent accent. It even scored lower than being silent, an example of the [[stereotype]] attached to the Brummie accent.<ref>[http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article3671116.ece Brummie accent is perceived as 'worse than silence'], ''[[The Times]]'', 4 April 2008.</ref>

According to ''Birmingham English: A Sociolinguistic Study'' ([[Steve Thorne]], 2003), among UK listeners "Birmingham English in previous academic studies and opinion polls consistently fares as the most disfavoured variety of British English, yet with no satisfying account of the dislike".
He alleges that, overseas visitors in contrast find it "lilting and melodious", and from this claims that such dislike is driven by various linguistic myths and social factors peculiar to the UK ("social [[snobbery]], negative media [[stereotyping]], the poor public image of the City of Birmingham, and the north/south geographical and linguistic divide"). However, the Brummie accent is the only 'northern' accent to receive such attention.

For instance, despite the city's cultural and innovative history, its industrial background (as depicted by the arm-and-hammer in [[Coat of arms of Birmingham|Birmingham's coat of arms]]) has led to a muscular and unintelligent stereotype: a "Brummagem screwdriver" or "Brummie screwdriver" is UK slang for a hammer.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

[[Steve Thorne]] also cites the mass media and entertainment industry where actors, usually non-Birmingham, have used inaccurate accents and/or portrayed negative roles.

Advertisements are another medium where many perceive stereotypes. Journalist Lydia Stockdale, writing in the [[Birmingham Post]],<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Perspective:+Pig+ignorant+about+the+Brummie+accent%3B+Lydia+Stockdale...-a0125619689 "Pig ignorant about the Brummie accent"] Birmingham Post, 2 December 2004 (From The Free Library)</ref> commented on advertisers' association of Birmingham accents with pigs: the pig in the ad for Colman's Potato Bakes, [[Nick Park]]'s [[Hells Angel]] Pigs for [[Centrica|British Gas]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s "Dave the window-cleaner pig" all had Brummie accents. In 2003, a [[Halifax (United Kingdom bank)|Halifax]] bank advertisement featuring [[Howard Brown (Halifax Bank)|Howard Brown]], a Birmingham- born and based employee, was replaced by an animated version with an exaggerated comical accent overdubbed by a [[Cockney]] actor.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,878221,00.html Face of the Halifax given a makeover ... and a cockney's voiceover], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 January 2003.</ref>

==Dialect==
According to the [[PhD]] thesis of [[Steve Thorne]] at the [[University of Birmingham]] Department of English,{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Birmingham English is "a dialectal hybrid of northern, southern, [[English Midlands|Midlands]], [[Warwickshire]], [[Staffordshire]] and [[Worcestershire]] speech", also with elements from the languages and dialects of its [[British Asian|Asian]] and [[British Afro-Caribbean community|Afro-Caribbean]] communities.

Traditional expressions include:<ref>[http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/lifestyle/50-top-birmingham-black-country-6477059%7C  Birmingham Mail Survey]</ref>

; Babby : variation of "baby"
; Bawlin, bawl : to weep, as in ''"She started to bawl'"''
; Cob : a bread roll (comes from the fact that bread rolls look like street cobbles)
; Gambol : a West Midlands term for a forward roll
; Go and play up your own end : said to children from a different street making a nuisance. It has been used as the title of the autobiographical book and musical play about the Birmingham childhood of radio presenter and entertainer Malcolm Stent
; Our wench : affectionate term, meaning 'sister' or sometimes used by a husband referring to his wife; derived from the older 16th and 17th meaning of "woman"
; The outdoor : exclusive West Midlands term for off license
; Pop : another word for a carbonated drink, e.g. '' "Do you want a glass of pop?". '' (common in other parts of England)
; Snap : food, a meal, allegedly derived from the act of eating itself (example usage ''"I'm off to get my snap"'' equates to ''"I'm leaving to get my dinner"''). May also refer to the tin containing lunch, a "snap tin", as taken down the pit by miners
; Scrage: a scratched cut, where skin is sliced off. For example ''"I fell over and badly scraged my knee"''
; Suff : another word for drain, as in ''"put it down the suff"''
; Throw a wobbly : to become sulky or have a tantrum
; Trap : to leave suddenly, or flee
; Up the cut : up the canal (not unique to Birmingham)
; Yampy : (often "dead yampy") mad, daft, barmy (also used is the word "saft", as in ''"yow big saft babbie"''). Many Black Country folk{{Specify|date=April 2009}} believe "yampy" is a Black Country word, originating from the Dudley-Tipton area, which has been appropriated and claimed as their own by both Birmingham and Coventry dialects, although yampy is found in areas of the black country both outside Birmingham and Tipton/Dudley so might have been a general south Staffordshire and north Worcestershire areas.

'''Lushnjë''' ({{IPA-sq|?lu???|[[Albanian language|Albanian]]:}}) ('''Lushnje''' (?lu??e) in Lushnje's own dialect) is a city in Central-West [[Albania]] located at 40.95°N, 19.71°E. It is the center of the [[District of Lushnje]] in the [[County of Fier]] and has a population of about 54,813.<ref name="Municipality of LushnjePlani rregullues">{{cite web|url=http://www.bashkialushnje.gov.al/urbanistika/plani-rregullues|title=Plani rregullues|last=Municipality of Lushnje|year=2010|language=Albanian|accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref> The town was founded in late medieval times by a widow called Salushe. She built a rest stop called Hani i Salushes on the road from [[Durrës]] to [[Berat]] and [[Fier]], giving birth to the town. As of 2000, old men still called the town Salushe. Lushnje is the only town in Albania founded by a woman.

In January 1920, Lushnje was a provisional capital of Albania and the place of the [[Congress of Lushnje]]. Chieftains of Albania assembled in the town and declared [[Tirana]] first a provisional and then the definitive capital of [[Albania]].

The Lushnje district is known as a main provider of agricultural products to the rest of the country. It is one of very few field districts of mountainous Albania.

During the Communist Regime the town had a number of factories: among them food processing and building materials, which were closed down for one reason or another in the aftermath of the fall of Communism. Stadium of Lushnje Abdurrahman Roza Haxhiu was the only stadium in the country where women were soccer fans as much as men were, and attended the soccer matches. This shows that the town was exceptionally liberal, peaceful and emancipated. Unfortunately that tradition has expired, and now Lushnje resembles all the neighboring towns.

3 km away from Lushnje is the Savra Field. This field is on the Lushnje-Fier road. Here the first battle between [[Principality of Zeta]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] occurred in 1385 (the [[Battle of Savra]]). In this battle [[Balsha II]] was killed. Along with Fier, Lushnje was the main district of the concentration camps during the Communist Regime; some of the camps included the villages of Savër, Gradishtë, Bedat, Gjazë, Rrapëz, Plug, etc.

Data from the 1918 census shows that the population of Lushnja was split almost evenly between Muslims and Christians at the time of independence from the Ottoman Empire. <ref name="uni-graz">{{cite web|url=http://www-gewi.uni-graz.at/seiner/marriage_patterns.html#map5|title=Regional variation in marriage patterns in Albania at the beginning of the 20th century|author=Siegfried Gruber|publisher=www-gewi.uni-graz.at|accessdate=2014-06-11}}, Seiner's 1918 data mapped here: http://www-gewi.uni-graz.at/seiner/density.html</ref> The Christians are mostly Orthodox, but there is a Catholic minority, while similarly the Muslims are mostly Sunni with a Bektashi minority. In modern days, like elsewhere in Albania, people in Lushnja tend not to be very religious if religious at all, regardless of whatever religion their ancestors professed.

'''''Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union''''', {{ussc|521|844|1997}}, is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which all nine Justices of the Court voted to strike down anti-[[indecency]] provisions of the [[Communications Decency Act]] (CDA), because they violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s guarantee of [[freedom of speech]]. Two Justices concurred in part and dissented in part to the decision. This was the first major Supreme Court ruling on the regulation of materials distributed via the [[Internet]].

== Background ==
The Communications Decency Act was an attempt to protect minors from explicit material on the Internet by criminalizing the knowing transmission of "obscene or indecent" messages to any recipient under 18; and also the knowing sending to a person under 18 of anything "that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs".

The government's main defense of the CDA was that similar decency laws had been upheld in three prior Supreme Court decisions: ''[[Ginsberg v. New York]]'' (1968); ''[[F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation]]'' (1978); and ''[[Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.]]'' (1986); and that the CDA should be similarly upheld.

In ''[[Ginsberg v. New York]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that material that is not obscene may nonetheless be harmful for children, and its marketing may be regulated.

In ''[[F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation]]'', the Supreme Court had upheld the possibility of the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] delivering administrative sanctions to a [[radio station]] for broadcasting [[George Carlin]]'s monologue on "[[Filthy Words]]". In ''Reno v. ACLU'', though, the Supreme Court held that this was not [[case law]] justifying the CDA, as the FCC's sanctions were not criminal punishments; and TV and radio broadcasts, "as a matter of history, had 'received the most limited First Amendment protection'…in large part because warnings could not adequately protect the listener from unexpected program content", as opposed to Internet users, who must take "a series of affirmative steps" to access explicit material.

Finally, in ''[[Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.]]'', the Supreme Court had upheld a zoning ordinance that kept adult movie theaters out of residential neighborhoods. The government argued that the CDA was an attempt to institute "a sort of 'cyberzoning' on the Internet". In ''Reno v. ACLU'', however, the Court ruled that the "time, place, and manner regulation" that ''Renton'' had enacted was not similar to the CDA, which was "a content-based blanket restriction on speech".

== Opinion of the Court ==
In a nuanced decision, Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] wrote of the differences between Internet communication and previous types of communication that the Court had ruled on. In conclusion, he wrote:

:We are persuaded that the CDA lacks the precision that the First Amendment requires when a statute regulates the content of speech. In order to deny minors access to potentially harmful speech, the CDA effectively suppresses a large amount of speech that adults have a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another. That burden on adult speech is unacceptable if less restrictive alternatives would be at least as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was enacted to serve.  (...)

:It is true that we have repeatedly recognized the governmental interest in protecting children from harmful materials.  But that interest does not justify an unnecessarily broad suppression of speech addressed to adults.  As we have explained, the Government may not "reduc[e] the adult population...to...only what is fit for children."  ''(footnotes removed)''

The rest of the CDA, including the "[[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]]" provision protecting [[Internet service provider]]<nowiki/>s from being liable for the words of others, was not affected by this decision and remains law.

=== Concurring opinion ===
[[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]], joined by [[William Rehnquist|Chief Justice Rehnquist]], agreed with the decision "as of 1997", but expressed interest in the idea of creating an "adult zone" on the Internet that was made inaccessible to minors through "gateway technology" that had been investigated by a lower district court. If such technology could be introduced, they wrote, zoning portions of the Internet to prohibit adult content could be as constitutional as such zoning is in the physical world. (See  [[.xxx|.xxx top-level domain]]. An alternate proposal promoted by [[free speech]] advocates claims that a "[[.kids]]" domain would be more feasible and constitutional.)

The two dissented in part, writing they would have invalidated a narrower portion of the two CDA provisions under review.

The '''sora''' (''Porzana carolina'') is a small waterbird of the family [[Rallidae]], sometimes also referred to as the sora rail or sora crake.

They have a short thick yellow bill, with black markings on the face at the base of the bill and on the throat. Sexes are similar, but young soras lack the black facial markings and have a whitish face and buff breast. They weigh about {{convert|49|-|112|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Robbins" />

The sora's breeding habitat is [[marsh]]es throughout much of [[North America]].<ref>{{Cite book
 |title = Field Guide to the Birds of North America |publisher = National Geographic
 |year= 2002|edition=4th |location = Washington D.C.}}</ref> They nest in a well-concealed location in dense vegetation. The female usually lays 10 to 12 [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s, sometimes as many as 18, in a cup built from marsh vegetation. The eggs do not all hatch together. Both parents [[incubate (bird)|incubate]] and feed the young, who leave the nest soon after they hatch and are able to fly within a month.

They [[bird migration|migrate]] to the southern [[United States]] and northern [[South America]]. Sora is a very rare vagrant to western [[Europe]], where it can be confused with [[spotted crake]]. However, the latter species always has spotting on the breast. a streaked crown stripe, and a different wing pattern.

Soras forage while walking or swimming. They are [[omnivore]]s, eating [[seed]]s, [[insect]]s and [[snail]]s. Although soras are more often heard than seen, they are sometimes seen walking near open water. They are fairly common, despite a decrease in suitable habitat in recent times. The call is a slow whistled ''ker-whee'', or a descending whinny. The use of call broadcasts greatly increases the chances of hearing a sora. Call broadcasts can also increase the chances of seeing a sora, as they will often investigate the source of the call.

==Distribution==
Soras occur throughout most of North America.<ref name=r10/> Soras breed from Nova Scotia northwest to southern Yukon and Northwest Territories, south to California, Arizona, and New Mexico and northeast to Pennsylvania and New England. Sora wintering grounds include the northern portions of South America, including Ecuador, Columbia, and Venezuela, north through Central America and Mexico to southern California in the West and coastal regions of the Southeast. From southern Kansas south to northern and eastern Texas and east through the inland areas of the southeastern United States, soras are typically only observed during migration in the spring and fall. In a few areas of the western United States, including central California and areas of Arizona and New Mexico, soras may occur year round.<ref name=r10>Cornell Lab of Ornithology. 2003.

==Plant communities==
Soras are commonly reported in plant communities dominated by [[cattails]] (''Typha'' spp.),<ref name=r8/><ref name=r24/><ref name=r28/><ref name=r34>Lor, Socheata Krystyne. 2000.

Management, habitat selection, and feeding ecology of migrant rails and shorebirds. Columbia, MO: University of Missouri. Thesis</ref><ref name=r50/>

Outside of wetlands, soras are most often reported in cultivated areas during migration or in the postbreeding period. For instance, a sora was observed {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} from marshland in a cultivated field in Iowa in the middle of August. A male sora was observed less than {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} from a large wetland in a soybean (''Glycine max'') field in northwestern Iowa during the postbreeding period.<ref name=r26/> From early June to mid-July, soras were observed on farms in Saskatchewan sown mainly with wheat (''Triticum aestivum'').<ref name=r57/>

Soras have also been reported in flooded wooded areas.<ref name=r34/><ref name=r19>Gibbs, James P.; Longcore, Jerry G.; McAuley, Daniel G.; Ringelman, James K. 1991. Use of wetland habitats by selected non-game water birds in Maine. Fish and Wildlife Research No. 9. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service</ref> In western New York, soras occurred during the breeding season on a study site where 26% of the area was categorized as "flooded timber," and 5% was classed as "scrub/shrub marsh".<ref name=r34/> In eastern and central Maine, an average of 2.1 soras was observed in wooded swamps per 100 hours of observation during the breeding season.<ref name=r19/> On a nonbreeding (August–April) site in southwestern Arizona, soras were found to use a "mixed shrub community" more than expected based on its availability.<ref name=r8/> Soras were observed at low abundances on a site with [[douglas-fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii''), [[ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa''), and [[Populus tremuloides|trembling aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides'') in British Columbia.<ref name=r41>Morgan, K.

==Major life events==

===Migration===
Sora's northern migration occurs in spring, primarily in April and May. For instance, in east-central Kansas significantly (p<0.05) more soras were detected from 24 April to 7 May than the 2-week periods before or after. In southeast Missouri, soras were observed from 25 March to 6 May.<ref name=r54/> Soras were 1st detected in April to early May in Colorado,<ref name=r24/> Iowa, and Minnesota.<ref name=r28/> In a summary of the 1st detections of soras in Minnesota, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, all occurred in April.<ref name=r46/>

Soras depart their breeding grounds as early as July and as late as October. Soras were observed returning to wintering grounds in Arizona as early as late July.<ref name=r8/> Although local movements may obscure migration occurring in July, most migration occurred in August and September in Colorado. In northern Ohio, sora abundance was increased in late August and September by migrating individuals.<ref name=r2/> In southeastern Missouri, soras were observed from 5 September to 27 October.<ref name=r54/> Soras have been observed in Manitoba and Saskatchewan as late as October.<ref name=r46/>

===Nesting===
Although sora nesting activities have been observed from late April through early August, the peak nesting period typically occurs from May to early July. In New York, nesting was initiated in late April.<ref name=r34/> A nest search and literature review study of soras in Colorado reports a clutch initiated in early August. However, mean clutch initiation dates occurred in May and June in regions across the state.<ref name=r12/> Studies from northern Ohio,<ref name=r2/> North Dakota, and Alberta <ref name=r36/> report nesting from May to July. In a review, sora nests with eggs were recorded from early May to early July in Indiana.<ref name=r42/>

Sora females begin construction of saucer-shaped nests on the ground or on a platform over shallow water at the start of egg laying.<ref name=r34/><ref name=r12/> [[avian clutch size|Clutch size]]s typically range from 8 to 13 eggs,<ref name=r12/><ref name=r42>Mumford, Russell E.; Keller, Charles E. (1984). The birds of Indiana. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press ISBN 0253107369</ref> although clutch sizes of up to 16 have been reported.<ref name=r28/><ref name=r36/><ref name=r12/> Both parents incubate the eggs. Incubation lasts approximately 19 days, although a wide range of incubation periods has been reported in the literature.<ref name=r36/> Eggs hatch over a span of 2 to 13 days.<ref name=r28/> Nestlings are precocial and are capable of walking and swimming short distances (< {{convert|3|ft|m|abr=on}}) by the end of their 1st day. Young soras are independent by about 4 weeks of age.<ref name=r26/><ref name=r12>DeGraaf, Richard M.; Yamasaki, Mariko. 2001. New England wildlife: Habitat, natural history, and distribution. Hanover, NH: University Press of New England</ref> Soras brood once per season.<ref name=r12/> Some late broods may be 2nd nesting attempts, but there is only 1 report in the literature of a 2nd brood attempt after a successful nest.<ref name=r36/> For information on breeding behavior of soras, see.<ref name=r28/> For information on conspecific nest parasitism and egg discrimination in soras see.<ref name=r58/>

Sora nest success rates vary across locations and years. In the literature addressing sora apparent nest success, the proportions of successful nests varied from 0.61 in Michigan to 0.833 in Minnesota.<ref name=r2/> In western New York, the nest success rate of 6 sora nests was 0.43, and the daily nest success rate was 0.97.<ref name=r34/> Using data from the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology's nest record program, nesting success rate of soras in North America was estimated as 0.529 over a 28-day period (n=108).<ref name=r9/> On a site in Alberta, 80.6% of eggs successfully hatched, while the following year only 59.6% of eggs hatched. The authors conclude that diminished water level interacting with predators and trampling by cattle resulted in decreased hatching success.<ref name=r36/> During late summer, soras are flightless for a period during their post-nuptial molt.<ref name=r2/>

===Home range===
Sora home range size varies. Sora brood-rearing home ranges in northwestern Iowa averaged {{convert|0.5|acre|ha|abbr=on}}.<ref name=r26/> In Arizona, sora home range size varied from {{convert|1.5|acre|ha|abbr=on}} in the early breeding season to over {{convert|2|acre|ha|abbr=on}} in the postbreeding season. These seasonal differences in sora home range size were not significant (p>0.05).<ref name=r8/>

===Survival===
Few data are available on the survival of soras. Radio-marked soras in Arizona had a nonbreeding survival probability of 0.308. The authors suggest the low survival rate may be due to increased mortality of radio-marked birds.<ref name=r9/> Likely causes of mortality are predation and human-caused sources such as road kill.<ref name=r2/>

==Preferred habitat==
Water and emergent vegetation are important sora habitat characteristics.

===Water===
Soras use areas with a wide range of water depths. They are often observed in water less than {{convert|1|ft|cm|abbr=on}} deep,<ref name=r24/><ref name=r38/><ref name=r54/><ref name=r50/> although the average water depth of sora heavy-use areas in Arizona was {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} .<ref name=r8/> In northwestern Iowa, average water depth in sora territories was {{convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}}, which was significantly (p<0.025) more shallow than water depths at random locations in the marsh.<ref name=r27/> Sora nesting sites occurred in shallower water than random sites in western New York.<ref name=r34/> Average water depths reported at nest sites range from {{convert|4|in|cm|abbr=on}} for 4 sora nests in Colorado to nearly {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} for sora nests in western New York.<ref name=r34/> In areas of deep water, soras typically wade on mats of floating vegetation.<ref name=r26/>

Water level fluctuations may result in nest abandonment. For example, at a site in Colorado where water level increased more than {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on}}, a sora nest with 7 eggs was abandoned.<ref name=r24/> In Alberta, soras nested in more vegetation types during a drought year, most likely due to substantially reduced water levels in the vegetation used the previous year.<ref name=r36/>

Soras use areas with shallower water in fall than in spring.<ref name=r8>Conway, Courtney J. 1990. Seasonal changes in movements and habitat use in three sympatric rails. Laramie, WY: University of Wyoming. Thesis</ref><ref name=r54/><ref name=r50>Reid, Frederic Arthur. 1989. Differential habitat use by waterbirds in a managed wetland complex. Columbia, MO: University of Missouri. Dissertation.</ref> Soras typically avoid open water. There is a significant (p?0.05) negative relationship between area of open water and Sora use of wetlands in Maine <ref name=r19/> and Sora relative abundance in Saskatchewan.<ref name=r57/> In western New York, Sora nesting sites had a lower percentage of open water than random sites,<ref name=r34/> and in Arizona soras used open water areas less than their availability.<ref name=r8/>

===Emergent vegetation===
Sora nesting sites had larger percentage of emergent vegetation than random sites in marshes of western New York.<ref name=r34/> Sora numbers in wetlands of northeastern North Dakota were significantly (p<0.05) positively correlated (r=0.45) with hectares of live emergent vegetation. In east and central Maine, wetlands used by soras had significantly (p=0.01) greater area of emergent vegetation than unused wetlands.<ref name=r19/>

Density of emergent vegetation in sora habitat varies. Reported density of emergent vegetation ranges from an average of 121.9 stems/m² in sora territories in northwestern Iowa <ref name=r27/> to 333 stems/m² on sites in northeastern Missouri used during fall migration.<ref name=r50/> In western New York, cover was greater than 70% at 95% of sora nests. In addition, nesting sites had more horizontal cover at 20&nbsp;inches (0.5 m) above water level than random sites.<ref name=r34/> However, average stem density on sora territories was not significantly (p>0.05) different from random sites in northwestern Iowa.<ref name=r27/>

Height of emergent vegetation in sora habitat also varies. It ranged from {{convert|8|to|11|in|cm|abbr=on}} in the spring after a winter disturbance in northwestern Iowa <ref name=r27/> to {{convert|84|in|cm|abbr=on}} in areas heavily used by soras in Arizona.<ref name=r8/> In marshes of western New York, average vegetation height at sora nesting sites was shorter than at random locations.<ref name=r34/> However, the average height of emergent vegetation in sora territories in northeastern Iowa was not significantly (p>0.05) different from the height of vegetation in random plots.<ref name=r27/>

In Arizona, both cover and height of vegetation used by soras varied with seasons. Conway suggested the differences likely reflected the varied diet of the sora.<ref name=r8/> The availability of habitat in different seasons is another possible source of seasonal differences in sora habitat.<ref name=r54/>

Extent of woody vegetation surrounding South Dakota wetlands was not significantly (p=0.6) associated with sora occurrence. However, in marshes of western New York, there was a significant (p=0.041) negative relationship between percent flooded timber on a site and sora relative abundance.<ref name=r34/>

Soras may prefer some cover types. In Arizona, 65.3% of sora use was in [[southern cattail]] (''Typha domingensis''), although it comprised only 16.5% of the vegetation. [[Bulrushes]] and a mixed-shrub community were also used more than their availability, while [[saltcedar]] (''Tamarix chinensis'') and [[arrowweed]] (''Pluchea sericea'') were avoided.<ref name=r8/> A literature review notes Sora avoidance of [[purple loosestrife]] (''Lythrum salicaria'')-dominated sites. In east and central Maine, wetlands used by soras had significantly (p=0.05) more ericaceous vegetation, such as [[leatherleaves]] (''Chamaedaphne'' spp.), [[sweetgales]] (''Myrica'' spp.), and [[laurels]] (''Kalmia'' spp.).<ref name=r19/> In marshes of northwestern Iowa, [[broadleaf arrowhead]] (''Sagittaria latifolia'') occurred in sora territories significantly (p<0.01) more often than at random sites. Johnson and Dinsmore <ref name=r27/> imply that this likely results from both species preferring similar site conditions. In May and June in Wisconsin, Soras were detected significantly (p<0.025) more often in [[cattail]] (''Typha'' spp.) survey areas than in sedge areas. However, in southeastern Wisconsin during the breeding season, there was no significant (p=0.943) difference in sora densities between habitats comprised predominantly of cattail, sedge, or bulrush.<ref name=r38/> In addition, Soras' use of [[glaucous cattail]] (''Typha × glauca''), [[broadfruit bur-reed]] (''Sparganium eurycarpum''), [[sedge]], [[river bulrush]] (''Schoenoplectus fluviatilis''), and [[hardstem bulrush]] (''S. acutus var. acutus'') habitats in marshes of northwestern Iowa generally reflected availability of these habitats.<ref name=r27/>

Seasonal differences in sora habitat use have been reported. In northeastern Missouri in spring, the likelihood of detecting sora in robust emergents, such as cattail (''Typha'' spp.) and [[longroot smartweed]] (''Polygonum amphibium var. emersum''), was over 6 times that of detecting soras in these areas in fall. However, availability of habitats during various times of the year was not addressed.<ref name=r50/> In a study performed in southeastern Missouri, plant species used by sora during spring and fall migration differed significantly (p=0.005). However, the author qualifies this finding with his observation of major seasonal differences in vegetation availability.<ref name=r54/>

===Temperature===
Temperature may also influence sora abundance. In Colorado, average April temperature was significantly (p<0.01) negatively correlated (r= -0.94) with sora abundance. On sites that had average April temperatures ? {{convert|42|F|C|abbr=on}}, soras were more abundant than the closely related [[Virginia rail]] (''Rallus limicola''), while on warmer sites the sora to Virginia rail ratio declined.<ref name=r24/>

===Densities===
Sora densities vary from to 12 Soras/acre in Colorado <ref name=r12/> to 0.47 pair/ha in Indiana.<ref name=r42/> An average of 1.3 soras/ha responded to calls across sites in Colorado.<ref name=r24/> A similar density of soras was found in southeastern Wisconsin.<ref name=r38/> In Iowa, average density over 2 years and several marsh habitats was 1.3 pairs/ha.<ref name=r27/>

Landscape factors, such as marsh area, habitat edges within marshes, and the number of marshes in a region may influence soras.

Although soras occur in marshes of all sizes, they may occur at higher densities in intermediate-sized marshes. Soras were significantly (p?0.01) positively related with total wetland area and perimeter area of surface water in east and central Maine <ref name=r19/> and were significantly (p<0.05) positively related to area of wetlands in Saskatchewan.<ref name=r57/> In Maine, soras used 10% of {{convert|2.5|acre|ha|abbr=on}} wetlands, 40% to 50% of wetlands from {{convert|2.5|-|5|acre|ha|abbr=on}} in size, and 20% of wetlands larger than {{convert|50|acre|ha|abbr=on}}.<ref name=r19/> In western New York, soras were significantly (p=0.007) more abundant in marshes from {{convert|100|to|250|acre|ha|abbr=on}} in size than in smaller (< {{convert|100|acre|ha|abbr=on}}) or larger ({{convert|250|-|380|acre|ha|abbr=on}}) marshes. In addition, sora nests were detected more often in the {{convert|100|-|200|acre|ha|abbr=on}} marshes.<ref name=r34/>

Soras also seem to prefer edge habitats. Breeding sora density was significantly (p<0.001) correlated (r=0.62) with the perimeter:area ratio of northwestern Iowa marshes. The distance from the center of sora territories to a habitat edge was also significantly (p<0.005) less than from the center of Virginia rail territories.<ref name=r27/> In Arizona, habitat edges were closer to sora heavy use areas than random sites.<ref name=r8/>

Wetland dynamics at a large scale can affect soras. Indices of Sora population at 3 "levels of response" were significantly (p<0.01) correlated (r?0.70) with the number of ponds present in the prairie pothole region of North Dakota in May.<ref name=r47/>

==Food habits==
[[File:Porzana carolina.jpg|thumb|left|Sora foraging in water]]
Soras eat a wide range of foods. Animals that are commonly reported as sora food items include [[snails]] (Gastropoda), [[crustaceans]] (Crustacea), [[spiders]] (Araneae), and [[insects]] (Insecta), mainly [[beetles]] (Coleoptera), [[grasshopper]]s (Orthoptera), [[flies]] (Diptera), and [[dragonflies]] (Odonata).<ref name=r39/><ref name=r53/> Soras often eat the seeds of plants, such as [[smartweeds]], [[bulrushes]], [[sedges]], and [[barnyard grasses]].<ref name=r2/><ref name=r39/><ref name=r53/> Seeds of annual [[Zizania aquatica|wildrice]] (''Zizania aquatica'') and [[rice cutgrass]] are eaten by soras in the eastern United States.<ref name=r39>Martin, Alexander C.; Zim, Herbert S.; Nelson, Arnold L. (1951). American wildlife and plants. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc</ref> A literature review lists [[Paspalum|crowngrass]] (''Paspalum'' spp.) and [[Oryza sativa|rice]] (''Oryza sativa'') as relatively important food sources for soras in the Southeast. Plants comprising <5% of the sora's diet are also listed and include [[Eleocharis|spikerushes]] (''Eleocharis'' spp.), [[duckweeds]] (Lemnaceae), [[Potamogeton|pondweeds]] (''Potamogeton'' spp.), [[Panicum|panicgrasses]] (''Panicum'' spp.), [[Spartina|cordgrasses]] (''Spartina'' spp.), and [[Distichlis spicata|saltgrass]] (''Distichlis spicata'').<ref name=r39/>

Soras eat more plant food in fall and winter (68%–69%) than in spring and summer (40%).<ref name=r39/> Plant material such as [[Digitaria sanguinalis|hairy crabgrass]] (''Digitaria sanguinalis''), [[Panicum dichotomiflorum|fall panicgrass]] (''Panicum dichotomiflorum''), and [[Setaria|bristlegrass]] (''Setaria'' spp.) occurred at substantially higher frequencies and in much larger volumes in sora esophagi collected in southeastern Missouri during fall migration than those collected in spring. In addition, animals comprised a larger volume of the spring diet than the fall diet. The volume of animal material in esophagi collected in spring was predominantly composed of adult beetles and snails from the [[Physidae]] family.<ref name=r53/>

==Predators==
Sora eggs are eaten by several species including [[Mustela vison|American minks]] (''Mustela vison''), [[Mephitidae|skunks]] (Mephitidae), [[Canis latrans|coyotes]] (''Canis latrans''), [[Quiscalus|grackles]] (''Quiscalus'' spp.), [[Corvus (genus)|crows]] (''Corvus'' spp.), and [[Ardeidae|herons]] (Ardeidae).<ref name=r36/><ref name=r2>Andrews, Douglas Alexander. 1973.

'''''Wings''''' is an American [[sitcom]] that ran on [[NBC]] from April 19, 1990, to May 21, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wings (TV Series 1990-1997)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098948/|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> Starring [[Tim Daly]] and [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] as brothers Joe and Brian Hackett, the show is set at the fictional "Tom Nevers Field" airport, a small two-airline airport in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]], where the Hackett brothers operate Sandpiper Air. Exteriors of [[Nantucket Memorial Airport]] were used for the show. Interior scenes were filmed on [[sound stage|Stage]] 19 at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]] in [[Hollywood, California]], before a live studio audience.<!--per end-credit indicia-->

Other regulars include [[Crystal Bernard]], [[David Schramm (actor)|David Schramm]], [[Rebecca Schull]], [[Thomas Haden Church]], and [[Tony Shalhoub]]. [[Farrah Forke]] later joined the cast for two seasons. When Forke left, [[Amy Yasbeck]] joined the cast for the remainder of the show's run from 1994–1997. Thomas Haden Church left the show in spring 1995 to star in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom ''[[Ned and Stacey]]'', and [[Brian Haley]] joined the cast as the new mechanic.

''Wings'' was created and produced by ''[[Cheers]]'' veterans [[David Angell]], [[Peter Casey (screenwriter)|Peter Casey]], and [[David Lee (director/writer)|David Lee]]. The trio would later create the sitcom ''[[Frasier]]'', which was a spinoff of ''Cheers''.  Characters from ''Cheers'' occasionally made special guest appearances on ''Wings''. All three series were produced by [[Paramount Television]].

In the United Kingdom, the series aired on [[Sky One]] and Paramount Comedy Channel from 1991 to 1997.

Reruns of this show aired regularly on the [[USA Network]] from September 13, 1993 to June 16, 2000 and then sporadically after that, and again on [[Nick at Nite]] from January 2004 to June 2006.  It can currently be seen on [[ReelzChannel]], [[Netflix]] and [[Comedy Gold (TV channel)|Comedy Gold]].

===Joseph Montgomery Hackett===
Joe is a highly responsible, compulsively neat pilot who owns the one-plane airline Sandpiper Air on [[Nantucket Island]]. He dreamed of becoming a pilot as a child, and became the [[de facto]] head of his family after his and his brother's mother disappeared and their father went [[insane]]. He had initially intended to launch Sandpiper Air with his fiancee Carol behind the ticket counter, but his brother Brian ran off with her, causing a [[wikt:falling out|falling out]] between the brothers. He was played by [[Timothy Daly]].

===Brian Michael Hackett===
[[File:Wings (TV show).jpg|thumb|Cast of ''Wings'' Seasons 7-8 (l to r): [[Tony Shalhoub]], [[Crystal Bernard]], [[Timothy Daly]], [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]], [[Rebecca Schull|Rebecca&nbsp;Schull]], [[David Schramm (actor)|David Schramm]], [[Amy Yasbeck|Amy&nbsp;Yasbeck]]|right|240px]]
Brian is the more carefree of the Hackett brothers. His irresponsibility is often a source of consternation to older brother Joe; he had a "free ride" to [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and dropped out, was accepted into the [[astronaut]] training program at [[NASA]] and was soon expelled because he was too unreliable, saying that he would have become an astronaut if they let him take his dates into the simulator, and has lost other lucrative opportunities due to his chronic irresponsibility. He moved to the island of [[Mustique]] in the [[Caribbean]] and ran charter flights there after he eloped with Joe's fiancee, Carol, which caused a rift between the brothers.  When Carol left Brian for another man and the patriarch of the Hackett family died, Brian returned to Nantucket, and Joe was eventually persuaded not only to allow him to move into his house, but to give Brian a job at Sandpiper Air. Brian is a shameless womanizer for most of the series, but has two significant relationships: the first with helicopter pilot Alex Lambert, and then with Casey Chappel Davenport, Helen's older sister (see below). He was played by [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]].

While ''Wings'' was on the air, Weber reprised the role of Brian on an episode of ''[[Duckman]]'' titled "Role with It".

===Helen Chappel Hackett===
Helen is a petite blonde who, despite having lived on Nantucket for most of her life, speaks with a [[Texan English|Texas drawl]]. In the series, it is explained that Helen's family moved to the island from Texas when she was a child. Though Helen dreams of playing the [[cello]] in a large [[symphony orchestra]], she runs the lunch counter in the airport terminal and never really manages to get a music career off the ground until the final episode. Occasionally Helen would also earn money teaching children the cello. A running gag in regard to her music is that bad luck would always seem to follow her in her playing. Examples of this bad luck included her having to join a  [[string quartet]] of [[neurosis|neurotic]] individuals as that was the only group at the time who would accept her. Other instances were: Helen getting accepted to a state-run symphony, only to soon learn the state legislature eliminated the funding; the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] appreciated a cassette of her cello playing, but they lost the label and had no way to contact her; when she finally got a chance to play for the BSO, the plane crashed en route. Helen also constantly battles a compulsive eating habit that caused her to be [[obese]] in her youth.  Though successful at losing the weight sometime after Brian eloped with Carol, it is still a specter in her life and a blight on her self-image. She has been a lifelong friend of both Hackett brothers and dreamed of marrying Joe from a young age. She married Antonio to prevent him from being [[deport]]ed and although they intended to divorce after he won the [[Green Card Lottery]], they mistakenly remained married for three years because Helen forgot to mail out the divorce papers. She finally married Joe at the end of the sixth season. She was played by [[Crystal Bernard]].

Originally the writers had a different character in mind; Joe's love interest working at the lunch counter was a woman of Greek heritage, which was written in mind for [[Peri Gilpin]], however Gilpin was unable to commit to the role; thus the new character of Helen was created for Bernard. Gilpin, however, did star on one episode of ''Wings'' in the third season.

===Lowell Mather===
(Season 1–6) Lowell is a dim, eccentric mechanic/handyman who works at the airport and is available to everyone when repairs are needed. He claims that, while he is not an orphan, his brother is. He was married to a woman named Bunny with whom he had several children, but they divorced when Lowell learned that Bunny was sleeping around. After Brian sank the [[houseboat]] Lowell lived on, Lowell lived with Joe and Brian for a time, where he revealed a surprising talent for cooking. After about a year, however, his eccentricities became unbearable to the Hacketts, and they kicked him out to find his own place. Eventually, Lowell is forced to leave Nantucket and enter the [[Witness Protection Program]] after witnessing a [[contract killing|mob hit]]. Although it was hard for him to leave Nantucket and the people he knew all his life, Lowell decided he would prefer to go into hiding rather than let a guilty man go free and possibly kill again. Lowell was often seen wearing an orange ballcap with his workman's overalls, which he donated to Joe and Brian just before he left Nantucket forever in order for them to remember him by. He was played by [[Thomas Haden Church]].

===Fay Evelyn Schlob Dumbly DeVay Cochran===
Fay, Joe's only other employee besides Brian, is a retired [[flight attendant]] who handles the ticket counter, baggage check, and flight announcements for Sandpiper Air. Fay is thrice widowed and half-jokes of a curse in which, if she marries a man named George, he will die prematurely, as all three of her husbands had that name. In one episode she almost remarries a man known as Lyle, only to realize that is only his middle name and his first name is George. She is a generally sweet and motherly, though slightly batty woman who looks after the younger members of their circle as her own children. She can, however, be sweetly manipulative. Fay also has a streak in which she has touched every [[First Lady of the United States]] since [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].  She grew up in Syracuse, NY, and lived in Hawaii, before moving to Nantucket. Fay was played by [[Rebecca Schull]].

===Roy Peterman Biggins===
Roy is the owner of Aeromass, the only other airline on Nantucket and, with seven planes, a larger business than Sandpiper, although Roy had been unable to break into the lucrative business of [[charter flight]]s.  Generally competitive, arrogant and unpleasant, and [[morbidly obese]], Roy often belittles Joe for having a small-time operation and mocks Joe's business skills. Despite this, Roy feels threatened by Joe's presence as a competitor, and makes numerous attempts to either buy Sandpiper or put it out of business. Roy was married to a woman named Sylvia; for several years he claimed that she died, but it was later revealed that actually she had left him and is now living in Boston and married to a wealthy [[plastic surgeon]]. Sylvia was played by [[Concetta Tomei]]. The couple had one son, R.J. (Roy Junior), who is a [[homosexual]].  Roy is also dishonest.  Examples included his forcing onto a plane a customer who has just ordered a large meal from Helen; the customer leaves his meal and the money for Helen, but Roy promptly steals both.  He also established false charities to include one for his "late wife" and using the proceeds for [[fly-fishing]] trips or to subscribe to the [[Playboy Channel]]. He has an autographed picture of [[Richard Nixon]] in his office and was once arrested for trying to force his way aboard [[Air Force One]] to have a picture taken of himself shaking hands with President [[George H. W. Bush]]. Also, in his office he has a poster of a woman wearing a [[thong bikini]] riding on a [[unicycle]]. His comment was, "If that was Paris and she was holding a loaf of bread, they'd call it art." While normally conniving and arrogant, Roy does have a sense of fun: since his birthday was on February 29, 1948, a [[leap year]], he celebrates it only once every four years as if he were only a quarter of his real age. He drives a purple [[Chevrolet El Camino|El Camino]], on which he claims he can disconnect the [[brake light]]s in order to engage in [[insurance fraud]] by being unintentionally rear-ended by people in [[luxury car]]s. He was played by [[David Schramm (actor)|David Schramm]].

===Antonio V. Scarpacci===
(Season 3–8) An Italian immigrant from [[Alecchio]], who owns and operates a [[taxicab|taxi]] service to and from the airport. Antonio is mild-mannered, deferential, and hopelessly romantic; he falls head-over-heels for Helen's older sister Casey when she returns to Nantucket, though his feelings are not reciprocated. Antonio was originally a [[waiter]], and made a guest appearance in the second season in this role before becoming an official cast member in the third season (by which time he had changed professions). Helen married him in order to save him from deportation. The marriage mistakenly lasted for three years (unbeknownst to either one of them) long after Antonio became a US citizen due to an error on Helen's part. He is a big fan of the ''Mary Pat Lee Show''.  Antonio once took over for Fay at the Sandpiper ticket counter, but he caused a bit of an uproar when he bumped [[Boston Bruins]]' star [[goaltender]] Danny "Dead End" Connolly in favor of a standby passenger.  Connolly berated him by calling him "Antwerpio Scarpukey" or "Antwerpio [[Sockpuppet]]".  He was played by [[Tony Shalhoub]].

===Alex Lambert===
(Season 4–5) Alex is a [[helicopter]] pilot who moves to Nantucket to start her own helicopter tour business. She had previously flown [[U.S. Army]] [[AH-64 Apache|Apache helicopters]] in [[Desert Storm]].<ref>Episode "Two Jerks and a Jill", season four</ref> It was also discovered that she had posed for ''[[Playboy]]''.  Though she initially rebuffs the amorous attentions of both Hackett brothers, she eventually falls for Brian's boyish charms. She and Brian live together briefly, but after Brian spends a wild night in New York with Joe and an old friend, Alex throws him out of the apartment and leaves Nantucket for good. She returns a season later to resolve some of the bitterness in their breakup; she and Brian briefly get back together before they both finally decide it best to go their separate ways. Alex was played by [[Farrah Forke]].

===Cassandra "Casey" (Davenport) Chappel===
(Season 6–8) Casey is Helen's older sister. She returns to Nantucket after being abandoned by her husband, Stuart Davenport (played by [[John Ritter]] who was the actress' real life partner and later husband), but despite having grown up there she has difficulty adjusting her [[upper class|upper crust]] tastes and sensibilities to a [[working class]] life on the small island.  Though Antonio falls madly in love with her, Casey takes little notice of him. After she and Brian spend the better part of a season sniping at each other, they end up having sex the night before Joe and Helen's wedding. Afterward they find themselves unable to stay away from each other, having a passionate affair; while Joe and Helen are on their honeymoon, Casey's bra lands on the hearth of the lit fireplace and leads to Helen's house burning down. Her relationship with Brian cools after that, but they maintain a friendship. When she first appears in the show, Casey goes by her married name of Davenport, but after she and Stuart divorce at the end of season seven, she reverts to Chappel. She was played by [[Amy Yasbeck]].

===Budd Bronski===
(Season 7) Budd is a retired [[US Marine]] who is hired to replace Lowell.  He is extremely jumpy and insecure, and haunted by an incident in his past in which an aircraft he worked on crashed, resulting in his facing a [[court martial]]. Though the military cleared him of charges, Budd continues to blame himself for the incident until Brian convinces him to let it go. Occasionally Budd would astonish everyone with magic tricks, but otherwise had difficulty adjusting to the social scene. After being introduced early in the seventh season, Budd disappears toward the end of the season and is never mentioned again. He was played by [[Brian Haley]].

==Recurring characters==
'''Carlton Blanchard''': He is an old man with a high-pitched nasal voice whose outwardly meek yet privately demanding behavior causes everyone who meets him to shudder at his coming. He is also known for asking bizarre questions such as "If you were to carpet Florida, how long would it take to vacuum it?" and "If a monkey were to bite you, what kind of drugs do you suppose they'd give you?". He annoyed Joe, Brian, Lowell and Antonio when he won a [[Charity (practice)|charity]] [[competition|contest]] sponsored by Sandpiper and demanded he be flown to [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]], way beyond the scope of Sandpiper's routes. In another episode, he tricked Helen into throwing him a birthday party and then fell down her stairs in order to force her to take care of him for a week. Though none of the regulars care for Carlton, he is especially disliked by Antonio, a situation made worse by the fact that Carlton repeatedly calls him "Angelo". Carlton was played by [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]].

'''Mr. Hackett''': Joe and Brian's deceased father who had taken it hard when his wife, and the boys' mother, walked out on the family. He was committed to a mental institution and had died just prior to the beginning of the series. He had a good sense of humor, and in the series premiere had his will required to be read to both Brian and Joe together, which required them to reunite after their six-year estrangement. He willed them a key which opened up the lockbox to another key, then another, which had Joe and Brian go to [[Boston]] then back to Nantucket airport where they ended up finding a suitcase full of spring snakes and a photograph of them as children, encouraging them to always value their kinship. After Brian and Casey burn down Joe's house, Joe, fed up with Brian's string of irresponsible behavior, fires him from Sandpiper and orders him never to speak to him again. The ghost of his father appears and uses [[reverse psychology]] to convince Joe to make peace with Brian. Mr. Hackett was played by [[Don Murray (actor)|Don Murray]].

'''Lou''': Lou is a feisty old man who is introduced in Season Seven's "The Lyin' King". In that episode, Joe, in order to assuage his guilt over going to a strip club later, volunteers at the senior citizens' home, where he is assigned to spend time with Lou. After spending a moment complaining about how lousy nursing home life is, Lou manages to guilt trip Joe into taking him to the strip club with him. Though Joe is somewhat tolerant of Lou, Brian is decidedly less so, referring to him derisively as "[[Yoda]]" (due to Lou's shrivelled physical appearance). Lou, in return, makes it clear he does not care for Brian either. Lou is also prone to talking about a rift he had in the past with his brother Harry, prompting his catchphrase, "He screwed me blue!" Lou was originally intended as a one-shot appearance, but proved so popular that he was brought back in the show's final season, where we are also introduced to his brother Harry, played by [[Abe Vigoda]]. Lou was played by [[Phil Leeds]].

'''Davis Lynch''': Davis is a businessman whom Joe flies to Nantucket to invest in the airline. Though he rejects Joe's offer (and ends up investing the money in Roy's airline), he ends up dating Helen, and eventually proposes to her. Helen accepts, but ends up leaving him for Joe. Toward the end of the series, Helen reveals she never broke off the engagement. She had figured he was gone after he was skirted off to [[Burma]] in the wake of a [[coup d'etat]] to salvage major investments he had in the company. He was then placed under [[house arrest]] by the [[military junta]]. Upon his release, Davis returns to see Helen, but while she is trying to work up the courage to tell him she has married someone else, Davis announces that ''he'' will be unable to marry ''her'', having fallen in love with a woman who worked for the [[State Department]] and had risked her life to secure his release. Davis was played by [[Mark Harelik]].

'''Roy Biggins, Jr. (a.k.a. R.J.)''': Roy's only son, who is secretly [[gay]]. Roy had trained R.J how to do "guy stuff" such as playing [[American football|football]]. The first time he is shown is when he is a [[high school]] student taking cello lessons from Helen as an extracurricular activity. R.J. reveals to everyone he is a homosexual. Roy does not take this news well and challenges him to a game of one-on-one basketball on the condition that if R.J. wins he is "allowed" to be gay, but if Roy wins R.J. is not. R.J. wins game after game against Roy, but Roy refuses to give up. R.J. would return much later in the series after being estranged from Roy for a long time. He had since graduated from law school and was looking to take the Massachusetts Bar Exam. Roy is proud of R.J and his accomplishments, but only so long as R.J.'s homosexuality isn't discussed. The issue finally comes to a head at Roy's birthday party, when he accuses R. J. of throwing his lifestyle in his face and ruining his party by bringing his boyfriend Luke ([[Tim Bagley]]). After R. J. and Luke walk out, Crystal talks to Roy, reminding him that while he doesn't have to like it, he does have to accept it--because the alternative is accepting that it may be another six years, or longer, before he sees R. J. again. Roy finally catches up with R. J. just as he and Luke are boarding a flight. After his father's fumbling apology, he finally loses patience, pointing out that he can't even say the word "gay." Desperate to stop R. J. from walking out of his life forever, Roy finally acknowledges it, and says that he wants to understand it. The two men hug. 

R.J. was played by [[Abraham Benrubi]].

'''Gail Scott''': Joe's girlfriend during the first part of Season Three. They began dating while Helen was in New York. When Joe persuaded Helen to move back to Nantucket when she was unhappy in New York, he did not tell her about his relationship with Gail because of his worry that it would prevent Helen from moving back to Nantucket. Helen, convinced that she and Joe would pick up right where they left off, did come back, but soon discovered the truth about Joe and Gail. Believing that Joe intended to hurt her by not disclosing his relationship with Gail, Helen drove her jeep through Joe and Brian's office. Gail is in three episodes, but is mentioned in several others, including phone conversations. She is a journalist who constantly travels. She and Helen eventually become friends briefly, but Gail leaves Joe when she catches Joe and Helen kissing in his kitchen. Gail was played by [[Gretchen German]].

'''Sandy Cooper''': Sandy is a friend of Joe's, Brian's, and Helen's from high school.  She has an insane, obsessive crush on Joe, but he is unable to convince anyone else of this because she acts completely normal except when she is alone with Joe, who gives her the nickname "Psycho Sandy". She would appear on Nantucket periodically and carefully plan her fantasy life with "Joey Bear" at moments when the two of them were alone. Such fantasies included a re-enacted high school [[prom]] in the basement of Sandy's old house, the couple's wedding and honeymoon in Helen's living room, and the birth of their first child in Joe's therapist's office.  In one episode, Sandy is shown to be dating Brian, but the relationship was ultimately never pursued by the show's writers. Sandy was played by [[Valerie Mahaffey]].

'''Kenny McElvey''': Kenny is an 18-year-old who becomes Sandpiper's backup pilot during a second season story arc where Joe is grounded for [[hypertension]]. The comedic focus of the character was his youth and relative inexperience, but he was the most qualified out of the applicants for Joe's replacement (which did not consist of a very large pool). When Joe began flying again in the third season, Kenny disappeared from the series without explanation and was never mentioned again. One episode showed Kenny also working at a [[fast food]] joint to supplement his meager income from Sandpiper. Kenny was played by [[Michael Manasseri]].

'''Bunny Mather''': Lowell's wife at the beginning of the series, from whom he separates and eventually divorces when he learns she sleeps with other men. Bunny's promiscuity is her primary gag; she flirts with nearly every man she encounters (including, at one point, Joe and Brian [her fantasy is to sleep with two co-workers]), and ends up sleeping with many of them. Not even the divorce was enough to convince Bunny to stay away, as the episode that showed the divorce had Lowell and Bunny sleeping together that very same night. Bunny was played by [[Laura Innes]].

'''Sylvia''': Roy's ex-wife who divorced Roy and married a plastic surgeon. Roy initially tells people that she was dead, but after being caught in his lie, he decides to go see her, only to find out that she has a new husband and a new life. She returns to the island again in season 5 to sleep with Roy in an attempt to get back at her current husband for having an affair. Roy finds out and decides to not go through with it.

'''Mary Pat Lee''': A [[Boston]] talk show host who tricks Brian onto her show in season 6 to meet up with his ex-girlfriend Alex. She returns the next season as Roy's new girlfriend, only to use the relationship to get a show topic using Joe and Helen. Played by [[Caroline Aaron]].  One of her biggest fans is Antonio.  Her budding relationship with Roy causes him to mutter, "But.....she's Mary Pat Lee....and he's.....Roy."

'''Edgar Clayton''':  Wealthy industrialist who buys Sandpiper from Joe and Brian to keep it from going under.  He installs his son Cord as the new president only to see Cord fail miserably.  He also fired his uncle Mike in front of his whole board of directors and has been known to give terminated employees "The Big Ugly".  He was part of a three-part story arc, "Wingless", during the show's final season.  Played by [[Mitchell Ryan]].

'''Eleanor "Bluto" Biggins''':  Roy's eccentric mother who lives in a nursing home.  She is a meddlesome, domineering nag and Roy feels threatened by her.  Joe, however, stood up to her and called her a "Miserable Old [[Gargoyle]]".  Eleanor was also a heavy drinker and Roy once said she had to be "cut off after six [[boilermaker (beer cocktail)|boilermakers]]."  She was frequently mentioned, but was not seen until the final season.  Played by [[Rose Marie]].

'''Lewis Blanchard''': Carlton's equally irritating nephew. He is very rude and abrasive, and makes only the slightest of attempts to hide his wish for Carlton to die so he can inherit his money. He seems to have crushes on Casey, Helen, and Alex, who are all completely repulsed by his lewd remarks. Lewis was played by [[Gilbert Gottfried]].

'''Mark''': He is the waiter at the Crab Restaurant. He becomes infatuated with Helen, who later pushes him toward Alex.  Mark was played by [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]].

==Locale==
The series takes place primarily at the fictional Nantucket airport Tom Nevers Field. Until 1976, the real-life island was the site of the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Tom Nevers Naval Facility]], later the home of the [[Nantucket Hunting Association]].  The Club Car (a real restaurant on Nantucket) is also often featured on the show.<ref>http://www.theclubcar.com/</ref>

The airplane for the show was a 1981 [[Cessna 402]]C one of which was C/N 402C0507 #N121PP, owned and operated by Express Air, Owned and operated by Mike Josefek and Richard Sevigny. The pilot during the filming was Austin Carey. The aircraft was eventually sold to Cape Air where it is still flying.;<ref>http://www.airport-data.com/aircraft/N121PB.html</ref> in the pilot episode (as well as a few other episodes) the airplane fuselage shown in the hangar was C/N 4110069 #N121PP (which was destroyed).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airport-data.com/aircraft/N121PP.html|title=Aircraft N121PP, Cessna 411 C/N 4110069|publisher=Airport-data.com|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}</ref>

==''Cheers'' tie-ins==
{{synthesis|date=October 2014}}
Although not a spin-off, ''Wings'' takes place in the same universe as ''[[Cheers]]'', and by extension, its [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Frasier]]''. Several episodes had tie-ins with ''[[Cheers]]''; [[Kelsey Grammer]] (who was nominated for an [[Emmy]] for his guest appearance), [[Bebe Neuwirth]], [[George Wendt]], [[John Ratzenberger]], and [[Kirstie Alley]] all appeared on ''Wings'' playing their ''Cheers'' characters.

*[[Cliff Clavin]] and [[Norm Peterson]] visit Nantucket in the season two episode "The Story of Joe". Their goal is ostensibly to go fishing, but the two never seem to get any farther than the island's drinking establishments.

*[[Frasier Crane|Frasier]] and [[Lilith Crane]] were the focus of the season three episode, "Planes, Trains, & Visiting Cranes." In the episode, Frasier and a skeptical Lilith come to Nantucket to put on a motivational seminar, but run into opposition from Helen Chappel, a dissatisfied former customer of Frasier's program. In the ''Cheers'' episode "License to Hill", which aired the same night as that particular ''Wings'' episode, Frasier even mentions that he and Lilith are going to Nantucket, foreshadowing their crossover appearance. (An additional note: Nine years later, at the beginning of the ''Frasier'' episode "Bla-Z Boy", [[Niles Crane|Niles]] plays [[Schubert's last sonatas#Sonata in A major, D. 959|the ''Wings'' theme]] on the piano.)

*[[Rebecca Howe]] has a cameo appearance in the season four episode "I Love Brian", whose plot revolves around Brian's attempt to infiltrate a post-concert party in [[Clint Black]]'s hotel room. As Rebecca is seen being asked to leave by Black's bouncer, she begs Black to come to the bar in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] where she works so she can prove to the others there that she knows him. Black responds, "Maybe next year," causing Rebecca to exclaim right before she is kicked out of the party, "But none of you know where we're going to be next year!", a reference to how ''Cheers'' was in its final season on television.

*[[Roz Doyle]]'s character is named as a tribute to a producer of the television series ''Wings'' (having the same creators as ''Frasier''), who died from [[breast cancer]] in 1991.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/55238460.html?dids=55238460:55238460&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+12,+1994&author=Donna+Gable&pub=USA+TODAY+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=Paying+tribute+to+a+friend+//+Role+of+`Frasier'+sidekick+based+on+real-life+producer+Roz+Doyle | title= Paying tribute to a friend | date= May 12, 1994 | work= [[USA Today]] |publisher= [[ProQuest]] Archiver| accessdate=2011-05-22}}</ref>

===Streaming===
The series was made available through streaming services such as [[Netflix]], however some seasons are incomplete.<ref>[http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Wings/70155634 ''Netflix: Wings'']</ref>

== Music, opening sequence and closing credits ==
The theme was a short version of a [[Franz Schubert]] piece, [[Piano Sonata No. 20 (Schubert)|Piano sonata No. 20]] in A Major, D. 959, IV. Rondo. Allegretto.  Schubert received screen credit as the theme composer in every episode.

The opening theme heard during the first two and a half seasons was a fairly straightforward arrangement with piano and strings, accompanied by the plane taking its flight to Nantucket in the opening sequence, which started out with a shot of Brant Point Lighthouse with seagulls heard in the background followed by the plane about to take flight, in which the title card was shown afterward, then showed the cast members (which showed "Timothy Daly" in its first two seasons before billing to "Tim Daly" in season 3) as the plane was flying over various places, including birds flying in the air, churches, and finally, into Nantucket, which the plane landed onto the lot of [[Nantucket Memorial Airport]] after which the Nantucket Airport control tower was seen with a reflection of the plane landing in the window with the creators of the show seen onscreen. The slow opening theme was dropped in January 1992 as episodes began using a [[cold open]], with simply the title card being seen and the cast members followed by the creators, in the now-customized fashion as the show's logo, during the teaser scene, though it returned for the series finale in 1997. The new opening scene would show a brief shot of cumulus clouds, save for the season 4 finale when the cold open was brusquely interrupted to show the plane caught in a violent thunder and lightning storm in contrast to the clear skies often shown.

The closing sequence used in seasons 1-5 was accompanied by the plane flying over [[Nantucket Sound]] in a sunrise setting. A [[jazz]]ed-up version of the theme was heard during the closing credits for the first two seasons, followed by a more up-tempo version with a piano lead from season 3 onward. The closing credits were changed in season 6 with the tag scene accompanied by the closing credits (for NBC's original airings, the [[closing credits#marginalization for television promotion|generic credits]] were used when NBC started doing this in the 1994-1995 season as well), though some episodes from seasons 6-8, including the series finale, used the standard closing sequence from seasons 1-5 (but with a slightly different font).

[[File:Elie Bleu Medailles.JPG|thumb|An [[Elie Bleu]] Medaille in blue.]]
A '''humidor''' is any kind of box or room with constant [[humidity]] that is used to store [[cigar]]s, [[cigarette]]s, or [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe]] tobacco. For private use, small wooden or acrylic glass humidor boxes for a few dozen cigars are used, while cigar shops may have walk-in humidors. Humidors can be used to store other goods for which a certain level of humidity is desirable; the [[Colorado Rockies]] [[Major League Baseball]] team stores [[baseball (ball)|game balls]] in a large humidor at their home stadium, [[Coors Field]], to counteract the effects of [[Denver]]'s high altitude and generally low humidity.
Humidors of all sizes use [[hygrometer]]s to keep track of the humidity levels.

'''''Classification of humidors'''''

'''Walk-in humidor'''

Most common in cigar bars or stores. One room is built as or converted to a humidor where all the cigars are stored.

'''Cabinet humidor'''

Usually placed on the floor as a piece of furniture. Typically holds 1000-5000 cigars.

'''Table humidor'''

Often quite heavy, though portable in theory, it's usually kept in one location. Capacity ranges from three hundred to a few thousand cigars. It usually comes with a polished wood exterior, marble, leather or combination of exotic elements, and glass top.

'''Personal humidor'''

Semi-regular cigar smokers will sometimes keep a small humidor in their homes for personal storage, special events, or aesthetic characteristics of the humidor itself . Usually contains 20-75 cigars. This may also be known as a "Desktop Humidor".{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

'''Travel humidor'''

Portable and made for carrying cigars enough for the outing or event, usually 2 to 10 cigars.

==Construction==
Commercially made humidor cases are typically made of wood, although other materials, like acrylic glass and metal, are not uncommon. [[Carbon fibre]], [[silicon carbide]], and [[polyethylene]] have also been used. Disregarding aesthetic qualities, the casing's purpose is to protect the interior and create a closed environment, so any durable and airtight material can be used.

The interior is typically a veneer of [[Cedrela odorata|Spanish-cedar]] wood or [[mahogany]].

Spanish-cedar is the most frequently used wood for the interior veneer of humidors. It possesses the following desirable characteristics for cigar storage:
# It holds more moisture than most woods, so it helps maintain humidity.
# It imparts its aroma to cigars if they are stored in it for long enough. For the same reason, some cigars are wrapped in Spanish-cedar sheets before they are sold.
# Spanish-cedar wood can repel [[Lasioderma serricorne|tobacco beetles]]. These pinhead-sized beetles can ruin entire stocks of cigars. They eat the tobacco and lay eggs, causing further infestation. They can also be discouraged by ensuring the humidor does not get hotter than 20&nbsp;°C (68&nbsp;°F).<ref>[[Lasioderma serricorne#Pest control|Beetle pest control information]] in Wikipedia</ref> The beetle eggs usually only hatch at around 25&nbsp;°C (77&nbsp;°F){{Citation needed|reason=varying opinions, this seems to be opinion|date=August 2012}}, although there are also instances where they will hatch at cooler temperatures if the humidity is too high.
# The wood properties are not prone to "warping" or "cupping" in high humidity.

In addition to commercially made humidors, home-made humidors are also in use.<ref>[http://www.cigargroup.com/gallery/homemade.htm Homemade Humidor Album Page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> They range considerably in material, size and complexity.

Relevant for the capacity of the humidor are the interior dimensions of the humidor after deducting the space required for the humidification element and some extra space between the humidification element and the cigars. The exact capacity can then be calculated based on the diameter of the cigars that should be stored. For the most popular cigar formats, the capacity can also be calculated online.<ref>[http://www.humidordiscount.com/humidor_calculator.php Online Humidor Capacity Calculator<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Maintenance==
===Humidity===
The ideal humidity in a humidor is around 68-72% of [[relative humidity]].<ref>[http://cigars.about.com/od/humidors/qt/humidor101.htm Humidity Levels for Storing Cigars in a Humidor<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Though it can go higher or lower depending on the cigar smoker's preferences, it should never go higher than 75%{{Citation needed|reason=conflicting numbers with construction section|date=August 2012}} due to the possibility of hatching [[Lasioderma serricorne|tobacco beetles]]. The more empty space, the more readily the humidity level of the box will drop or rise.

All humidors contain a humidifying system which keeps the air moist, which in turn keeps the cigars moist.

Most humidifying elements are passive, releasing stored humidity through evaporation and diffusion. The use of a 50/50 solution of [[propylene glycol]] and [[distilled water]] is recommended for replenishing the passive humidifying element as it has a buffer effect on air humidity, maintaining it at approximately 70%. Retailers and manufacturers claim it also has mild antifungal and antibacterial properties.
In lack of propylene glycol, distilled water should be used, due to its lack of minerals, additives, or bacteria which keeps the contents neutral and healthy.

Electronic humidifiers are also available, although usually reserved for very large humidors. A sensor measures the outside humidity and then activates a ventilator, which blows air over a humid sponge or water tank into the humidor. Once the preset humidity level has been reached the ventilator stops [relative humidity]. This way electronic humidifiers can maintain a much more stable humidity level than passive humidifiers. Also they typically will activate an alarm to notify when the humidifier needs refilling, before the humidity actually drops. The accuracy of electronic humidifiers depends primarily on the integrated type of sensor. Capacitive sensors are the preferred type of sensors.

Usage of [[silica gel]] beads is a third alternative. These also have a buffer effect on [[relative humidity]], and are moistened with distilled water when necessary.  They can absorb or release humidity at RH 50%. Silica gel is commonly used to remove moisture from packaging containers. For use in humidors it is typically calibrated (by the additional coating of mineral salts) in various ranges of humidity including - 65%, 68%, 70%, and 72%.  Unlike the passive devices, silica beads only require distilled water, and can be ruined by propylene glycol.

Each humidor has to be seasoned after being bought or having been out of use for a while.<ref>[http://cigars.about.com/od/seasoninganewhumidor/ss/0061702c.htm Seasoning a New Humidor Before Storing Cigars<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The seasoning process brings the wood inside the humidor close to the relative humidity level that it will be operating at so that the wood itself will buffer moisture. This can be done using different techniques including placing a small container of distilled water inside the humidor and allowing the wood to absorb the evaporated moisture for 1 to 3 days. Another technique involves wiping down the entire inside wood with a lightly soaked cloth, although this method is not recommended because the wood may [[Wood warping|warp]]. After the wood has been wiped a small container of distilled water is stored inside or a lightly soaked surgical sponge on top of plastic is stored in the humidor until the wood is sufficiently humidified to 65-72% RH. An unseasoned humidor will absorb humidity from the closed environment, which in turn will reduce the humidity of the cigars to the point of drying them out.

===Temperature===
To discourage eggs of [[Lasioderma serricorne|tobacco beetles]] from hatching, the humidor temperature should be kept below 25°C/77°F{{Citation needed|reason=same numbers questioned above|date=August 2012}}, as well as below 75%{{Citation needed|reason=science|date=August 2012}} relative humidity.
At lower temperatures below 12°C/53.6°F, the desired aging process of the cigars is impaired. Therefore, cold wine cellars are only suitable for cigar storage to a limited extent. Similarly, temperatures over 24°C/75°F can lead to worm infestation and cigar rotting. For this reason, the humidor should not be exposed to direct sunlight.<ref>[http://www.humidor-guide.com/storing-cigars/optimum-temperature Optimum temperature for cigar storage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

'''Arthur Norman Prior''' (1914–1969) was a noted [[logic]]ian and philosopher. Prior (1957) founded [[tense logic]], now also known as [[temporal logic]], and made important contributions to [[intensional logic]], particularly in Prior (1971).

==Biography==
Prior was born in Masterton New Zealand, 4 December 1914, the only child of Australian-born parents: Norman Henry Prior (1882-1967) and his wife born Elizabeth Munton Rothesay Teague (1889-1914). His mother died less than 3 weeks after his birth and he was cared for by his father's sister. His father, a medical practitioner in general practice, remarried in 1920 and there were three more children.

Prior was educated entirely in [[New Zealand]], where he was fortunate to have come under the influence of [[John Niemeyer Findlay]]. Despite knowing only modest mathematics, he began teaching philosophy and logic at [[Canterbury University College]] in 1946, filling the vacancy created by [[Karl Popper]]'s resignation. He became Professor in 1953. Thanks to the good offices of [[Gilbert Ryle]], who had met Prior in New Zealand in 1954, Prior spent the year 1956 on leave at the [[University of Oxford]], where he gave the [[John Locke]] [[John Locke lectures|lectures]] in philosophy. These were subsequently published as ''Time and Modality'' (1957). This is a seminal contribution to the study of tense logic and the metaphysics of time, in which Prior championed the A-theorist view that the temporal modalities past, present and future are basic ontological categories of fundamental importance for our understanding of time and the world. During his time at Oxford, Prior met [[Peter Geach]] and [[William Kneale (logician)|William Kneale]], influenced [[John Lemmon]], and corresponded with the adolescent [[Saul Kripke]]. Logic in the United Kingdom was then in a rather low state, and Prior's enthusiasm is believed to have contributed materially to its revival.{{fact|date=November 2012}} From 1959 to 1966, he was Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Manchester]], having taught [[Osmund Lewry]]. From 1966 until his death he was Fellow and Tutor in philosophy at [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. His students include [[Max Cresswell]], [[Kit Fine]], and [[Robert Bull]].

Almost entirely self-taught in modern [[formal logic]], Prior published his first paper on logic in 1952, when he was already 38 years of age, shortly after discovering the work of [[Józef Maria Boche?ski]] and [[Jan ?ukasiewicz]], very little of whose work was then translated into English.{{fact|date=November 2012}} He went on to employ [[Polish notation]] throughout his career. Prior (1955) distills much of his early teaching of logic in New Zealand. Prior's work on tense logic provides a systematic and extended defence of a tensed conception of reality in which material objects are construed as three-dimensional continuants which are wholly present at each moment of their existence.

Prior stood out by virtue of his strong interest in the history of logic. He was one of the first English-speaking logicians to appreciate the nature and scope of the logical work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], and the distinction between ''[[de dicto]]'' and ''[[de re]]'' in [[modal logic]]. Prior taught and researched [[modal logic]] before Kripke proposed his [[Kripke semantics|possible worlds semantics]] for it, at a time when modality and intentionality commanded little interest in the English speaking world, and had even come under sharp attack by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].

He is now said to be the precursor of [[hybrid logic]].<ref name="CarnielliPizzi2008">{{cite book| author1=Walter Carnielli| author2=Claudio Pizzi| title=Modalities and Multimodalities| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XpAFM04G6BAC&pg=PA181| year=2008| publisher=Springer| isbn=978-1-4020-8589-5| page=181 }}</ref> Undertaking (in one section of his book ''Past, Present, and Future'' (1967)) the attempt to combine binary (e.g., "until") and unary (e.g., "will always be") temporal operators to one system of [[temporal logic]], Prior—as an incidental result—builds a base for later hybrid languages.

His work ''Time and Modality'' explored the use of a [[many-valued logic]] to explain the problem of [[non-referring names]].

Prior's work was both philosophical and formal and provides a productive synergy between formal innovation and linguistic analysis.{{fact|date=November 2012}} [[Natural language]], he remarked, can embody folly and confusion as well as the wisdom of our ancestors. He was scrupulous in setting out the views of his adversaries, and provided many constructive suggestions about the formal development of alternative views.

Modifying a computer case in any non-standard way is considered a case mod.  Modding is done, particularly by [[Computer hardware|hardware]] enthusiasts, to show off a computer's apparent power by showing off the internal hardware, and also to make it look aesthetically pleasing to the owner.

Cases may also be modified to improve a computer's performance; this is usually associated with cooling and involves changes to components as well as the case.

==History==
When personal computers first became available to the public, the majority were produced in simple, beige-colored cases. This design is sometimes referred to be as a ''[[beige box]]''. Although this met the purpose of containing the components of the [[personal computer]], many users considered their computers as "tacky" or "dull", and some began modifying their existing chassis, or building their own from scratch.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} One of the original case mods is the "Macquarium", which consists of replacing the CRT screen in a [[Compact Macintosh]] case with a [[aquarium|fishbowl]].

A new market for third-party computer cases and accessories began to develop, and today cases are available in a wide variety of colors and styles. Today the business of "modding" computers and their cases is a hugely profitable endeavor, and modding competitions are everywhere.<ref>{{cite web

==Common modifications==

===Appearance===
[[Image:Casemodding microwave.JPG|thumb|300px|Computer built into a [[Microwave oven]]]]
[[File:"Exotic Touch" Custom Case by O. Lüscher.jpg|thumb|A bamboo custom case]]
*'''Peripheral mods''':  [[Peripheral]]s like the keyboard, mouse, and speakers are sometimes painted or otherwise modified to match the computer.  Some system builders, in an effort to make their system more portable and convenient, install speakers and small screens into the case.
*'''Case building''':  Sometime modders build entire cases from scratch.  Some may attempt to treat the case as a work of [[art]]. Others make it look like or appear to be something else, like a teddy bear, wooden cabinet, a shelf mounted on a wall, or antique equipment such as a [[Macintosh Plus]] or an old [[Atari 2600]] [[video game console]].  Relatively few case [[modders]] or builders make their computer cases from scratch; those who do sometimes put hundreds of hours into their work.  The [http://www.bit-tech.net/modding/2006/05/22/wmd_part2_g-gnome_case_mod/1.html WMD case], [http://www.thebestcasescenario.com/forum/showthread.php?t=28&page=6 Project Nighthawk], and [http://forums.bit-tech.net/showthread.php?t=76374&page=1&pp=20 Dark Blade case] are a few examples of professional cases built from scratch.
*'''Component modding''':  This type of modding, as the name suggests, involves modifying the PC components themselves for a perceived improvement in appearance.  An example is the relocation of buttons on optical drives. This is often done in combination with "stealthing", which hides the drive's visibility by masking it with a blank face. A riskier modification is installing [[hard drive]] windows which show the platters and mechanism, which must be done in a [[clean room]] without significant dust.  Few people have attempted it and results seem to vary. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  Some hard drives, including the [[WD Raptor]], now come with a window as standard.
*'''Laptop modding''': [[Laptop]]s can be modified much like a typical computer case.  While most laptop mods consist of new paint or other finishes, others have chosen to engrave or cut out designs into their laptop cover (behind the screen).  Laptops may also be turned into [[digital photo frame]]s.  These types of mods will typically void the warranty of the device.  To avoid warranty issues, skins or stickers can be purchased that are easily removable from the casing.
[[Image:PC case mod lights.jpg|right|thumbnail|A computer with an led fan]]
*'''Window mods''': This refers to a window placed within one of the panels of a computer case.<ref>{{cite web
| publisher = CrazyPC LLC
| title = Windows Kits
| url = http://www.crazypc.com/products/casemods/windows.htm
| accessdate = 2009-05-07

*'''Lighting mods''': A lighting mod refers to lighting in or on the computer cases.<ref>{{cite web
| publisher = eXtreme PC gear
| title = Case Mod Supplies
| url = http://www.xpcgear.com/casemodding.html
| accessdate = 2009-05-07

| publisher = Xoxide
| title = PC Case Fans and Cooling Fans
| url = http://www.xoxide.com/casefans.html
| accessdate = 2009-05-07
}}</ref> or [[electroluminescent]] wire lights. The lights are sometimes paired with sound controllers that make the lights pulse in time to sound. CCLs come in long tubes and generally produce a little bit of heat. LEDs come in many sizes and forms, most often seen in bars similar to CCLs or within fans. Electroluminescent wire, which takes the form of a small light rope, is sometimes embedded in cables such as [[Serial ATA|SATA]] cables. Lighting modifications are usually paired with window mods to help show off the components. Internal components such as case fans, CPU heatsink fans, and power supplies are often available with built in lighting.

*'''Paint''': Painting a case is another method of distinguishing your work from others. [[Spray paint]] is the common method preferred among amateur modders.<ref>{{cite web
| publisher = Rob 'linear' Arnold
| title = case mod 101: how to paint your computer case

| accessdate = 2009-05-07
}}</ref> There are many spray painting guides for amateur modders. The finish cannot be compared to automotive paint or [[powder coating]], but is a simple way to change the look of a case. Re-colouring the plastics of a case, keyboard, mouse and speakers with vinyl dye is another method of highlighting your system and making it different than the rest. [[Vinyl dye]] has the advantages of ease of use like spray paint, but is much more durable as it does not chip or scratch off, it also does not create a ‘layer’ like paint.

===Function===

*'''Cooling mods''': There are many modifications that can fall into this category. The most common one is simply drilling a mount for a new fan,<ref>{{cite web
| publisher = LegitReviews.com
| title = Case Mod-Fans
| url = http://forums.legitreviews.com/about19907.html

| accessdate = 2009-05-07
}}</ref> filtering, sealing openings to make air flow over hot components instead of escaping near where it entered, or even the adding of a tank of pressurized [[carbon dioxide]] or liters of [[mineral oil]] to the case. These modifications are often performed by [[Overclocking|overclockers]] either looking for better cooling for hot components or [[Quiet PC|noise (sound) reduction]]. Some fan modifications are merely a show of modding skill or talent and have no functional purpose.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Hardcore [[Overclocking|overclockers]] often install cooling systems for the sole purpose of achieving performance records.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  Such systems may include [[water cooling]], [[phase transition|phase change]] materials, [[Thermoelectric effect#Peltier effect|thermoelectric/Peltier]]coolers, and [[liquid nitrogen]].

==Less common modifications==
[[Image:Saibotcaseside.jpg|left|thumbnail|A computer modded with different coloured [[CCFL]]s and [[LED]] fans. ]]
*'''Automotive paint & other finishes''':  Automotive paint refers to the paint typically seen on cars and trucks.  This type of finish requires a compressed air source, such as an [[air compressor]] or [[CO2]] tank, and a [[spray gun]].  It is more expensive than a finish using [[Aerosol paint|spray cans]], but when done skillfully it can be better looking and much more durable.  Other methods of painting can include [[powder coating]] which is highly durable though not quite as aesthetically pleasing to many modders as automotive paint.  [[Electroplating]] can also be done on steel computer cases and parts.  Aluminum cases can be plated or [[Anodizing|anodized]] as well, and processes are available to plate plastic cases.  Plated coatings can range from nickel to chrome and even gold.  More elaborate finishes can be crafted by using a combination of techniques, such as chrome plating with a transparent color coat.
*'''Body filler''': Body filler (or [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]]) is a two-part putty often used to fix dents in automobiles.  Case modders use it to fill and sculpt their own creations.  When mixed with a paste catalyst the filler hardens in a short period of time and can be sanded, ground or cut to a desired shape.  An alternative system uses [[fiberglass]] resin (catalyzed with liquid hardener) and either fiberglass cloth or mat to fill holes and form shapes.  Lacquer based Spot Putty is often used to fill smaller imperfections before the application of [[Primer (paint)|primer]].  Typically, a case modder uses a combination of these materials to obtain the desired result.  This method is usually used on the front plastic bezel of a computer case to give it a new look.

==Contests==
Many websites and companies feature contests for case modders, awarding prizes and accolades to the winners. Examples include bit-tech's Mod of the Month and Mod of the Year competitions, while some of these contests are sponsored by computer enthusiast magazines, such as CPU magazine or Custom PC Magazine, both of which have monthly modding contests. Other contests are sometimes supported by computer parts manufacturers.

==Console case modding==

[[File:Gold Xbox.jpg|thumb|300px|An example of an Xbox 360 case mod]]
''Console case modding'' refers to the modification of the case of a game consoles. The most common consoles to modify are the Xbox and Xbox 360, because there is much more room inside to customize them with items such as lights and fans. Moreover, the Xbox 360 requires additional cooling over the factory configuration to avoid [[Xbox 360 technical problems|overheating issues]] due to the use of the wrong type of lead-free solder, which was not capable of handling the temperature limits standard solder can.<ref>{{cite news|title=Coolest electronic gear way too hot for its own good|work=Chicago Tribune|date=August 13, 2007|authors=Alex Pham, Dawn Chmielewski|page=D5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1040835/bbc-watchdog-reviews-xbox-360-ring-death |title=Bbc watchdog reviews xbox 360 ring-of-death |publisher=The Inquirer |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref> These consoles and their controllers are also relatively easy to take apart. For those who do not wish to scratch-build mods, there are several companies that sell transparent Xbox cases and various cooling/lighting equipment for them.

Console case modding started in the late 1980s when the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]], were released; many customers simply put pictures or stickers on them until the [[PlayStation]] was released. Many case modders started to change hardware, for example by altering them to play copied games (known as 'chipping' the games console). The most common modification for the PlayStation was the 'chipping' process (mentioned above). When the [[Nintendo 64]], [[Dreamcast]] and [[PlayStation 2]] were released, many chipped them, styled them, and added additional cooling; some went as far as changing the hardware itself. When the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Xbox 360]] were released, many modders personally customized them further, using neon lights, transparent cases, fans, and PC hard drives (as opposed to Xbox-branded drives). Many modders found that altering the interior of Xbox 360s was difficult due to absence of a power cable (normally in a PC, this cord attaches the hard disk drive to its motherboard). Despite shortcomings, modders also found a way to power neon lighting and other powered equipment by using the DVD-ROM power supply; however, due to insufficient power to the hard disk drive, it often caused freezing during disk access. Another common method for internal case modding uses the power outlet for the internal fan by splitting the cord with a "Y" connector.  However, the most up to date modders will use power points under where the PSU (power supply) plugs in, which doesn't diminish any (or very little) power from the console.

[[File:Pericles 1609.jpg|thumb|right|The 1609 [[quarto]] edition title page.]]
'''''Pericles, Prince of Tyre''''' is a [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] play written at least in part by [[William Shakespeare]] and included in modern editions of his collected works despite questions over its authorship, as it was not included in the [[First Folio]]. Whilst various arguments support that Shakespeare is the sole author of the play (notably DelVecchio and Hammond's Cambridge edition of the play), modern editors generally agree that Shakespeare is responsible for almost exactly half the play—827 lines—the main portion after scene 9 that follows the story of Pericles and Marina.{{efn|E. g., DelVecchio & Hammond,<ref name=Del />{{rp|p.9}} Gossett,<ref name=Gossett/>{{rp|p.47–54}} Warren,<ref name=Warren/>{{rp|p.4–6}} and Mowat.<ref name=Mowat/>{{rp|p.lii}}}} Modern textual studies indicate that the first two acts of 835 lines detailing the many voyages of Pericles were written by a mediocre collaborator, which strong evidence suggests to have been the [[Licensed_victualler#Licensed_victualler|victualler]], [[Procuring (prostitution)|pander]], dramatist and [[pamphlet]]eer [[George Wilkins]].<ref name=Vickers/>{{rp|p.291–332}}

==Synopsis==
John Gower introduces each act with a prologue. The play opens in the court of Antiochus, king of [[Antioch]], who has offered the hand of his beautiful daughter to any man who answers his riddle; but those who fail shall die.

<blockquote><poem>
I am no viper, yet I feed
On mother's flesh which did me breed.
I sought a husband, in which labour
I found that kindness in a father:
He's father, son, and husband mild;
I mother, wife, and yet his child.
How they may be, and yet in two,
As you will live, resolve it you.
</poem></blockquote>

Pericles, the young Prince (ruler) of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] in [[Phoenicia]] ([[Lebanon]]), hears the riddle, and instantly understands its meaning: Antiochus is engaged in an [[incest]]uous relationship with his daughter. If he reveals this truth, he will be killed, but if he answers incorrectly, he will also be killed. Pericles hints that he knows the answer, and asks for more time to think. Antiochus grants him forty days, and then sends an assassin after him. However, Pericles has fled the city in disgust.

Pericles returns to [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], where his trusted friend and counsellor Helicanus advises him to leave the city, for Antiochus surely will hunt him down. Pericles leaves Helicanus as [[regent]] and sails to [[Tarsus in Cilicia|Tarsus]], a city beset by [[famine]]. The generous Pericles gives the governor of the city, Cleon, and his wife Dionyza, grain from his ship to save their people. The famine ends, and after being thanked profusely by Cleon and Dionyza, Pericles continues on.

A storm wrecks Pericles' ship and washes him up on the shores of [[Cyrenaica|Pentapolis]]. He is rescued by a group of poor [[fishing|fishermen]] who inform him that Simonedes, King of Pentapolis, is holding a tournament the next day and that the winner will receive the hand of his daughter Thaisa in marriage. Fortunately, one of the fishermen drags Pericles' suit of armour on shore that very moment, and the prince decides to enter the tournament. Although his equipment is rusty, Pericles wins the tournament and the hand of Thaisa (who is deeply attracted to him) in marriage. Simonedes initially expresses doubt about the union, but soon comes to like Pericles and allows them to wed.

A letter sent by the noblemen reaches Pericles in Pentapolis, who decides to return to Tyre with the pregnant Thaisa. Again, a storm arises while at sea, and Thaisa appears to die giving birth to her child, Marina. The sailors insist that Thaisa's body be set overboard in order to calm the storm. Pericles grudgingly agrees, and decides to stop at Tarsus because he fears that Marina may not survive the storm.

Luckily, Thaisa's casket washes ashore at [[Ephesus]] near the residence of Lord Cerimon, a physician who revives her. Thinking that Pericles died in the storm, Thaisa becomes a priestess in the [[Temple of Artemis|temple]] of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].

Pericles departs to rule Tyre, leaving Marina in the care of Cleon and Dionyza.

Marina grows up more beautiful than Philoten the daughter of Cleon and Dionyza, so Dionyza plans Marina's murder. The plan is thwarted when pirates kidnap Marina and then sell her to a brothel in [[Mytilene]]. There, Marina manages to keep her virginity by convincing the men that they should seek virtue. Worried that she is ruining their market, the brothel rents her out as a tutor to respectable young ladies. She becomes famous for music and other decorous entertainments.

Meanwhile, Pericles returns to Tarsus for his daughter. The governor and his wife claim she has died; in grief, he takes to the sea.

Pericles' wanderings bring him to Mytilene where the governor Lysimachus, seeking to cheer him up, brings in Marina. They compare their sad stories and joyfully realise they are father and daughter. Next, the goddess Diana appears in a dream to Pericles, and tells him to come to the temple where he finds Thaisa. The wicked Cleon and Dionyza are killed when their people revolt against their crime. Lysimachus will marry Marina.

==Sources==
The play draws upon two sources for the plot. The first is ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (1393) of [[John Gower]], an English poet and contemporary of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. This provides the story of [[Apollonius of Tyre]]. The second source is the [[Lawrence Twine]] prose version of Gower's tale, ''[[The Pattern of Painful Adventures]]'', dating from c. 1576, reprinted in 1607. Moreover, a third related work is ''The Painful Adventures of Pericles'' by George Wilkins, published in 1608. But this seems to be a "novelization" of the play, stitched together with bits from Twine; Wilkins mentions the play in the Argument to his version of the story<ref name=Halliday/>{{rp|p.528}} – so that Wilkins' novel derives from the play, not the play from the novel. Wilkins, who with Shakespeare was a witness in the [[Bellott v. Mountjoy]] lawsuit of 1612,<ref>Charles Nicholl, 'The gent upstairs', ''Guardian'' 20 October 2007.</ref> has been an obvious candidate for the author of the non-Shakespearean matter in the play's first two acts; Wilkins wrote plays very similar in style, and no better candidate has been found.

The choruses spoken by Gower were influenced by Barnabe Barnes's ''[[The Diuils Charter]]'' (1607) and by ''The Trauailes of the Three English Brothers'' (1607), by [[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]], [[William Rowley]], and Wilkins.<ref>British Library, [http://www.bl.uk/treasures/shakespeare/pericles.html "Pericles, creation of the play"], ''Shakespeare Quartos''.</ref>

==Date and text==
Most scholars support 1607 or early 1608 as most likely, which accords well with what is known about the play's likely co-author, George Wilkins, whose extant literary career seems to span only three years, 1606 to 1608.<ref>Stephen Orgel, Stephen. Introduction to ''Pericles'' in ''The Complete Pelican Shakespeare'' (2002) p. 606.</ref><ref>Nicholl, Charles. ''The Lodger'' (2007) p. 199.</ref> The only published text of ''Pericles'', the 1609 quarto (all subsequent quartos were reprints of the original), is manifestly corrupt; it is often clumsily written and incomprehensible and has been interpreted as a pirated text reconstructed from memory by someone who witnessed the play (much like theories surrounding the 1603 "[[bad quarto]]" of ''[[Hamlet]]'').<ref>Edwards, Philip. "An Approach to the Problem of Pericles." ''Shakespeare Studies'' 5 (1952): 26.</ref> The play was printed in [[book size|quarto]] twice in 1609 by the stationer Henry Gosson. Subsequent quarto printings appeared in 1611, 1619, 1630, and 1635; it was one of Shakespeare's most popular plays in his own historical era. The play was not included in the [[First Folio]] in 1623; it was one of seven plays added to the original Folio thirty-six in the second impression of the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Third Folio]] in 1664. [See: [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)]].] [[William Jaggard]] included ''Pericles'' in his 1619 [[False Folio]].

The editors of the Oxford and Arden editions of ''Pericles'' accept Wilkins as Shakespeare's collaborator, citing [[stylometry|stylistic]] links between the play and Wilkins's style that are found nowhere else in Shakespeare.<ref name=Warren/>{{rp|p.60–71}} The Cambridge editors reject this contention, arguing that the play is entirely by Shakespeare and that all the oddities can be defended as a deliberately old-fashioned style; however, they do not discuss the stylistic links with Wilkins's work or any of the scholarly papers demonstrating contrary opinions.<ref name=Del /> If the play was co-written or revised by Wilkins, this would support a later date, as it is believed Wilkins' career as a writer spanned only the years 1606-8.<ref>Roger Prior, "The Life of George Wilkins," ''Shakespeare Survey'' 55 (1972).</ref> The 1986 [[Oxford University Press]] edition of the ''Complete Works'' and the subsequent individual edition include a "reconstructed text" of ''Pericles'', which adapts passages from Wilkins' novel on the assumption that they are based on the play and record the dialogue more accurately than the quarto.

The play has been recognised as a probable collaboration since 1709, if not earlier. In that year [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]] wrote, "there is good Reason to believe that the greatest part of that Play was not written by him; tho' it is own'd, some part of it certainly was, particularly the last Act."<ref>Rowe, Nicholas, ''Some Account of the Life &c. of
Mr. William Shakespeare'', 1709.</ref> Rowe here seems to be summarising what he believes to be a consensus view in his day, although some critics thought it was either an early Shakespeare work or not written by him at all.<ref name=Vickers/>{{rp|p.291–293}} Wilkins has been proposed as the co-author since 1868.<ref>Jackson, MacDonald P. ''Defining Shakespeare: Pericles as a Test Case''. (200) n13 p. 34.</ref> In 1919, H. Dugdale Sykes published a detailed comparison of numerous parallels between the first half of Pericles and four of Wilkins's works, but he thought that Wilkins's novelisation of the play preceded its composition.<ref name=Vickers/>{{rp|p.297–305}} Many other scholars followed Sykes in his identification of Wilkins, most notably Jonathan Hope in 1994 and [[MacDonald P. Jackson]] in 1993 and 2003.<ref>Hope, Jonathan. ''The Authorship of Shakespeare's Plays: A Socio-Linguistic Study'' (Cambridge, 1994); Jackson, MacDonald P. "The Authorship of ''Pericles'': The Evidence of Infinitives", ''Note & Queries'' 238 (2993): pp. 197–200; Jackson 2003.</ref> In 2002, Prof. Brian Vickers summarised the historical evidence and took the Cambridge editors to task for ignoring more than a century of scholarship.<ref name=Vickers/>{{rp|p.291–332}}

==Analysis and criticism==
Critical response to the play has not been warm, to say the least. In 1629, [[Ben Jonson]] lamented the audiences' enthusiastic responses to the play:

<blockquote><poem>
No doubt some mouldy tale,
Like Pericles; and stale
As the Shrieve's crusts, and nasty as his fish—
Scraps out of every dish
Throwne forth, and rak't into the common tub (Ben Jonson, ''Ode (to Himself)'')
</poem></blockquote>

In 1660, at the start of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] when the theatres had just re-opened, [[Thomas Betterton]] played the title role in a new production of ''Pericles'' at the [[Cockpit Theatre]], the first production of any of Shakespeare's works in the new era.<ref name=Gossett/>{{rp|p.4}}

After Jonson and until the mid-twentieth century, critics found little to like or praise in the play. For example,
nineteenth-century scholar [[Edward Dowden]] wrestled with the text and found that the play “as a whole is singularly undramatic” and “entirely lacks unity of action."<ref name=Dowden/>{{rp|p.145}}  The episodic nature of the play combined with the Act Four’s lewdness troubled Dowden because these traits problemetised his idea of Shakespeare. Dowden also banished ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' from the canon because it belonged to “the pre-Shakespearean school of bloody dramas”.<ref name=Dowden/>{{rp|p.54}}

[[T. S. Eliot]] found more to admire, saying of the moment of Pericles' reunion with his daughter: "To my mind the finest of all the 'recognition scenes' is Act V,i of that very great play ''Pericles''. It is a perfect example of the 'ultra-dramatic', a dramatic action of beings who are more than human... or rather, seen in a light more than that of day."

The New Bibliographers of the early twentieth century [[Alfred W. Pollard]], [[Walter Wilson Greg]], and [[R. B. McKerrow]]
gave increased attention to the examination of quarto editions of Shakespearean plays published before the [[First Folio]] (1623). ''Pericles'' was among the most notorious "bad quartos."  In the second half of the twentieth century, critics began to warm to the play. After John Arthos' 1953 article "''Pericles, Prince of Tyre'': A Study in the Dramatic Use of Romantic Narrative,"<ref>''Shakespeare Quarterly'' 4 257–270</ref> scholars began to find merits and interesting facets within the play's dramaturgy, narrative and use of the marvelous. And, while the play's textual critics have sharply disagreed about editorial methodology in the last half-century, almost all of them, beginning with [[F. D. Hoeniger]] with his 1963 ''Arden 2'' edition, have been enthusiastic about ''Pericles'' (Other, more recent, critics have been [[Stephen Orgel]] (''Pelican Shakespeare''), Suzanne Gossett (''Arden 3''), Roger Warren (''Reconstructed Oxford''), [[Harold Bloom]] said that the play works well on the stage despite its problems.<ref>Harold Bloom "Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human" (Riverhead Books, 1998) p. 604.</ref>{{Clarify|date=August 2009}}<!--Please include quotations of exactly what he said--> and Doreen DelVecchio and Antony Hammond (''Cambridge'')).<ref name=Del />{{rp|p.7}}

In 2005, The New Globe in London and The Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, DC presented two very different but, nonetheless, critically acclaimed productions of the play.

==Performance history==
The [[Venetian Republic|Venetian ambassador to England]], [[Zorzi Giustinian]], saw a play titled ''Pericles'' during his time in London, which ran from 5 Jan. 1606 to 23 Nov. 1608. As far as is known, there was no other play with the same title that was acted in this era; the logical assumption is that this must have been Shakespeare's play.<ref name=Halliday/>{{rp|p.188}} The title page of the play's first printed edition states that the play was often acted at the [[Globe Theatre]], which was most likely true.

The earliest performance of ''Pericles'' known with certainty occurred in May 1619, at Court, "in the King's great chamber" at [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]]. The play was also performed at the [[Globe Theatre]] on 10 June 1631.<ref name=Halliday />{{rp|p.363}} A play called ''Pericles'' was in the repertory of a [[recusant]] group of itinerant players arrested for performing a religious play in [[Yorkshire]] in 1609; however, it is not clear if they performed ''Pericles'', or if theirs was Shakespeare's play.

[[John Rhodes (17th century)|John Rhodes]] staged ''Pericles'' at the [[Cockpit Theatre]] soon after the theatres re-opened in 1660; it was one of the earliest productions, and the first Shakespearean revival, of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] period. [[Thomas Betterton]] made his stage debut in the title role. Yet the play's pseudo-naive structure placed it at odds with the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] tastes of the Restoration era. It vanished from the stage for nearly two centuries, until [[Samuel Phelps]] staged a production at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] in [[Clerkenwell]] in 1854. Phelps cut Gower entirely, satisfying his narrative role with new scenes, conversations between unnamed gentlemen like those in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', 5.2. In accordance with Victorian notions of decorum, the play's frank treatment of incest and prostitution was muted or removed.

[[Walter Nugent Monck]] revived the play in 1929 at his [[Maddermarket Theatre]] in [[Norwich]], cutting the first act. This production was revived at Stratford after the war, with [[Paul Scofield]] in the title role.

=== Modern revivals ===


The play has risen somewhat in popularity since Monck, though it remains difficult to stage convincingly, an aspect played with in ''[[Paris Belongs to Us]]'' (filmed 1957–1960). In 1958, [[Tony Richardson]] directed the play at the [[Shakespeare Memorial Theatre]] in Stratford. The scene design, by [[Loudon Sainthill]],<ref>[http://www.australiadancing.org/subjects/3981.html Australia Dancing – Sainthill, Loudon (1919–1969)]</ref> unified the play; the stage was dominated by a large ship in which Gower related the tale to a group of sailors. [[Geraldine McEwan]] played Marina; [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] was Pericles; and [[Mark Dignam]] was Simonides. [[Angela Baddeley]] was the Bawd. The production was a success; it was later viewed as a model for "coherent" or thematically unified approaches, in contrast to the postmodern or disintegrative approaches of the seventies and eighties.

* The 1969 production by [[Terry Hands]] at Stratford also received favourable reviews. The set was almost bare, with a hanging replica of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Vitruvian Man]] above a bare stage. Hands also introduced extensive doubling, which has since become a staple of productions of this play. [[Emrys James]] played Gower (as a Welsh bard) and Helicanus. [[Susan Fleetwood]] doubled Thaisa and Marina (with [[Susan Sheers]] playing Marina when the two characters appear together in the final scene).<ref name=Warren/>{{rp|p.23}} [[Ian Richardson]] played the title role. For the performances on the nights of the [[Moon landing|Apollo landing]], Hands added a special acknowledgment of the event to Gower's lines.

* Ron Daniels directed the play in 1979 at [[The Other Place (theatre)|The Other Place]], an unlikely venue for such an expansive play. Daniels compensated for the lack of space by canny use of lighting and offstage music and sound effects. [[Peter McEnery]] played Pericles; [[Julie Peasgood]] was Marina. [[Griffith Jones (actor)|Griffith Jones]] was Gower.

* The play was included in the [[BBC Television Shakespeare|BBC's prestigious Shakespeare collection]] and first transmitted on 8 December 1984. The play was opened out so as to deal with the various locations and time intervals and was given a thoughtful and moving interpretation. Mike Gwilym played Pericles, Amanda Redman was Marina and Juliet Stevenson was Thaisa.

* In 1989, David Thacker directed the play at the [[Swan Theatre (Stratford)|Swan]]. The production was centred on a grid-covered trap suspended in air; the brothel scenes were played below, as in a basement; the shipboard scenes were played on and around the grid. [[Rudolph Walker]] was Gower, dressed as a bureaucrat; [[Nigel Terry]] played Pericles, and Suzan Sylvester and Sally Edwards were Marina and Thaisa, respectively.

* Productions in the 1990s differed from earlier productions in that they generally stressed the dislocation and diversity inherent in the play's setting, rather than striving for thematic and tonal coherence. As early as 1983, [[Peter Sellars]] directed a production in Boston that featured extras dressed as contemporary American [[homelessness|homeless people]]; devices such as these dominated English main stages in the nineties. Phyllida Lloyd directed the play at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in 1994. The production used extensive doubling. [[Kathryn Hunter]] played Antiochus, Cerimon, and the Bawd. The production made extensive use of the mechanised wheel in the theatre to emphasise movement in time and space; however, the wheel's noise made some scenes difficult to hear, and some critics disparaged what they saw as pointless gimmickry in the staging.

* [[Adrian Noble]]'s 2002 production at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] (his last before leaving the RSC) stressed diversity in another way. Responding to critical interest in [[Orientalism]], Noble accentuated the multicultural aspects of the play's setting. [[Ray Fearon]] took the title role to Lauren Ward's Thaisa; [[Kananu Kirimi]] played Marina. [[Brian Protheroe]] was Gower. In an echo of the music played during the interval of the 1619 Whitehall performance, Noble featured belly dancing and drumming during the intermission of his production.

* The [[Hudson Shakespeare Company]] of New Jersey mounted the play in two separate productions in their annual [[Shakespeare in the Park festivals|Shakespeare in the Parks]] series, directed by Jon Ciccarelli (2006) and Noelle Fair (2014) respectively. Both directors noted the 2002 Adrian Noble production as a direct influence on their productions utilizing diversely ethnic casts and set in Mediterranean locales. Ciccarelli's production took a more historical and literary slant on the story using [[Gower]] as a direct story teller of the action in medieval costume vs. the Greek/Turish garb of the main cast. Fair's production took a more dream like approach using a variety of international music and devised movement pieces to convey the Gower dialogue.<ref>{{cite news|title=Shakespeare Troupe bringing "Pericles" to Stratford Library Shakespeare Company to perform on July 8|url=http://www.hudsonshakespeare.org/Articles/2006articles/periclestratford.html|publisher=Stratford Bard|date=June 2006}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Shakespeare's 'Pericles' comes to Kenilworth Aug. 14|url=http://www.nj.com/cranford/index.ssf/2014/07/shakespeares_pericles_comes_to.html|publisher=Cranford Chronicle|date=July 29, 2014}}</ref>

In the [[First Folio]], the [[Play (theatre)|plays]] of [[William Shakespeare]] were grouped into three categories: comedies, [[Shakespearean history|histories]], and [[Shakespearean tragedy|tragedies]], though today many scholars recognize a fourth category, romance, to describe the specific types of comedies that appear as Shakespeare's later works.

"[[Comedy]]", in its [[Elizabethan]] usage, had a very different meaning from modern comedy. A Shakespearean comedy is one that has a happy ending, usually involving marriages between the unmarried characters, and a tone and style that is more light-hearted than Shakespeare's other plays. Patterns in the comedies include movement to a "green world",<ref>Regan, Richard. "[http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/rjregan/rrScom.htm Shakespearean comedy]". Retrieved on 11 January 2007.</ref> both internal and external conflicts, and a tension between [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] values. Shakespearean comedies tend to also include:
* A greater emphasis on situations than characters (this numbs the audience's connection to the characters, so that when characters experience misfortune, the audience still finds it laughable)
* A struggle of young lovers to overcome difficulty, often presented by elders
* Separation and re-unification
* Deception of characters (especially mistaken identity)
* A clever servant
* Disputes between characters, often within a family 
* Multiple, intertwining plots
* Use of all styles of comedy (slapstick, puns, dry humour, earthy humour, witty banter, practical) 
* Pastoral element (courtly people living an idealized, rural life), originally an element of Pastoral Romance, exploited by Shakespeare for his comic plots and often parodied therein for humorous effects
* Happy ending

Several of Shakespeare's comedies, such as ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' and ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]],'' have an unusual tone with a difficult mix of humour and tragedy which has led them to be classified as [[Shakespearean problem play|problem plays]]. It is not clear whether the uneven nature of these dramas is due to an imperfect understanding of [[Elizabethan]] humour and society, a fault on Shakespeare's part, or a deliberate attempt by him to blend styles and subvert the audience's expectations. By the end of Shakespeare's life, he had written seventeen comedies. [[Cymbeline]], listed in this article with the comedies, was, in the First Folio, included among the tragedies, even though it has many of the features of the so-called "late romances" (including a happy ending).

'''Exchangeable image file format''' (officially '''Exif''', not EXIF according to JEIDA/JEITA/CIPA specifications) is a standard that specifies the [[file format|formats]] for [[image]]s, [[sound]], and ancillary tags used by [[digital camera]]s (including [[smartphone]]s), [[Image scanner|scanners]] and other systems handling image and sound files recorded by digital cameras. The specification uses the following existing file formats with the addition of specific [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] tags: [[JPEG]] [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT)<ref>{{Citation |first=N. |last=Ahmed |author1-link=N.

This standard consists of the Exif image file specification and the Exif audio file specification.

=={{anchor|1.0|1.1|2.0|R98|2.1|2.2|2.21|2.3}}Background==
The [[Japan Electronic Industries Development Association]] (JEIDA) produced the initial definition of Exif. Version 2.1 of the specification is dated 12<!-- To be checked: 1 or 12? --> June 1998. [[Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association|JEITA]] established Exif version 2.2 (aka "'''Exif Print'''"), dated 20 February 2002 and released in April 2002.<ref>{{cite paper |author=Technical Standardization Committee on AV & IT Storage Systems and Equipment |title=Exchangeable Image File Format for Digital Still Cameras |id=JEITA CP-3451 |version=Version 2.2 |publisher=[[Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association]] |url=http://www.exif.org/Exif2-2.PDF |date=April 2002 |accessdate=2008-01-28}}</ref> Version 2.21 (with [[Adobe RGB]] support) is dated 11 July 2003, but was released in September 2003 following the release of DCF 2.0. The latest, version 2.3, released on 26 April 2010 and revised in May 2013, was jointly formulated by [[Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association|JEITA]] and [[Camera & Imaging Products Association|CIPA]]. Exif is supported by almost all camera manufacturers.

The metadata tags defined in the Exif standard cover a broad spectrum:
* Date and time information.  Digital cameras will record the current date and time and save this in the metadata.
* Camera settings.  This includes static information such as the camera model and make, and information that varies with each image such as orientation (rotation), [[aperture]], [[shutter speed]], [[focal length]], [[metering mode]], and [[ISO speed]] information.
* A [[thumbnail]] for previewing the picture on the camera's LCD screen, in file managers, or in photo manipulation software.
* Descriptions
* Copyright information.

==Technical==
The Exif tag structure is borrowed from TIFF files. On several image specific properties, there is a large overlap between the tags defined in the [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], Exif, [[Tag Image File Format / Electronic Photography|TIFF/EP]], and [[Design rule for Camera File system|DCF]] standards. For descriptive metadata, there is an overlap between Exif and [[IPTC Information Interchange Model]] info, which also can be embedded in a JPEG file.

When Exif is employed for [[JPEG]] files, the Exif data are stored in one of JPEG's defined utility ''Application Segments'', the APP1 (segment marker 0xFFE1), which in effect holds an entire TIFF file within. When Exif is employed in TIFF files (also when used as "an embedded TIFF file" mentioned earlier), the TIFF Private Tag 0x8769 defines a sub-Image File Directory (IFD) that holds the Exif specified TIFF Tags. In addition, Exif also defines a [[Global Positioning System]] sub-IFD using the TIFF Private Tag 0x8825, holding location information, and an "Interoperability IFD" specified within the Exif sub-IFD, using the Exif tag 0xA005.

Formats specified in Exif standard are defined as folder structures that are based on Exif-JPEG and recording formats for memory. When these formats are used as Exif/DCF files together with the DCF specification (for better interoperability among devices of different types), their scope shall cover devices, recording media, and application software that handle them.

==Geolocation==
{{See also|Geotagging}}

The Exif format has standard tags for location information. {{As of | 2014}} many cameras and most mobile phones have a built-in GPS receiver that stores the location information in the Exif header when a picture is taken. Some other cameras have a separate GPS receiver that fits into the flash connector or [[hot shoe]]. Recorded GPS data can also be added to any digital photograph on a computer, either by correlating the time stamps of the photographs with a [[GPS tracking|GPS record]] from a hand-held GPS receiver or manually by using a map or mapping software. The process of adding geographic information to a photograph is known as [[Geotagged photograph|geotagging]]. Photo-sharing communities like [[Panoramio]], [[locr]] or [[Flickr]] equally allow their users to upload geocoded pictures or to add geolocation information online.

==Program support==
Exif data are embedded within the image file itself.  While many recent [[Graphics software|image manipulation programs]] recognize and preserve Exif data when writing to a modified image, this is not the case for most older programs. Many image gallery programs also recognise Exif data and optionally display it alongside the images.

Software libraries, such as libexif<ref>{{cite web | url=http://libexif.sourceforge.net/ | title=The libexif C EXIF for C | accessdate=2009-11-08 }}</ref> for [[C (programming language)|C]] and Adobe XMP Toolkit<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp.html | title=Adobe XMP Toolkit SDK | publisher= Adobe Inc. }}</ref> or Exiv2<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.exiv2.org/ | title=Exiv2 Image Metadata Library | publisher=Andreas Huggel | accessdate=2009-02-12}}</ref> for [[C++]], Metadata Extractor<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.drewnoakes.com/code/exif/ | title=Metadata Extractor | publisher=Drew Noakes | accessdate=2011-02-18}}</ref> for [[Java (programming language)|Java]], or [[ExifTool|Image::ExifTool]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/ | title=Image::ExifTool Perl library | publisher=Phil Harvey | accessdate=2009-02-12}}</ref> for [[Perl]], parse Exif data from files and read/write Exif tag values.

==Problems==

===Technical===
The Exif format has a number of drawbacks, mostly relating to its use of legacy file structures.

* The derivation of Exif from the TIFF file structure using offset pointers in the files means that data can be spread anywhere within a file, which means that software is likely to corrupt any pointers or corresponding data that it doesn't decode/encode. For this reason most image editors damage or remove the Exif metadata to some extent upon saving.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=TIFF Revision 6.0 | url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/tiff/TIFF6.pdf | publisher=Adobe | date=1992-06-03 | accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref>

* The standard defines a MakerNote tag, which allows camera manufacturers to place any custom format metadata in the file. This is used increasingly by camera manufacturers to store myriad camera settings not listed in the Exif standard, such as shooting modes, post-processing settings, serial number, focusing modes, etc.  As this tag format is proprietary and manufacturer-specific, it can be prohibitively difficult to retrieve this information from an image (or properly preserve it when rewriting an image).  Some manufacturers encrypt portions of the information; for example, Nikon encrypts the detailed lens data in their newer MakerNote data versions.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Nikon Tags: Nikon LensData01 Tags | url=http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/TagNames/Nikon.html#LensData01 | publisher=Phil Harvey | date=2008-01-25 | accessdate=2008-01-28}}</ref>

* The standard only allows TIFF or JPEG files&nbsp;— there is no provision for a "raw" file type which would be a direct data dump from the sensor device. This has caused camera manufacturers to invent many proprietary, incompatible "raw" file formats.  To solve this problem, Adobe developed the [[Digital Negative (file format)|DNG]] format (a TIFF-based raw file format), in hopes that manufacturers would standardize on a single, raw file format.

* The Exif standard specifically states that color depth is always 24 bits.<ref>(JEITA CP-3451) Section 4.4.3: Pixel Composition and Sampling</ref> However, many modern cameras, such as the [[Nikon D70]] which captures 36 bits of color per pixel, can capture significantly more. Since Exif/DCF files cannot represent this color depth, many manufacturers have developed proprietary, non-compatible [[Raw image format]]s.

* Exif is very often used in images created by scanners, but the standard makes no provisions for any scanner-specific information.

* Photo manipulation software sometimes fails to update the embedded thumbnail after an editing operation, possibly causing the user to inadvertently publish compromising information.<ref>{{cite web | author= Maximillian Dornseif | title=EXIF Thumbnail in JPEG images | url=http://blogs.23.nu/disLEXia/stories/5751 | publisher=disLEXia 3000 blog | date=2004-12-17 | accessdate=2008-01-28}} {{Dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref>

* Exif metadata are restricted in size to 64 kB in JPEG images because according to the specification this information must be contained within a single JPEG APP1 segment. Although the [[#FlashPix extensions|FlashPix extensions]] allow information to span multiple JPEG APP2 segments, these extensions are not commonly used.  This has prompted some camera manufacturers to develop non-standard techniques for storing the large preview images used by some digital cameras for [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] review. These non-standard extensions are commonly lost if a user re-saves the image using image editor software, possibly rendering the image incompatible with the original camera that created it.  (In 2009, CIPA released the [[Multi-Picture Format]] specification which addresses this deficiency and provides a standard way to store large previews in JPEG images.<ref>{{cite web | title=Multi-Picture Format | url=http://www.cipa.jp/std/documents/e/DC-007_E.pdf | publisher=CIPA | date=2009-02-04 | accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref>)

* There is no way to record time-zone information along with the time, thus rendering the stored time ambiguous.

* There is no field to record readouts of a camera's [[accelerometers]] or [[inertial navigation system]]. Such data could help to establish the relationship between the image sensor’s XYZ coordinate system and the gravity [[Euclidean vector|vector]] (i.e., which way is down in this image). It could also establish relative camera positions or orientations in a sequence of photos.

===Privacy and security===

Since the Exif tag contains metadata about the photo, it can pose a privacy issue. For example, a photo taken with a [[GPS]]-enabled camera can reveal the exact location and time it was taken, and the unique ID number of the device - this is all done by default - often without the user's knowledge.  Many users may be unaware that their photos are tagged by default in this manner, or that specialist software may be required to remove the Exif tag before publishing.  For example, a [[whistleblower]], journalist or [[political dissident]] relying on the protection of anonymity to allow them to report [[Misfeasance|malfeasance]] by a corporate entity, criminal, or government may therefore find their safety compromised by this default data collection.

In December 2012, anti-virus programmer [[John McAfee]] was arrested in [[Guatemala]] while fleeing from alleged persecution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/07/world/americas/guatemala-mcafee-asylum-rejected/index.html |title=McAfee wins stay of deportation from Guatemala |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref> in [[Belize]], which shares a border.

According to documents leaked by [[Edward Snowden]], the [[NSA]] is targeting Exif information under the [[XKeyscore]] program.<ref name =Guardian2>{{cite news| author = Staff | title=XKeyscore Presentation from 2008 – Read in Full{{spaced ndash}} Training Materials for the XKeyscore Program Detail How Analysts Can Use It and Other Systems to Mine Enormous Agency Databases and Develop Intelligence from the Web{{spaced ndash}} Revealed: NSA Program That Collects 'Nearly Everything a User Does on the Internet'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jul/31/nsa-xkeyscore-program-full-presentation|accessdate= August 6, 2013|newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date= July 31, 2013}}</ref>

The privacy problem of Exif data can be avoided by removing the Exif data using a [[metadata removal tool]].

==Related standards==

[http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/ Metadata Working Group] was formed by a consortium of companies in 2006 (according to their web page) or 2007 (as stated in their own press release). It released its first document on 24 September 2008,<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Guidelines for Handling Image Metadata | url=http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/specs/ | publisher=Metadata Working group | date=2008-09-24 | accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref> giving recommendations concerning the use of Exif, [[IPTC Information Interchange Model|IPTC]] and [[Extensible Metadata Platform|XMP]] metadata in images.

[[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) was created by [[Adobe Systems]] to be a better metadata format for photography and image processing. However, it is generally unsupported in cameras.

The following table shows Exif data for a photo made with a typical digital camera. Notice that authorship and copyright information is generally not provided in the camera's output, so it must be filled in during later stages of processing. Some programs, such as Canon's [[Digital Photo Professional]], allow the name of the owner to be added to the camera itself.

==MakerNote data==
The 'MakerNote' tag contains image information normally in a proprietary binary format. Some of these manufacturer-specific formats have been decoded:

Unfortunately, the proprietary formats used by many manufacturers break if the MakerNote tag is moved - i.e. by inserting or editing a tag which precedes it.  The reason to edit to the Exif data could be as simple as to add copyright information, an Exif comment, etc.  In some cases, camera vendors also store important information only in proprietary makernote fields, instead of using available Exif standard tags. An example for this is Nikon's ISO settings tag.<ref>{{cite web | author=Andreas Huggel | title=Makernote formats and specifications | url=http://www.exiv2.org/makernote.html | date=2012-04-25 | accessdate=2012-09-09}}</ref>

===Presidential Palace===
{{main|Presidential Palace, Zagreb}}
The Presidential Palace ({{lang-hr|Predsjedni?ki dvori}}, also referred to by the [[metonym]] ''[[Pantov?ak]]'') in [[Zagreb]] is the [[official residence]] of the president. The president does not actually live in the building, as it is used as the Office of the President of Croatia rather than as a residence. The structure covers {{convert|3700|m2|abbr=off}}. It had been used as the official residence since then-president Franjo Tu?man moved there following the October 1991 [[bombing of Banski dvori]]. In addition to the original building, there is also an {{convert|3500|m2|abbr=off}} annex built in 1993, an ancillary structure housing office security services and a [[bomb shelter]] predating the 1990s.<ref name="JL-Pantov?ak">{{cite news|newspaper=[[Jutarnji list]]|language=Croatian|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/-ne-dolazi-u-obzir-da-se-odreknemo-pantovcaka-/307483/|title='Ne dolazi u obzir da se odreknemo Pantov?aka'|trans_title=Giving up Pantov?ak is out of the question|date=25 August 2009|author=Vanja Nezirovi?|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> The building, formerly known as ''Villa Zagorje'' or ''Tito's Villa'', was designed by architects [[Vjenceslav Richter]] and [[Kazimir Ostrogovi?]] and completed in 1964 for the former [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] president [[Josip Broz Tito]].<ref name="JL-Pantov?ak"/><ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]]|language=Croatian|url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/13257/vjenceslav-richter-slikarska-retrospektiva-avangardnog-arhitekta|title=Vjenceslav Richter – slikarska retrospektiva avangardnog arhitekta|trans_title=Vjenceslav Richter – A Painter's Retrospective of an Avant-garde Architect|author=Nina Ožegovi?|date=23 October 2002|accessdate=19 November 2011|archivedate=3 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68sVyy7H8}}</ref>

===History===
[[File:Tapiserija Ured predsjednika RH.JPG|thumb|200px|Tapestry in the Office of the President, flanked by a bust of [[Ante Star?evi?]] and a statue of [[King Tomislav]]]]
The [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]] within [[SFR Yugoslavia]] was led by a group of communist party officials, who formed a collective Presidency with the president of the Presidency at its head. The [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|first democratic elections of 1990]] did not elect members of the Presidency directly. Rather, the parliament was tasked with filling these positions as it had done in the socialist period. The [[Croatian Democratic Union]] won the elections and its leader [[Franjo Tu?man]] assumed the presidency on 30 May 1990. On 25 July of the same year, the parliament passed several constitutional amendments, including amendment LXXI, which created the position of President and Vice-Presidents.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Narodne Novine|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/1990_07_31_610.html|language=Croatian|title=Odluka o proglašenju Amandmana LXIV. do LXXV. na Ustav Socijalisti?ke Republike Hrvatske|trans_title=Decision on Promulgation of Amendments LXIV through LXXV of the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Croatia|date=28 July 1990|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> The [[Constitution of Croatia|Christmas Constitution]], passed on 22 December 1990, established the government as a [[semi-presidential system]] and called for presidential elections.<ref name="JL-ustav">{{cite news|publisher=[[Jutarnji list]]|language=Croatian|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/arlovic-i-seks--bilo-bi-dobro-da-ovaj-ustav-izdrzi-dulje--ali-me-strah-da-ipak-nece/838714/|title=Arlovi?: Bilo bi dobro da ovaj Ustav izdrži dulje, ali me strah da ipak ne?e|trans_title=Arlovi?: It would be good if this constitution lasts, but I fear i will not|author=Veronika Reškovi?|date=17 June 2010|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref>

Tu?man won the [[Croatian presidential election, 1992|presidential elections in 1992]], and was inaugurated on 12 August 1992. He was [[Croatian presidential election, 1997|reelected in 1997]], and the [[Constitution of Croatia]] was amended the same year.<ref name="JL-ustav"/> After his death in 1999, the constitution was amended and much of the presidential powers were transferred to the parliament and the government, creating a [[parliamentary system]].<ref name="BBC-CroProfile">{{cite web|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1097128.stm|title=Croatia country profile|date=20 July 2011|accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref> [[Stjepan Mesi?]] won two consecutive terms in [[Croatian presidential election, 2000|2000]] on the [[Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats|Croatian People's Party]] (HNS) ticket and in [[Croatian presidential election, 2005|2005]], the maximum term permitted by the constitution.

==Immunity and impeachment==
The President of Croatia enjoys [[Parliamentary immunity|immunity]]—the president may not be arrested, nor can any criminal proceedings be instituted against the president without prior consent from the Constitutional Court. The only case in which immunity does not apply is if the president has been caught in the act of committing a criminal offense, which carries a penalty of imprisonment for more than five years. In such a case the state body that has detained the president must notify the President of the Constitutional Court immediately.<ref name="Ustav-RH"/>

The President of Croatia is [[Impeachment|impeachable]] for any violation of the Constitution committed in performance of duty. Impeachment proceedings may be initiated by the Parliament of Croatia by a [[two-thirds majority]] vote of all members of the parliament. The impeachment of the president is then decided by the Constitutional Court, by a two-thirds majority vote of all its judges. If the Constitutional Court impeaches the president, the president's term is terminated.<ref name="Ustav-RH"/>

==Vacancy or incapacity==

In case of brief incapacitation to execute the office of the President of Croatia due to absence, illness or vacations, the president may transfer his powers to the [[List of Speakers of the Croatian Parliament|Speaker of the Croatian Parliament]] to act as a deputy. The president decides on the revocation of this authority and his return to the office. If the president is prevented from performing his duties for a longer period of time due to illness or other form of incapacitation, and especially if the president is unable to decide on a transfer of powers to a deputy, the Speaker of the parliament becomes the acting president, assuming presidential duty pursuant to a decision of the Constitutional Court, made upon request of the Government.<ref name="Ustav-RH"/>

In case of death or resignation submitted to the President of the Constitutional Court and communicated to the Speaker of the parliament, or in cases when the Constitutional Court decides to terminate the presidential term through impeachment, the Speaker of the parliament becomes acting president. In those circumstances, new legislation is countersigned by the prime minister instead of the president and a new presidential election must be held within 60 days.<ref name="Ustav-RH"/> This situation occurred after the death of [[Franjo Tu?man]] on 10 December 1999,<ref name="Tu?man-Obituary">{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-franjo-tudjman-1132142.html|title=Obituary: Franjo Tudjman|author=Branka Magas|date=13 December 1999|accessdate=17 October 2011|archivedate=26 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69Qmjvz7e}}</ref> when [[Vlatko Pavleti?]] became the acting president.<ref name="Pavleti?">{{cite web|publisher=Sabor|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=14221&sec=1200|title=Akademik Vlatko Pavleti?, predsjednik Sabora od 1995. do 2000. godine|trans_title=Academician Vlatko Pavleti?, Speaker of the Parliament from 1995 to 2000|language=Croatian|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref> After the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2000|parliamentary elections of 2000]], the role was transferred to [[Zlatko Tom?i?]], who filled the office until [[Stjepan Mesi?]] was [[Croatian presidential election, 2000|elected President of Croatia in 2000]].<ref name="Tom?i?">{{cite web|publisher=Sabor|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=14222&sec=1200|title=Zlatko Tom?i?, predsjednik Sabora od 2000. do 2003. godine|trans_title=Zlatko Tom?i?, Speaker of the Parliament from 2000 to 2003|language=Croatian|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref>

Legislation defines the appearance and use of the [[List of Croatian flags|Presidential Standard of Croatia]] as a symbol of the President of Croatia, and the appearance and use of the [[presidential sash]] as a symbol of honour of the office of the president. The presidential standard is a square, blue field with a thin border of alternating red and white squares on each side. In the centre of the blue field is the main shield of the [[coat of arms of Croatia]] with the historical arms of Croatia surrounding the main shield. From left to right, these are the oldest known coats of arms of Croatia, the [[Republic of Dubrovnik]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Istria]] and [[Slavonia]], adorned with bands of gold, red and white stripes extending down vertically. Atop the shield there is a [[Flag of Croatia|Croatian tricolour]] ribbon with golden letters ''RH'' that stand for the Republic of Croatia, executed in [[Roman square capitals]].

The presidential sash is a Croatian tricolour band, trimmed with gold and adorned with the coat of arms of Croatia, which is placed in a white field, with the tricolour at the front. The arms are bordered by oak branches on the left and olive branches on the right. The sash is worn diagonally, over the right shoulder, and is fastened using a square clasp trimmed with golden [[Croatian interlace]]. The sash is adorned with the arms used on the presidential standard, although without the ribbon used in the arms.

{{Roman Catholicism}}

The '''College of Cardinals''' is the body of all [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals of the Catholic Church]].<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P19.HTM 1983 CIC, Bk. II, Pt. II, Sec. I, Chap. III ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']</ref>

A function of the college is to advise the [[Pope]] about church matters when he summons them to an ordinary [[Papal consistory|consistory]].<ref>CIC 1983, can. 349</ref> It also convenes on the death or resignation of a pope as a [[papal conclave]] to elect a successor.<ref name="universi">John Paul II, Ap. Const. ''[[Universi Dominici Gregis]]'' in ''AAS'' 88 (1996)</ref> The college has no ruling power except during the ''[[sede vacante]]'' (papal vacancy) period, and even then its powers are extremely limited by the terms of the current law, which is laid down in the [[Apostolic constitution]] ''[[Universi Dominici Gregis]]'' and the [[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]].

Historically, cardinals were the clergy serving parishes of the city of Rome under its [[Bishop of Rome|bishop]], the Pope. The College acquired particular importance following the crowning of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] as [[King of Germany]] and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the age of six, after the unexpected death of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] in 1056. Until then, secular authorities had significant influence over who was to be appointed Pope, and the Holy Roman Emperor in particular had the special power to appoint him. This was significant as the aims and views of the Holy Roman Emperor and the Church did not always coincide. Churchmen involved in what was to become known as the [[Gregorian Reform]] took advantage of the new king's lack of power, and in 1059 reserved the election of the Pope to the clergy of the Church in Rome. This was part of a larger power struggle, which became known as the [[Investiture Controversy]], as the Church and the Emperor each attempted to gain more control over the appointment of bishops, and in doing so wield more influence in the lands and governments they were appointed to. Reserving to the cardinals the election of the Pope represented a significant shift in the balance of power in the Early Medieval world. From the beginning of the 12th century, the College of Cardinals started to meet as such, when the cardinal bishops, cardinal priests, and cardinal deacons ceased acting as separate groups.<ref>Broderick, J.F. 1987. "The Sacred College of Cardinals: Size and Geographical Composition (1099–1986)." ''Archivum historiae Pontificiae'', '''25''': 8.</ref>

The [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]] and the Sub-Dean are the president and vice-president of the college. Both are elected by and from the cardinals holding [[suburbicarian diocese]]s, but the election requires Papal confirmation. Except for presiding, the dean has no power of governance over the cardinals, instead acting as ''[[primus inter pares]]'' (first among equals).

The [[Cardinal Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], the prefects of the [[Congregation (Roman Curia)|Congregations]] of the [[Roman Curia]], the [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]], the [[Vicar General of Rome]], and the [[Patriarch of Venice|Patriarchs of Venice]] and [[Patriarch of Lisbon|Lisbon]], are usually Cardinals, with few, usually temporary, exceptions. The [[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]] requires that appointees to the state's [[legislative body]], the [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], be cardinals.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2522/FundamentalLaw1.pdf | title=Fundamental Law of Vatican City State | author=[[Pope John Paul II]] | date=26 November 2000 | accessdate=2008-04-11}}</ref>

== Origins ==

The Church cites Acts 6 as the formation of the Sacred College of Cardinals. Specifically, the seven assistants, Stephen, Philip, Nicanor, Timon, Nicholas, Parmenas, and Prochorus, selected by the Apostles to relieve them of the more mundane tasks of the Church so that they might concentrate more on prayer, contemplation, and preaching.  As early as the third century, these assistants were defined as critical supporters of the papacy, and by the fourth century, the title of Cardinal was applied to these consultors of the Pope.<ref>{{cite book|last=Noonan|first=James-Charles|title=The Church Visible: The Ceremonial Life and Protocol of the Catholic Church, Revised Edition|year=2012|publisher=Sterling Ethos|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4027-8730-0|pages=7–8}}</ref>

The word cardinal itself is derived from the Latin Carda, translated as "hinge". The cardinals were believed to facilitate a relationship between the theological and governmental roles of the hierarchy of the Church as a sort of pivot; on them hung the relationship between Christ and His Church on Earth, headed by the pope.  This definition of helper has not changed over the years, and popes have not ceased to depend on the College for advice on doctrine and government.<ref>{{cite book|last=Noonan|first=James-Charles|title=The Church Visible: The Ceremonial Life and Protocol of the Catholic Church, Revised Edition|year=2012|publisher=Sterling Ethos|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4027-8730-0|pages=8}}</ref>

Towards the end of the 600s, the title of Cardinal had become synonymous with an honor, and was no longer reserved to men who served the pope as special assistants. Sts. Augustine and Ambrose applied the term to truths of life and Christian virtues respectively.  In 845 the Council of Meaux "required Bishops to establish Cardinal titles or parishes in their towns and outlining districts."<ref>{{cite book|last=van Lierde|first=Peter C.|title=What Is a Cardinal?|year=1964|publisher=Hawthorne Books Inc.|location=New York|page=14}}</ref> At the same time, the popes began referring to the cardinal priests of Rome to serves as legates and delegates  within Rome at ceremonies, synods, councils, etc., as well as abroad on diplomatic missions and councils. Those who were assigned to the latter roles were given the titles of Legatus a latere (Cardinal Legate) and Missus Specialis (Special Missions).<ref>{{cite book|last=Noonan|first=James-Charles|title=The Church Visible: The Ceremonial Life and Protocol of the Roman Catholic Church, Revised Edition|year=2012|publisher=Sterling Ethos|location=New York|isbn=978-1-40278730-0|pages=8–9}}</ref>

During the pontificate of Stephen V (816-17), the three classes of the College that are present today began to form.  Stephen decreed that all cardinal-bishops were bound to say Mass on rotation at the high altar at St. Peter's Basilica, one per Sunday.  The first class to form was that of the cardinal-deacons, direct theological descendants of the original seven ordained in Acts 6, followed by the cardinal-priests, and finally, the cardinal-bishops.<ref name="Jr 2012 9">{{cite book|last=Jr|first=James-Charles Noonan,|title=The church visible : the ceremonial life and protocol of the Roman Catholic Church|year=2012|publisher=Sterling Ethos|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4027-8730-0|page=9}}</ref>

The College played an integral part in various reforms within the Church as well, as early as the pontificate of Pope Leo IX (1050).  In 759, the third Lateran Council declared that only Cardinals could assume the papacy, a requirement that has since lapsed.  In 1130, under Urban II, all the classes were permitted to take part in papal elections; up to this point, only cardinal-bishops had this role.<ref name="Jr 2012 9"/>

By the end of the 1300s, the practice of solely Italian cardinals had ceased.  Between the 1300s and 1600s, there was much struggle for the College between the cardinals of the day and the reigning popes.  The most effective way for a pope to increase his power was to increase the number of cardinals, promoting those who had nominated him.  Those cardinals in power saw these actions as an attempt to weaken their influence.  In 1517, Pope Leo X added another thirty-one cardinals, bringing the total to sixty-five so that he could have a supportive majority among the cardinalate.  Paul IV brought the total to seventy.  Pius IV raised an additional six.  By the papacy of Sixtus V, the number was set at seventy, divided among fourteen cardinal-deacons, fifty cardinal-priests, and six cardinal-bishops.<ref name="Jr 2012 9"/>

== Choosing the Pope ==
{{Politics of the Holy See}}
Under the terms of [[Pope Paul VI]]'s [[motu proprio]] ''Ingravescentem Aetatem'', cardinals who reached the age of 80 before a conclave opened had no vote in papal elections. [[Pope John Paul II]]'s ''[[Universi Dominici Gregis]]'' of 22 February 1996 modified that slightly, so that cardinals who have reached the age of 80 before the day the [[episcopal see|see]] becomes vacant do not have a vote.<ref name="universi" />

Although the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical]] qualifications required of candidates for episcopacy<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1D.HTM canon 378]</ref> leave a broad field open to the cardinals, they have for over six centuries elected one of their own number to be Bishop of Rome. The last time they chose someone who was not a cardinal was at the 1378 election of [[Pope Urban VI]]. The conclave rules specify the procedures to be followed, should someone residing outside Vatican City or not yet a bishop be elected.<ref>''Universi Dominici gregis'', 88–90</ref>

Of the 117 Cardinals under the age of 80 at the time of Pope [[Benedict XVI]]'s resignation, 115 participated in the [[Papal conclave, 2013|conclave of March 2013]] that elected his successor. The two who did not participate were [[Julius Riyadi Darmaatmadja]] (for health reasons) and [[Keith O'Brien]] (for personal reasons). Of the 115 Cardinals who participated in the conclave that elected [[Pope Francis]], 48 were appointed by Pope [[John Paul II]], and 67 by Pope [[Benedict XVI]]. 

As of 23 September 2014, there are a total of 210 cardinals, of whom 113 are under age 80. Of those 113, 36 were appointed by Pope [[John Paul II]], 61 by Pope [[Benedict XVI]], and 16 by [[Pope Francis]]. [[Tarcisio Bertone]] will be the next cardinal to reach the age of 80, on 2 December 2014, and lose his right to participate in a conclave.

== Members of the College of Cardinals ==
{{Main|List of living cardinals}}
The following is the list of all cardinals living as of 23 September 2014. Cardinals appear in order of precedence, based on seniority by date of appointment. [[Paulo Evaristo Arns]] is the most senior member of the College by length of service (the Protopriest) and the last survivor from the 1973 consistory. [[Angelo Sodano]] has the highest precedence as a Cardinal Bishop and Dean of the College of Cardinals. As of 23 September 2014, the oldest living cardinal is [[Loris Francesco Capovilla]], born in 1915.

Within the College of Cardinals, there are three categories, the highest-ranked [[Cardinal Bishop]]s, then [[Cardinal Priest]]s, and finally [[Cardinal Deacon]]s. Within each category the Cardinals are ranked by seniority of appointment. Since the pontificate of Pope [[John XXIII]], despite these titles, almost all Cardinals who were not already [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]] at the time their appointment was announced have been ordained bishops prior to the conclusion of the formal installation, though from the late 20th century Jesuit priests made cardinals when already over 80 have usually petitioned not to become bishops and have received permission in this sense.

Most of the cardinals are from the [[Latin Church]]; those who are from the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] have their church indicated.

==Size of the College of Cardinals==
{{Main|Size of the College of Cardinals}}
As of 1 January 2014, the College had 199 members, 106 of whom were young enough to participate in a conclave.<ref>{{cite web|date=31 January 2014| accessdate=8 March 2014| url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/cardinali_statistiche/cardinali_statistiche_continenti_en.html| title= Holy See Press Office: The College of Cardinals Statistics}}</ref> The group's size has historically been limited by popes, [[ecumenical council]]s, and even the College itself. From 1099 to 1986, the total number of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s appointed was approximately 2900 (excluding possible undocumented 12th-century cardinals, cardinals appointed during the [[Western Schism]] by pontiffs now considered to be [[antipopes]], and subject to some other sources of uncertainty), nearly half of whom were created after 1655.<ref>Broderick, 1987, p. 11.</ref>

'''Sibylla''' (French: "Sibylle", c. 1160&ndash;1190) was the [[Count of Jaffa and Ascalon|Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon]] from 1176 and [[Kings of Jerusalem|Queen of Jerusalem]] from 1186 to 1190. She was the eldest daughter of [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] and [[Agnes of Courtenay]], sister of [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]] and half-sister of [[Isabella I of Jerusalem]], and mother of [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem]]. Her grandmother [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Melisende]] had provided an example of successful rule by a [[queen regnant]] earlier in the century.

==Dynasty==
She was born into the [[Franks|Frankish]] noble family of the [[House of Châteaudun|House of Anjou]] (descending from [[Ingelger]]). Sibylla was raised by her great-aunt, the [[abbot|Abbess]] [[Ioveta of Bethany]], sister of former Queen [[Melisende of Jerusalem]], who founded the [[Church of Saint Lazarus, Israel|convent of St. Lazarus]] in Bethany for her sister in 1128, and died there in 1163. In the convent Sibylla was taught scripture and other church traditions.

In 1174, her father sent [[Frederick de la Roche]], [[archbishop of Tyre]], on a diplomatic legation to Europe to drum up support (martial and financial) for the Crusader states, and to arrange a suitable marriage for Sibylla. As her only brother Baldwin suffered from an illness later confirmed as [[leprosy]], Sibylla's marriage was of paramount concern.  Frederick convinced [[Stephen I of Sancerre]], a well-connected young nobleman, to come east and marry the princess.  Shortly after his arrival in Jerusalem, however, Stephen changed his mind (the reason is not known) and he returned to France.

==Baldwin IV's reign==
On their father Amalric's death, Baldwin IV became king in 1174. First [[Miles of Plancy]], then [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] became regent during his minority (although Miles was never regent in title, merely function). In 1176, Baldwin and Raymond arranged for Sibylla to marry [[William of Montferrat, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon|William Longsword of Montferrat]], eldest son of the Marquess [[William V of Montferrat]], and a cousin of [[Louis VII of France]] and of [[Frederick Barbarossa]]. Sibylla was created [[Count of Jaffa and Ascalon|Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon]] (previously held by her mother Agnes), the title increasingly associated with the heir to the throne. In autumn they were married. William died by June the following year, leaving Sibylla pregnant. In the tradition of the dynasty, Sibylla named her son [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin]].

The widowed princess remained a prize for ambitious nobles and adventurers seeking to advance themselves and take control of Jerusalem. [[Philip I, Count of Flanders|Philip of Flanders]], a first cousin of Sibylla (his mother, [[Sibylla of Anjou]], was her father's half-sister), arrived in 1177 and demanded to have the princess married to one of his own vassals. By marrying Sibylla to his vassal, Philip could control the kingship of Jerusalem. The ''[[Haute Cour of Jerusalem]]'', led by [[Baldwin of Ibelin]], rebuffed Philip's advances. Affronted, Philip left Jerusalem to campaign in [[Antioch]].

Sibylla did not remarry until 1180. For a long time, popular narrative histories favoured an account from the 13th century ''Old French Continuation of William Tyre'', partly attributed to [[Ernoul]], and associated with the Ibelin family. It claims that Sibylla was in love with Baldwin of Ibelin, a widower over twice her age, but he was captured and imprisoned in 1179 by [[Saladin]]. She wrote to Baldwin, suggesting they wed when he was released. Saladin demanded a large ransom: Baldwin himself could not pay the ransom, but was released with the promise to pay Saladin later. Once free, Baldwin went to the Byzantine court, where he received a grant from [[Manuel I Comnenus|Emperor Manuel]], the emperor previously receiving confirmation from his niece, [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena, the dowager queen]], of the likelihood of the Sibylla-Baldwin match. However, Agnes of Courtenay advised her son to have Sibylla married to the newly arrived Frankish knight [[Guy of Lusignan]], brother of her personal constable, [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amalric of Lusignan]], who Ernoul claims was her lover. By this&nbsp;— so this narrative alleges&nbsp;— Agnes hoped to foil any attempt by [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] (the former regent) from marrying her daughter into the rival court faction, led by the Ibelins. It claims that Baldwin of Ibelin was still in Constantinople and unable to wed Sibylla. With pressure mounting to have the [[Heir Presumptive]] wed, the marriage was hastily arranged, and Sibylla&nbsp;— whom the author depicts as fickle&nbsp;— easily transferred her affections to the younger man. This account strongly favours the Ibelins, and shows influence from romance.

[[File:Sibylle-betrothal&marriage.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Top: Baldwin IV betrothes Sibylla to Guy; Bottom: Sibylla and Guy are married. (MS of William of Tyre's ''Historia'' and ''Old French Continuation'', painted in Acre, 13C. ''Bib. Nat. Française''.)]]
However, this is not supported by the more contemporaneous and less fanciful accounts of [[William of Tyre]] and others. A plan to marry Sibylla to [[Hugh III of Burgundy]] had broken down. At [[Easter]] 1180, Raymond of Tripoli and [[Bohemund III of Antioch]] entered the kingdom in force, with the intent of imposing a husband of their own choice, probably Baldwin of Ibelin, on Sibylla. However, a foreign match was essential to the kingdom, bringing the possibility of external military aid. Baldwin IV himself arranged the marriage to Guy, whose brother Amalric, well-regarded and able, had first come to court as Baldwin of Ibelin's son-in-law and was now [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|constable of Jerusalem]]. With the new French king [[Philip II of France|Philip II]] a minor, Guy's status as a vassal of the King and Sibylla's first cousin [[Henry II of England]] – who owed the Pope a penitential pilgrimage&nbsp;— was useful in terms of offering a source of external help. Baldwin of Ibelin was in Jerusalem at the time of Sibylla's marriage, and did not go to Constantinople until later in the year&nbsp;— contradicting the claims in the ''Old French Continuation''. Also in 1180, Baldwin IV further curtailed the ambitions of the Ibelins by betrothing the eight-year-old Isabella to [[Humphrey IV of Toron]], removing her from the control of her mother and the Ibelins, and placing her in the hands of her betrothed's family – [[Raynald of Châtillon]] and his wife [[Stephanie of Milly]].

Sibylla bore Guy two daughters, Alice and Maria (their years of birth are unknown). Initially Baldwin IV vested much authority in Guy, appointing him his regent during times of his own incapacitation. But within a year the king was offended and enraged by Guy's behaviour as regent. Guy overlooked Raynald of Châtillon's harassment of trade caravans between Egypt and Syria, threatening the stop-gap accord between Jerusalem and Egypt. Baldwin IV deposed Guy as regent in 1183 and had Sibylla's son crowned as co-king as Baldwin V, thereby passing over her and Guy in the succession. He also attempted to have Sibylla's marriage annulled throughout 1184. Her son was to succeed with Raymond III of Tripoli as regent. If Baldwin V were to expire during his minority, his "''most rightful heirs''" would succeed to the regency until his maternal kinsman the [[Henry II of England|King of England]] and paternal kinsmen the [[Philip II of France|King of France]] and the [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor]], and the [[Pope]] should adjudicate between the claims of Sibylla and Isabella. Though her husband was in disgrace for his behaviour as regent, it does not seem that Sibylla herself was held in disfavour.

Throughout these internal political conflicts, an even greater external threat was on the horizon: [[Saladin]], the sultan of Egypt and Syria, who was steadily building up his power-base in preparation for invasion. Meanwhile, Agnes died in [[Akko|Acre]], sometime in 1184.

==Baldwin V and the succession==
Baldwin IV died in spring 1185, leaving Sibylla's son as sole king, Raymond as regent and the boy's great-uncle Count [[Joscelin III of Edessa]] as guardian. Baldwin V's grandfather, Marquess [[William V of Montferrat]], had also now arrived in the kingdom to give his support. However, the young king, never a healthy child, died in Acre in the summer of 1186. Neither Sibylla's nor Isabella's party seems to have been prepared to accept the terms of Baldwin IV's will, to install a regent and wait for a decision by Baldwin V's relatives in England, France and Germany.

Joscelin and the Marquess William escorted the king's coffin to Jerusalem. Sibylla attended her son's funeral, arranged by Joscelin. For security an armed escort garrisoned Jerusalem. Raymond III, who wanted to protect his own influence and his political allies, the dowager queen [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]] and the Ibelins, went to Nablus&nbsp;— Maria and Balian's home&nbsp;— where he summoned those members of the ''Haute Cour'' who supported Isabella. Meanwhile, Sibylla was crowned queen by [[Eraclius of Jerusalem|Patriarch Eraclius]]. Raynald of Châtillon gained popular support for Sibylla by affirming that she was "li plus apareissanz et plus dreis heis dou roiaume" ("the most evident and rightful heir of the kingdom"). Sibylla's detractors resurrected the claim that Sibylla was illegitimate and intended to hold a rival coronation for Isabella. However, in 1163 the Latin Church of Jerusalem had ruled Sibylla was a legal heir and successor to her father. Either way, Sibylla's claim held strong as the ''Haute Cour'' negotiated to recognize her as queen. Sibylla's position was further strengthened when Isabella's husband, [[Humphrey IV of Toron]], Raynald of Châtillon's stepson, left Nablus to swear fealty to Sibylla and Guy.

Sibylla was crowned alone, as sole Queen. Before her crowning Sibylla agreed with oppositional court members that she would annul her own marriage to please them, as long as she would be given free rein to choose her next husband. (This followed the precedent of her own parents.) The leaders of the ''Haute Cour'' agreed, and Sibylla was crowned forthwith. To their astonishment, Sibylla immediately announced that she chose Guy as her husband, and crowned him.

Of Queen Sibylla's right to rule, Bernard Hamilton wrote "there is no real doubt, following the precedent of Melisende, that Sibylla, as the elder daughter of King Amalric, had the best claim to the throne; equally, there could be no doubt after the ceremony that Guy only held the [[crown matrimonial]]."

==Sibylla's reign==
Sibylla had shown great cunning and political prowess in her dealings with the members of the opposition faction. She had some support from her maternal relations, the Courtenay family (the former dynasty of the [[County of Edessa]]) and their allies and vassals, while her rivals were led by Raymond of Tripoli, who had a claim to the throne in his own right, the Ibelin family and the dowager queen in Nablus on behalf of Isabella.

Queen Sibylla's chief concern was to check the progress of Saladin's armies as they advanced into the kingdom. Guy and Raymond were dispatched to the front with the entire fighting strength of the kingdom, but their inability to cooperate was fatal, and Saladin routed them at the [[Battle of Hattin]] on July 4, 1187. Guy was among the prisoners. The dowager queen joined her stepdaughter in Jerusalem as Saladin's army advanced. By September 1187, Saladin was besieging the Holy City, and Sibylla personally led the defence, along with Patriarch Eraclius and [[Balian of Ibelin]], who had survived Hattin. [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|Jerusalem capitulated]] on October 2, and Sibylla was permitted to escape to [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] with her daughters.

==Death==
Guy was released from his imprisonment in [[Damascus]] in 1188, when Saladin realized that returning him would cause strife in the crusader camp and that Guy was a less capable leader than certain others who now held sway. The queen joined him when they marched on [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] in 1189, the only city in the kingdom that had not fallen. [[Conrad of Montferrat]], brother of Sibylla's first husband William, had taken charge of the city's defences. However, he denied them entrance, refusing to recognise Guy's claim to the remnant of the kingdom, and asserting his own claim to hold it until the arrival of the kings from Europe (in accordance with Baldwin IV's will). After about a month spent outside the city's walls, the queen followed Guy when he led a vanguard of the newly arrived [[Third Crusade]] against Muslim-held Acre, desiring to make that town the seat of kingdom. Guy besieged the town for two years (see [[Siege of Acre (1189–1191)|Siege of Acre]]).

There, during the stalemate in July or August, possibly July 25, 1190, Sibylla died in an epidemic which was sweeping through the military camp. Her two young daughters had also died some days earlier. (Acre was afterwards conquered in July 1191, mostly by troops brought by [[Philip II of France]] and [[Richard I of England]]).

Bernard Hamilton wrote "had Sibylla lived in more peaceful times she would have exercised a great deal of power since her husband's authority patently derived from her", and that only the conquest by Saladin brought her rule to a speedy end. Her legal successor was her half-sister Isabella, who was forced to end her marriage to Humphrey of Toron and instead to marry Conrad, but Guy refused to relinquish his crown until an election in 1192.

==In fiction==
Sibylla has appeared in several novels, notably [[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka]]'s ''Król tr?dowaty'' (''The Leper King''), [[Graham Shelby]]'s ''The Knights of Dark Renown'', and [[Cecelia Holland]]'s ''Jerusalem''. Holland makes her the heroine of her novel, but ignores her known devotion to Guy to invent a doomed romance for her with a Templar knight.
   
A heavily fictionalized version of Sibylla is played by [[Eva Green]] in the [[2005 in film|2005 movie]] ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]''. In this, she is depicted as unhappily married, and has an affair with an equally fictionalized version of [[Balian of Ibelin]]. In the movie she does not want Guy to take the throne and participates in a failed plot for his murder. In the Director's Cut it is suggested she poisons her son, [[Baldwin V]] to spare him from suffering from leprosy. Instead of rejoining her husband after his release, she leaves for France with Balian.

'''Aneuploidy''' is a condition in which the number of [[chromosomes]] in the nucleus of a cell is not an exact [[Multiple (mathematics)|multiple]] of the [[Ploidy#Haploid_and_monoploid|monoploid]] number of a particular species. An extra or missing chromosome is a common cause of [[genetic disorder]]s including human birth defects. Some cancer cells also have abnormal numbers of chromosomes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sen S |title=Aneuploidy and cancer |journal=Current Opinion in Oncology |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=82–8 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10687734 |doi=10.1097/00001622-200001000-00014}}</ref> Aneuploidy originates during [[cell division]] when the chromosomes do not separate properly between the two cells. This generally happens when [[cytokinesis]] begins while [[karyokinesis]] is still under way.

Different species normally have [[List of number of chromosomes of various organisms|different numbers of chromosomes]] from one another, and the term "aneuploidy" refers to the chromosome number being different from the usual number for that species.

Chromosome abnormalities occur in 1 of 160 live human births.{{clarify|aneuploidy or other conditions such as translocation?|date=March 2014}} Apart from [[sex chromosome disorders]], most cases of aneuploidy result in termination of the developing fetus; the most common extra [[autosome|autosomal]] chromosomes among live births are [[Chromosome 21|21]], [[Chromosome 18|18]] and [[Chromosome 13|13]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Driscoll DA, Gross S |title=Clinical practice. Prenatal screening for aneuploidy |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=360 |issue=24 |pages=2556–62 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19516035 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp0900134}}</ref>

==Chromosomes==
Every [[cell (biology)|cell]] in the human body, apart from enucleated [[red blood cell]]s and the [[haploid]] [[gametes]], has 23 pairs of [[chromosomes]] (for a total of 46). One copy of each pair is inherited from the mother and the other copy is inherited from the father.  The first 22 pairs of chromosomes (referred to as [[autosomes]]) are numbered from 1 to 22, and are arranged from largest to smallest in a [[karyotype]] (see figure).  The 23rd pair of chromosomes are the [[sex chromosomes]].  Normal females have two [[X chromosomes]], while normal males have one [[X chromosome]] and one [[Y chromosome]].

[[File:Human male karyotype.gif|Normal male karyotype]]

During [[meiosis]], when germ cells divide to create sperm and egg (gametes), each half should have the same number of chromosomes. But sometimes, the whole pair of chromosomes will end up in one gamete, and the other gamete will not get that chromosome at all.

Most embryos cannot survive with a missing or extra [[autosome]] (numbered chromosome) and are spontaneously aborted. The most frequent aneuploidy in humans is [[trisomy 16]], although fetuses affected with the full version of this chromosome abnormality do not survive to term (it is possible for surviving individuals to have the mosaic form, where trisomy 16 exists in some cells but not all).  The most common aneuploidy that infants can survive with is trisomy 21, which is found in [[Down syndrome#Trisomy 21|Down syndrome]], affecting 1 in 800 births. [[Edwards syndrome|Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome)]] affects 1 in 6,000 births, and [[trisomy 13|trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome)]] affects 1 in 10,000 births. 10% of infants with trisomy 18 or 13 reach 1 year of age.<ref name="titleAneuploidy">{{cite book

Changes in chromosome number may not necessarily be present in all cells in an individual.  When aneuploidy is detected in a fraction of cells in an individual, it is called chromosomal [[mosaicism]].  In general, individuals who are mosaic for a chromosomal aneuploidy tend to have a less severe form of the syndrome compared to those with full trisomy.  For many of the autosomal trisomies, only mosaic cases survive to term.  However, mitotic aneuploidy may be more common than previously recognized in somatic tissues, and aneuploidy is a characteristic of many types of [[tumorigenesis]] (see below).

==Terminology==
In the strict sense, a chromosome complement having a number of chromosomes other than 46 (in humans) is considered ''[[heteroploid]]'' while an exact multiple of the [[haploid]] chromosome complement is considered [[euploid]].  
{| class="wikitable"
| '''Number of chromosomes''' || '''Name''' || '''Description''' 
 |- 
 | 1 || Monosomy || '''[[Monosomy]]''' refers to lack of one chromosome of the normal complement.  Partial monosomy can occur in unbalanced translocations or deletions, in which only a portion of the chromosome is present in a single copy (see [[deletion (genetics)]]).  Monosomy of the [[sex chromosome]]s (45,X) causes [[Turner syndrome]].
 |- 
 | 2 || Disomy || ''Disomy'' is the presence of two copies of a chromosome.  For organisms such as humans that have two copies of each chromosome (those that are [[ploidy#Diploid|diploid]]), it is the normal condition.  For organisms that normally have three or more copies of each chromosome (those that are [[ploidy|triploid]] or above), disomy is an aneuploid chromosome complement.  In [[uniparental disomy]], both copies of a chromosome come from the same parent (with no contribution from the other parent).
 |- 
 | 3 || Trisomy || '''[[Trisomy]]''' refers to the presence of three copies, instead of the normal two, of a particular [[chromosome]]. The presence of an extra [[chromosome 21]], which is found in [[Down syndrome]], is called trisomy 21.  [[Trisomy 18]] and [[Trisomy 13]], known as [[Edwards Syndrome]] and [[Patau Syndrome]], respectively, are the two other autosomal trisomies recognized in live-born humans.  Trisomy of the sex chromosomes is possible, such as in [[Triple X syndrome|(47,XXX)]], [[Klinefelter's syndrome|(47,XXY)]], and [[XYY syndrome|(47,XYY)]].
 |- 
 | 4/5 || tetrasomy/pentasomy || ''[[Tetrasomy]]'' and ''pentasomy'' are the presence of four or five copies of a chromosome, respectively. Although rarely seen with autosomes, sex chromosome tetrasomy and pentasomy have been reported in humans, including [[XXXX syndrome|XXXX]], [[XXYY syndrome|XXYY]], [[49, XXXXX|XXXXX]], [[49 XXXXY syndrome|XXXXY]] and [[XYYYY]].<ref name="pmid7567329">{{cite journal |author=Linden MG, Bender BG, Robinson A |title=Sex chromosome tetrasomy and pentasomy |journal=Pediatrics |volume=96 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=672–82 |date=October 1995 |pmid=7567329}}</ref>
|}

==Mechanisms==
''[[Nondisjunction]]'' usually occurs as the result of a weakened [[mitotic checkpoint]], as these checkpoints tend to arrest or delay cell division until all components of the cell are ready to enter the next phase. If a checkpoint is weakened, the cell may fail to 'notice' that a chromosome pair is not lined up on the [[mitotic plate]], for example. In such a case, most chromosomes would separate normally (with one chromatid ending up in each cell), while others could fail to separate at all. This would generate a daughter cell lacking a copy and a daughter cell with an extra copy.

''Completely inactive mitotic checkpoints'' may cause non-disjunction at multiple chromosomes, possibly all. Such a scenario could result in each daughter cell possessing a [[disjoint set]] of genetic material.

''[[Merotelic attachment]]'' occurs when one [[kinetochore]] is attached to both [[mitotic spindle]] poles. One daughter cell would have a normal complement of chromosomes; the second would lack one. A third daughter cell may end up with the 'missing' chromosome.

[[Multipolar spindles]]: more than two [[spindle pole]]s form. Such a mitotic division would result in one daughter cell for each spindle pole; each cell may possess an unpredictable complement of chromosomes.

''Monopolar spindle'': only a single spindle pole forms. This produces a single daughter cell with its copy number doubled.

A ''tetraploid intermediate'' may be produced as the end-result of the monopolar spindle mechanism. In such a case, the cell has double the copy number of a normal cell, and produces double the number of spindle poles as well. This results in four daughter cells with an unpredictable complement of chromosomes, but in the normal copy number.

==Somatic mosaicism in cancer==
Aneuploidy is consistently observed in virtually all cancers.<ref name=Nature>{{cite journal|last=Rajagopalan|first=Harith|author2=Christoph Lengauer|title=Progress Aneuploidy and cancer|journal=Nature|date=18 November 2004|volume=432|issue=7015|pages=338–341|doi=10.1038/nature03099|pmid=15549096}}</ref> 
Somatic mosaicism occurs in virtually all [[cancer]] cells, including trisomy 12 in [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL) and trisomy 8 in [[acute myeloid leukemia]] (AML). However, these forms of mosaic aneuploidy occur through mechanisms distinct from those typically associated with genetic syndromes involving complete or mosaic aneuploidy, such as chromosomal instability<ref name=Err>{{cite journal|last=Hassold|first=Terry|author2=Patricia Hunt|title=To err (meiotically) is human: the genesis of human aneuploidy|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=April 2001|volume=2|issue=4|pages=280–291|doi=10.1038/35066065|pmid=11283700}}</ref> (due to mitotic segregation defects in cancer cells). Therefore the molecular processes that lead to aneuploidy are targets for the development of cancer drugs. Both [[resveratrol]] and [[aspirin]] have been found ''in vivo'' (in mice) to selectively destroy tetraploid cells that may be precursors of aneuploid cells, and activate [[AMPK]], which may be involved in the process.<ref>{{cite web |title=Aspirin and resveratrol could prevent cancer by killing tetraploid cells, research shows |author=Marcia Malory |journal=Medical Xpress |url=http://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-02-aspirin-resveratrol-cancer-tetraploid-cells.html#ajTabs}}</ref>

Alteration of normal mitotic checkpoints are also important tumorogenic events, and these may directly lead to aneuploidy.<ref name=Road>{{cite journal|last=Kops|first=Geert J. P. L.|coauthors=Beth A. A. Weaver & Don W. Cleveland|title=On the road to cancer: aneuploidy and the mitotic checkpoint|journal=Nature Reviews Cancer|date=October 2005|volume=5|issue=10|pages=773–785|doi=10.1038/nrc1714|pmid=16195750}}</ref> 
Loss of tumor suppressor [[p53]] gene often results in [[genomic instability]], which could lead to the aneuploidy genotype.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clemens A. Schmitt |title=Dissecting p53 tumor suppressor functions in vivo |journal=Cancer Cell|volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=289–298 |date=April 2002 |doi=10.1016/S1535-6108(02)00047-8 |pmid=12086865 |last2=Fridman |first2=JS |last3=Yang |first3=M |last4=Baranov |first4=E |last5=Hoffman |first5=RM |last6=Lowe |first6=SW}}</ref>

In addition, genetic syndromes in which an individual is predisposed to breakage of chromosomes ([[chromosome instability syndrome]]s) are frequently associated with increased risk for various types of cancer, thus highlighting the role of somatic aneuploidy in [[carcinogenesis]]. It has been suggested that aneuploidy might directly contribute to carcinogenesis by disrupting the asymmetric division of adult stem cells, thereby leaving those cells capable of "limitless expansion".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhang F, Zhao D, Wang S, Hong L, Li Q |title=Aneuploidy directly contribute to carcinogenesis by disrupting the asymmetric division of adult stem cells |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=237–8 |year=2007 |pmid=16890378 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2006.06.007}}</ref>

==Partial aneuploidy==
The terms "partial monosomy" and "partial trisomy" are used to describe an imbalance of genetic material caused by loss or gain of part of a chromosome.  In particular, these terms would be used in the situation of an [[chromosomal translocation|unbalanced translocation]], where an individual carries a derivative chromosome formed through the breakage and fusion of two different chromosomes.  In this situation, the individual would have three copies of part of one chromosome (two normal copies and the portion that exists on the derivative chromosome) and only one copy of part of the other chromosome involved in the derivative chromosome.

==Aneuploidogens==
Agents capable of causing aneuploidy are called aneuploidogens.  Many mutagenic carcinogens are aneuploidogens.  [[X-ray]]s, for example, may cause aneuploidy by fragmenting the chromosome; it may also target the spindle apparatus.<ref>{{cite pmid|11013390}}</ref> Other chemicals such as [[colchicine]] can also produce aneuploidy by affecting microtubule polymerization.

==Diagnosis==
{{Further|Prenatal diagnosis}}
[[File:Trisomy Detection in GeneMarker.jpg|thumb|Example of [[Trisomy 21]] detected via [[quantitative PCR]] [[Short Tandem Repeat]] assay]]
Germline aneuploidy is typically detected through [[karyotyping]], a process in which a sample of cells is fixed and stained to create the typical light and dark chromosomal banding pattern and a picture of the [[chromosomes]] is analyzed.  Other techniques include [[Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization]] (FISH),  [[quantitative PCR]] of [[Short Tandem Repeat]]s, quantitative fluorescence PCR (QF-PCR), [[quantitative PCR]] dosage analysis, Quantitative Mass Spectrometry of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, and [[Comparative Genomic Hybridization]] (CGH).

These tests can also be performed prenatally to detect aneuploidy in a pregnancy, through either [[amniocentesis]] or [[chorionic villus sampling]].  Pregnant women of 35 years or older are offered [[prenatal diagnosis]] because the chance of chromosomal aneuploidy increases as the mother's age increases.

Recent advances have allowed for less invasive testing methods based on the presence of fetal genetic material in maternal blood.

'''Ourimbah''' is a small township and a [[List of Central Coast suburbs|suburb]] of the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] region of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], located about {{convert|78|km|mi|0}} north of the [[Sydney CBD]].  The township today consists of small scattered local shops and businesses along the Pacific Highway, as well as the Central Coast campus of the [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]].

== History ==
The [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] word "Oorin" meaning "Belt of manhood" <ref>http://www.gosford.nsw.gov.au/library/local_history/placenames.html</ref> in which a stone axe was carried on hunting expeditions, and "Oorinbah" which is the bora ring or ceremonial ground in which the initiation ceremony of conferring the "belt of manhood" was carried out is where the name for Ourimbah originates from. Ourimbah was also known as ‘Blue Gum Flats’ which is what the school was called. The name of Ourimbah was universally adopted for the School, Post Office, Railway and Township in the late 1800s.

There are many sites around Ourimbah which provide evidence of Aboriginal occupation. These include axe grinding grooves, archaeological deposits of campfires and food scraps, cave art, as well as many stone implements which have been purloined by museums and privateers.

Blue Gum Flat Public School (Ourimbah Public School) was built in 1863 on the site of the present railway station. In 1886 the school was moved to the opposite side of the road and a wooden building constructed. The [[Ourimbah railway station, New South Wales|Ourimbah railway station]] was built in the same year and opened on 15 August 1887 and was the only station other than [[Narara railway station, New South Wales|Narara]] between Gosford and Wyong at this time. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The relocation of the school and construction of the railway provided the opportunity for the subdivision of land into "town-size" allotments and the creation at Ourimbah of a townscape at first dubbed "Beckford". An area had previously been earmarked for a township to the north of this planned subdivision.  {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The town of Ourimbah, with its blue gums, blackbutts, round leaved gum, spotted gum and white mahogany trees, was an ideal place for the milling of timber to support a Sydney building boom between 1840 and 1870. The 1840s saw a major growth of population in the Ourimbah area. Attracted by the availability of work cutting timber, a great number of young couples moved all through the Central Coast, gradually forming settlements at which many began to put down roots.

While the timber supply thinned out, other means such as Citrus fruit and dairy farming restored the fortunes of Ourimbah. Later, in the 1950s it was realised that the dairy industry could not survive. The citrus farmers found themselves in a similar bind, unable to match the economies of scale available to producers elsewhere. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In January 1970, Ourimbah was the venue for Australia's first major rock festival drawing 11,000 fans.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60D10FB355D1B7493C4AB178AD85F448785F9 | work=The New York Times | title=Weekend Rock Festival In Australia Ends Quietly | date=26 January 1970 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref><ref>http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2002/01/26/Today-In-Music-A-look-back-at-pop-music/UPI-29361012024800/</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/industry-salutes-the-godfather-of-aussie-rock/story-e6frg6nf-1111112155627 | first1=Iain | last1=Shedden | first2=Dan | last2=Box | title=Industry salutes the godfather of Aussie rock | date=17 August 2006 | work=The Australian}}</ref>

The early 1970s land boom, which saw much land redeveloped into smaller holdings, was the end of any serious potential for farming as a means of supporting a family in Ourimbah. Land use once again changed, with pockets of urban development amongst the acreages, themselves now valuable for the leisure opportunities they offered rather than as agricultural holdings.

== Education ==
[[Image:Central Coast Campus-Entrance toward library.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance of University of Newcastle, Central Coast Campus.]]
Ourimbah Public School is the oldest school on the Central Coast, opening in 1863 as Blue Gum Flat School. (http://www.ourimbah-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/documents/2573097/2579271/1317966347621_19eb9eec26e2ca27012702ba259a1167.pdf)
It continues to grow and change from its once small stable rural environment to its present rapidly expanding urban environment.

The [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]] has a major presence on the Central Coast at Ourimbah through a multi-sector co-located partnership of the University and TAFE NSW - Hunter Institute. "Ourimbah" is an Indigenous word expressing a place of learning, and the campus is located on traditional lands where this learning took place. The Ourimbah campus offers University, TAFE and Community College programs and courses on one site so that students can take advantage of pathways between levels and sectors of education and training. Affiliates are the Central Coast Community College and the Central Coast Conservatorium of Music. The University of Newcastle commenced teaching at the Ourimbah Campus, also known as the Central Coast Campus, in 1989.

Campus Central is the Ourimbah Campus student association. Campus Central has been operating as an independent student organisation at the Ourimbah Cmapus since 1994. Campus Central has retained autonomy through the VSU ([[Voluntary Student Unionism]]) legislation changes and continues to provide services to students, members and the Campus community.

'''Carnot's theorem''', developed in 1824 by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot]], also called '''Carnot's rule''', is a principle that specifies limits on the maximum efficiency any [[heat engine]] can obtain, which thus solely depends on the difference between the hot and cold temperature reservoirs.

Carnot's theorem states: 
*All heat engines between two heat reservoirs are less efficient than a [[Carnot engine]] operating between the same reservoirs.
*Every [[Carnot engine]] between a pair of heat reservoirs is equally efficient, regardless of the working substance employed or the operation details.

The formula for this maximum efficiency is
:<math>\eta_{\text{max}} = \eta_{\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}</math>
where ''T<sub>C</sub>'' is the [[absolute temperature]] of the cold reservoir, ''T<sub>H</sub>'' is the [[absolute temperature]] of the hot reservoir, and the efficiency <math>\eta</math> is the ratio of the work done by the engine to the heat drawn out of the hot reservoir.

Based on modern thermodynamics, Carnot's theorem is a result of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. Historically, however, it was based on contemporary [[caloric theory]] and preceded the establishment of the second law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashdocs.com/myvnxz/thermodynamics.html|title=A Very Brief History of Thermodynamics|date=2009|author=John Murrell|accessdate=May 2, 2014}} {{PDFWayback|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/chemistry/documents/a_thermodynamics_history.pdf|date=20091122191251|size=142 KB}}</ref>

==Proof==
[[File:Carnot theorem paradox.jpg|thumb|300px|An impossible situation: A heat engine cannot drive a less efficient (reversible) heat engine without violating the second law of thermodynamics.]]

The proof of the Carnot theorem is a [[proof by contradiction]], or [[reductio ad absurdum]], as illustrated by the figure showing two heat engines operating between two reservoirs of different temperature. The heat engine with more efficiency (<math>\eta_M</math>) is driving a heat engine with less efficiency (<math>\eta_L</math>), causing the latter to act as a [[heat pump]]. This pair of engines receives no outside energy, and operates solely on the energy released when heat is transferred from the hot and into the cold reservoir. However, if <math>\eta_M>\eta_L</math>, then the net heat flow would be backwards, i.e., into the hot reservoir:

:<math>Q^\text{out}_\text{hot} = Q < \frac{\eta_M}{\eta_L}Q=Q^\text{in}_\text{hot}</math>.

It is [[Second law of thermodynamics#Controversies|generally agreed]] that this is impossible because it violates the [[second law of thermodynamics]].

We begin by verifying the values of work and heat flow depicted in the figure. First, we must point out an important caveat: the engine with less efficiency (<math>\eta_L</math>) is being driven as a heat pump, and therefore must be a ''[[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]]'' engine. If the less efficient engine (<math>\eta_L</math>) is not reversible, then the device could be built, but the expressions for work and heat flow shown in the figure would not be valid.

By restricting our discussion to cases where engine (<math>\eta_L</math>) has less efficiency than engine (<math>\eta_M</math>), we are able to simplify notation by adopting the convention that all symbols, <math>Q</math> and <math>W</math> represent [[Sign (mathematics)#Terminology for signs|non-negative]] quantities (since the direction of energy flow never changes sign in all cases where <math>\eta_L\leqslant\eta_M</math>). Conservation of energy demands that for each engine, the energy which enters, <math> E_{in} </math>, must equal the energy which exits, <math> E_{out} </math>:

:<math>E_{in}^{M} = Q = (1-\eta_M)Q + \eta_M Q = E_{out}^{M}  </math>,

:<math>E_{in}^{L} = \eta_M Q + \eta_M Q \left(\frac{1}{\eta_{L}}- 1 \right )=\frac{\eta_M}{\eta_L}Q = E_{out}^{L}  </math>,

The figure is also consistent with the definition of [[Heat engine#Efficiency|efficiency]] as <math>\eta=W/Q_h</math> for both engines:

:<math>\eta_M= \frac{W_M}{Q^M_h}=\frac{\eta_M Q}{Q}=\eta_M</math>,

:<math> \eta_L=\frac{W_L}{Q^L_h}=\frac{\eta_M Q}{\frac{\eta_M}{\eta_L}Q}=\eta_L</math>.

It may seem odd that a hypothetical heat pump with low efficiency is being used to violate the second law of thermodynamics, but the [[figure of merit]] for refrigerator units is not efficiency, <math>W/Q_h</math>, but the [[coefficient of performance]] (COP),<ref>{{cite book|last=Tipler|first=Paul|title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers|year=2008|publisher=Freeman|isbn=9781429201322|edition=6th|author2=Mosca, G.|chapter=19.2, 19.7}}</ref>
which is <math>Q_c/W</math>. A reversible heat engine with low thermodynamic efficiency, <math>W/Q_h</math> delivers more heat to the hot reservoir for a given amount of work when it is being driven as a heat pump.

Having established that the heat flow values shown in the figure are correct, Carnot's theorem may be proven for irreversible and the reversible heat engines.<ref name=CarnotThoerem>{{cite web

|title=Lecture 10: Carnot theorem

|accessdate=October 5, 2010}}</ref>

===Reversible engines===
To see that every reversible engine operating between reservoirs <math>T_1</math> and <math>T_2</math> must have the same efficiency, assume that two reversible heat engines have different values of <math>\eta</math>, and let the more efficient engine (M) drive the less efficient engine (L) as a heat pump. As the figure shows, this will cause heat to flow from the cold to the hot reservoir without any external work or energy, which violates the second law of thermodynamics. Therefore both (reversible) heat engines have the same efficiency, and we conclude that:

:''All reversible engines that operate between the same two heat reservoirs have the same efficiency.''

This is an important result because it helps establish the [[Clausius theorem]], which implies that the change in [[entropy]] is unique for all reversible processes.,<ref>{{cite book|last=Ohanian|first=Hans|title=Principles of Physics|year=1994|publisher=W.W. Norton and Co.|isbn=039395773X|pages=438}}</ref>

:<math>\Delta S = \int_a^b \frac {dQ_{rev}}T </math>,

over all paths (from '''''a''''' to '''''b''''' in ''V-T'' space). If this integral were not path independent, then entropy, S, would lose its status as a [[state function|state variable]].<ref>http://faculty.wwu.edu/vawter/PhysicsNet/Topics/ThermLaw2/ThermalProcesses.html, and http://www.itp.phys.ethz.ch/education/hs10/stat/slides/Laws_TD.pdf. Both retrieved 13 December 2013.</ref>

===Irreversible engines===
If one of the engines is irreversible, it must be the (M) engine, placed so that it reverse drives the less efficient but reversible (L) engine. But if this irreversible engine is more efficient than the reversible engine, (i.e., if <math>\eta_M >\eta_L</math>), then the second law of thermodynamics is violated. And, since the Carnot cycle represents a reversible engine, we have the first part of Carnot's theorem:

:''No irreversible engine is more efficient that the Carnot engine.''

==Definition of thermodynamic temperature==
{{main|Thermodynamic temperature#Definition of thermodynamic temperature|l1=Definition of thermodynamic temperature
}}
The efficiency of the engine is the work divided by the heat introduced to the system or
{{NumBlk|:|<math>\eta = \frac {w_{cy}}{q_H} = \frac{q_H-q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \frac{q_C}{q_H}</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where w<sub>cy</sub> is the work done per cycle. Thus, the efficiency depends only on q<sub>C</sub>/q<sub>H</sub>.

Because all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient, any reversible heat engine operating between temperatures ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> must have the same efficiency, meaning, the efficiency is the function of the temperatures only:
{{NumBlk|:|<math>\frac{q_C}{q_H} = f(T_H,T_C)</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

In addition, a reversible heat engine operating between temperatures ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>3</sub> must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between ''T''<sub>1</sub> and another (intermediate) temperature ''T''<sub>2</sub>, and the second between ''T''<sub>2</sub>and''T''<sub>3</sub>. This can only be the case if
:<math>
f(T_1,T_3) = \frac{q_3}{q_1} = \frac{q_2 q_3} {q_1 q_2} = f(T_1,T_2)f(T_2,T_3).
</math>

Specializing to the case that <math>T_1</math> is a fixed reference temperature: the temperature of the triple point of water. Then for any ''T''<sub>2</sub> and ''T''<sub>3</sub>,

:<math>f(T_2,T_3) = \frac{f(T_1,T_3)}{f(T_1,T_2)} = \frac{273.16 \cdot f(T_1,T_3)}{273.16 \cdot f(T_1,T_2)}.</math>

Therefore, if thermodynamic temperature is defined by

:<math>T = 273.16 \cdot f(T_1,T) \,</math>

then the function ''f'', viewed as a function of thermodynamic temperature, is
:<math>f(T_2,T_3) = \frac{T_3}{T_2},</math>
and the reference temperature ''T''<sub>1</sub> has the value 273.16. (Of course any reference temperature and any positive numerical value could be used—the choice here corresponds to the [[Kelvin]] scale.)

It follows immediately that
{{NumBlk|:|<math>\frac{q_C}{q_H} = f(T_H,T_C) = \frac{T_C}{T_H}</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Substituting Equation {{EquationNote|3}} back into Equation {{EquationNote|1}} gives a relationship for the efficiency in terms of temperature:

{{NumBlk|:|<math>\eta = 1 - \frac{q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

==Applicability to fuel cells and batteries==
Since [[fuel cell]]s and [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] can generate useful power when all components of the system are at the same temperature (<math>T=T_H=T_C</math>), they are clearly not limited by Carnot's theorem, which states that no power can be generated when <math>T_H=T_C</math>. This is because Carnot's theorem applies to engines converting thermal energy to work, whereas fuel cells and batteries instead convert chemical energy to work.<ref>{{cite web

In the [[First Folio]], the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] were grouped into three categories: [[Shakespearean comedies|comedies]], histories, and [[Shakespearean tragedy|tragedies]].  The histories might be more accurately called the "[[List of the monarchs of the Kingdom of England|English history]] plays" and include the outliers ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'' and ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'' as well as a continuous sequence of eight plays covering the [[Wars of the Roses]].  These last are [[Chronology of Shakespeare's plays|considered to have been composed]] in two cycles. The so-called first tetralogy, apparently written in the early 1590s, deals with the later part of the struggle and includes ''[[Henry VI, Part 1|Henry VI, parts one]]'', ''[[Henry VI, Part 2|two]]'' & ''[[Henry VI, Part 3|three]]'' and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. The second tetralogy, finished in 1599 and including ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'' and ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', is frequently called the [[Henriad]] after its protagonist Prince Hal, the future [[Henry V of England|Henry V]].

The folio's classifications are not unproblematic. Besides proposing other categories such as [[Shakespeare's Late Romances|romances]] and [[Shakespearean problem play|problem plays]], many modern studies treat the histories together with those tragedies that feature historical characters. These include ''[[Macbeth]]'', set in the mid-11th century during the reigns of [[Duncan I of Scotland]] and [[Edward the Confessor]], and also the Roman plays ''[[Coriolanus]]'', ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' and the legendary ''[[King Lear]]''.

As with the Roman plays, the first folio groups these with the tragedies. Although both are connected with British history, and based on similar sources, they are usually not considered part of Shakespeare's English histories.

*''[[King Lear]]''
*''[[Macbeth]]''

==Sources==
The source for most of the English history plays, as well as for ''Macbeth'' and ''King Lear'', is the well known [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''[[Holinshed's Chronicles|Chronicle]]'' of English history. The source for the Roman history plays is [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans Compared Together]]'', in the translation made by Sir [[Thomas North]] in 1579. Shakespeare's history plays focus on only a small part of the characters' lives, and also frequently omit significant events for dramatic purposes.

==Politics==
Shakespeare was living in the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], the last monarch of the [[house of Tudor]], and his history plays are often regarded as Tudor propaganda because they show the dangers of civil war and celebrate the founders of the Tudor dynasty. In particular, ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' depicts the last member of the rival [[house of York]] as an evil monster ("that bottled spider, that foul bunchback'd toad"), a depiction disputed by many modern historians, while portraying the [[usurper]], [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in glowing terms. Political bias is also clear in ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'', which ends with an effusive celebration of the birth of Elizabeth. However, Shakespeare's celebration of Tudor order is less important in these plays than his presentation of the spectacular decline of the medieval world. Moreover, some of Shakespeare's histories—and notably ''Richard III''—point out that this medieval world came to its end when opportunism and [[Machiavellianism]] infiltrated its politics. By nostalgically evoking the late Middle Ages, these plays described the political and social evolution that had led to the actual methods of Tudor rule, so that it is possible to consider the English history plays as a biased criticism of their own country.

===Interpretations===

[[John F. Danby]] in ''Shakespeare’s Doctrine of Nature'' (1949) examines the response of Shakespeare’s history plays (in the widest sense) to the vexed question: ‘When is it right to rebel?’, and concludes that Shakespeare’s thought ran through three stages: (1) In the [[Wars of the Roses]] plays, ''[[Henry VI, Part 1|Henry VI]]'' to ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', Shakespeare shows a new thrustful godlessness attacking the pious medieval structure represented by ''[[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]''. He implies that rebellion against a legitimate and pious king is wrong, and that only a monster such as Richard of Gloucester would have attempted it. (2) In ''[[King John (play)|King John]]'' and the ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' to ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' cycle, Shakespeare comes to terms with the [[Machiavellianism]] of the times as he saw them under Elizabeth. In these plays he adopts the official Tudor ideology, by which rebellion, even against a wrongful usurper, is never justifiable. (3) From ''[[Julius Caesar]]'' onwards, Shakespeare justifies [[tyrannicide]], but in order to do so moves away from English history to the camouflage of Roman, Danish, Scottish or Ancient British history.

Danby argues that Shakespeare’s study of the Machiavellian prince is key to his study of history. Richard III, the Bastard in ''[[King John (play)|King John]]'', [[Henry V (play)|Hal]] and [[Falstaff]] are all Machiavellian princes, characterised in varying degrees of frankness by the pursuit of "Commodity" (i.e. advantage, profit, expediency).<ref>Shakespeare, ''[[King John (play)|King John]]'', II.1.574.</ref><ref>John F. Danby, ''Shakespeare’s Doctrine of Nature – A Study of ''[[King Lear]]'', 1949), pp.72–74.</ref> Shakespeare at this point in his career pretends that the Hal-type Machiavellian prince is admirable and the society he represents historically inevitable. [[Henry 'Hotspur' Percy|Hotspur]] and Hal are joint heirs, one medieval, the other modern, of a split Falconbridge. Danby argues, however, that when Hal rejects Falstaff he is not reforming, as is the common view,<ref>e.g. [[A.L.Rowse]], ''Discovering Shakespeare'', London, 1989; pages 92–93</ref> but merely turning from one social level to another, from Appetite to Authority, both of which are equally part of the corrupt society of the time. Of the two, Danby argues, Falstaff is the preferable, being, in every sense, the bigger man.<ref>John F. Danby, ''Shakespeare’s Doctrine of Nature – A Study of ''[[King Lear]]'', 1949), pp.57–101.</ref>  In ''[[Julius Caesar]]'' there is a similar conflict between rival Machiavellian princes: the noble Brutus is a dupe of his Machiavellian associates, while Antony’s victorious “order”, like Hal's, is a negative thing. In ''[[Hamlet]]'' king-killing becomes a matter of private rather than public morality—the individual’s struggles with his own conscience and fallibility take centre stage. ''[[Hamlet]]'', like Edgar in ''[[King Lear]]'' later, has to become a “machiavel of goodness”.<ref>John F. Danby, ''Shakespeare’s Doctrine of Nature – A Study of ''[[King Lear]]'', 1949), p.151.</ref>  In ''[[Macbeth]]'' the interest is again public, but the public evil flows from Macbeth’s primary rebellion against his own nature. “The root of the machiavelism lies in a wrong choice. Macbeth is clearly aware of the great frame of Nature he is violating.”<ref>John F. Danby, ''Shakespeare’s Doctrine of Nature – A Study of ''[[King Lear]]'', 1949), p.167.</ref>

''[[King Lear]]'', in Danby's view, is Shakespeare’s finest historical [[allegory]]. The older medieval society, with its doting king, falls into error, and is threatened by the new Machiavellianism; it is regenerated and saved by a vision of a new order, embodied in the king’s rejected daughter. By the time he reaches Edmund, Shakespeare no longer pretends that the Hal-type Machiavellian prince is admirable; and in ''Lear'' he condemns the society we think historically inevitable. Against this he holds up the ideal of a transcendent community and reminds us of the “true needs” of a humanity to which the operations of a Commodity-driven society perpetually do violence. This “new” thing that Shakespeare discovers is embodied in Cordelia. The play thus offers an alternative to the feudal-Machiavellian polarity, an alternative foreshadowed in France’s speech (I.1.245–256), in Lear and Gloucester’s prayers (III.4. 28–36; IV.1.61–66), and in the figure of Cordelia. Cordelia, in the allegorical scheme, is threefold: a person; an ethical principle (love); and a community. Until that decent society is achieved, we are meant to take as role-model Edgar, the Machiavellian prince of patience, of courage and of "ripeness". After ''[[King Lear]]'' Shakespeare’s view seems to be that private goodness can be permanent only in a decent society.<ref>John F. Danby, ''Shakespeare’s Doctrine of Nature – A Study of ''[[King Lear]]'', (Faber, London, 1949). For B. S. Stephan's summary of ''Shakespeare’s Doctrine of Nature'', see [http://www.cchs.co.uk/subjects/docs/english/english-john-danby.doc]</ref>

==The "Wars of the Roses" cycle==
[[File:Henry6th2shot.jpg|thumb|250px|Henry VI (Jeffrey T. Heyer) and a young Richmond (Ashley Rose Miller) in the West Coast premiere of ''The Plantagenets: The Rise of Edward IV'', staged by [[Pacific Repertory Theatre]] in 1993.]]

"[[The Wars of the Roses|The War(s) of the Roses]]" is a phrase used to describe the civil wars in England between the Lancastrian and Yorkist dynasties. Some of the events of these wars were dramatised by Shakespeare in the history plays [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]; [[Henry IV, Part 1]]; [[Henry IV, Part 2]]; [[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]; [[Henry VI, Part 1]]; [[Henry VI, Part 2]]; [[Henry VI, Part 3]]; and [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries there have been numerous stage performances including:
#The first tetralogy (Henry VI parts 1 to 3 and Richard III) as a cycle;
#The second tetralogy (Richard II, Henry IV parts 1 and 2 and Henry V) as a cycle (which has also been referred to as the [[Henriad]]); and
#The entire eight plays in historical order (the second tetralogy followed by the first tetralogy) as a cycle. Where this full cycle is performed, as by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 1964, the name ''The War(s) of the Roses'' has often been used for the cycle as a whole.
#A 10-play history cycle, which began with the newly attributed [[Edward III (play)|Edward III]], the anonymous [[Thomas of Woodstock (play)|Thomas of Woodstock]], and then the eight plays from [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]] to [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], was performed by [[Pacific Repertory Theatre]] under the title ''Royal Blood'', a phrase used throughout the works. The entire series, staged over four consecutive seasons from 2001 to 2004, was directed by PacRep founder and Artistic Director [[Stephen Moorer]].
#A conflation of the eight plays by [[Tom Wright (Australian actor)|Tom Wright]] and [[Benedict Andrews]] under the title ''The War of the Roses'' was performed by the [[Sydney Theatre Company]] in 2009.<ref>[http://www.australianstage.com.au/reviews/sydney-festival/the-war-of-the-roses--sydney-theatre-company-2172.html Review by Jack Telwes, ''Australian Stage'', 16 January 2009]</ref>

The tetralogies have been filmed for television five times, twice as the entire cycle:

#First Tetralogy filmed for the ''[[BBC Television Shakespeare]]'' in 1981 directed by [[Jane Howell]], although the episodes didn't air until 1983. In the First Tetralogy, the plays are performed as if by a repertory theater company, with the same actors appearing in different parts in each play. Featuring [[Ron Cook]] as Richard III, [[Peter Benson (actor)|Peter Benson]] as Henry VI, [[Brenda Blethyn]] as Joan, [[Bernard Hill]] as York, [[Julia Foster]] as Margaret, [[Brian Protheroe]] as Edward, [[Paul Jesson]] as Clarence, [[Mark Wing-Davey]] as Warwick, [[Frank Middlemass]] as Cardinal Beaufort, [[Trevor Peacock]] as Talbot and Jack Cade, [[Paul Chapman (actor)|Paul Chapman]] as Suffolk and Rivers, [[David Burke (British actor)|David Burke]] as Gloucester and [[Zoe Wanamaker]] as Lady Anne. 
#for a straight-to-video filming, directly from the stage, of the [[English Shakespeare Company]]'s 1987 production of "The Wars of the Roses" directed by [[Michael Bogdanov]] and [[Michael Pennington]].

The three ''Henry VI'' plays are condensed into two plays, bearing the subtitles ''Henry VI: House of Lancaster'' and ''Henry VI: House of York''.
#Second Tetralogy filmed as ''[[The Hollow Crown (TV series)|The Hollow Crown]]'' for BBC2 in 2012 directed by [[Rupert Goold]] (''[[Richard II (film)|Richard II]]''), [[Richard Eyre]] (''[[Henry IV, Part I and Part II (TV films)|Henry IV, Parts 1 & 2]]'') and [[Thea Sharrock]] (''[[Henry V (TV film)|Henry V]]''). Featuring [[Ben Whishaw]] as Richard II, [[Patrick Stewart]] as John of Gaunt, [[Rory Kinnear]] as Henry Bolingbroke (in ''Richard II'') and [[Jeremy Irons]] as Henry IV, [[Tom Hiddleston]] as Henry V, [[Simon Russell Beale]] as Falstaff, [[Joe Armstrong (actor)|Joe Armstrong]] as Hotspur, and [[Julie Walters]] as Mistress Quickly. The first tetralogy is set to be adapted in 2016.

Many of the plays have also been filmed stand-alone, outside of the cycle at large. Famous examples include ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', directed and starring both [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]], ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' by Olivier and [[Richard Loncraine]] (starring [[Ian McKellen]]) and ''[[Henry IV, Part I]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part II|Part II]]'' combined into ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]'' (with some scenes from [[Henry V (play)|Henry V]], also known as ''Falstaff'') directed by and starring [[Orson Welles]].

'''Hoeven''' is a village in the municipality of [[Halderberge]] in the [[Netherlands]]. The name Hoeven originated from the purchase of a certain amount of ground in 1282 by the [[abbey]] of [[Cistercienser]] of [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]].  This amount was equal to 100 "hoeven", a local measure of [[area]] in those days.  A [[hoeve]] is approximately 12 [[bunder]].  A "bunder" equals the area of the average [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[farm]] in the Netherlands.

== Municipality of Hoeven ==

Hoeven was a separate municipality until 1997 including the three villages of [[Bosschenhoofd]], Hoeven and Kruisstraat. In 1997 the municipality of Hoeven became a part of Halderberge.<ref>{{Repertorium Nederlandse Gemeenten}}</ref>

== Different names ==

Though the village officially is named Hoeven, most civilians use and pronounce it as "Oeve" or "d'Oeve" as 'Hoeven' is pronounced in the local dialect, [[Brabants]]. Remarkable in the southern parts of the [[Netherlands]], where they officially celebrate [[carnival]], is that during this period all places change names during this seven-day celebration. In case of Hoeven it is known in this period as "Peejenland" which means "Land of the Carrots". Before the name may be changed the [[Mayor]] must hand the key of the village to the Prince of Carnival ("Prins Carnaval") and this way he gives the Prince the leadership of the village. At the end of [[Carnival|Carnaval]] the Princess gives the key back to the Mayor and the village welcomes boards change back to the original.

== Flag ==

The [http://www.vlaggen.fiberworld.nl/hoeven.html official flag] of Hoeven is composed of two color in a diagonal line from left under to right above. Remarkable point is that the border line between those points isn't straight but wave-shaped which is a rare sight in this area. The lowest part of the flag is yellow while the highest part is blue. In this blue part appears a yellow castle tower which could come from a castle that was located in the center of Hoeven in history. Recently at construction works at the old Mayorhouse there were ruins and graves discover of an unknown centuries old large building with towers. The construction works are delayed for historical research on the ruin. The shape of the castle in the flag of Hoeven also comes back in the [http://www.vlaggen.fiberworld.nl/haldenberge.html flag] of the municipal "Halderberge".

== Symbol ==

The symbol of Hoeven is "de Peejenzaaier" (the carrotsower). Which is pictured as a bronze statue at the main square in the center of the village.

== Location ==

Hoeven is situated between the bigger cities of [[Roosendaal]] and [[Breda]], near the smaller city [[Etten-Leur]]. The center street of Hoeven is build on a small hill called the "Halderberg". Which is remarkable since the rest of the areas landscape is extremely flat. To the north Hoeven finds a natural border with the river "[[Mark (Dintel)|De Mark]]", which is also the border of the municipality with [[Zevenbergen]]. The village of Hoeven has a surface of 24,82&nbsp;km² and in 2007 counted 6,560 civilians.

Hoeven also contains two pieces of [[polder]]:
* The biggest polder is the "Hoevense Beemde" which was founded at 12 June 1409 when the [[abbot]] of "Sint Bernardus" offered a large piece of land to the public. A big percentage of this area was sold to people from [[Moerdijk]] who used the land to win [[peat]]. This caused much danger for floods because the river "[[Mark (Dintel)|De Mark]]" was nearby, so the area of the "Hoevense Beemden" was protected by building [[levee|dykes]] around it.
* The "Sint Maartenspolder" was a piece of land that was owned by the abbot of "Sint Bernardus" which released this piece of land that had been slibt over the years 8 October 1483. It was named after the patron saint "Sint Maarten".

== Sights ==

* Great seminar Bovendonk
The great seminar [http://www.bovendonk.nl/ Bovendonk] located in the center of Hoeven. In the year 1282 the abbey "Sint Bernardus" in [[Antwerp]] (Modern day [[Belgium]]) founded a new "garden" in Hoeven. In 1570 this garden became property of the Bishop of [[Antwerp]]. In 1646 it lost his function as Catholic Church and it become Protestant and the first Pastor arrived.  1871 the great seminar of [[Breda]] moved from location to Hoeven and the great seminar Bovendonk was born.  Because all the ground of the seminar was still property of the Dutch government, the seminar bought the complete amount of ground in 1892 for 14000 [[Guilder]].  Three years later the famous designer [[Petrus J.H. Cuypers]] designed a complete new seminar for this location and in 1907 the new seminar in [[neogotic]] style appeared. Due the low amount of notifications for the Paster study the great seminar Bovendonk was abandoned in 1967 and left like this for the next 11 years. In 1990 first progress was made to commercialise the great seminar Bovendonk. In 2007 the 100th birthday of the great seminar was celebrated. These days it is in use as a conference center, hotel, exhibition and event center.

== Events ==

* Carnaval
As in all towns in the two southern provinces of the Netherlands [[carnival]] is also celebrated in Hoeven. Remarkable is that every town has its own rituals and happenings during this seven-day celebration. Very special is that Hoeven is the only village in the Netherlands that has a (legal) private radio station named [http://www.radiopeejenland.nl/ Radio Peejenland] during these 7 days.

* Carnavalsparade
Every year at the last Tuesday of [[carnival]] there is a carnivals [[parade]] in Hoeven. Though this is a well-known phenomenon, the parade of Hoeven highly ranked in the area because there are very strict rules for the competitors which leads to very high quality of the creations. So there is mainly paper used instead of polyester, which is mostly used in other areas.

* Trekkertrek
Trekkertrek, which litterly means "[[tractor pulling]]", is a sport where a tractor needs to pull a trailer which is becoming more and more heavy by the time the trucks gets further. These days many of these tractors are powered by engines from heavy machinery or even [[fighterjet]] engines.

* Fietsvierdaagse and Wandelvierdaagse
Two four-day tournaments where competitives need to walk or cycle a certain distance in four days in different categories. In the case of the cycling event ([[Fietsvierdaagse]]), people can choose from a distance of 25, 40, 60 or 100 kilometre per day. In the case of the walking event ([[Wandelvierdaagse]]) you can choose between 5, 10 or 15 kilometre distance per day. Once a competitive has managed to drive or walk the same distance for four days in a row they earn a medal.

* Muziekweekend
A music event that is held once or twice a year, organised by the local music organisation "Sint Cecilea". At this event there are always 3 days organised with different international, national and regional music.

* Sint Maarten
During this celebration that is only celebrated in a few random areas of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg and the North of France, there is always a fireworks show at the recreationpark "Splesj!".

* Kermis
During the pinkster period there is a yearly Kermis ([[fair]]) held at the center of Hoeven.

* Koninginnedag
At [[Koninginnedag]] (Queensday) there is a national celebration of the birthday of the Queen (actually, it is the birthday of the mother of the queen). This means there is a parade through the village with a lot of orange colored vehicles.  Orange being the national color of the Netherlands.  Also there are multiple music and sport activities planned around the general celebration.

== Famous citizens born in Hoeven ==

* [[Frederik Ouwerling]] (1883–1960), archivist

'''''Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation''''', {{ussc|438|726|1978}} is a [[landmark decision|landmark]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision that defined the power of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) over [[decency|indecent]] material as applied to broadcasting.

== Facts ==
[[File:Seven Dirty Words WBAI.jpg|thumbnail|left|In reference to this case, a poster in a [[WBAI]] broadcast booth warns radio broadcasters against using the [[seven dirty words]].]]
In 1973 a father complained to the FCC that his son had heard the [[George Carlin]] routine "[[Seven dirty words|Filthy Words]]" broadcast one afternoon over [[WBAI]], a [[Pacifica Foundation]] [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] station in New York City. Pacifica received censure from the FCC, in the form of a letter of reprimand, for allegedly violating FCC regulations which prohibited broadcasting indecent material.

== Holding ==
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC action in 1978, by a vote of 5 to 4, ruling that the routine was "indecent but not [[obscenity|obscene]]". The Court accepted as compelling the government's interests in:
* Shielding children from potentially offensive material, and
* Ensuring that unwanted speech does not enter one's home.

The Court stated that the FCC had the authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience, and gave the FCC broad leeway to determine what constituted indecency in different contexts.

WARN  - 2014-11-30 14:43:01.074; org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.SolrWriter; Error creating document : SolrInputDocument(fields: [contents=In [[geometry]], the notion of a '''connection''' makes precise the idea of transporting data along a curve or family of curves in a ''parallel'' and consistent manner. There are a variety of kinds of connections in modern geometry, depending on what sort of data one wants to transport. For instance, an [[affine connection]], the most elementary type of connection, gives a means for transporting [[tangent space|tangent vectors]] to a [[manifold]] from one point to another along a curve.  An affine connection is typically given in the form of a [[covariant derivative]], which gives a means for taking [[directional derivative]]s of vector fields: the infinitesimal transport of a [[vector field]] in a given direction.

Connections are of central importance in modern geometry in large part because they allow a comparison between the local geometry at one point and the local geometry at another point.  [[Differential geometry]] embraces several variations on the connection theme, which fall into two major groups: the infinitesimal and the local theory.  The local theory concerns itself primarily with notions of [[parallel transport]] and [[holonomy]].  The infinitesimal theory concerns itself with the differentiation of geometric data.  Thus a covariant derivative is a way of specifying a [[derivative]] of a vector field along another vector field on a manifold.  A [[Cartan connection]] is a way of formulating some aspects of connection theory using [[differential forms]] and [[Lie group]]s.  An [[Ehresmann connection]] is a connection in a [[fibre bundle]] or a [[principal bundle]] by specifying the allowed directions of motion of the field.  A [[Koszul connection]] is a connection generalizing the derivative in a [[vector bundle]].

Connections also lead to convenient formulations of ''geometric invariants'', such as the [[curvature]] (see also [[Riemann curvature tensor|curvature tensor]] and [[curvature form]]), and [[torsion tensor]].

==Motivation: the unsuitability of coordinates==
[[File:Connection-on-sphere.png|frame|Parallel transport (of black arrow) on a sphere. Blue, respectively red arrows represent parallel transports in different directions but ending at the same lower right point. The fact that they end up not pointing in the same direction is a function of the curvature of the sphere.]]
Consider the following problem.  Suppose that a tangent vector to the sphere ''S'' is given at the north pole, and we are to define a manner of consistently moving this vector to other points of the sphere: a means for ''parallel transport''.  Naïvely, this could be done using a particular [[coordinate system]].  However, unless proper care is applied, the parallel transport defined in one system of coordinates will not agree with that of another coordinate system.  A more appropriate parallel transportation system exploits the symmetry of the sphere under rotation.  Given a vector at the north pole, one can transport this vector along a curve by rotating the sphere in such a way that the north pole moves along the curve without axial rolling.  This latter means of parallel transport is the [[Levi-Civita connection]] on the sphere.  If two different curves are given with the same initial and terminal point, and a vector ''v'' is rigidly moved along the first curve by a rotation, the resulting vector at the terminal point will be ''different from'' the vector resulting from rigidly moving ''v'' along the second curve.  This phenomenon reflects the [[curvature]] of the sphere. A simple mechanical device that can be used to visualize parallel transport is the [[south-pointing chariot]].

For instance, suppose that ''S'' is given coordinates by the [[stereographic projection]].  Regard ''S'' as consisting of unit vectors in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.  Then ''S'' carries a pair of coordinate patches: one covering a neighborhood of the north pole, and the other of the south pole.  The mappings
:<math>
\begin{align}
\varphi_0(x,y) & =\left(\frac{2x}{1+x^2+y^2}, \frac{2y}{1+x^2+y^2}, \frac{1-x^2-y^2}{1+x^2+y^2}\right)\\[8pt]
\varphi_1(x,y) & =\left(\frac{2x}{1+x^2+y^2}, \frac{2y}{1+x^2+y^2}, \frac{x^2+y^2-1}{1+x^2+y^2}\right)
\end{align}
</math>
cover a neighborhood ''U''<sub>0</sub> of the north pole and ''U''<sub>1</sub> of the south pole, respectively.  Let ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'' be the ambient coordinates in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.  Then ?<sub>0</sub> and ?<sub>1</sub> have inverses
:<math>
\begin{align}
\varphi_0^{-1}(X,Y,Z)&=\left(\frac{X}{Z+1}, \frac{Y}{Z+1}\right), \\[8pt]
\varphi_1^{-1}(X,Y,Z)&=\left(\frac{-X}{Z-1}, \frac{-Y}{Z-1}\right),
\end{align}
</math>
so that the coordinate transition function is [[inversion in a circle|inversion in the circle]]:

:<math>\varphi_{01}(x,y) = \varphi_0^{-1}\circ\varphi_1(x,y)=\left(\frac{x}{x^2+y^2},\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}\right)</math>

Let us now represent a vector field in terms of its components relative to the coordinate derivatives.  If ''P'' is a point of ''U''<sub>0</sub> ? ''S'', then a vector field may be represented by the pushforward

:<math>v(P) = J_{\varphi_0}(\varphi_0^{-1}(P))\cdot {\bold v}_0(\varphi_0^{-1}(P))\qquad(1) </math>

where <math>J_{\varphi_0}</math> denotes the [[Jacobian matrix]] of ?<sub>0</sub>, and '''v'''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''v'''<sub>0</sub>(''x'',&nbsp;''y'') is a vector field on '''R'''<sup>2</sup> uniquely determined by ''v''.  Furthermore, on the overlap between the coordinate charts ''U''<sub>0</sub> ? ''U''<sub>1</sub>, it is possible to represent the same vector field with respect to the ?<sub>1</sub> coordinates:

:<math>v(P) = J_{\varphi_1}(\varphi_1^{-1}(P))\cdot {\bold v}_1(\varphi_1^{-1}(P)). \qquad (2) </math>

To relate the components '''v'''<sub>0</sub> and '''v'''<sub>1</sub>, apply the [[chain rule]] to the identity ?<sub>1</sub> = ?<sub>0</sub> o ?<sub>01</sub>:

:<math>J_{\varphi_1}(\varphi_1^{-1}(P)) = J_{\varphi_0}(\varphi_0^{-1}(P))\cdot J_{\varphi_{01}}(\varphi_1^{-1}(P)). \, </math>

Applying both sides of this matrix equation to the component vector '''v'''<sub>1</sub>(?<sub>1</sub><sup>&minus;1</sup>(''P'')) and invoking (1) and (2) yields
:<math>{\bold v}_0(\varphi_0^{-1}(P)) = J_{\varphi_{01}}(\varphi_1^{-1}(P))\cdot {\bold v}_1(\varphi_1^{-1}(P)). \qquad (3)</math>

We come now to the main question of defining how to transport a vector field parallelly along a curve.  Suppose that ''P''(''t'') is a curve in ''S''.  Naïvely, one may consider a vector field parallel if the coordinate components of the vector field are constant along the curve.  However, an immediate ambiguity arises: in ''which'' coordinate system should these components be constant?

For instance, suppose that ''v''(''P''(''t'')) has constant components in the ''U''<sub>1</sub> coordinate system.  That is, the functions '''v'''<sub>1</sub>(''?''<sub>1</sub><sup>&minus;1</sup>(''P''(''t''))) are constant.  However, applying the [[product rule]] to (3) and using the fact that ''d'''''v'''<sub>1</sub>/''dt'' = 0 gives

:<math>\frac{d}{dt}{\bold v}_0(\varphi_0^{-1}(P(t)))=\left(\frac{d}{dt}J_{\varphi_{01}}(\varphi_1^{-1}(P(t)))\right)\cdot {\bold v}_1(\varphi_1^{-1}(P(t))).</math>

But <math>\left(\frac{d}{dt}J_{\varphi_{01}}(\varphi_1^{-1}(P(t)))\right)</math> is always a non-singular matrix (provided that the curve ''P''(''t'') is not stationary), so '''v'''<sub>1</sub> and '''v'''<sub>0</sub> ''cannot ever be'' simultaneously constant along the curve.

===Resolution===
The problem observed above is that the usual [[directional derivative]] of [[vector calculus]] does not behave well under changes in the coordinate system when applied to the components of vector fields.  This makes it quite difficult to describe how to parallelly translate vector fields, if indeed such a notion makes any sense at all.  There are two fundamentally different ways of resolving this problem.

The first approach is to examine what is required for a generalization of the directional derivative to "behave well" under coordinate transitions.  This is the tactic taken by the [[covariant derivative]] approach to connections: good behavior is equated with [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariance]].  Here one considers a modification of the directional derivative by a certain [[linear operator]], whose components are called the [[Christoffel symbols]], which involves no derivatives on the vector field itself.  The directional derivative ''D''<sub>'''u'''</sub>'''v''' of the components of a vector '''v''' in a coordinate system ? in the direction '''u''' are replaced by a ''covariant derivative'':

:<math>\nabla_{\bold u} {\bold v} = D_{\bold u} {\bold v} + \Gamma(\varphi)\{{\bold u},{\bold v}\}</math>

where ? depends on the coordinate system ? and is [[Bilinear form|bilinear]] in '''u''' and '''v'''.  In particular, ? does not involve any derivatives on '''u''' or '''v'''.  In this approach, ? must transform in a prescribed manner when the coordinate system ? is changed to a different coordinate system.  This transformation is not [[tensor]]ial, since it involves not only the ''first derivative'' of the coordinate transition, but also its ''second derivative''.  Specifying the transformation law of ? is not sufficient to determine ?  uniquely.  Some other normalization conditions must be imposed, usually depending on the type of geometry under consideration.  In [[Riemannian geometry]], the [[Levi-Civita connection]] requires compatibility of the [[Christoffel symbols]] with the [[Riemannian metric|metric]] (as well as a certain symmetry condition).  With these normalizations, the connection is uniquely defined.

The second approach is to use [[Lie group]]s to attempt to capture some vestige of symmetry on the space.  This is the approach of [[Cartan connection]]s.  The example above using rotations to specify the parallel transport of vectors on the sphere is very much in this vein.

==Historical survey of connections==

Historically, connections were studied from an [[infinitesimal]] perspective in [[Riemannian geometry]].  The infinitesimal study of connections began to some extent with [[Christoffel]].   This was later taken up more thoroughly by [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]] and [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] {{harv|Levi-Civita|Ricci|1900}} who observed in part that a connection in the infinitesimal sense of Christoffel also allowed for a notion of [[parallel transport]].

The work of Levi-Civita focused exclusively on regarding connections as a kind of [[differential operator]] whose parallel displacements were then the solutions of [[differential equation]]s.  As the twentieth century progressed, [[Élie Cartan]] developed a new notion of connection.  He sought to apply the techniques of [[Pfaffian system]]s to the geometries of [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]].  In these investigations, he found that a certain infinitesimal notion of connection (a [[Cartan connection]]) could be applied to these geometries and more: his connection concept allowed for the presence of [[curvature]] which would otherwise be absent in a classical Klein geometry.  (See, for example, {{harv|Cartan|1926}} and {{harv|Cartan|1983}}.)  Furthermore, using the dynamics of [[Gaston Darboux]], Cartan was able to generalize the notion of parallel transport for his class of infinitesimal connections.  This established another major thread in the theory of connections: that a connection is a certain kind of [[differential form]].

The two threads in connection theory have persisted through the present day: a connection as a differential operator, and a connection as a differential form.  In 1950, [[Jean-Louis Koszul]] {{harv|Koszul|1950}} gave an algebraic framework for regarding a connection as a differential operator by means of the [[Koszul connection]].  The Koszul connection was both more general than that of Levi-Civita, and was easier to work with because it finally was able to eliminate (or at least to hide) the awkward [[Christoffel symbols]] from the connection formalism.  The attendant parallel displacement operations also had natural algebraic interpretations in terms of the connection.  Koszul's definition was subsequently adopted by most of the differential geometry community, since it effectively converted the ''analytic'' correspondence between covariant differentiation and parallel translation to an ''algebraic'' one.

In that same year, [[Charles Ehresmann]] {{harv|Ehresmann|1950}}, a student of Cartan's, presented a variation on the connection as a differential form view in the context of [[principal bundle]]s and, more generally, [[fibre bundle]]s.  [[Ehresmann connection]]s were, strictly speaking, not a generalization of Cartan connections.  Cartan connections were quite rigidly tied to the underlying [[differential topology]] of the manifold because of their relationship with [[Cartan's equivalence method]].  Ehresmann connections were rather a solid framework for viewing the foundational work of other geometers of the time, such as [[Shiing-Shen Chern]], who had already begun moving away from Cartan connections to study what might be called [[gauge connection]]s.  In Ehresmann's point of view, a connection in a principal bundle consists of a specification of ''horizontal'' and ''vertical'' vector fields on the total space of the bundle.  A parallel translation is then a lifting of a curve from the base to a curve in the principal bundle which is horizontal.  This viewpoint has proven especially valuable in the study of [[holonomy]].

==Possible approaches==

*A rather direct approach is to specify how a [[covariant derivative]] acts on elements of the [[module (mathematics)|module]] of [[vector field]]s as a [[differential operator]].  More generally, a similar approach applies for [[connection (vector bundle)|connections]] in any [[vector bundle]].
*Traditional index notation specifies the connection by components; see [[Christoffel symbols]].  (''Note'': this has three indices, but is '''''not''''' a [[tensor]]).
*In [[pseudo-Riemannian]] and [[Riemannian geometry]] the [[Levi-Civita connection]] is a special connection associated to the [[metric tensor]].
*These are examples of [[affine connection]]s. There is also a concept of [[projective connection]], of which the [[Schwarzian derivative]] in [[complex analysis]] is an instance.  More generally, both affine and projective connections are types of [[Cartan connection]]s.
*Using [[principal bundle]]s, a connection can be realized as a [[Lie algebra]]-valued [[differential form]].  See [[connection (principal bundle)]].
*An approach to connections which makes direct use of the notion of transport of "data" (whatever that may be) is the [[Ehresmann connection]].
*The most abstract approach may be that suggested by [[Alexander Grothendieck]], where a [[Grothendieck connection]] is seen as [[descent (category theory)|descent]] data from infinitesimal neighbourhoods of the [[diagonal]]; see {{harv|Osserman|2004}}.

'''Reed Owen Smoot''' (January 10, 1862{{spaced ndash}}February 9, 1941) was a native-born [[Utah]]n who was first elected to the [[United States Senate]] from Utah in 1903, and served as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator until 1933. Smoot is primarily remembered as the co-sponsor of the 1930 [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]], which raised US import tariffs on over 20,000 dutiable items to record levels and is widely regarded as having exacerbated the [[Great Depression]]. Smoot was a prominent leader of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), serving as an [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] in the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]]. Smoot's role in the LDS Church (together with rumors of a secret LDS policy favoring multiple marriage and a secret oath) led to lengthy controversy, when he was first elected to the Senate, over his eligibility to serve, eventually settled in Smoot's favor. At the time of his death, Smoot was third in the line of succession to lead the LDS Church.

==Early life, family, and religious activity==
Born in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah Territory]], Smoot was the son of [[Mormon]] pioneer and former [[mayor of Salt Lake City]], [[Abraham O. Smoot]] and Anne Kristina (Morrison) Smoot.  Reed Smoot attended public schools and the [[University of Utah]], and graduated from Brigham Young Academy (now [[Brigham Young University]]) in Provo, Utah in 1879.  After graduation, he served as a [[Mormon missionary]] in England. He married Alpha M. Eldredge of Salt Lake City on September 17, 1884. They were the parents of seven children. Smoot was a successful businessman and from 1895 became increasingly important in the hierarchy of the LDS Church.  On April 8, 1900, Smoot was ordained  as an [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] of the LDS Church and became a member of the church's [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]].
[[File:Grantsmootloc2.png|thumb|left|Smoot (right) with [[Heber J. Grant]], president of the LDS Church, ca 1918-1920.]]

As a U.S. Senator in the early 1920s, Smoot toured Europe with an official U.S. government passport and was able to convince several governments to allow [[Mormon missionaries]] to enter.

==United States Senate==
After becoming an apostle in 1900, Smoot received the approval of church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] to run for office in 1902.  He was elected to the [[United States Senate]] ([[58th United States Congress|58th Congress]]) on January 20, 1903 as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator, representing the state of Utah.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Business of the House: Proceedings Before That Branch Late Yesterday Afternoon.|url= http://udn.lib.utah.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/den7/id/48687/show/48898/rec/95|newspaper= Deseret News|location= Salt Lake City, Utah|publisher= |date= January 21, 1903|accessdate= November 29, 2013}}</ref> Smoot was introduced to the United States Senate by Utah's Senior U.S. Senator, Republican [[Thomas Kearns]], a Catholic who was elected in 1901. Kearns, a prominent mining magnate, newspaper owner, banker and railroad owner had denied Smoot this senate seat two years before with the blessing of the president of the LDS church, Lorenzo Snow.

===Controversy over religious affiliation===

His election sparked a bitter four-year battle in the Senate on whether Smoot was eligible or should be allowed to serve, due to his position as a Mormon apostle. Many were convinced that his association with the church disqualified him from serving in the United States Senate. Only a few years earlier, another prominent Utah Mormon, [[B. H. Roberts]], had been elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] but was denied his seat on the basis that he practiced [[Polygamy and the Latter Day Saint movement|plural marriage]] (polygamy).

Smoot did not practice plural marriage, and the LDS Church had officially renounced future plural marriages in an [[1890 Manifesto]] before Utah became a state. However, the ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' reported that church leaders continued to secretly approve of new, post-Manifesto plural marriages.<ref>B. Carmon Hardy, ''Solemn Covenant: The Mormon Polygamous Passage'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1994) extensively documents Mormon-sanctioned post-Manifesto polygamy.</ref> As a result, the Senate began an investigation into Smoot's eligibility.<ref>Kathleen Flake, ''The Politics of American Religious Identity: The Seating of Senator Reed Smoot, Mormon Apostle'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2004).</ref> The [[Smoot Hearings]] began on January 16, 1904. The hearings included exhaustive questioning into the continuation of plural marriage within the state of Utah and the LDS Church, and questions on church teachings, doctrines and history. Although Smoot was not a polygamist, the charge by those opposed to his election to the Senate was that he could not swear to uphold the Constitution of the United States while serving in the highest echelons of an organization that sanctioned law breaking.

[[File:Smoot and Hawley standing together, April 11, 1929.jpg|thumb|left|[[Willis C. Hawley]] (left) and Smoot in April 1929, shortly before the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]] passed the House.]]
There were claims that [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]]-attending Latter-day Saints took an "[[oath of vengeance]]" against America for past grievances. As a leader of the LDS Church, Senator Smoot was accused of taking this oath, which Smoot denied. Five of the U.S. Senators who participated in the investigation agreed, writing, "As to the 'endowment oath,' it is sufficient in this summary to say that the testimony is collated and analyzed in the annexed statement, and thereby shown to be limited in amount, vague, and indefinite in character, and utterly unreliable because of the disreputable and untrustworthy character of the witnesses."<ref>Senate Resolution 205, [[57th United States Congress|Fifty-seventh Congress]], second session.</ref> Although the majority of the committee recommended that Smoot be removed from office, on February 20, 1907 the Senate defeated the proposal and Smoot was allowed to serve in the Senate. Smoot was reelected in 1908 and continued to serve in the Senate until March 1933 (following his 1932 electoral defeat).

In 1916, [[William Kent (U.S. Congressman)|William Kent]] was the lead sponsor of the legislation in the House of Representatives that created the [[National Park Service]]. The similar Senate bill was sponsored by Reed Smoot. The legislation passed the House of Representatives on July 1, 1916, passed the Senate on August 5, and was signed by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916.<ref>{{Cite journal

Smoot was Chairman of the [[Senate Finance Committee]] from 1923 to 1933 and served on the Senate Appropriations Committee. He became active in the national Republican Party and served as a delegate to the Republican national convention in 1908, 1912, 1916, 1920, and 1924. He was Chairman of the 1928 Resolutions Committee at the 1928 Republican National Convention and chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.

Smoot was a co-sponsor of the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff]] in 1930, which raised U.S. import tariffs on over 20,000 dutiable items to record levels and arguably exacerbated the [[Great Depression]].  [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Herbert Hoover]] signed the act into law on June 17, 1930.

Smoot served five terms before being defeated in the 1932 election by [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[Elbert D. Thomas]]. After his unsuccessful reelection campaign, Smoot moved back to Salt Lake City. He retired from active business and political pursuits to dedicate his remaining years as an apostle for the LDS Church. Smoot died on February 9, 1941 during a visit to [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], and was buried in [[Provo, Utah]].

H. Douglas]].  Its supporters were colloquially known as '''Socreds''' in English and '''créditistes''' in French.  It gained popularity and its own political party in the 1930s, as a result of the [[Great Depression]].

==Federal politics==
{{main|Social Credit Party of Canada}}
The '''Western Social Credit League''', an outgrowth of Alberta Social Credit, ran candidates in the [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935 federal election]] taking many votes from the [[Progressive Party of Canada]] and the [[United Farmers of Canada|United Farmers]] movement. In the [[Canadian federal election, 1940|1940 federal election]], Socreds ran with supporters of [[William Duncan Herridge]] as [[New Democracy (Canada)|New Democracy]], but reverted to the Social Credit name in subsequent elections with the [[Social Credit Association of Canada]] being officially formed in 1944. The party was generally fairly small, and gradually declined.  

In the 1960s, the [[Social Credit Party of Canada split, 1963|Québécois wing of the party split off]] to form the ''[[Ralliement créditiste]]''. The two wings reunited in 1971. The party was left without any parliamentary seats following the [[Canadian federal election, 1980|1980 federal election]], and thereafter declined into irrelevance, though it nominally continued to exist until 1993.

{{see also|Social Credit Party of Canada leadership conventions}}

==Alberta==
{{main|Social Credit Party of Alberta}}

The ideology was embraced by the Reverend "Bible Bill" [[William Aberhart]], who formed the [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Alberta Social Credit League]] based on Douglas' ideology and conservative Christian social values. He was elected [[List of Alberta premiers|Premier of Alberta]] in the [[Alberta general election, 1935|1935 provincial election]].  His government was probably the only one in the world that adhered to the social credit ideology. In fact, following the [[1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt]] in which Aberhardt's government was pressured to implement its fiscal program, he once tried to implement social credit by issuing "Prosperity Certificates" to Albertans, although this measure was disallowed by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on the basis that only the federal government of Canada was authorized to issue currency. Aberhart died in office, and was replaced by [[Ernest Manning]], who largely discredited the theory and attempted to purge the party of [[anti-Semites]], but kept the Social Credit name.

The Alberta Socreds formed nine consecutive [[majority government]]s spanning 36 years, the longest unbroken run in government at the provincial level at the time.

Although the party is no longer a significant force in Alberta politics, it still has some support and briefly experienced a revival in the mid-2000s.  However, in the most recent provincial election, in 2008, the party collapsed to only 0.2 percent of the vote, its worst showing ever.

==British Columbia==
{{main|Social Credit Party of British Columbia}}
In the 1930s and 1940s, the social credit movement in [[British Columbia]] was largely fractious, and made up of various small groups, the largest of which being the Social Credit League. The British Columbian movement was largely at odds with the Albertan wing and sought to distance itself from William Aberhart's religious preaching.

The effective death of the movement came when [[W. A. C. Bennett]] was elected leader of the League in 1951. Bennett joined in order to use the party as a political vehicle, and was quick to dump the original ideology, and reorganize into the conservative populist [[Social Credit Party of British Columbia|British Columbia Social Credit Party]].

Social Credit's first government in British Columbia was a very small [[minority government|minority]], but they were elected to a majority a year later. After the minority, and 20 years of majority government, the party was defeated by the [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia]]. The NDP served only one term in Government, before the Social Credit Party was returned to office for four more terms of majority government under W.A.C. Bennett's son, [[Bill Bennett]].  Bennett was succeeded by [[Bill Vander Zalm]] in 1986, but Vander Zalm was forced to resign in 1991 in favour of [[Rita Johnston]].

The Social Credit government was defeated by the NDP in the [[British Columbia general election, 1991|1991 election]], and was knocked down to third place.  The party collapsed in the [[British Columbia general election, 1996|1996 election]] when it failed to win a single seat  in the legislature, and received only 0.4% of votes cast. Many of the party's mainstream  members left to join the [[British Columbia Liberal Party]], which emerged in the early 1990s as the new "free enterprise" coalition opposing the NDP. 

Although the party still nominally exists, it is generally reckoned as a fringe party.  It ran only two candidates in the [[British Columbia general election, 2001|2001 election]]. The strongest candidate of the two, Grant Mitton, a former radio talk show host who received 17% of the vote in his [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]], later left the party to form the [[British Columbia Party]].  It only ran two candidates in [[British Columbia general election, 2005|2005]] and none in [[British Columbia general election, 2009|2009]].

==Quebec==
{{main|Ralliement créditiste|Ralliement créditiste du Québec}}

The movement also caught on in [[Quebec]] in part because of the work of [[Louis Even]] who translated social credit literature into French, wrote his own articles on the subject and published and circulated periodicals to promote social credit theories. He and [[Gilberte Côté-Mercier]] founded a [[laity|lay]] Christian group called the "[[Pilgrims of Saint Michael]]", based in Rougemont, Quebec, that promotes social credit monetary policy coupled with conservative Catholicism. The Pilgrims publish ''The Michael Journal'' in English and ''Vers Demain'' in French. The group is nicknamed "the White Berets" for the headgear worn by members.  

Even and Côté-Mercier also founded the ''[[Union des électeurs]]'' in 1939 as a provincial party based on social credit theories  and recruited [[Réal Caouette]] to the movement. Even and Armand Turpin ran federally as [[New Democracy (Canada)|New Democracy]] candidates in the [[Canadian federal election, 1940|1940 federal election]], but none was elected. The movement was able to win a post [[World War II]] [[by-election]] under the ''[[Union des électeurs]]'' label, with Caouette being sent to the [[Canadian House of Commons]]. The Union broke with the [[Social Credit Party of Canada]] in 1947 over [[Ernest Manning]]'s rejection of more orthodox social credit economic theory and his purge of anti-Semites from the social credit movement. The Union held more orthodox views in line with [[C.H. Douglas]]'s original economic and political philosophy including a rejection of party politics in the belief that it should be replaced by a non-partisan "union of electors" in which elected officials would implement the popular will. 

Caouette ran for re-election as a ''union des electeurs'' candidate and lost his seat in the [[Canadian federal election, 1949|1949 federal election]].  Caouette continued to run in elections unsuccessfully through the 1950s over the objections of Even and Côté-Mercier and split with them on May 4, 1958 to form ''[[Ralliement des créditistes]]'' as the Quebec wing of the [[Social Credit Party of Canada]] with himself as leader. It achieved a major breakthrough in the [[Canadian federal election, 1962|1962 federal election]], and remained in the House of Commons under various names until 1980. 

Social Credit was never able to form a provincial government in Quebec due to the  near dominance of social conservative votes by the ''[[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'' party from the 1930s into the 1960s. The Social Credit Party, however, soon became a major contender in Quebec for seats to the federal [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] in the 1960s. Although BC and Alberta would elect a few Social Credit [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) in that decade, it would be Quebec that maintained the party's national presence after 1962. Social Credit remained dominant in the other two provinces in provincial elections.

In the [[Canadian federal election, 1962|1962 election]], Social Credit won 26 of 75 seats in Quebec, beating the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]]. They continued to finish in second place in terms of federal seats from Quebec until their last MPs fell with the minority government of [[Joe Clark]] in 1980. The most Social Credit ever captured in terms of the Quebec popular vote was 27.3% federally, and 11.2% provincially.

The Quebec wing of the movement broke from the rest of the party in 1963 to form its own Quebec-only federal Social Credit party, the ''[[Ralliement des créditistes]]''. As a social conservative party, the party generally attracted voters who supported of the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] in provincial elections.

The party formed a provincial wing in 1970, the ''[[Ralliement créditiste du Québec]]'', which benefited as the UN declined after the death of [[Premier]] [[Daniel Johnson, Sr|Daniel Johnson]] in 1968. 

The growth of [[History of the Quebec sovereignist movement|Quebec separatism]] stymied the rise of the provincial Créditistes. Although ''[[Parti Québécois]]'' is a [[social democratic]] party, it drew nationalist voters away from the Créditistes.

In the [[Quebec general election, 1970|1970 provincial election]], the Liberals took 72 seats, followed by the Union Nationale with 17, and ''Ralliement créditiste du Québec'' with 12. The party was riven by internal dissent for the remainder of its history, capturing two seats in the [[Quebec general election, 1973|1973 election]], and only one in the [[Quebec general election, 1976|1976 election]], the last time a ''créditiste'' was elected to the Quebec [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]].

==New Brunswick==

While Social Credit never won any seats in the [[New Brunswick]] Legislature, it won 3.1% of the vote in the [[New Brunswick general election, 1948|1948 provincial election]], the party's first. Social Credit also ran candidates in [[New Brunswick general election, 1952|1952]] and [[New Brunswick general election, 1956|1956]] winning 0.5% and 1.6% of the vote respectively.

==Manitoba==
{{main|Manitoba Social Credit Party}}
In [[Manitoba]], the party was able to win a few seats in the Legislature, and was the [[third political party|third party]] in each at various times. From 1936 to 1940, the party supported [[John Bracken]]'s [[minority government]], and in 1940 it joined Bracken's [[coalition government]]. 

Of the ten elections from 1936–1973, the party won seats in seven. In the [[Manitoba general election, 1936|1936 provincial election]], Social Credit finished third, and in the [[Manitoba general election, 1941|1941 provincial election]], it tied for third. However, Social Credit never won more than 14% of the popular vote.

==Saskatchewan==
{{main|Social Credit Party of Saskatchewan}}
In [[Saskatchewan]], Social Credit won seats in the Legislature in two elections - 2 seats in the [[Saskatchewan general election, 1938|1938 election]], and 3 in the [[Saskatchewan general election, 1956|1956 election]]. In 1956, the party held  [[third political party|third party]] status. Social Credit was never able to win more 16% of the popular vote.

==Ontario==

{{main|Social Credit Party of Ontario}}

In [[Ontario]], the party unsuccessfully ran candidates in most provincial elections from 1945 until 1975, never obtaining electoral support beyond a negligible level.

The party faced serious divisions in the 1940s, 1960s and early 1970s due to attempted takeovers by fascist groups and was put in trusteeship by the federal party in 1972 when the fascist [[Western Guard Party|Western Guard]] succeeded in taking control.

The party continued as a registered party into the 1980s, not running candidates in the 1977 election and running only 5 candidates with interim leader [[John Turmel]] in the 1981 election. It was defunct by 1985.

==Other parties==

Other political parties have also promoted social credit principles, including [[John Turmel]]'s [[Christian Credit Party]] and [[Abolitionist Party of Canada]], and the short-lived [[Canada Party]].  The [[Global Party of Canada]] also appears to promote social credit economic policies.

The [[Canadian Action Party]] has [[monetary reform]] policies in its platform, but is not considered to be a social credit party.

'''David Russell Lange''', [[Member of the Order of New Zealand|ONZ]], [[Companion of the Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]] ({{IPAc-en|?|l|?|?|i}} {{respell|LONG|ee}}; 4 August 1942 – 13 August 2005), served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|32nd]] [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]] from 1984 to 1989. He headed New Zealand's [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|fourth Labour Government]], one of the most reforming administrations in his country's history, but one which did not always conform to traditional expectations of a [[social democracy|social-democrat]] party. He had a reputation for cutting wit (sometimes directed against himself) and eloquence. His government implemented far-reaching [[free market|free-market]] reforms. [[Helen Clark]] described [[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987|New Zealand's nuclear-free legislation]] as his legacy.<ref>

==Early life==
Lange was born in [[Otahuhu]], a South [[Auckland]] suburb.{{sfn|Lange|2005|p=21-22}} He was the son of a doctor of German stock. His relatives had suffered from prejudice during the First World War due to their German ancestry, and Lange himself would face a political rival in 1984 who tried to discredit him because of his German heritage. He received his formal education at Fairburn Primary School, [[Otara]] Intermediate School and [[Otahuhu College]], then at the [[University of Auckland]], where he graduated in law in 1965. He paid his way through university by working in a [[food preservation|meat-freezing]] works. In 1968 he married Naomi Crampton. He gained a Master of Laws in 1970, then practised law in [[Northland (region), New Zealand|Northland]] and Auckland for some years, often giving legal representation to the most dispossessed members of Auckland society.

Lange suffered all his life from [[obesity]] and the health problems it caused. By 1982 he weighed about 175 kilograms, and had surgery to [[stomach stapling|staple]] his stomach in order to lose weight.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/20408/the-new-leader-of-the-labour-party|title=The new leader of the Labour Party|encyclopedia=Dictionary of New Zealand Biography|date=30 October 2013}}</ref>{{sfn|Lange|2005|pp=143-144}} 
He attributed his verbal talents to the need to compensate for his clumsiness during his intermediate school days.{{sfn|Lange|2005|p=50}}

Lange joined the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] in 1963, and helped in the campaigns of [[Phil Amos]] in 1963 and [[Norman Douglas (New Zealand politician)|Norman Douglas]] in 1966. In 1974 his cousin [[Michael Bassett]] suggested that Lange should stand on the Labour ticket for the Auckland City Council. The Council was dominated by conservative interests and the only Labour candidates elected were [[Jim Anderton]] and [[Catherine Tizard]]; Lange was ''halfway down the field .... which was better than I expected.'' Lange's father, who was a doctor, had delivered Bassett. Lange then stood for Labour in [[Hobson (New Zealand electorate)|Hobson]] in [[New Zealand general election, 1975|1975]], and came third.{{sfn|Lange|2005|pp=98,99}}

Lange entered the [[Parliament of New Zealand|New Zealand Parliament]] as the Labour MP for [[Mangere]], a working-class Auckland electorate with a large [[M?ori people|M?ori]] population, in 1977 in the [[Mangere by-election, 1977|Mangere by-election]]. On becoming an MP, Lange quickly made an impression in the House as a debater, a wit, and the scourge of Prime Minister [[Robert Muldoon]]. He succeeded [[Bill Rowling]] as leader of the Parliamentary Labour Party and as [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] on 3 February 1983.

=== Prime Ministership ===
{{main|Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand}}
When Muldoon called a [[New Zealand general election, 1984|snap election]] in 1984, Lange led Labour to a landslide victory, becoming at the age of 41 New Zealand's youngest prime minister of the 20th century.

Upon coming to office, Lange's government uncovered a skyrocketing public debt, ostensibly the result of Muldoon's policy of government regulation of the economy, including a wage- and price-freeze and regulation of the [[exchange rate]]. Such economic conditions prompted Lange to remark: "We ended up being run very similarly to a [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Polish shipyard]]".<ref>{{cite news | title = David Lange, in his own words | date = 2005-08-15 | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/david-lange-1942-2005/news/article.cfm?c_id=1500960&objectid=10340844 | work=The New Zealand Herald | accessdate = 2010-07-29}}</ref> Lange and [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]] [[Roger Douglas]] engaged in a rapid programme of deregulation and public-asset sales, which brought criticism from many people in Labour's traditional support-base. The Labour Party also lost support from many elderly people by introducing a [[Pension|superannuation]] [[Surtax|surcharge]] after having promised not to reduce superannuation.

Commentators coined the term [[Rogernomics]] for these policies, drawing connections with [[Reaganomics]] and with [[Thatcherism]]. After the Lange administration's first term (1984–1987), significant divisions started to form in the Labour parliamentary [[caucus]], with Lange becoming uncomfortable with the extent of the reforms, while Douglas and [[Richard Prebble]] wanted to push on.

The [[Black Monday (1987)|stock-market crash of 19 October 1987]] damaged confidence in the New Zealand economy. In 1988 consensus on economic policy amongst the Labour leadership finally broke down, with Douglas resigning after Lange overruled his proposed radical [[flat tax|flat income-tax]]. After losing many members, the Labour Party finally fractured, with [[Jim Anderton]] MP forming a breakaway [[NewLabour Party (New Zealand)|New Labour Party]], which later merged into the [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance Party]].

During his tenure as Prime Minister, Lange engaged in competitive motor-sport, appearing in the New Zealand One Make [[Ford Laser]] Sport series.

During his term of office as Prime Minister Lange also held the positions of [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] (1984 to 1987) and [[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Minister of Education]] (1987 to 1989). After [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Geoffrey Palmer]] became party leader and Prime Minister in 1989, Lange became (from 1989 to 1990) [[Attorney-General (New Zealand)|Attorney-General]], Minister in Charge of the [[Serious Fraud Office (New Zealand)|Serious Fraud Office]] and a Minister of State. In failing health, he retired from Parliament in 1996. His Labour Party colleague [[Taito Phillip Field]] succeeded him as the Member for the Mangere electorate.

The [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] made Lange a [[Order of the Companions of Honour|Companion of Honour]] in 1990 and created him an Ordinary Member of the [[Order of New Zealand]] on 2 June 2003.

Lange was a supporter of [[Flag of New Zealand|changing New Zealand's flag]], and wrote in 1994: "[a] stranger who saw the Australian flag and the New Zealand flag outside adjacent buildings would assume that some British hotel chain was advertising deluxe and standard rooms".<ref name="cuttings">{{cite book|author=David Lange|title=Cuttings – God Save Us All|date=1994-07-18|ISBN=0-473-02953-7|publisher=Jonathan Hudson & Associates}}</ref> Lange also expressed support for a [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand republic]], stating: "Do such things matter? They certainly do. We suffer in this country from a lack of emotional focus... New Zealand will become a republic just as Britain will be blurred into Europe".<ref name="cuttings" />

In an interview<ref>{{cite news | first = Audrey | last = Young | title = Interview: David Lange | date = 2004-07-03 | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/rainbow-warrior-bombing/news/article.cfm?c_id=1500930&objectid=3575913 | work=The New Zealand Herald | accessdate = 2010-07-29}}</ref> with ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' (published on 3 July 2004) the ''Herald'' asked Lange:

:''Do you think if the election of 1984 had not been a snap election, there would have been time for the opposing forces within the party to have successfully blocked the reforms or to have severely limited them?''

Lange replied:

{{Quotation|"You have to talk about why things happened the way they did. You can't actually explain my political life except by a series of situations rather than by some carefully constructed, rigidly progressed ascendancy. You could not imagine two more unlike rides to the top as I had and [[Helen Clark]] had: hers the principled, extremely hard-working, fearless really persistence in the face of all sorts of adversities and personal assaults. Whereas mine was some sort of divine roulette. Even entering into Parliament was not one of your created, structured planned-for episodes. I mean one minute I was a clapped-out two guinea legal-aid lawyer and the next minute I was in Parliament. The by-election of 77 saw to that ... I got there in terms of the Labour Party for all the wrong reasons, for all the reasons which weren't part of its tradition. I'd never been a tract writer; I'd never been a philosopher; I'd never taken part in extraordinary industrial dispute activism; I'd not been in any of that background but I was able to mix it in what had become, conceived to be, the new front line of politics – the ability on television to convey confidence and assurance without saying anything. And that is very important ... [I was] plunged into this extraordinary awareness of a crisis in foreign exchange and reserves and having to take steps that were the absolute antithesis of anything that I would ever have expected the week before. If the people of New Zealand thought it was a bit odd, for me it was absolutely staggering.... I had thought of getting the agencies like the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], the [[World Bank]] to come in and do a ''de facto'' receivership. In fact I said so more or less publicly – let us get some external analysis of where we are rather than one which is tainted by my self-interest and by [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]]'s clear self-interest. But it was rendered unnecessary. He put on such an extraordinarily good performance of carrying on and saying I was introducing scorched earth policy. By the time Muldoon had finish[ed] a couple of television appearances, the general public was completely satisfied we were in a mess...."}}

===International affairs===
{{further|New Zealand-United States relations|Franco-New Zealand relations}}

Lange made his name on the international stage with a long-running campaign against [[nuclear weapon]]s. His government refused to allow nuclear-armed ships into New Zealand waters, a policy that New Zealand continues to this day. The policy, developing in 1985, had the effect of prohibiting [[United States Navy]] ships from visiting New Zealand. This displeased the United States and Australia: they regarded the policy as a breach of treaty obligations under [[ANZUS]] and as an abrogation of responsibility in the context of the [[Cold War]] against the [[Soviet bloc]].  After consultations with Australia and after negotiations with New Zealand broke down, the United States announced that it would suspend its treaty obligations to New Zealand until the re-admission of United States Navy ships to New Zealand ports, characterising New Zealand as "a friend, but not an ally".

Erroneous claims sometimes suggest that David Lange withdrew New Zealand from ANZUS. His government's policy may have prompted the US's decision to suspend its ANZUS Treaty obligations to New Zealand, but that decision rested with the U.S. government, not with the New Zealand government.

An [[Oxford Union]] debate shown live on New Zealand television in March 1985 showcased Lange, a skilled orator, arguing for the proposition that "[http://publicaddress.net/default,1578.sm nuclear weapons are morally indefensible]", in opposition to U.S. [[televangelist]] [[Jerry Falwell]]. ([[TVNZ]] has made available an [http://www.publicaddress.net/default,2424.sm audio of Lange's speech].) Lange regarded his appearance at the Oxford Union as the highest point of his career in politics.{{sfn|Lange|2005|p=208}} 
His speech included his memorable statement "I can smell the [[uranium]] on it [your breath]...!".<ref>

Relations with France became strained when French agents of the [[DGSE]] [[sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|bombed and sank]] the [[Greenpeace]] ship the ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|Rainbow Warrior]]'' on 10 July 1985 while it lay moored in [[Waitemata Harbour|Auckland Harbour]], killing photographer [[Fernando Pereira]]. In June 1986 Lange obtained a political deal with France over the ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|Rainbow Warrior]]'' affair, presided over by [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]].  France agreed to pay compensation of NZ$13&nbsp;million (US$6.5&nbsp;million) to New Zealand and also to apologise. In return, Lange agreed that French authorities could detain the convicted French agents [[Alain Mafart]] and [[Dominique Prieur]] at the French military base on [[Hao (French Polynesia)|Hao Atoll]] for three years. However, the two spies both were freed by May 1988, after less than two years had elapsed.

==Life after politics==
In 1996 Lange sued the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] over an alleged defamation that it broadcast about him. The ABC used the defence that there exists in the [[Australian Constitution]] an implied right to [[freedom of speech]] on political matters, but the [[High Court of Australia]] found against them, reversing the then existing law (see [[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]). The case was later settled on terms favourable to Lange.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In a key New Zealand defamation case (Lange v Atkinson [2000] 3 NZLR 385), Lange sued [[political scientist]] Joe Atkinson for representing him in the magazine ''[[North & South (New Zealand magazine)|North & South]]'' as a lazy prime minister. In a 1998 judgment, and on appeal in 2000, the courts affirmed a new qualified privilege for the media to discuss politicians when expressing the criticisms as the "honest opinion" of the author.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Lange was a [[New Zealand Rugby League]] board member and served as the organisation's Vice-President.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17261824.html|title=NZRL chief back in the gun|work= The Sunday Star-Times|date=6 September 1998}}</ref>

Lange received the [[Right Livelihood Award]] in 2003 for his strong fight against [[nuclear weapons]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Accidental release of secret report===
In January 2006, [[Archives New Zealand]] released to ''[[The Sunday Star-Times]]'' newspaper a box of David Lange's previously classified documents. They revealed New Zealand's ongoing involvement in [[Western alliance]] espionage, and a threat by the United States to spy on New Zealand if it did not back down from its ban on nuclear ships.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/sst0106.htm | title=Lange's secret papers reveal USA's bully tactics | work=The Sunday Star Times | date=15 January 2006 | accessdate=12 June 2014 | author=Bain, Helen}}</ref> Archives New Zealand chief executive  Dianne Macaskill said the paper did not have the authority to access or print the report, and wrote to the paper revoking permission to publish it. In response, the ''Sunday Star Times'' said the information had already been released into the public arena and hence could not be retracted.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/652901/423466.xhtml | title=Star-Times may face action over report | work=Television New Zealand | date=24 January 2006 | accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref> The release of the document prompted a high-level inquiry to investigate how the top-secret report ended up in Lange's personal papers, in breach of security protocol.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10363868 | title=Inquiry into spying file found in Lange's papers | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=16 January 2006 | accessdate=12 June 2014 | author=Change, Derek}}</ref> A secret diplomatic cable released by [[Wikileaks]] in 2010 covers the accidental release of the document.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1012/S00175/wikileak-langes-last-laugh-1612006.htm | title=Wikileak: Lange's Last Laugh - 16/1/2006 | work=Scoop.co.nz | date=19 December 2010 | accessdate=12 June 2014 | author=Wikileaks}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1989 Lange announced in a brief press statement on 10 November that he was separating from his wife of 21 years. On 12 November Naomi Lange named his speech-writer, Margaret Pope as the other woman in a ''Sunday Times'' article, and said that she had been told by David five or six months ago that he planned to leave the marriage. Lange's mother Phoebe also publicly criticised him, but they later reconciled.{{sfn|Bassett|2008|p=525}} He had three children, Roy, Emily, and Byron ({{As of|2008|alt= now}} in their 30s) with his first wife (Naomi) and one daughter, Edith, with his second wife (Margaret). He married Margaret in Glasgow in January 1992 while holidaying in Britain.{{sfn|Bassett|2008|p=543}}

In the 1990s Lange's health declined, with [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and [[kidney]] disorders. In 2002, doctors diagnosed Lange as having [[amyloidosis]], a rare and incurable [[blood plasma]] disorder. He underwent extensive medical treatment for this condition. Although initially told he had only four months to live, Lange defied his doctors' expectations, and remained "optimistic" about his health. He entered hospital in Auckland in mid-July 2005 to undergo nightly peritoneal dialysis in his battle with end-stage kidney-failure. On 2 August, he had his lower right leg amputated without a general anaesthetic, as a result of diabetes complications.<ref>{{cite news | first = Julie | last = Middleton | title = I'd rather lose a leg than my life, says Lange | date = 2005-08-04 | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/david-lange-1942-2005/news/article.cfm?c_id=1500960&objectid=10339078 | newspaper=The New Zealand Herald | accessdate = 29 July 2010}}</ref>

His declining health resulted in the bringing-forward of the publication of his memoir ''My Life'' to 8 August 2005. [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] broadcast on ''[[Campbell Live]]'' on the same day an [http://www.publicaddress.net/default,2402.sm interview]; [[John Campbell (broadcaster)|John Campbell]] had interviewed him just before he went into hospital. In his last interview, given to the ''[[Herald on Sunday]]'' from his hospital bed, he made a potent intervention in New Zealand's [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005 election]] campaign by saying he "wanted to get out of bed and get a wheel-chair to Wellington" to stop any relaxation of his ban on nuclear ships.<ref>{{cite news | first = Jonathan | last = Milne | title = Ailing Lange still has strong voice on nukes | date = 31 July 2005 | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/david-lange-1942-2005/news/article.cfm?c_id=1500960&objectid=10338414 | newspaper=The New Zealand Herald | accessdate = 29 July 2010}}</ref>

In Bassett published a book in 2008 about the Lange government entitled ''Working With David: Inside the Lange Cabinet''. Lange's father Roy, a doctor and general practitioner at Otahuhu, delivered Bassett and Lange later said that:{{sfn|Lange|2005|p=98}}
:My father had delivered him (Bassett), and it became plain in later days that he must have dropped him.

'''''No Exit''''' ({{lang-fr|Huis Clos|links=no}}, {{IPA-fr|?i klo|pron}}) is a 1944 [[existentialism|existentialist]] French play by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. The original title is the French equivalent of the legal term ''[[wikt:in camera|in camera]]'', referring to a private discussion behind closed doors; English translations have also been performed under the titles  '''''In Camera''''', '''''No Way Out''''', '''''Vicious Circle''''', '''''Behind Closed Doors''''', and '''''Dead End'''''. The play was first performed at the [[Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier]] in May 1944.<ref>Wallace Fowlie, Dionysus in Paris (New York: Meridian Books, inc., 1960), page 173.</ref>

The play is a depiction of the [[afterlife]] in which three deceased characters are punished by being locked into a room together for eternity. It is the source of Sartre's especially famous and often misinterpreted quotation "L'enfer, c'est les autres" or "Hell is other people", a reference to Sartre's ideas about the [[Being and Nothingness#Part 3, Chapter 1: The look|Look]] and the perpetual [[ontology|ontological]] struggle of being caused to see oneself as an object in the world of another consciousness.<ref name="Arthur Danto">{{cite book |last=Danto |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Danto |year=1975 |title=Jean-Paul Sartre |chapter=Chapter 4: Shame, or, The Problem of Other Minds}}</ref>

==Plot synopsis==
Three damned souls, Joseph Garcin, Inès Serrano, and Estelle Rigault, are brought to the same room in Hell and locked inside by a mysterious valet. They had all expected torture devices to punish them for eternity, but instead find a plain room furnished in [[Second Empire architecture|the style of the Second French Empire]]. At first, none of them will admit the reason for their damnation: Garcin says that he was executed for being a pacifist, while Estelle insists that a mistake has been made; Inès, however, is the only one to demand that they all stop lying to themselves and confess to their moral crimes. She refuses to believe that they have all ended up in the room by accident and soon realizes that they have been placed together to make each other miserable; she deduces that they are to be one another's torturers. Garcin suggests that they try to leave each other alone and to be silent, but Inès starts to sing about an execution and Estelle vainly wants to find a mirror to check on her appearance. Inès tries to seduce Estelle by offering to be her "mirror" by telling her everything she sees, but ends up frightening her instead. It is soon clear that Inès is attracted to Estelle, Estelle is attracted to Garcin, and Garcin is in no mood for sexual behavior.

After arguing, they decide to confess to their crimes so they know what to expect from each other. Garcin cheated on and mistreated his wife; Inès seduced her cousin's wife while living with them; and Estelle had an affair and then killed the resulting child, prompting the child's father to commit suicide. Despite their revelations, they continue to get on each other's nerves. Garcin finally begins giving in to the lascivious Estelle's escalating attempts to seduce him, which drives Inès crazy. Garcin is constantly interrupted by his own thought, though, and begs Estelle to tell him he is not a coward for attempting to flee his country during wartime. While she complies, Inès tells him that Estelle is just feigning attraction to him so that she can be with a man—any man. This causes Garcin to abruptly attempt an escape. After trying to open the door repeatedly, it inexplicably and suddenly opens, but he is unable to bring himself to leave, and the others remain as well. He says that he will not be saved until he can convince Inès to trust in him. She refuses, saying that he is obviously a coward, and promising to make him miserable forever. Garcin concludes that rather than torture devices or physical punishment, "hell is other people." Estelle tries to persevere in her seduction of Garcin, but he says that he cannot make love while Inès is watching. Estelle, infuriated, picks up a paper knife and repeatedly stabs Inès. As they are all already dead, this attack does nothing and Inès even halfheartedly stabs herself, beginning to laugh. As Estelle comments on the idea of their being trapped here forever and laughs too, all three join in prolonged fit of laughter before Garcin finally concludes, "''Eh bien, continuons''" (roughly "Eh well, let's continue...").

==Characters==
'''Joseph Garcin''' – cowardice and callousness caused his young wife to die "of grief" after his execution. He is from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and deserted during an unspecified military conflict. He was unfaithful to his wife – he even recalls, without any sympathy, bringing home another woman one night, and his wife bringing them their morning coffee after hearing their engagement all night. Initially, he hates Inès because she understands his weakness, and wants Estelle because he feels that if she treats him as a man he will become manly. However, by the end of the play he understands that because Inès understands the meaning of cowardice and wickedness, only absolution at her hands can redeem him (if indeed redemption is possible).

'''Inès Serrano''' – Inès is the second character to enter the room. A lesbian [[postal clerk]], she turned a wife against her husband, twisting the wife's perception of her spouse and the subsequent murder of the man (who is Inès' cousin). Indeed, Inès seems to be the only character who understands the power of opinion, manipulating Estelle's and Garcin's opinions of themselves and of each other throughout the play. She is honest about the evil deeds she, Garcin, and Estelle have done. She frankly acknowledges the fact that she is a cruel person.

'''Estelle Rigault''' – Estelle is a high-society woman, a blonde who married an older man for his money and had an affair with a younger man. To her, the affair is merely an insignificant [[Casual relationship|fling]], but her lover becomes emotionally attached to her and she bears him a child. She drowns the child by throwing it into the lake, which drives her lover to commit suicide. Throughout the play she tries to get at Garcin, seeking to define herself as a woman in relation to a man. Her sins are deceit and murder (which also motivated a suicide). She lusts over "manly men", which Garcin himself strives to be.

'''Valet''' – The Valet enters the room with each character, but his only real dialogue is with Garcin. We learn little about him, except that his uncle is the head valet, and that he does not have any eyelids, which links to Garcin because Garcin's eyelids are [[atrophy|atrophied]].

==Critical reception==
The play was widely praised when it was first performed. Upon its 1946 American premiere at the [[Biltmore Theatre]], critic [[Stark Young]] described the play as "a phenomenon of the modern theatre – played all over the continent already," in [[The New Republic]] and wrote that "It should be seen whether you like it or not."<ref>Young, Stark. (9 December 1946). "Weaknesses". ''The New Republic'',  pp. 764.</ref>

A short parody by Meron Langsner entitled ''At the Hotel Huis Clos'' premiered at [[Brooklyn College]] at the [[Gi60 International One-Minute Play Festival]] on June 8, 2012.

In the show [[Futurama]] the Season 1 Finale is titled [[Hell Is Other Robots]] in which through committing various sins, [[Bender (Futurama)]] is sent to Robot Hell

===Influence===
The play's premise was inspiration for the 1961 ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Five Characters in Search of an Exit]]".<ref name="Zicree">{{cite book|title=The Twilight Zone Companion|last=Zicree|first=Marc Scott|year=1982|publisher=Sillman-James Press|page=234|edition=Second}}</ref>

David K. O'Hara's play ''The Upstairs Room'' (Methuen Drama 2012) presents itself as a 'postmodern riposte' to ''Huis Clos''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tucker|first=Matthew|title=The Upstairs Room (REVIEW): An Apocalyptic Vision Of London|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/11/20/the-upstairs-room-review_n_2167940.html|accessdate=7 December 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=21 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=O'Hara|first=David K|title=The Upstairs Room|year=2012|publisher=Methuen Drama|location=London|isbn=1472515102|pages=96|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Upstairs-Room-DK-OHara/dp/1472515102}}</ref> It premiered at the [[King's Head Theatre]], London in 2012.

The ending of the final episode of ''Seinfeld'' would seem to be inspired by this.

The Abaddon is a serialized webcomic by Koren Shadmi, loosely based on ''No Exit''.

[[Richard Linklater]]'s 2001 film adaptation of Stephen Belber's play, ''Tape'', seems to be heavily influenced by ''No Exit''.

''[[The Box (2009 film)|The Box]]'', a 2009 film starring [[Cameron Diaz]], references ''No Exit'' in several of its scenes.

''[[The Exterminating Angel (film)|The Exterminating Angel]]'' by [[Luis Buñuel]] includes the concept of people not capable of leaving a room.

'''''The Phantom of the Opera''''' is a musical with music by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and lyrics by [[Charles Hart (lyricist)|Charles Hart]] with additions from [[Richard Stilgoe]]. Lloyd Webber and Stilgoe also wrote the musical's book together.<ref name=License /> Based on the French novel ''[[The Phantom of the Opera|Le Fantôme de l'Opéra]]'' by [[Gaston Leroux]], its central plot revolves around a beautiful soprano, [[Christine Daaé]], who becomes the obsession of a mysterious, disfigured musical genius.

The musical opened in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1986, and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1988. It won the 1986 [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Award]] and the 1988 [[Tony Award]] for Best Musical, and [[Michael Crawford]] (in the title role) won the Olivier and Tony Awards for Best Actor in a Musical.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thephantomoftheopera.com/the_show/awards.php |title= The Phantom of the Opera – The Show – Awards}}</ref> It is the [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|longest running show in Broadway history]] by a wide margin, and celebrated its 10,000th Broadway performance on 11 February 2012, the first production ever to do so.<ref>Gerald Martin Bordman (2004).

==Development==

===Idea===
In 1984 Lloyd Webber contacted [[Cameron Mackintosh]], the co-producer of ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' and ''[[Song and Dance]]'', to propose a new musical. He was aiming for a romantic piece, and suggested Gaston Leroux's book ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' as a basis. They screened both the [[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|1925 Lon Chaney]] and the [[The Phantom of the Opera (1943 film)|1943 Claude Rains]] motion picture versions, but neither saw an effective way to make the leap from film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical:{{quote|"I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realized that the reason I was hung up was because I was trying to write a major romantic story, and I had been trying to do that ever since I started my career. Then with the Phantom, it was there!"<ref name=YRE>Andrew Lloyd Webber, Martin Knowlden [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ji8NRDmL5LMC&pg=PA25 ''The Phantom of the Opera Companion''] Pavilion, 2007</ref>}}

===Lyricists===
Lloyd Webber first approached [[Jim Steinman]] to write the lyrics because of his "dark obsessive side", but he declined in order to fulfill his commitments on a [[Bonnie Tyler]] album.<ref>{{cite news |first=Spencer |last=Bright |title=Jim'll Fix It |work=Sunday Times |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/lontimes.htm |date=8 December 1996 |accessdate=9 July 2007}}</ref> [[Alan Jay Lerner]] was then recruited, but he became seriously ill after joining the project and was forced to withdraw; none of his contributions (mostly involving the song "Masquerade") are credited in the show.<!---References below moved from lead -RoyGoldsmith, 4/22/12---><ref>Citron, Stephen.

The Complete Book of Les Misérables (1993),Arcade Publishing, ISBN 1-55970-156-0, p. 62</ref> [[Richard Stilgoe]], the lyricist for ''[[Starlight Express]]'', wrote most of the original lyrics for the production.  [[Charles Hart (lyricist)|Charles Hart]], a young and then-relatively unknown lyricist, later rewrote many of the lyrics, along with original lyrics for "Think of Me". Some of Stilgoe's original contributions are still present in the final version, however.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Behind the Mask'' documentary, on the [[2004 in film|2004 film]] DVD</ref>

===Score===
Inspired in part by an [[Phantom of the Opera (1976 musical)|earlier musical version]] of the same story by [[Ken Hill (playwright)|Ken Hill]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=You need program to keep `Phantom' productions straight|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1990_747877|work=Houston Chronicle|date=2 December 1990|author=Evans, Everett}}</ref> Lloyd Webber's score is sometimes operatic in style but maintains the form and structure of a musical throughout. The full-fledged operatic passages are reserved principally for subsidiary characters such as Andre and Firmin, Carlotta, and Piangi.  They are also used to provide the content of the fictional "operas" that are taking place within the show itself, viz., ''Hannibal'', ''Il Muto'', and the Phantom's masterwork, ''Don Juan Triumphant''. "Here, Lloyd Webber pastiched various styles from the grand operas of [[Meyerbeer]] through to [[Mozart]] and even [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]."<ref>Coveney, M. Cats on a Chandelier: The Andrew Lloyd Webber Story. New York, Hutchinson (1999).  pp. 200-206. ISBN 978-0091801700</ref> These pieces are often presented as musical fragments, interrupted by dialogue or action sequences in order to clearly define the musical's "show within a show" format. The musical extracts from the Phantom's opera, "Don Juan Triumphant", during the latter stages of the show, are dissonant and modern—"suggesting, perhaps, that the Phantom is ahead of his time artistically".<ref>Snelson, J. Andrew Lloyd Webber (Yale Broadway Masters Series). New Haven, Yale University Press (2009), p. 88. ISBN 978-0300151138</ref>

===Design, direction, and choreography===
[[Maria Björnson]] designed the sets and over 200 costumes, including the elaborate gowns in the "Masquerade" sequence.  Her set designs, including the chandelier, subterranean gondola, and sweeping staircase, earned her multiple awards.<ref>Maria Bjornson Dies; Theatre Production Designer was 53 (16 December 2002).

===First preview at Sydmonton===
A preview of the first act was staged at Sydmonton (Lloyd Webber's home) in 1985, starring Colm Wilkinson (later the star of the Toronto production) as the Phantom, [[Sarah Brightman]] as Kristin (later Christine) and Clive Carter (later a member of the London cast) as Raoul. This very preliminary production used Richard Stilgoe's original unaltered lyrics, and many songs sported names that were later changed, such as "What Has Time Done to Me" ("Think of Me"), and "Papers" ("Notes"). The Phantom's original mask covered the entire face and remained in place throughout the performance, obscuring the actor's vision and muffling his voice. Björnson designed the now-iconic half-mask to replace it, and the unmasking sequence was added.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Clips of this preview performance were included on the DVD of the 2004 film production.<ref>Phantom of the Opera DVD (2004 film).

Lot 666 is a shattered chandelier that, the auctioneer explains, has a connection to "the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera, a mystery never fully explained".  As the chandelier is uncovered, its lamps flicker to life and it magically rises over the audience to its original position in the rafters. As it ascends, the years roll back and the Opéra returns to its 1880s grandeur.  ("Overture")

===Act I===
It is now 1881.<ref name=phanlasvegas>[http://www.phantomlasvegas.com/index.php?page=/the_show_musical_numbers.php ''Phantom Las Vegas'': Musical Numbers]</ref> As Carlotta, the Opéra's resident soprano [[prima donna]], rehearses for that evening's performance, a backdrop collapses without warning. "The Phantom! He's here!" the anxious cast members whisper.  The Opera's new owners, Firmin and André, try to downplay the incident, but Carlotta refuses to continue and storms offstage. Madame Giry, the Opéra's ballet mistress, tells Firmin and André that [[Christine Daaé]], a Swedish chorus girl and orphaned daughter of a prominent violinist, has been "well taught" and could sing Carlotta's role. With cancellation of the performance their only alternative, the owners reluctantly audition Christine, and to their surprise she is equal to the challenge. ("Think of Me")
[[Image:PhantomoftheOpera-BoatScene.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman performing the title song]]

Backstage after her triumphant début, Christine confesses to her best friend Meg (Madame Giry's daughter) that she knows her mysterious teacher only as an invisible "Angel of Music" ("Angel of Music"). The Opera's new patron, Raoul, the Vicomte de Chagny, finds Christine, his old childhood playmate, in her dressing room. ("Little Lotte") Christine reminisces with Raoul about the "Angel of Music" stories that her late father used to tell them and confides that the Angel has visited her and taught her to sing. Raoul laughs at her "fantasies" and invites her to dinner. He exits and a jealous Phantom appears in Christine's mirror in the guise of The Angel of Music. ("The Mirror/Angel of Music (Reprise)") Christine begs him to reveal himself and The Phantom obliges, then guides her into a ghostly underground realm. ("[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]]")  They cross a subterranean lake to his secret lair beneath the opéra house. The Phantom explains that he has chosen Christine to sing his music and enchants her with his own sublime voice. ("[[The Music of the Night]]")  Christine sees a mannequin resembling herself in a wedding dress, and when the mannequin suddenly moves, she faints. The Phantom picks her up and places her gently on a bed.

As the Phantom composes music at his organ, Christine awakens to the sound of the monkey music box. ("I Remember…") She slips behind the Phantom, lifts his mask, and beholds his real face. The Phantom rails at her curiosity, then ruefully expresses his longing to look normal—and to be loved by her. ("Stranger Than You Dreamt It")   

Meanwhile, inside the opéra house, [[Joseph Buquet]], the Opéra's chief stagehand—who, like Madame Giry, inexplicably knows much about the Phantom—regales everyone with tales of the "Opéra Ghost" and his terrible [[Punjab lasso]]. ("Magical Lasso")  Madame Giry warns Buquet to exercise restraint. In the managers' office, Madame Giry delivers a note from the Phantom: He demands that Christine replace Carlotta in the new opera, ''[[Il Muto]]'', or there will be a terrible disaster "beyond imagination". ("Notes…") Firmin and André assure the enraged Carlotta that she will remain the star, ("Prima Donna") but during her performance, ("Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh") the Phantom reduces her voice to a frog-like croak. A ballet interlude begins, to keep the audience entertained—but a series of menacing shadows can be seen on the backdrop.  Suddenly the corpse of Buquet, hanging from the Punjab lasso, drops from the rafters. Firmin and André plead for calm as the Phantom's diabolical laughter is heard.

In the ensuing mêlée, Christine escapes with Raoul to the roof, where she tells him about her subterranean rendezvous with the Phantom.  Raoul is skeptical, ("Why Have You Brought Me Here?/Raoul, I've Been There") but swears to love and to protect her always. ("[[All I Ask of You]]") The Phantom, who has overheard their conversation, is heartbroken.  As he angrily vows revenge against Raoul, ("All I Ask of You (Reprise)") the Opéra's mighty chandelier crashes to the stage as the curtain falls.

===Act II===
[[Image:PotOFinalScene.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Steve Barton and Sarah Brightman in the final scene]]
Six months later, in the midst of the gala [[masquerade ball]], the Phantom, costumed as the [[The Masque of the Red Death|Red Death]], makes his first appearance since the chandelier disaster. ("[[Masquerade (The Phantom of the Opera song)|Masquerade]]/Why So Silent?") He announces to the stunned guests that he has written an opera entitled ''[[Don Juan Triumphant]]''. He demands that it be produced immediately, with Christine (who is now engaged to Raoul) in the lead role, and warns of dire consequences if it is not. He seizes Christine's engagement ring and vanishes in a flash of fire and smoke. Raoul demands that Madame Giry tell him about the Phantom. She reluctantly replies that he is a brilliant musician and magician born with a terrifyingly deformed face, who escaped from captivity in a traveling freak show and disappeared.

During rehearsals, Raoul hatches a plan to use ''Don Juan Triumphant'' as a trap to capture the Phantom, knowing the Phantom will be sure to attend its première. ("Notes/Twisted Every Way")  Christine, torn between her love for Raoul and her gratitude for the Phantom's teaching, visits her father's grave, longing for his guidance. ("Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again") The Phantom appears, again under the guise of the Angel of Music. ("Wandering Child") Christine nearly falls under his spell, but Raoul arrives to rescue her. The Phantom taunts Raoul, launching fiery missiles at him, ("Bravo Monsieur") until Christine begs Raoul to leave with her. Furious, the Phantom sets fire to the cemetery.

''Don Juan Triumphant'' opens with Christine and Ubaldo Piangi, the Opéra's principal tenor, singing the lead roles. ("Don Juan") During their duet, Christine suddenly realizes that she is singing not with Piangi, but with the Phantom himself. ("The Point of No Return") He expresses his love for her and gives her his ring, but Christine rips off his mask, exposing his deformed face to the shocked audience. As Piangi is found strangled to death backstage, the Phantom seizes Christine and flees the theatre.  An angry mob led by Meg searches the theatre for the Phantom, while Madame Giry directs Raoul to the Phantom's subterranean lair, and warns him to beware his Punjab lasso.

In the lair Christine is forced to don the doll's wedding dress. ("Down Once More/Track Down This Murderer") Raoul arrives, but the Phantom captures him with his lasso. He tells Christine that he will free Raoul if she agrees to stay with him forever; if she refuses, Raoul will die. ("Final Lair") Christine tells the Phantom that it is his soul that is deformed, not his face, and kisses him. The Phantom, having experienced kindness and compassion for the first time, sets them both free. Christine returns the Phantom's ring to him, and he tells her he loves her. She cries, forces herself to turn away, and exits with Raoul. The Phantom, weeping, huddles on his throne and covers himself with his cape. The mob storms the lair and Meg pulls away the cape—but the Phantom has vanished; only his mask remains.<ref name="complete">{{cite news | first=George | last=Perry | title=The Complete Phantom of the Opera | publisher=Owl Books, 1991, ISBN 0-8050-1722-4 }}</ref>

'''Sir Robert David "Rob" Muldoon''', {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George|GCMG]], [[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]]}} (25 September 1921{{spaced ndash}}5 August 1992), served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|31st]] [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]] from 1975 to 1984, as leader of the governing [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]].  Muldoon had been a prominent member of the National party and MP for the Tamaki electorate for some years prior to becoming leader of the party. During his time as a member of parliament and as Prime Minister, Muldoon was responsible for a number of major changes to the New Zealand economy, including the introduction of decimal currency and the [[Think Big]] policies of the third National Government. Despite being a polarising figure during his time as Prime Minister, Muldoon's impact on New Zealand society faded after his retirement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Youth==
Robert David Muldoon was born to parents Jim and Amie Muldoon in [[Auckland]] in 1921.

At age five Muldoon slipped while playing on the front gate, damaging his cheek and resulting in a distinctive scar.{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=?}} At age eight, Muldoon's father was admitted to hospital, where he died nearly 20 years later.{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|pp=20–21}} This left Muldoon's mother to raise him on her own. During this time Muldoon came under the strong formative influence of his fiercely intelligent, iron-willed maternal grandmother, Jerusha, a committed socialist. Though Muldoon never accepted her creed, he did develop under her influence a potent ambition, a consuming interest in politics, and an abiding respect for New Zealand's [[welfare state]]. A brilliant student at school, Muldoon won a scholarship to attend [[Mount Albert Grammar School]]{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=?}} from 1933 to 1936. He left school at age 15, finding work at [[Fletcher Construction]] as an arrears clerk.{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=?}}

Muldoon joined the [[New Zealand Army]] in November 1940 during the Second World War, and served in the South Pacific and in Italy. While in Italy he served in the same battalion (Divisional Cavalry) as two other future National Party colleagues, [[Duncan MacIntyre (New Zealand politician)|Duncan MacIntyre]] and [[Jack Marshall]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} He completed his training as an accountant, sitting his final exams to become an accountant while in Italy. He returned to New Zealand after the war as the country's first fully qualified [[Cost accounting|cost accountant]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In March 1947 Muldoon joined a newly founded branch of the [[New Zealand Young Nationals|Junior Nationals]], the youth wing of the conservative [[New Zealand National Party]]. He quickly became active in the party, making two sacrificial-lamb bids for Parliament against entrenched but vulnerable [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] incumbents in [[New Zealand general election, 1954|1954]] ([[Mount Albert (New Zealand electorate)|Mount Albert]]) and [[New Zealand general election, 1957|1957]] ([[Waitemata (New Zealand electorate)|Waitemata]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} But in [[New Zealand general election, 1960|1960]] he won election as MP for the suburban Auckland electorate of [[T?maki (New Zealand electorate)|Tamaki]], winning against [[Bob Tizard]], who had taken the former National seat in 1957. In [[New Zealand general election, 1960|1960]], an electoral swing brought [[Keith Holyoake]] to power as Prime Minister of the [[Second National Government of New Zealand|Second National Government]]. Muldoon would represent the Tamaki constituency for the next 32 years.

===Entry into Cabinet===
Muldoon displayed a flair for debate and a diligence in his backbench work, and in 1963 he became Under-Secretary to the [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]], [[Harry Lake]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} While holding this office, he took responsibility for the successful introduction of [[decimal currency]] into New Zealand in July 1967.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Minister of Finance===
[[File:McCready Muldoon Shaw 1969.jpg|thumb|Muldoon (centre) as Minister of Finance, 26 June 1969. With him are [[Allan McCready]] MP and A J Shaw.]]
When Lake died in 1967, Muldoon seemed the natural (and only obvious) choice to replace him; at 45, he became the youngest Minister of Finance since the 1890s. However, because Holyoake saw Muldoon as too arrogant and ambitious for his own good{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}, he ranked him only eighth in Cabinet. Traditionally Ministers of Finance rank second or third in seniority lists within Westminster-style Cabinets, although his predecessor [[Harry Lake]] was ranked at sixth because of his short service in Parliament.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Muldoon opposed both abortion and capital punishment. In 1961 he was one of ten National MPs to cross the floor and vote with the Opposition to remove [[Capital punishment in New Zealand|capital punishment]] for murder from the Crimes Bill that the [[Second National Government of New Zealand|Second National Government]] had introduced. Later, in 1977, he voted against abortion when the issue also came up as a conscience vote.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

From his early years as a Member of Parliament, Muldoon became known as ''Piggy''; the [[wiktionary:en:epithet|epithet]] that would remain with him throughout his life even amongst those who were his supporters. Muldoon himself seemed to relish his controversial public profile and later claimed{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} that he thought that satirical critics were not hard enough on him.

Muldoon established a considerable national profile rapidly; many historians{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} credit his image, rather than that of the Prime Minister, Holyoake, or of his deputy, [[Jack Marshall]], for the National Party's surprise victory in the [[New Zealand general election, 1969|1969 election]]. He also displayed a flair –  lacking in his senior colleagues – for the newly introduced medium of television;<ref>
Television broadcasts in New Zealand started in 1960.
</ref> commentators still consider him one of New Zealand's most artful practitioners of [[media manipulation]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Deputy Prime Minister===
When Holyoake stood down in 1971, Muldoon challenged Marshall for the top job; he lost by a narrow margin, but won unanimous election as deputy leader of the National Party and hence [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]].

==Leader of the Opposition==
Marshall fought the [[New Zealand general election, 1972|1972 election]] on a slogan of "Man For Man, The Strongest Team" – an allusion to Marshall's own low-key style, particularly compared to his deputy. Muldoon commented on Labour's election promises with "They can’t promise anything because I’ve spent it all".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/2430AC6B-8B63-4AB9-A0C2-7CF38DD8E5BB/89283/47HansD_20040522.pdf|page=13131 |title=Questions for Oral Answer |date=20 May 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0507/S00170.htm |publisher= [[Scoop (website)|Scoop]] |title=Brian Easton: The State Of The Nation |first=Brian |last=Easton |date=12 July 2005 |accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> The party lost control of the House, ending 12 years in [[political power|power]].  Many members of the party caucus regarded Marshall as not up to the task of taking on the formidable [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] Prime Minister, [[Norman Kirk]].  Partly due to this, Marshall resigned, and Muldoon took over, becoming [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] on 4 July 1974. 

Muldoon relished the opportunity to match up against Kirk – but had it for only a short time, until Kirk's sudden death on 31 August 1974.  In the [[New Zealand general election, 1975|1975 election]], Muldoon ran on a platform of "New Zealand – The Way You Want It", promising a generous [[Social security|national superannuation]] scheme to replace Kirk and Rowling's employer-contribution superannuation scheme (which the famous [[Dancing Cossacks advertisement|"Dancing Cossack" television advertisement]] implied would turn New Zealand into a communist state), and undertaking to fix New Zealand's "shattered economy".  He overwhelmed Kirk's more lacklustre successor, [[Wallace Rowling|Bill Rowling]], reversing the 32–55 Labour majority into a 55–32 National majority.Economics correspondent [[Brian Gaynor]] has claimed that Muldoon's policy of reversing Labour's saving-scheme cost him a chance to transform the New Zealand economy.<ref name="gaynor_super">

Labour responded with a campaign called [[Citizens for Rowling]], described by Muldoon as "not even a thinly disguised" attack on himself.{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=?}}

==Prime Minister==
{{Main|Third National Government of New Zealand}}

Muldoon had remained National's Finance spokesman when he became party leader, and as a result became Minister of Finance as well as Prime Minister—thus concentrating enormous power in his hands.  He is the last to hold both posts {{As of|2012|alt= to date}}. He had a reputation as combative, and many people in political positions and the media feared openly confronting him.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}
[[File:Robert Muldoon 1977.jpg|thumb|Muldoon during a visit to the US in 1977]]
Muldoon led National to victory in [[New Zealand general election, 1978|1978]] and [[New Zealand general election, 1981|1981]]; however, in both elections, the Labour opposition received more popular votes across the country as a whole. This ambiguous mandate did not dilute Muldoon's agenda, and he became more emphatic and autocratic as his time in power continued.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The "Muldoon Years" featured Muldoon's obstinate and resourceful attempts to maintain New Zealand's "cradle to the grave" [[welfare state]], dating from 1935, in the face of a changing world.  The country's economy suffered  the aftermath of the [[1973 energy crisis]], the loss of New Zealand's biggest export market upon Britain's entry to the [[European Economic Community]], and rampant inflation.

Concerned about the use of [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] during the 1970s' oil crises, Muldoon supported a scheme whereby  natural gas or a dual-fuel gas–petrol system could power cars. Muldoon's 1979 budget introduced incentives to encourage the conversions, and New Zealand emerged as possibly the first country to have [[dual-fuel cars]] as a commonplace sight. However, the projection that oil prices would become ever-higher did not happen during this period.

In 1980 an abortive attempt, known as the Colonels' Coup, took place to replace Muldoon with his more economically liberal deputy, [[Brian Talboys]]. However, Talboys proved a somewhat reluctant draftee, and Muldoon saw the plotters off with relative ease. No other serious challenge to Muldoon's authority occurred in his years as Prime Minister.

On 8 January 1977 when he was at [[Piha]] Beach for the re-opening of the [[Piha Surf Life Saving Club]] club-house after the Project 40 rebuild, he joined the [[Auckland Rescue Helicopter Trust|Auckland Rescue Helicopter]] lifeguards jumping into the surf from the helicopter. He was lifted out of the water and transported back to the beach slung under the helicopter using the rescue strop connected into the cargo hook.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piha.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Short-surf-club-history1.pdf|title=Piha Surf Life Saving Club – Guardians of the Iron Sands|accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref>

Muldoon became an [[Order of the Companions of Honour|Additional Member of the Companion of Honour]] in the [[1977 Birthday Honours|1977 Silver Jubilee and Queen's Birthday Honours]],<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/47237/supplements/7127 ''London Gazette'' (supplement), No. 47237, 10 June 1977].

===Think Big===
{{Unreferenced section|date= August 2014}}
{{Main|Think Big}}
As economic pressures continued to build, Muldoon tried to control spiralling wages through a trade-off with the [[trade union|trade-union]] leadership: a reduction in the tax rate against an agreement not to press for further rounds of wage increases. When this strategy proved unsuccessful, as a last resort, Muldoon imposed a total freeze on wages, prices, interest rates and dividends across the country, against a "sweetener" of a tax cut which cost the New Zealand treasury approximately a billion New Zealand dollars and held the country in that state against the hope that his "Think Big" strategy, in which the government borrowed heavily and pumped the funds into large-scale industrial projects, would create trickle-down benefits in the form of jobs and revenue.

That never happened: most of the Think Big projects yielded minimal profit while Muldoon was still Prime Minister and many were hampered by industrial disputes. With a fiscal deficit and with a billion dollars not now coming into treasury coffers, Muldoon was also obliged to borrow to fund the welfare state and New Zealand's agricultural subsidies. Ultimately the Wage and Price Freeze, which had been intended only to last for a year, remained in force for nearly two years. Years later, Muldoon admitted that the freeze was a political mistake.

===The Dawn Raids===
Robert Muldoon continued his Labour predecessor Prime Minister [[Norman Kirk]]'s policy of arresting and deporting [[Pacific Islander]] overstayers which had begun in 1974.{{sfn|Anae|2012|pp=227-230}} Since the 1950s, the New Zealand government had encouraged substantial emigration from several Pacific countries including [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], and [[Fiji]] to fill a labour shortage caused by the post–war economic boom. Consequently, the Pacific Islander population in New Zealand had grown to 45,413 by 1971, with a substantial number overstaying their visas.<ref>{{Citation | last1  = Parker | first1 = John | last2  =  | first2 =  | last3  =  | first3 =  | lastauthoramp = yes | title     = Frontier of Dreams: The Story of New Zealand&mdash;Into the 21st Century, 1946-2005 | publisher = TVNZ and Scholastic | place   = Auckland| volume  = | edition =  | year    = 2005  | pages =28–29, 64–65}}</ref> During the late 1960s and early 1970s, New Zealand's economy had declined due to several international developments: a decline in international wool prices in 1966, Britain joining the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973 which deprived NZ of a major market for dairy products, and the [[1973 oil crisis]]. This economic downturn led to increased crime, unemployment and other social ailments, which disproportionately affected the Pacific Islander community.<ref>John Parker, 64-65</ref>

In July 1974, Muldoon as opposition leader had promised to cut immigration and to "get tough" on law and order issues. He criticized the Labour government's immigration policies for contributing to the economic recession and a housing shortage which undermined the New Zealand "way of life." During the 1975 general elections, the National Party had also played a controversial electoral advertisement that was later criticized for stoking negative racial sentiments about Polynesian migrants.<ref name="National Party advertisment">{{cite AV media |people=|year=1975 |title=''National Party advertisement''|trans_title= |medium= |language= |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/video/2158/national-party-advertisement |accessdate= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= documentary |time= |publisher=TVNZ Television New Zealand, Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |location= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> Muldoon's  government accelerated the Kirk government's police raids against Pacific overstayers. These operations involved special police squads conducting dawn raids on the homes of overstayers throughout New Zealand. Overstayers and their families were often deported back to their countries.<ref name="Dawn Raids">{{cite AV media |people=Damon Fepulea'I, Rachel Jean, Tarx Morrison |year=2005 |title=''Dawn Raids'' |trans_title= |medium= |language= |url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/dawn-raids-2005 |accessdate= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= documentary |time= |publisher=TVNZ, Isola Publications |location= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref>{{sfn|Anae|2012|pp=230-233}}

The Dawn Raids were widely condemned by different sections of New Zealand society including the Pacific Islander and [[M?ori people|M?ori]] communities, church groups, employers and workers' unions, anti-racist groups, and the opposition Labour Party. The raids were also criticized by elements of the [[New Zealand Police]] and the ruling National Party for damaging race relations with the Pacific Island community.{{sfn|Anae|2012|pp=234-236}} Critics also alleged that the Dawn Raids unfairly targeted Pacific Islanders since Pacific Islanders only comprised one-third of the overstayers but made up 86% of those arrested and prosecuted for overstaying. The majority of overstayers were from [[Great Britain]], [[Australia]], and [[South Africa]].<ref name="Dawn Raids">''Dawn Raids'' documentary</ref> The Muldoon government's treatment of overstayers also damaged relations with Pacific countries like Samoa and Tonga, and generated criticism from the South Pacific Forum. By 1979, the Muldoon government terminated the Dawn Raids since the deporation of illegal Pacific overstayers had failed to alleviate the ailing New Zealand economy.<ref name="Dawn Raids" />

===Communism and the Soviet Union===
As with other conservative governments during the [[Cold War]], Muldoon adopted an anti-Soviet stance. As a long-time National Party activist, Muldoon rejected [[Communism]] as an 'alien' collectivist philosophy. During the television programme ''Gallery'' in the later 1960s, he also criticised left-leaning clergymen who had criticised [[apartheid in South Africa]] for failing to oppose Soviet communism. Muldoon was also critical of Communist influence in New Zealand's trade union movement.{{sfn|Wilson|2004|pp=85-87}} He also viewed the [[Moscow]]-aligned [[Socialist Unity Party of New Zealand|Socialist Unity Party]] (SUP), a break-away faction from the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]], as a Soviet fifth column that was trying to subvert New Zealand and the South Pacific island states. In various speeches and press releases, he would accuse the SUP and other Communist groups of instigating strikes, and organising protests against US naval visits and New Zealand's sporting contacts with South Africa.{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=27}}

As Prime Minister, he accepted both the American and Chinese views that the [[Soviet Union]] was an aggressive power with hegemonic ambitions in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=27}} Muldoon would also join the United States [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] and other Western leaders in condemning the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in 1979 and boycotting the [[1980 Summer Olympics]]. However, his government did not participate in the US-led trade boycott against the Soviet Union since it would hurt New Zealand's predominantly agricultural export economy. In 1980, the National government also expelled the Soviet Ambassador, Vsevolod Sofinski, for handing money over to the SUP. Despite his antagonism towards the Soviet Union and domestic Communist movements, Muldoon's government still maintained economic relations with the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Wilson|2004|pp=106-129}}

===Arthur Allan Thomas===
{{main|Arthur Allan Thomas}}
After [[David Yallop]] drew Muldoon's attention to the case of Arthur Allan Thomas, twice convicted for the murders of farming couple [[Harvey and Jeannette Crewe]], Muldoon asked Robert Adams-Smith, a [[List of King's and Queen's Counsel in New Zealand|QC]], to review the case. Adams-Smith reported 'an injustice may have been done', and Muldoon pushed through a royal pardon for Thomas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/page/arthur-allan-thomas-convicted-crewe-murders-second-time|title=Arthur Allan Thomas convicted of Crewe murders for a second time|publisher=History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref>  A subsequent Royal Commission of Inquiry exonerated the pardon and recommended Thomas be paid $950,000 as compensation for the time he served.<ref>{{citation |url=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/r.christie/thomas_royal_commission_1980.pdf |title=Report of the Royal Commission to Inquire into the Circumstances of the Convictions of Arthur Allan Thomas for the Murders of David Harvey Crewe and Jeanette Lenore Crewe, 1980 |page=120 |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref>

===Springbok tour of 1981===
{{Main|1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand}}

Professing a belief that politics should not interfere with sport, Muldoon resisted pressure to bar the 1981 Springbok Tour by the [[Springboks]], the national [[rugby football|rugby]] squad of ''[[apartheid]]''-era South Africa. By allowing "the Tour", Muldoon was accused of breaking the 1977 [[Gleneagles Agreement]] (to form a common policy on sporting with South Africa amongst the Commonwealth, signed after the boycott of the Montreal Olympics in 1976). Muldoon noted, however, that the Gleneagles Agreement had been amended and, in an article in ''[[The Times]]'', that he had not broken the Gleneagles Agreement because "New Zealand and subsequently other countries made it clear that they could not subscribe to an agreement which required them to abrogate the freedoms of their sportsmen and prohibit sporting contacts".<ref name="muldoon_robert">

 |title=Robert Muldoon: Why My Small Country is Now Being Rent Asunder}}</ref>  "The Tour", as it has become known, provoked massive public demonstrations, the formation of public pressure group [[Halt All Racist Tours]] (HART) and some of the worst social schisms New Zealand has ever seen. Muldoon came down firmly on the pro-Tour side, arguing that sport and politics should be kept separate. He argued that his refusal to ban the Springboks was anti-authoritarian, leaving it up to individual consciences whether to play sports with representatives of [[apartheid]]. He also argued that allowing their rugby team to tour did not mean supporting apartheid any more than playing a [[Soviet Union]] team meant supporting Communism.  Despite the turmoil over "The Tour" created within New Zealand, Muldoon's [[New Zealand National Party]] won the subsequent election held later that year.

===Falklands War===
In 1982, Muldoon's government supported the British in the [[Falklands War]]. While New Zealand did not directly participate in the conflict, Muldoon undertook to send the frigates [[HMNZS Canterbury (F-421)|HMNZS ''Canterbury'']] and [[HMNZS Waikato (F-55)|HMNZS ''Waikato'']] to the Indian Ocean to relieve Royal Navy frigates, so that they could in their turn deploy in the conflict. New Zealand also broke off its diplomatic relations with Argentina. In defence of his support for the war, Muldoon wrote an article that was published in ''[[The Times]]'', entitled "Why we Stand by our Mother Country":

<blockquote>We are a free and independent nation but in time of trouble we stand with our mother country...New Zealand's decision to break off diplomatic relations with Argentina over the Falklands, immediately after Britain had done so, was not because of Britain's support on the sporting issue. The reason goes much deeper than that. It is in the context of the statement made by a Labour Prime Minister of New Zealand in 1939: “Where Britain goes, we go.” We see the Falklands as British territory and the Falklands Islanders as subjects of our Queen. We live at the end of the line and we know the feeling of isolation...With the Falklands Islands, it is family. Historically, Britain has so often on great occasions thrown up the leader that the occasion demanded. I regard Margaret Thatcher as one of the finest and straightest politicians I have ever met...In 1939 we learned the folly of appeasement. A great catastrophe was the price that was paid. The military rulers of Argentina must not be appeased. New Zealand will back Britain all the way.<ref>Robert Muldoon, ‘Why we stand with our mother country’, ''The Times'' (20 May 1982), p. 14.</ref></blockquote>

According to British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], Muldoon said of his stance towards the Falklands: "With the Falkland Islanders it is family"<ref>[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=104948 Margaret Thatcher, "Speech to Conservative Women’s Conference", 26 May 1982]</ref> and that he had reminded her: "Don't forget. In New Zealand, we are still a member of the same family."<ref>[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=104942 Margaret Thatcher, "House of Commons PQs", 20 May 1982]</ref>

===Boat and Caravan Tax===
Muldoon attempted to increase tax revenue by levying a 20% tax on the construction and purchasing of boats and caravans.  However, the immediate result of this tax was the decimation of both industries as potential buyers could not afford to pay the tax on top of the construction costs, and had the additional effect of adding to the numbers of unemployed as boat and caravan builders could not pay their employees because of the order cancellations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/news/10344516/Vantastic-explores-NZ-caravan-history|title=Vantastic explores NZ caravan history|first=Geoff|last=Lewis|date=4 August 2014|publisher=Fairfax New Zealand}}</ref>  Despite the clear evidence that this tax was costing money and jobs, Muldoon refused to revoke it on the grounds that doing so would be an admission of failure.  This tax was not repealed until the first budget of the newly elected Labour Government in 1984.  A popular bumper sticker seen on cars read "I'd rather Be sailing, but I voted National".

===Closer Economic Relations===
Muldoon initiated a [[Closer Economic Relations]] (CER) free-trade programme with Australia to liberalise trade, which came into effect from New Year's Day 1982. The aim of total free trade between the two countries was achieved in 1990, five years ahead of schedule.

===Nuclear ships policy and the snap election of 1984===
Ultimately, the end of Muldoon's government came following a late-night clash with National backbencher [[Marilyn Waring]] over highly contentious Opposition-sponsored [[Nuclear proliferation|nuclear-free New Zealand]] legislation, in which Waring told him she would [[Crossing the floor|cross the floor]] (giving the Opposition a victory). On 14 June 1984, a visibly drunk{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=375}} Muldoon called a [[New Zealand general election, 1984|snap election]] for 14 July that same year; historians noted the unfortunate coincidence with [[Bastille Day]].<ref name=nzhistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/people/robert-muldoon |title=Robert Muldoon |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate=22 November 2010 }}</ref> A journalist commented that a month-long campaign was too short.  Muldoon replied "It doesn't give my opponents much time". He was heavily defeated by [[David Lange]]'s resurgent Labour Party, which won 56 seats to National's 37 with massive [[vote splitting]] caused by the [[New Zealand Party]] in particular. Muldoon's drunkenness when announcing the election date led to it being known as the schnapps election.<ref name=nzhistory/>

It is a strong convention in New Zealand politics that a prime minister does not [[dropping the writ|ask for an early election]] unless he or she cannot govern, or unless they need to seek the electorate's endorsement on a matter of national importance (as was the case in [[New Zealand general election, 1951|1951]]). Muldoon justified the snap election because he felt Waring's revolt impeded his ability to govern. Indeed, it was obvious that Muldoon was finding it hard to pass financial measures with [[neo-liberal]] rebels like [[Ruth Richardson]] and [[Derek Quigley]] voting against the Government on certain issues.{{sfn|Bohan|2004|p=95}} However, Waring said that she would not have denied Muldoon confidence or [[Loss of Supply|supply]].  This has led historians to question Muldoon's excuse for calling a snap election, since he still would have had the constitutional means to govern.

===Foreign exchange and constitutional crises===
{{Main|New Zealand constitutional crisis, 1984}}
{{Unreferenced section|date= August 2014}}
A final controversy occurred during the course of the election and transfer of government: during early 1984 [[Roderick Deane]], then Deputy Governor of the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]], became concerned that the [[New Zealand dollar]] (which had a fixed exchange-rate to the US Dollar) had become significantly overvalued and was vulnerable to currency speculation on the financial markets in the event of a "significant political event". This was exacerbated by media speculation following a leak that an incoming Labour administration would be likely to significantly devalue the NZ dollar upon election. The Reserve Bank counselled Muldoon that the dollar should be devalued. Muldoon ignored the advice, owing to his belief that it would hurt poor New Zealanders in the medium term, and in June 1984 announced the snap election mentioned above which, as predicted, caused an immediate run on the dollar.

Following the election the controversy became a [[constitutional crisis]]: Muldoon refused to do as the incoming government instructed, causing the currency crisis to worsen. Eventually he relented however, after his position as leader of the National party was threatened by members of his caucus.

After nine years, Muldoon's stewardship of the nation and its economy ceased. The newly elected radically neo-liberal and unexpectedly pro-free market Fourth Labour Government embarked on a series of fundamental free-market reforms known (after Labour's finance minister [[Roger Douglas]]) as [[Rogernomics]], and which were then continued from 1990 to 1994 by the succeeding National government's policies known as (after National's finance minister [[Ruth Richardson]]) as [[Ruthanasia]]. These policies marked a fundamental break with the more interventionist policies of Muldoon's era.

==Later life==
Muldoon was deposed as National leader shortly after the election by his deputy, [[Jim McLay]]. Muldoon remains the only defeated National Prime Minister who did not stay on to lead the party into opposition.  He refused McLay's offer of a front bench post, instead opting to return to the backbench for the first time in over two decades.  However, he remained a thorn in McLay's side, refusing to withdraw into an "elder statesman" role as McLay wanted.  The relationship between the two bottomed out when Muldoon criticised the entire party leadership, forcing McLay to demote him to the lowest rank in the National caucus.

Muldoon continued to undermine McLay until 1986, when McLay was ousted in turn by his own deputy (and Muldoon's preferred candidate), [[Jim Bolger]], who had served as Minister of Labour for the latter half of Muldoon's term as Prime Minister. Bolger returned Muldoon to the front bench as spokesperson for Foreign Affairs, pitting him directly against Prime Minister David Lange.{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=?}}

Muldoon remained as the MP for Tamaki until shortly before his death.  He lived through the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]]'s [[neo-liberal]] reforms, known as ''[[Rogernomics]]'', and to his horror – to see his own man, Bolger, take up the same baton after winning the [[New Zealand general election, 1990|landslide of 1990]] in the form of [[Ruthanasia]], named after Finance Minister Ruth Richardson. Muldoon's conscience tormented him; he could not bring himself to vote with Labour against the Bolger government's benefit cuts, and, looking miserable, abstained.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Muldoon also opposed the legalisation of homosexual behaviour when Labour MP [[Fran Wilde]] introduced the [[Homosexual Law Reform Act|Homosexual Law Reform Bill]] in 1985. The Bill passed as the [[Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986|Homosexual Law Reform Act]] in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Although he remained iconic to particular segments of society, particularly the elderly, Muldoon faded quickly as a force on the political scene. His biographer, [[Barry Gustafson]], who described himself as not a Muldoon supporter, wrote that he still served as an active MP for his Tamaki electorate, dealing immediately with matters from all walks of life. He continued to write in international economic journals, arguing that the unemployment that had arisen as a result of the free-market reforms was worse than the gains that were made, a view that came to be popular by the time of the [[Fifth Labour Government]] in 1999.

Muldoon had a short stage career in a New Zealand production of ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', held at Auckland's His Majesty's Theatre (demolished soon after the production ended),{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=?}} starring as the narrator. He also had minor television appearances on commercials for [[Panasonic]] (when it changed its brand name in New Zealand from "National") and in the television series ''[[Terry and the Gunrunners]]'' (as Arnos Grove) and in ''The Friday Frights'' (as the host); he also hosted a [[talkback radio]] show entitled ''Lilies and Other Things'', referencing his favourite flower on [[Radio Pacific]].{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=?}}

On this show, on 17 November 1991, Muldoon announced he would stand down from Parliament; he formally retired one month later, on 17 December. His retirement party featured taped speeches from [[Ronald Reagan]] (commenting that at Muldoon's age, he was only getting started) and [[Margaret Thatcher]]. He fell seriously ill almost immediately, and died in hospital on 5 August 1992, aged 70.

He is buried at Purewa Cemetery, [[Meadowbank, New Zealand|Meadowbank]], Auckland in a plot that faces Auckland City.

==Legacy==
Muldoon remains one of the most complex, fascinating, polarising and iconic figures in New Zealand history. He divided people into camps of those who loved him and those who hated him; very few people, except those born after his fall, remained neutral.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} To his enemies, "Piggy" Muldoon was a dictatorial Prime Minister who nearly destroyed both New Zealand's economy and New Zealand society through his arrogance. To those, known as "Rob's Mob", who revered him, he represented an icon of the New Zealand national character, a supporter of the "ordinary bloke" (his own description of himself) and an international statesman.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Curiously, he also became patron of the Black Power gang for whom he had created work schemes and advised on the better treatment of women and children associated with the gang.{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=426}} Members paid him solemn respect by performing two [[haka]] during his funeral in 1992.

Historians like Gustafson and [[Brian Easton (economist)|Brian Easton]] criticise Muldoon because, according to them, he pursued an ultimately unsustainable line of policy.{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=?}}{{sfn|Easton|2001|pp=239–253}}

Some argue{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} that he was responsible for much of the pain caused by the free-market reforms of 1984–1993, because by holding on for as long as he did he forced the inevitable reforms to be implemented with unusual speed and severity. However,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} this view is not universal, and many also argue that the free market reformers of the 1980s and 1990s used Muldoon as an excuse to embark on radical ideological programs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Muldoon famously declared upon becoming Prime Minister that he hoped to leave New Zealand "no worse off than I found it".{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} He dominated New Zealand politics for over a decade, and still influences the conduct of government {{As of|2007|alt= today}}. Gustafson gives him the following epitaph: "By 1992 New Zealand had not become what Muldoon or many other New Zealanders wanted it to be but he was not prepared to take the blame for that. Muldoon died unrepentant and still convinced that his way, even if never perfect, had been a better way."{{Cite quote| date=August 2014}}

==Thea Muldoon==
In 1951 Muldoon married Thea Dale Flyger, by whom he would have three children, and who survives him. Lady Muldoon was appointed a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1993 New Year Honours]]<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/53154/supplements/29 ''London Gazette'' (supplement), No. 53154, 30 December 1992]. Retrieved 9 January 2013.</ref> and awarded the [[Queen's Service Order]] in the [[1986 New Year Honours]].<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/50362/supplements/29 ''London Gazette'' (supplement), No. 50362, 30 December 1985]. Retrieved 9 January 2013.</ref>

==In popular culture==
* Muldoon was frequently lampooned in the TVNZ-produced satire show ''[[David McPhail|McPhail]] & [[Jon Gadsby|Gadsby]]'' during the 1980s.
* American President [[Ronald Reagan]] would sometimes mistake the last name of Canadian Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] to be Muldoon after changes in government in both New Zealand and Canada in 1984, with many Canadian political cartoonists taking up on this error and referring to Mulroney as 'Muldoon'.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} 
* In 1995, actor [[Ian Mune]] played Sir Robert Muldoon in the made-for-television mini-series ''Fallout'', depicting the end of the Muldoon National Government.
* Two further documentaries about Muldoon were ''Magic Kiwis: Muldoon'' and ''The Grim Face of Power'', both produced by Neil Roberts.
* A corner on the Rimutaka Hill Road section of [[New Zealand State Highway 2|State Highway 2]] has been named after the former prime minister.<ref>[http://www.times-age.co.nz/local/news/muldoons-corner-work-set-to-begin-august-31/3902467/ Muldoon's Corner work set to begin 31 August – Local News – Wairarapa Times-Age<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://moonovermartinborough.com/2009/04/30/conquering-the-road-that-scared-me/#more-155 Conquering the road that scared me « Moon over Martinborough<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Safety work carried out between 2009 and 2012, costing [[NZ$]]16.5 million, included realignment to ease the corner.<ref>[http://www.transport.govt.nz/news/newsevents/Muldoon%E2%80%99sCornerrealignmentworkbegins/ Muldoon’s Corner realignment work begins<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/6923452/Muldoons-16m-corner-opens-after-three-years |title=Muldoon's $16m corner opens after three years |date=15 May 2012 |work= Dominion Post |accessdate=10 February 2013 |first=Michael |last=Forbes}}</ref>

The '''Tangiwai disaster''' is New Zealand's worst rail accident. It occurred at 22:21 on 24 December 1953 when the Whangaehu River bridge collapsed beneath a Wellington to Auckland express passenger train at Tangiwai, in the central North Island of New Zealand. The locomotive and first six carriages derailed into the river, killing 151 people. The subsequent Board of Inquiry found that the accident was caused by the collapse of the [[tephra]] dam holding back nearby [[Mount Ruapehu]]'s crater lake, creating a large [[lahar]] in the Whangaehu River, which destroyed one of the bridge piers at Tangiwai only minutes before the train reached the bridge.

==Bridge collapse==
On 24 December 1953 the 3&nbsp;pm express from [[Wellington]] to [[Auckland]] was made up of a [[NZR KA class|K<sup>A</sup> class]] [[steam locomotive]] hauling 11 carriages: five second class, four first class, a guard's van  and a postal van. With 285 passengers and crew,{{sfn|Inquiry Report|1954|p=4}} it passed through Tangiwai Station on time at 10:20&nbsp;pm at about {{convert|40|mph|disp=flip}}. Approaching the bridge over the [[Whangaehu River]] at Tangiwai an emergency brake application was made by the driver (Mr Charles Parker - First Class Locomotive Engineer category) and the track had been sanded for 128 yards through application of the sand box lever by the fireman (Mr Lance Redman) to aid in braking the entire train (this aided in reducing the number of carriages that went into the river and thus, the death toll) either in response to Cyril Ellis, a passerby, standing by the track and waving a torch or seeing the condition of the bridge.{{sfn|Conly|Stewart|1991|p=3}} However, this was too late to stop the train going onto the bridge, which gave way, the locomotive, tender, and five second class carriages falling into the river.{{sfn|Inquiry Report|1954|p=4}} The leading first-class carriage teetered on the edge of the bridge before its [[Railway coupling|coupling]] to the rest of the train snapped and it, too, rolled into the river.  The remaining three first-class carriages, the guard's van, and a postal van remained on the track.{{sfn|Conly|Stewart|1991|pp=6–7}}

The death toll of 151 consisted of 148 second-class passengers, 1 first-class passenger, the engine driver and fireman. Twenty of the bodies were never found and were presumed to have been carried {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}} downriver to the ocean.{{sfn|Conly|Stewart|1991|p=7}} Among the dead was Nerissa Love, the fiancee of cricketer [[Bob Blair (cricketer)|Bob Blair]], who was playing in a Test Match in South Africa at the time. On going out to bat after his loss, he received a standing ovation.<ref name="Blair"/>

==Aftermath==
[[File:TangiwaiMemorialPlaque1b.jpg|thumb|left|Tangiwai Memorial, showing the replica of the number plate of the train’s locomotive, [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup> 949]] ]]
After the train crashed, Ellis informed the train's guard, William Inglis, of what had happened and the two entered the sixth carriage, then still balanced precariously on the bridge's edge, in an attempt to save passengers. While they were in the carriage, it tumbled off the bridge and Ellis and Inglis, with the assistance of passenger John Holman, smashed a window and helped passengers out of the carriage. Of the carriage's 24 occupants, only one died, a girl who was trapped in her seat and drowned.{{sfn|Conly|Stewart|1991|pp=15–16}}

Shortly after the accident, rescue teams departed from Waiouru {{convert|5|mi|km|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} east of Tangiwai. These included soldiers from [[Waiouru Army Camp]], radio operators from [[Irirangi]] Naval Communications Station and [[Ministry of Works (New Zealand)|MOW]] workmen from the Waiouru Ministry of Works camp. By midnight survivors were being admitted into the Waiouru Camp Hospital, and by 4&nbsp;am the following day, Christmas morning, bodies started arriving there.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The Prime Minister, [[Sidney Holland]], arrived at Tangiwai early on Christmas morning after a high-speed drive down from Auckland. He coordinated the rescue work by railway, army, police, navy, MOW, local farmers and undertakers. While the army led efforts near the accident site, local farmers recovered bodies further down the Whangaehu River; at Fields Track, Mount View, Mangamahu, Kauangaroa, Whangaehu village and the river mouth. The bodies were taken by truck to Wanganui and thence by rail to Waiouru, where police and undertakers identified them. Local settlers carried out daily search-and-recovery operations for the next month as bodies rose to the surface.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

For their actions, Ellis and Holman received the [[George Medal]].  Inglis and a passing traveller, Arthur Dewar Bell, both received the [[British Empire Medal]] for actions that saved 15 lives. [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]] were visiting New Zealand on their first royal tour when the disaster occurred. The Queen made her [[Royal Christmas Message|Christmas broadcast]] from Auckland, finishing with a message of sympathy to the people of New Zealand. The Duke of Edinburgh attended a state funeral for many of the victims.<ref name="Library">{{cite web|title= Tangiwai Railway Disaster 1953|publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]]|accessdate=5 November 2012|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/kids/nzdisasters/tangiwai.asp|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20121023214235/http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/kids/nzdisasters/tangiwai.asp|archivedate=23 October 2012}}</ref>

==Public inquiry==
A [[Board of Inquiry]] was appointed to look into the cause of the accident; this sat in public from 26 January until 2 April and reported on 23 April 1954.{{sfn|Inquiry Report|1954|pp=3, 24}} The bridge had eight piers and seven spans—after the accident four piers had been damaged and five spans dislodged.{{sfn|Inquiry Report|1954|pp=16-17}} The Board found that a [[lahar]] from [[Mount Ruapehu]] had removed the fourth pier a few minutes before the train started to cross the bridge and this is what caused the accident.{{sfn|Inquiry Report|1954|pp=8, 17}} The bridge had been designed for foreseeable flooding and the previous lahars that had different characteristics to the 1953 lahar, the forces of which had been unpredictable.{{sfn|Inquiry Report|1954|p=18}}{{sfn|Inquiry Report|1954|p=20}}

==Legacy==
Following the disaster, the Railways Department installed a lahar warning system upstream in the river to alert train control to high river flows. The early warning system installed in 1999 measures the river level using radar and sends the level to the Network Control Centre at [[Wellington Railway Station]] via a RF link to Waiouru and then via the signalling network to Wellington. If the river changes level, an alarm is triggered which alerts staff to the fact. If the level is of a significant risk, the Control Centre sets the signals either side of the Tangiwai bridge to danger and warns trains in the area to stay clear by radio. The system is failsafe and if there is a problem with the system it automatically sends a fault signal to the Control Centre. In this instance, trains in the area are restricted to {{convert|25|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and told to take extreme care over the Tangiwai Bridge. Since 2002, it has also been backed-up by the [[ERLAWS|Eastern Ruapehu Lahar Alarm and Warning System]] (ERLAWS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geodyn.psu.edu/geosc402/lahar/RuapehuReport.pdf|title=Ruapehu Lahar Residual Risk Assessment|date=October 2002|publisher=TTAC|author=Tony Taig|accessdate=5 November 2012|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}</ref>

A lahar of similar magnitude to the 1953 one occurred on 18 March 2007. The early warning systems worked as planned, stopping trains and motorists at Tangiwai before the lahar hit. The newer bridges held up to the lahar, and after inspection, trains resumed operation over the bridge.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10429432">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10429432|title=Photos: Lahar could have been much worse|date=18 March 2007|agency=[[NZPA]]|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref>

===Dramatisations===
Among the dead was Nerissa Love, the  fiancée of New Zealand international cricketer [[Bob Blair (cricketer)|Bob Blair]]. In 2011, a television film about the disaster was made by Lippy Pictures for [[Television New Zealand]]. Entitled ''Tangiwai: A Love Story'', it follows the disaster and the love story between Blair and Love (portrayed by Ryan O'Kane and [[Rose McIver]] respectively), the latter of whom was killed in the disaster. It premiered on [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV One]] on 14 August 2011.<ref name="Blair">{{cite web|accessdate=12 August 2011|url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/new-zealand/news/article.cfm?l_id=71&objectid=10743254|title=Death and the maiden: The tale of 'Tangiwai'|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=6 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1922735/|title=Tangiwai (2011)|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref> A play written and performed by Auckland actor Jonny Brugh, ''The Second Test'', tells the same story from Blair's perspective, emphasizing his commitment to continue playing with the New Zealand team, then on tour in South Africa, after hearing of the tragedy.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Otago Daily Times]]|date=30 March 2011|url= http://www.odt.co.nz/sport/cricket/153898/cricket-emotion-blairs-story-brought-stage|title= Cricket: Emotion of Blair's story brought to stage|accessdate=31 March 2011|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20121017235043/http://www.odt.co.nz/sport/cricket/153898/cricket-emotion-blairs-story-brought-stage|archivedate=17 October 2012}}</ref>

In 1981, she made her West End musical theatre debut in ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' and met composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], whom she married. She went on to star in several West End and Broadway musicals, including ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', where she originated the role of [[Christine Daaé]]. The Original London Cast Album of the musical was released in CD format in 1987 and sold 40 million copies worldwide, making it the biggest-selling cast album of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorktheatreguide.com/news/ag10/phantomoftheopera556119.htm |title=Phantom of the Opera Original Cast Recording sales |publisher=Newyorktheatreguide.com |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>

After retiring from the stage and divorcing Lloyd Webber, Brightman resumed her music career with former [[Enigma (musical project)|Enigma]] producer [[Frank Peterson]], this time as a classical [[crossover (music)|crossover]] artist. She is often credited as the creator of this genre and remains among the most prominent performers, with worldwide sales of more than 30 million records and 2 million DVDs, establishing herself as the world's best-selling [[soprano]] of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://today24news.com/entertainment/sarah-brightman-jackie-evancho-on-americas-got-talent-164284 |title=Sarah Brightman & Jackie Evancho on America's Got Talent |publisher=Today24News |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=118429 |title=Success comes to soprano Sarah Brightman}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/entertainment/view/soprano-star-sarah-brightman-to-sing-in-japanese-for-nhk-drama |title=Soprano Sarah Brightman to sing in Japanese for NHK drama " Japan Today: Japan News and Discussion |publisher=Japantoday.com |date=25 October 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>

Brightman's 1996 duet with the Italian tenor [[Andrea Bocelli]], "[[Time to Say Goodbye]]", topped charts all over Europe and became the highest and fastest selling single of all time in Germany, where it stayed at the top of the charts for fourteen consecutive weeks and sold over 3 million copies.<ref name="Bocelli on Decca.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.decca.com/artists/andrea-bocelli-192 |title=Bocelli on |publisher=Decca.com |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref><ref name="Bocelli Bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicsandjazz.co.uk/plink/Andrea+Bocelli |title=Andrea Bocelli Biography |publisher=Classicsandjazz.co.uk |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> It subsequently became an international success selling 12 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling singles worldwide|best-selling singles of all time]].<ref name="Daily Mail">{{cite web|last=Wilde |first=Jon |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-2009588/Andrea-Bocelli-I-avoid-sex-big-concert.html |title=Andrea Bocelli: 'I avoid sex before a big concert' &#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2011-07-02 |accessdate=2014-07-25}}</ref><ref>[http://www.sugarmusic.com/en/discography/news/3-14 ]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://deccarecords.com/artist/detail.aspx?nid=4588&aid=108] {{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref><ref name="Sarah Brightman's Not Saying Goodbye!">{{cite web|url=http://www.early-sarah-brightman.com/timeless.htm |title=Angel records |publisher=Early-sarah-brightman.com |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> She has now collected over 180 gold and platinum sales awards in 38 different countries.<ref name="sarah-brightman.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.sarah-brightman.com/about_sarah.html |title=Official Website Sarah Brightman/About/Awards |publisher=Sarah-brightman.com |date=4 January 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> In 2010 she was named by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' the 5th most influential and best-selling classical artist of the 2000s decade in the US<ref name="Billboard">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/#/charts-decade-end/classical-artists?year=2009|title=Best of 2000's / Classical Artists |work=Billboard  |date=6 February 2012}}</ref> and according to Nielsen SoundScan, she has sold 6.5 million albums in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/chartbeat/474549/ask-billboard-the-twitter-sized-edition|title=Ask Billboard: The Twitter-Sized Edition |work=Billboard  |date=20 October 2012}}</ref>

Brightman is the first artist to have been invited twice to perform at the [[Olympic Games]], first at the 1992 [[Barcelona Olympic Games]] where she sang "[[Amigos Para Siempre]]" with the Spanish tenor [[José Carreras]] with an estimated global audience of a billion people, and sixteen years later in Beijing, this time with Chinese singer [[Liu Huan]], performing the song "[[You and Me (Olympic theme song)|You and Me]]" to an estimated 4 billion people worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/culture/songs/n214517844.shtml |title=Sarah Brightman moved to tears upon hearing Olympic theme – The Official Website of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games |publisher=En.beijing2008.cn |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>

In 2012, Brightman was appointed as the [[UNESCO Artist for Peace]] for the period 2012–2014, for her "commitment to humanitarian and charitable causes, her contribution, throughout her artistic career, to the promotion of cultural dialogue and the exchanges among cultures, and her dedication to the ideals and aims of the Organization".<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41146&Cr=UNESCO&Cr1= |title=United Nations News Centre - British singer and actress Sarah Brightman becomes UNESCO Artist for Peace |publisher=Un.org |date=2012-02-06 |accessdate=2014-07-25}}</ref>

==Family and early life==
Brightman is the oldest of six children of businessman Grenville Geoffrey Brightman (1934<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findmypast.co.uk/content/search-menu/life-events-bmds |title=Search birth, marriage and death records 1837–2006 &#124; Overseas BMDs, parish records from 1538 |publisher=Findmypast.co.uk |accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>–1992) and Paula Brightman. Her younger sisters are Nicola, Claudia and Amelia (aka Violet). She was raised in [[Berkhamsted]], Hertfordshire, England. At age three, she began taking dance and piano classes and went on to perform in local festivals and competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarah-brightman.com/BillboardJan2008/ |publisher=''Billboard'' magazine |title=Genre-Bending Brightman Seeks Crossover Success With 'Symphony' |accessdate=2014-07-26}}</ref> At age 11, she successfully auditioned for the [[Arts Educational School, Tring Park|Arts Education School]] in [[Tring Park]], a school specialising in performing arts.

Education: [[Elmhurst Ballet School]], [[Arts Educational School]], and [[Royal College of Music]].

In 1973, at the age of 13, Brightman made her theatrical debut in the musical ''[[I and Albert]]'' at the [[Piccadilly Theatre]], London, playing one of Queen Victoria's daughters (Victoria).
In 1976 she was recruited into Arlene Phillips' troupe [[Hot Gossip]] in 1977. The group had a disco hit in 1978 with "[[I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper]]", which sold half a million and reached number six on the [[UK Singles Chart|UK charts]]. Brightman, now solo, released more disco singles under her own label, Whisper Records, such as "[[Not Having That!]]" and a cover of the song "[[My Boyfriend's Back (song)|My Boyfriend's Back]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarah-brightman.com/ |title=Sarah Brightman Official Website – Home Page |publisher=Sarah-brightman.com |accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> In 1979, Brightman appeared on the soundtrack of the movie "[[The World Is Full of Married Men]]" and sang the song "Madam Hyde".

==1981–1989: Stage career==
In 1981, Brightman auditioned for the new musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', by composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], and was cast as Jemima. After a year in ''Cats'', Brightman took over from [[Bonnie Langford]] as Kate in  ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' at the Drury Lane Theatre, London, and appeared as Tara Treetops in ''Masquerade'', a musical based on [[Kit Williams]]'s [[Masquerade (book)|book of the same title]]. In that year she left to play the title role in [[Charles Strouse]]'s children's opera, ''[[Nightingale (musical)|Nightingale]]''.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://www.sarah-brightman.com/htm_sarah/biogtwo.shtml |title=II. Sarah's Musical Theatre Era : 1981-1990 |publisher=Sarah-brightman.com |accessdate=2014-07-26}}</ref>

Enticed by a rave review, Webber went to watch her in the show one evening and was greatly impressed by her performance. Though she had appeared in his musical ''Cats'', Webber had not previously singled Brightman out as a great talent. The two married in 1984, and Brightman appeared in Lloyd Webber's subsequent musicals including ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and ''[[Song and Dance]]'', as well as the [[mass (music)|mass]] ''[[Requiem (Webber)|Requiem]],'' which was written and composed for her.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In 1985, Brightman's recording of [[Pie Jesu]] was a strong commercial success, selling 25,000 copies<ref name="ReferenceA"/> on the first day of release and peaking at number 3, despite the lyrics being in Latin. With classical music permeating the Lloyd Webber household (Brightman was in heavy operatic training at the time), Lloyd Webber was moved to write the Requiem Mass as a tribute to young victims of war. Its Manhattan premiere, starring [[Plácido Domingo]] and Brightman, was filmed by both PBS and the [[BBC]] for later broadcast. The LP eventually became UK's top selling classical album of the year and earned Brightman a Grammy nomination as Best New Classical Artist."<ref name="video">{{cite web |title= Video Biography |url= http://www.sarah-brightman.com/sound_vision.html |publisher= Sarah Brightman Official Website |accessdate=18 June 2009}}</ref> [[Image:PhantomoftheOpera-BoatScene.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Michael Crawford and Brightman performing the title song, "[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]]"]]

Brightman starred as [[Christine Daaé]] in Lloyd Webber's adaptation of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]].'' The role of Christine was written specifically for her.<ref name="video"/> Lloyd Webber refused to open ''The Phantom of the Opera'' on Broadway unless Brightman played Christine. Initially, the American [[Actors' Equity Association]] balked, because of their policy that any non-American performer must be an international star. Lloyd Webber had to cast an American in a leading role in his next [[West End theatre|West End musical]] before Equity would allow Brightman to appear (a promise he kept in casting ''[[Aspects of Love]]''). In the end, it was a compromise that more than paid off. "Phantom" chalked up a staggering $17 million in advance sales prior to opening night on 26 January 1988, and generated a public and media frenzy that is unmatched since.<ref>''Time''. Brightman performed the show on Broadway for six months "[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966470,00.html Chills, Thrills, and Trapdoors]" 18 January 1988.

Album sales now exceed forty million worldwide and it is the biggest selling cast album of all time, and has gone six times platinum in the United States, twice platinum in the UK, nine times platinum in Germany, four times platinum in the [[Netherlands]], 21 times platinum in [[Korea]] and 17 times platinum in [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westendtheatre.com/tag/sarah-brightman/ |title=Sarah Brightman &#124; London Theatre and West End Shows from |publisher=West End Theatre.com |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>

After leaving ''Phantom,'' she performed in a tour of Lloyd Webber's music throughout England, Canada and the United States, and performed ''Requiem'' in the Soviet Union. Studio recordings from this time include the single "Anything But Lonely" from ''Aspects of Love'' and two solo albums: the 1988 album ''[[The Trees They Grow So High (album)|The Trees They Grow So High]],'' a collection of [[folk song]]s accompanied by piano, and the 1989 album ''[[The Songs That Got Away]],'' a compilation of obscure musical theatre songs from shows by such composers as [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Stephen Sondheim]]. Brightman also sang the song "Make Believe" during the credits of the children's film "[[Grandpa]];" Howard Blake composed the music and wrote the lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.early-sarah-brightman.com/makebelieve.htm |title=Make Believe |publisher=Early-sarah-brightman.com |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>

By 1990, Brightman and Lloyd Webber had separated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://josvg.home.xs4all.nl/cits/sb/intervw.html |title=Interview with Sarah Brightman: "Wrapped up in her gift" |publisher=Josvg.home.xs4all.nl |date= |accessdate=21 June 2012}}</ref> After their highly publicized divorce, Brightman played the lead in Lloyd Webber's ''[[Aspects of Love|Aspects]]'' in London opposite [[Michael Praed]], before transferring to Broadway.<ref name="chin">Chin, Siew May.

==1990s: Solo career==
In 1992, Brightman performed with [[José Carreras]] at the [[Barcelona Olympic Games]] singing the theme song "Amigos Para Siempre" ("Friends Forever") to a worldwide audience of 3 billion people. Following the appearance, Brightman pursued solo recording, and inspired by the German band [[Enigma (musical project)|Enigma]], she requested to work with one of its members, [[Frank Peterson]]. Their first release together was ''[[Dive (Sarah Brightman album)|Dive]]'' (1993), a water-themed pop album that featured "[[Captain Nemo (song)|Captain Nemo]]", a cover of a song by the Swedish [[electronica]] band [[Dive (Swedish band)|Dive]].<ref>Demalon, Tom. "[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r169793|pure_url=yes}} Review: Dive]". Allmusic.

Brightman and Peterson's second collaboration yielded the pop rock album, [[Fly (Sarah Brightman album)|''Fly'']] (1995). The album catapulted Brightman to fame across Europe, and she unveiled its hit track "A Question of Honor"—a mélange of electronic, rock, classical strings and excerpts from the Alfredo Catalani opera "La Wally".<ref>Malich, Daniel. "[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r368550|pure_url=yes}} Review: Fly]". Allmusic. Retrieved 10 February 2007.</ref>
The song and the video were introduced at the World [[Boxing]] Championship match between Germany's [[Henry Maske]] and [[Graciano Rocchigiani]].

In 1997, Brightman released the album ''[[Timeless (Sarah Brightman album)|Timeless/Time to Say Goodbye]]''. It remains as Brightman's biggest-selling album. It went gold, [[platinum]] and/or [[multi-platinum]] in 21 countries, selling over 1.4 million copies in the U.S. alone, and topped the [[Billboard]] [[Classical Crossover]] [[chart]] in the U.S. for 35 weeks.<ref name="Astana">{{cite web|url=http://www.astana.kz/en/node/37104|title= Concert of world star Sarah Brightman|publisher=''Astana News Source''|accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> The lead single from the album, "Time to Say Goodbye", was the second song that Brightman debuted at the World Boxing Championship in Germany.

With the success of ''Timeless'', Brightman released her next album, ''[[Eden (Sarah Brightman album)|Eden]]'' in 1998. She hand-selected each song and convinced the Academy Award-winning Italian composer [[Ennio Morricone]] to let her set lyrics to one of his film compositions, "''[[Gabriel's Oboe]]''" from the film [[The Mission (1986 film)|''The Mission'']] resulting in the now classic piece "[[Nella Fantasia]]". The album, unlike ''Time to Say Goodbye'', incorporated more pop music elements. Reviews were mixed – [[LAUNCHcast]] deemed ''Eden'' "deliriously sappy",<ref>Dumpert, Hazel-Dawn.

==2000–2004: Further international success==
In 2000, ''[[La Luna (album)|La Luna]]'' was released. For this album, Brightman chose songs drawing on influences as diverse as pop, vintage jazz, and high opera, in homages to Dvo?ák, Beethoven and Billie Holiday.

"Dreamchaser In Concert" aired on PBS on 3 August, with a setlist of twelve songs (plus two bonus songs) featuring both new songs and well-known favorites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/180745-Sarah-Brightmans-Dreamchaser-Airs-on-PBS-Beginning-Aug-3 |title=Sarah Brightman's Dreamchaser Airs on PBS Beginning Aug. 3 |publisher=Playbill.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-25}}</ref>

On March 2014, Brightman released a compilation album called ''Voce – Sarah Brightman Beautiful Songs'' available only in the Japanese region. Her album included well-known songs, rare-tracks and a special new song called "Keep the Light", which was recorded for the Japanese movie ''[[Kamisama no Karute 2]]''.

==Music and voice==
Brightman underwent vocal training first with Elizabeth Hawes, head of the [[Trinity College of Music|Trinity Music College]] in London, and later with [[Ellen Faull]] of [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]]. She currently studies with internationally known voice teacher David Romano. She has a five-octave vocal range.<ref>Alter, Gaby. "[http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_sarah_brightman/index.html Tour Profile: Sarah Brightman]". 1 April 2004. Retrieved 22 August 2006.</ref> According to Brightman, her voice can reach an F6.<ref>Perusse, Bernard. [http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/story.html?id=4bdb6e52-c810-47a9-8860-812e608627b2&k=42491 Sarah Brightman: The original angel of music hits the high notes in Symphony], [[Times Colonist]], 4 February 2008. Retrieved 4 February 2008.</ref>
However, her highest note sung in public and in studio is an E6 at the end of the song "The Phantom of the Opera".

David Caddick, a conductor of ''Phantom'', has stated:

<blockquote>"What is amazing about Sarah is that she has two voices, really. She can produce a pop, contemporary sound, but she can also blossom out into a [[light lyric soprano]]. The soprano part of her voice can go up to a F6 above her known E6. She doesn’t sing it full out, but it is there. Of course, she has to dance while she is singing some of the time, so it’s all the more extraordinary."<ref name="chin"/></blockquote>

She sometimes uses her pop and classical voices in the same song. One example is "Anytime, Anywhere" from ''Eden'', a song based on [[Albinoni]]'s ''[[Adagio in G minor]]''. In the song, she starts out in classical voice, switches to pop voice temporarily, and finishes with her classical voice. Another example is heard in the [[Lions Gate]] film ''[[Repo! The Genetic Opera]]'', during the songs "Chase The Morning" and "Chromaggia" by her character, Blind Mag.

Brightman's music is generally classified as classical crossover. According to [[Manhattan Records]] GM Ian Ralfini, she is largely responsible for the popularity of the genre. In a 2000 interview with ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', Brightman dismissed the classical crossover label as "horrible" but stated she understood people's need to categorise music.<ref>Charaipotra, Sona. ''[[People (magazine)|People Weekly]]'', 6 November 2000.</ref> Her personal influences include 1960s and 1970s musicians and artists such as [[David Bowie]] and [[Pink Floyd]],<ref name="video"/> and she incorporates aspects of genres from pop/rock to classical. Her work has also been compared to that of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Cher]] and [[Celine Dion]].<ref>[[Joel Selvin|Selvin, Joel]]. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/07/DD56374.DTL Brightman Lights Up Civic], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 7 March 2001. Retrieved 1 September 2007.</ref> The material on her albums ranges from versions of opera arias from composers such as [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]] (on ''Harem'', ''Eden'', and ''Timeless''), to pop songs by artists such as [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]] ("[[Dust in the Wind]]" on ''Eden''), [[Dido (singer)|Dido]] ("[[Here with Me (Dido song)|Here with Me]]" on ''La Luna''), and [[Procol Harum]] ("[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]" on ''La Luna''). She sings in many languages which are English, Spanish, French, Latin, German, Italian, Russian, Hindi, Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.

==Personal life==
At age 18, in 1979, Brightman married Andrew Graham-Stewart, who then managed the German band [[Tangerine Dream]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.early-sarah-brightman.com/bio1.htm |title=Biography |publisher=Early-sarah-brightman.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-07}}</ref> In 1983, she divorced Graham-Stewart. She met [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] when she performed in ''Cats'', and Lloyd Webber later divorced his first wife, Sarah Hugill, to marry her on 22 March 1984.<ref name="astro">{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Brightman,_Sarah |title=Astro-Databank |publisher=Astro.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-07}}</ref><ref name="passagen">Larsdotter , Åsa [http://hem.passagen.se/musicals/bio_and.html A place for lovers of musicals]</ref> in Hampshire. Their marriage saw intense media and [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] scrutiny. Brightman acknowledged the marriage in a 1999 interview as a "difficult time" but also one of much creative output. They are currently on friendly terms; at the 20th London anniversary of ''The Phantom of the Opera'', Lloyd Webber called Brightman a "wonderful woman" and "absolutely beloved mentor". He appeared as a special guest in her [[Sarah Brightman: In Concert|1997 concert]] at the Royal Albert Hall (London).

Brightman has suffered several personal crises. In February 1992, her 57-year-old father committed suicide by [[asphyxiation]] in his car in Hertfordshire after divorce and financial issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brazil.sarah-brightman.net/daily_mail.html |title=Sarah Brightman in Brazil |publisher=Brazil.sarah-brightman.net |date=10 December 2000 |accessdate=2011-07-07}}</ref> Previously, she experienced an [[ectopic pregnancy]],a [[stillbirth]], and two [[miscarriage]]s with Lloyd Webber. In an interview with British magazine ''[[Hello!]]'', she said motherhood would have been "lovely" but accepted that she would never have a child.<ref>Barber, Richard. ''[[Hello! Magazine|Hello!]]''. 5 December 2006.</ref>

==Philanthropy==
Since January 2010, Brightman is [[Panasonic]]'s global Brand Ambassador. Together they launched the song "Shall Be Done" at Panasonic's Olympic Pavilion at Live City Yaletown, the official celebration site of the [[2010 Winter Games]] held in [[Vancouver]], Canada. The lyrics of the song express Panasonic's vision for the next generation as well as Brightman's vision, infusing the spirit of 'ideas for life' of contribution for a sustainable society. The song has been used in a wide range of global promotional activities including stores, advertising, exhibitions and other events.

On 8 February 2012, Brightman accepted the [[UNESCO]] nomination to be an "Artist For Peace" Ambassador.<ref>{{cite web|author=Source: Unescopress |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/global_recording_artist_sarah_brightman_designated_unesco_artist_for_peace/ |title=Global recording artist, Sarah Brightman designated UNESCO Artist for Peace &#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=21 June 2012}}</ref> Additionally, she is actively engaged in Panasonic's [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Centre endeavours, and stars in their The World Heritage Special campaign.

On 27 June 2013, the Reignwood Group announced at the Beijing Theatre that Brightman would be a promotional ambassador for its 10 Trinity Square, a landmark in the Reignwood Group's global expansion, in London for the next four years. This is the second time for the group to cooperate with an influential artist, the first being with tenor Plácido Domingo, in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reignwood.com/cn/news.asp?id=601&page=1&k= |title=???? |publisher=Reignwood.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-25}}</ref>

On November 2013, Brightman donated US$533,000 to those affected by  [[Hurricane Ingrid]] in the Mexican state of Guerrero. The origin of the funds was all the profit generated by her sold-out show in Mexico City held on 13 November 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musica.terra.com.mx/destinan-ganancias-de-show-de-sarah-brightman-a-guerrero,b456567b2b952410VgnVCM3000009af154d0RCRD.html |title=Destinan ganancias de show de Sarah Brightman a Guerrero - Terra México |publisher=Musica.terra.com.mx |date= |accessdate=2014-07-25}}</ref>

On 30 October, Brightman announced through the media that she was honoured to be part of the Advisory Council for the Challenger Center, the non-profit science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education organisation. Sarah also announced that she will be joined on the council by other distinguished individuals including President George H.W. Bush, Mr Norman Augustine, Senator John and Mrs Annie Glenn, all of whom will be lending their diverse talents and support of STEM education to help expand the organization's reach with today's youth.

"Through my partnership with the Challenger Center, I hope to inspire in children the same wonder and excitement for space exploration that I feel myself"—Sarah Brightman commented.
Challenger Center and its network of more than 40 Challenger Learning Centers engage students in hands-on experiences that strengthen knowledge in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and inspire students to pursue careers in these important fields.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sarahbrightman.com/news/challenger |title=News |publisher=Sarah Brightman |date= |accessdate=2014-07-25}}</ref>

It is sometimes imagined the name is from [[Shepperton]] in England, but this is not the case.<ref>Bill Wannan, ''Australian Folklore'', Lansdowne Press, 1970, reprint 1979 ISBN 0-7018-1309-1, under "Place Names", page 422, citing William Sandry James, ''A History of Shepparton'', 1938.</ref>

== History ==
Prior to the [[European settlement of Australia]], it was thought to be inhabited by the [[Yorta Yorta people|Yorta Yorta]] [[Indigenous Australian]] tribe.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/victoria/shepparton/2005/02/17/1108500207320.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Shepparton | date=17 January 2008}}</ref>

The Yorta Yorta people are the Indigenous Australians who traditionally lived around the junction of the Goulburn and Murray Rivers in present-day northeast Victoria.

Yorta Yorta Family Groups include the Bangerang, Kailtheban, Wollithiga, Moira, Ulupna, Kwat Kwat, Yalaba Yalaba and Nguaria-iiliam-wurrung clans. The Yorta Yorta Nation is the Nation and the local tribe is Kailtheban for the Shepparton area. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The language is referred to generally as the Yorta Yorta language.

[[Major Thomas Mitchell]] was the first European to travel through the area in 1835. Mitchell recommended it as a site for Joseph Hawdon and Charles Bonney to camp at the Goulburn River en route from [[Albury, New South Wales]] to [[Adelaide, South Australia]].

The first permanent settlement in the area was by [[squatter]] Edward Khull at [[Tallygaroopna, Victoria|Tallygaroopna]] which a man named Sherbourne Sheppard was to take over two years later. Sheppards holding developed into a village adjacent to the [[Goulburn River, Victoria|Goulburn River]] known as "Sheppardton". During the 1850s, the nearby village was a popular river crossing point for [[miner]]s travelling from the [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]] [[Victorian gold rush|goldfields]] to the new finds in the [[Beechworth, Victoria|Beechworth]] area. As there was no bridge to link either sides of the Goulburn River, entrepreneur Patrick Macguire set up a [[cable ferry|punt]] service in 1850 and the settlement became known as "Sheppardton or Macguire's Punt". A Post Office opened on 1 February 1854 and closed in July of that year.<ref name="postal-history">{{Citation | last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List | url = http://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&filter=Shepparton | accessdate=2 January 2012 }}</ref>

'''''The Phantom of the Opera''''' is a 2004 British [[film adaptation]] of [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s 1986 [[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|musical of the same name]], which in turn is based on the French novel ''[[The Phantom of the Opera|Le Fantôme de l'Opéra]]'' by [[Gaston Leroux]].

Directed by [[Joel Schumacher]], the film was also produced and co-written by Lloyd Webber. ''The Phantom of the Opera'' stars [[Gerard Butler]] in the title role, [[Emmy Rossum]] as Christine Daaé, as well as [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Raoul, [[Miranda Richardson]] as Madame Giry, and [[Minnie Driver]] as Carlotta Giudicelli.

The film was announced as early as 1989, but production only started in 2002 due to Lloyd Webber's divorce and Schumacher's busy career. It was entirely shot at [[Pinewood Studios]], with sceneries also being depicted with the help of miniatures and computer graphics. Rossum, Wilson, and Driver had singing experience, but Butler had no experience and had to receive music lessons. ''The Phantom of the Opera'' grossed approximately $154 million worldwide, and received mixed reviews, praising the visuals and acting but criticising the writing and directing.

==Plot==
''For a more detailed plot, go to [[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)]]''

In 1919, the dilapidated Paris Opera House holds an auction. [[Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny|Raoul, the Viscount of Chagny]], now an old wheelchair-bound man, purchases a coveted music box in a shape of a monkey wearing Persian robes and playing cymbals. During the auction, Raoul spots a familiar figure: Madame Giry, whom he met as a young man. Madame Giry is now an elderly woman, almost 50 years later. Their attention is called on by the next piece for auction, lot [[Number of the Beast|666]]: a [[chandelier]] in pieces which has been restored and newly wired with electricity. As the auctioneers display the restored chandelier, which illuminates and slowly rises to its old place in the rafters the opening crescendo of music wipes away the years of decay from the opera house as the black and white turns into colour, and the audience is transported back in time to 1870, the beginning of the story, when the opera house was in its prime.

The opera house is put into the hands of two new owners, Richard Firmin and Gilles André, who do not understand the house. Madame Giry, who is the mistress of the house and the mother of Meg Giry, introduces them to Christine Daaé, a young but talented singer who sings background. Young Raoul is introduced to the cast and Christine recognizes him as her childhood love. He does not see her, however, and she says nothing to get his attention. During rehearsal, a backdrop falls from the ceiling and almost crushes the soloist and lead soprano, Carlotta Giudicelli, who immediately resigns from the house. Meanwhile, a dark figure leaves the spot where the backdrop used to be. An envelope falls to the floor where Madame Giry opens it. She reads the letter signed from the "Opera Ghost", a spectre-like entity who lives somewhere within the opera house and is believed to be a ghost. He apparently watches every show and is paid twenty thousand francs a month by the owner of the house. Firmin and André scramble to replace Carlotta and Christine is chosen. That night she sings beautifully, and the Opera Ghost hears her through the vents. He is shown to live within the deepest recess of the opera house in a watery labyrinth. 

During Christine's performance, Raoul recognizes her from his childhood and sets off to find her. After she sings, Christine is found in a small room where she lights a candle for her father, who died when she was six years old. Meg asks Christine how she learned to sing so well. Christine explained that an Angel of Music comes to her and tutors her. She has never met this man, but she thinks her father sent this "angel" to help her, but in fact it is the same Opera Ghost, or Phantom of the Opera, who teaches her. Later she is in her dressing room, where she reunites with Raoul. He plans to take her into the city, but she declines, saying that the Angel is very strict. Raoul does not hear her and leaves to prepare for their date. When he leaves, the Phantom locks Christine in her room and begins to sing to her. He reveals himself in a mirror to her, and she is enchanted at his white mask. Christine takes his hand, and he leads her away while Raoul pounds at the locked door, thinking  she is being kidnapped. 

Christine goes with the Phantom to his watery cave underneath the house. He reveals to her that he loves her and wants her to love him back. He shows her a bust of herself, wearing a wedding dress and veil, and she faints. Later she awakes to find the Phantom writing music. She seduces him to take off his mask, and he bursts into a fit of rage when she removes it. He covers his face with his hand until Christine returns the white mask. He at first says she must stay forever because she saw his face without his mask, but then decides to return her to the opera house. 

In the opera house, the two owners do not understand the role of the Phantom. They discover with Raoul that Christine is missing. A series of notes have been sent to various members of the house, each blackmailing the director for the twenty thousand francs. When Carlotta returns, she is furious to find that there was a note sent to her that said if she sang as the countess that night instead of Christine, there would be a fate worse than death. She assumed it was Raoul who sent the letters to her, but he didn't and Firmin and André struggle to make her the center instead of Christine. Meanwhile Raoul begins a journey to find the Angel Christine had mentioned earlier. In a second comedic performance, the Phantom tampers with props while a stagehand, Joseph Buquet, tries to find the intruder. The Phantom interrupts the performance instead and criticizes the failure to follow his orders. Carlotta continues to sing, but her voice croaks and the lead role is given to Christine on short notice. It is chaos as stagehands move props and backdrops. The Phantom hangs Buquet in front of the audience and rushes out of the house. Christine plans to return to the Phantom to stop him from killing more people. She takes Raoul to the roof reveals to him that she has seen the Phantom's face and tells him she pities the Phantom. Raoul tells Christine he loves her and will protect her, and she tells him she loves him too and they kiss passionately. Then both leave the roof. The Phantom who witnessed everything becomes heartbroken that Christine loves Raoul and not him. He then hears them both singing together and grows furious at Raoul and vows revenge.

Three months later, a masquerade party ensues in the opera house. At the party, Christine wears her new engagement ring from Raoul. The event is interrupted once again by the Phantom's doomed music. Raoul leaves the room and Christine alone.  At the sight of the engagement ring, the Phantom takes it and runs off. Then the scene goes to a small room with stacks of newspapers. Madame Giry tells the story of the Phantom to Raoul. When she was a little girl, she went to a freak circus where they featured a deformed child in a cage. The child was beaten in the cage while everyone watched and laughed. The ringmaster then removed a burlap sack covering the child's face, revealing his deformity. Only Madame Giry, as a girl, does not laugh, but instead pities him. The deformed child puts his sack back over his face and cries in the cage. She is the last to leave and turns around to see the child strangling the ringmaster with a rope. After he is dead, the child sees the young Madame Giry, but guards have already come. She helps him escape and runs away with the boy and he finds shelter in the opera house. She tells Raoul how she has hidden him from the world ever since. 

Christine takes a carriage to see her father's grave, but the Phantom has secretly taken over the reins. Raoul follows them. Christine arrives and laments her father's death. The Phantom then tries to win her heart back, but Raoul arrives and stops her. A swordfight ensues in the cemetery, where Raoul eventually disarms the Phantom and is about to kill him when Christine pleads for him not to. His rage seemingly augmented, the Phantom watches angrily as Christine and Raoul ride away.

Christine admits she is afraid of the Phantom and tells Raoul he will never stop trying to recapture her. She will let him have her in order to stop the killing. At that night's play, the Phantom once again makes an entrance, this time on the stage of the house. Raoul can do nothing and watches from the balcony as Christine agrees to go with the Phantom, and he caresses her. She caresses his face back, only to once again remove his mask revealing his deformities. The audience screams in fear, but Christine is not afraid and shows pity. He runs off with her, after a series of tense, chaotic sequences, including dropping the chandelier (the one from the beginning of the film) and setting the opera house on fire, killing many people. 

The Phantom brings Christine down into his labyrinth. Madame Giry shows Raoul where the Phantom lives, and Raoul goes to rescue Christine. The Phantom once again professes his love, and orders Christine to marry him. Instead Christine tries to console the Phantom about his deformed face, saying she does not fear his ugliness. Just then Raoul comes to the scene. The Phantom ties him to a gate and threatens to strangle him if Christine refuses his marriage offer. She kisses the Phantom, in order to save Raoul's life, while displaying her pity and compassion for him. Ashamed of what he's done, he begs Christine and Raoul to leave him and never return. He finds comfort in a little monkey cymbal toy.  Just before she departs with Raoul on the boat, Christine approaches the Phantom, who tells her that he loves her, and she silently gives him the diamond ring from her finger. Christine and Raoul row away as Christine glances back at the Phantom, with love in her eyes. After they leave, the Phantom uses a candelabrum to smash every mirror in his underground lair and he disappears through the last mirror behind a velvet curtain into another section of the caves just before the police arrive. Upon entering, Meg finds only the Phantom's white mask.

Later, the grainy black-and-white picture dominates as the elderly Raoul rides to a cemetery where he goes to visit Christine's tomb, which reveals that she died only two years before, in 1917, at age 63. Her tombstone says "Countess of Chagny" and "beloved wife and mother", suggesting she married Raoul, had children and died. He lays the monkey music box at her grave site, and notices that on the left of the tombstone lies a red rose with a black ribbon tied around it (a trademark of the Phantom) with the engagement ring attached to it, implying that the Phantom is still alive, and will always love Christine.

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] for ''Phantom of the Opera'' lasted from September 15, 2003 to January 15, 2004. The film was shot entirely using eight [[sound stage]]s at [[Pinewood Studios]],<ref>{{cite news|author= Staff|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/pr/?id=1434&p=.htm|title=Production Commences On 'Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera'|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=2003-10-01|accessdate= 2009-09-26}}</ref> where, on the Pinewood [[backlot]], the bottom half exterior of the [[Palais Garnier]] was constructed. The top half was implemented using a combination of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) and a [[scale model]] created by [[Cinesite]]. The surrounding Paris skyline for "All I Ask of You" was entirely composed of [[matte painting]]s.<ref name=DVD/> Cinesite also created a miniature falling chandelier, since a life-size model was too big for the actual set.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/production/iphantom-operai-classic-miniature|title=Phantom of the Opera: A Classic in Miniature|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|first=Mary Ann|last=Skweres|date=2004-12-22|accessdate=2009-12-23}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
The film received generally mixed reviews from film critics. Even though 86% of the general audience liked the film, based on 384,463 audience reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, only 33% of the critics enjoyed ''The Phantom of the Opera'', with an average score of 5/10. "The music of the night has hit something of a sour note: Critics are calling the screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s popular musical histrionic, boring, and lacking in both romance and danger," the consensus read. "Still, some have praised the film for its sheer spectacle."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/phantom_of_the_opera/| title=Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref> By comparison, ''[[Metacritic]]'' calculated an average score of 40/100 from its 39 reviews collected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/phantomoftheopera|title=Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref>

Despite having been impressed with the cast, [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' wrote that "Teen romance and operetta-style singing replace the horror elements familiar to film-goers, and director Joel Schumacher obscures any remnants of classy stage spectacle with the same disco overkill he brought to ''[[Batman Forever]]''."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Jonathan Rosenbaum]]|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-phantom-of-the-opera/Film?oid=1053502|title=The Phantom of the Opera|work=[[Chicago Reader]]|date=2004-12-20| accessdate=2009-10-06}}</ref> [[Stephanie Zacharek]] of ''[[Salon.com]]'' believed that ''Phantom of the Opera'' "takes everything that's wrong with Broadway and puts it on the big screen in a gaudy splat."<ref>{{cite news|author=Stephanie Zacharek|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/review/2004/12/22/phantom/index.html|title=The Phantom of the Opera|work=[[Salon.com]]|date=2004-12-22|accessdate=2009-10-06}}</ref>

In a mixed review for ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[David Ansen]] praised Emmy Rossum's performance, but criticised the film makers for their focus on visual design rather than presenting a cohesive storyline. "Its kitschy romanticism bored me on Broadway and it bores me here—I may not be the most reliable witness. Still, I can easily imagine a more dashing, charismatic Phantom than Butler's. Rest assured, however, Lloyd Webber's neo-[[Giacomo Puccini|Puccinian]] songs are reprised and reprised and reprised until you're guaranteed to go out humming."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[David Ansen]]|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/56147|title=The Phantom of the Opera: Into the Night|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=2004-12-20|accessdate=2009-10-09}}</ref> [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' believed Schumacher did not add enough dimension in adapting ''The Phantom of the Opera''. "Schumacher, the man who added nipples to Batman's suit, has staged Phantom chastely, as if his job were to adhere the audience to every note."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Owen Gleiberman]]|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1011985,00.html|title=The Phantom of the Opera|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2005-01-15|accessdate=2009-10-09}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] reasoned that "Part of the pleasure of movie-going is pure spectacle—of just sitting there and looking at great stuff and knowing it looks terrific. There wasn't much Schumacher could have done with the story or the music he was handed, but in the areas over which he held sway, he has triumphed."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Roger Ebert]]|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041221/REVIEWS/41201007|title=The Phantom of the Opera|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=2004-12-22|accessdate=2009-10-09}}</ref> In contrasting between the popularity of the Broadway musical, Michael Dequina of ''[[Film Threat]]'' magazine explained that "it conjures up this unexplainable spell that leaves audiences sad, sentimental, swooning, smiling—in some way transported and moved.

The '''Battle of Taranto''' took place on the night of 11–12 November 1940 during the [[World War II|Second World War]], between British Naval forces, under Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]], and Italian Naval forces, under Admiral [[Inigo Campioni]]. The [[Royal Navy]] launched the first all-aircraft ship-to-ship naval attack in history, flying a small number of obsolescent biplane [[torpedo bomber]]s from the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Illustrious|R87}} in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The attack struck the battle fleet of the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' at anchor in the harbour of [[Taranto]] using [[aerial torpedo]]es despite the shallow depth of the water in the harbour. The devastation wrought by the British carrier-launched aircraft on the large Italian warships was the beginning of the rise of the power of [[naval aviation]], over the big guns of battleships. According to Admiral Cunningham, "Taranto, and the night of November 11–12, 1940, should be remembered for ever as having shown once and for all that in the Fleet Air Arm the Navy has its most devastating weapon."<ref>Simpson, Michael (2004). ''A life of Admiral of the Fleet Andrew Cunningham. A Twentieth-century Naval Leader''. Routledge Ed., p. 74. ISBN 978-0-7146-5197-2</ref>

==Origins==
Long before the [[World War I|First World War]], the Italian Royal Navy's First Squadron was based at [[Taranto]]. In that period, the British Royal Navy developed plans for countering the power of the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Italian Navy). Blunting the power of any adversary in the Mediterranean Sea was an ongoing exercise. Plans for the capture of the port at Taranto were considered as early as the Italian invasion of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] in 1935.<ref name="steven">{{cite book|last=Stephen| first=Martin|title=Sea Battles in Close-up: World War 2|location=Shepperton, Surrey|publisher=Ian Allan|year=1988|pages=34–38|volume=Volume 1|isbn=0-7110-1596-1|coauthors=Grove, Eric (Ed)}}</ref>

In 1940–1941, [[Italian Army]] operations in [[North Africa]], based in [[Libya]], required a supply line from Italy. The British Army's [[Western Desert Campaign|North African Campaign]], based in Egypt, suffered from much greater supply difficulties. Supply [[convoy]]s to Egypt had to either cross the Mediterranean via [[Gibraltar]] and [[Malta]], and then approach the coast of [[Sicily]], or steam all the way around the [[Cape of Good Hope]], up the whole east coast of Africa, and then through the [[Suez Canal]], to reach [[Alexandria]]. Since the latter was a very long and slow route, this put the Italian fleet in an excellent position to interdict British supplies and reinforcements.

The British had won several actions, considerably upsetting the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] in the Mediterranean.{{clarify|date=August 2014}} Following the concept of a [[fleet in being]], the Italians usually kept their warships in harbour. The Italian fleet at Taranto was powerful: six [[battleship]]s (of which five were battleworthy), seven [[heavy cruiser]]s, two [[light cruiser]]s and eight [[destroyer]]s, making the threat of a [[sortie]] against British shipping a serious problem.

During the [[Munich Crisis]] of 1938, Admiral Sir [[Dudley Pound]], the commander of the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]], was concerned about the survival of the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Glorious||6}} in the face of Italian opposition in the Mediterranean. Pound ordered his staff to re-examine all plans for attacking Taranto.<ref name="steven"/> He was advised by the [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]] of ''Glorious'', [[Lumley Lyster|Arthur L. St.G. Lyster]], that her [[Fairey Aviation Company|Fairey]] [[Fairey Swordfish|TSR Swordfish]] were capable of a night attack, using [[aerial torpedo]]es. Indeed, the [[Fleet Air Arm]] was then the only [[naval aviation]] arm capable of it.<ref name="steven"/> Pound took Lyster's advice, and he ordered training to begin. Security was kept so tight there were no written records.<ref name="steven"/> Just a month before the war began, Pound knowingly advised his replacement, Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]], to consider the possibility. This came to be known as Operation ''Judgement''.<ref name="tarantoRN">{{cite web|title=Taranto 1940| work=Royal Navy official web site|publisher=royalnavy.mod.uk|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/history/battles/taranto/index.htm}}</ref>

The [[Battle of France|fall of France]] and the consequent loss of the [[French Mediterranean Fleet|French fleet in the Mediterranean]] (even before [[Attack on Mers-el-Kébir|Operation ''Catapult'']]) made redress essential. The older carrier, {{HMS|Eagle|1918|6}}, on Cunningham's strength, was ideal, possessing a very experienced air group composed entirely of obsolescent Swordfish aircraft. Three [[Gloster Gladiator|Sea Gladiator]]s were added for the operation.<ref name="steven"/> Firm plans were drawn up after the Italian Army halted at [[Sidi Barrani]], which freed up the British Mediterranean Fleet.<ref name="steven"/>

Operation ''Judgement'' was just a small part of the overarching [[Operation MB8|Operation ''MB8'']].<ref name= "steven"/> It was originally scheduled to take place on 21 October 1940, [[Trafalgar Day]], but a fire in an auxiliary fuel tank of one Swordfish led to a delay. (The {{convert|60|impgal|L USgal|abbr=on}} auxiliary tanks replaced the usual third crewman to extend the operating range of the aircraft enough to reach Taranto.) This minor fire spread into something more serious that destroyed two Swordfish.<ref name="steven"/> ''Eagle'' then suffered a breakdown in her fuel system,<ref name= "steven"/> so she was eliminated.

When the brand-new carrier {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}}, based at Alexandria, became available in the Mediterranean, she took on board five Swordfish from ''Eagle'', and launched the strike alone.<ref name="sturtivant">{{cite book|last=Sturtivant|first=Ray|year=1990|title= British naval aviation: the Fleet Air Arm 1917–1990|location=London|publisher=Arms & Armour Press Ltd|pages=48–50|isbn=0-85368-938-5}}</ref>

The complete naval [[task force]]—commanded by Rear Admiral Lyster,<ref name="steven"/> who had authored the plan of attack on Taranto—consisted of ''Illustrious'', the heavy cruisers {{HMS|Berwick|65|6}} and {{HMS|York|90|2}}, the light cruisers {{HMS|Gloucester|62|6}} and {{HMS|Glasgow|C21|2}}, and the destroyers {{HMS|Hyperion|H97|6}}, {{HMS|Ilex|D61|2}}, {{HMS|Hasty|H24|2}} and {{HMS|Havelock|H88|2}}.<ref>'The Aeroplane, Vol. LXXIII No. 1887, August 8, 1947, pg.154</ref> The 24<ref name="steven"/> attack Swordfish came from [[813 Naval Air Squadron|813]], [[815 Naval Air Squadron|815]], [[819 Naval Air Squadron|819]], and [[824 Naval Air Squadron]]s. The small number of attacking warplanes raised concern that ''Judgement'' would only alert and enrage the Italian Navy without achieving any significant results.<ref name="steven"/> ''Illustrious'' also had Fairey Fulmar [[fighter plane|fighter]]s of [[806 Naval Air Squadron]] aboard to provide air cover for the task force, with radar and fighter control systems.<ref>Wragg, David, ''Swordfish'', Weidenfiled & Nicholson, 2003, pp 78-79</ref>

Half of the Swordfish were armed with torpedoes as the primary strike aircraft, with the other half carrying [[aerial bomb]]s and flares to carry out diversions.<ref name="steven"/> These torpedoes were fitted with Duplex magnetic / contact [[exploder]]s, which were extremely sensitive to rough seas,<ref name="steven"/> as the attacks on the [[Kriegsmarine|German]] battleship {{Ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} later showed. There were also worries the torpedoes would bottom out in the harbour after being dropped.<ref name="steven"/> The loss rate for the bombers was expected to be fifty percent.<ref name="steven"/>

Several [[reconnaissance]] flights by [[Martin Maryland]] bombers (of the RAF's No. 431 General Reconnaissance Flight)<ref name="steven"/> flying from [[Malta]] confirmed the location of the Italian fleet. These flights produced photos on which the [[military intelligence|intelligence]] officer of ''Illustrious'' spotted previously unexpected [[barrage balloon]]s; the attack plan was changed accordingly.<ref name="steven"/> To make sure the Italian warships had not sortied, the British also sent over a [[Short Sunderland]] [[flying boat]] on the night of 11 November, just as the carrier task force was forming up about {{convert|170|nmi|lk=on|abbr=on}} from Taranto harbour, off the Greek island of [[Cephalonia]]. This reconnaissance flight alerted the Italian forces in southern Italy, but since they were without any [[radar]]s, they could do little but wait for whatever came along. The ''Regia Marina'' could conceivably have gone to sea in search of any British naval force, but this was distinctly against the naval philosophy of the Italians between January 1940 and September 1943.

The complexity of Operation ''MB8'', with its various forces and convoys, succeeded in deceiving the Italians into thinking only normal convoying was under way. This contributed to the success of ''Judgement''.<ref name="steven"/>

==The attack==
[[File:Battle of Taranto map-en.svg|thumb|right|Attack directions of the British planes]]

The first wave of 12 aircraft led by Lieutenant Commander M. W. Williamson RN of 815 Sqn., left ''Illustrious'' just before 21:00 hours on 11 November 1940, followed by a second wave of nine about 90 minutes later. Of the second wave, one turned back with a problem with its auxiliary fuel tank, and one aircraft launched 20 minutes late, after requiring emergency repairs to damage following a minor taxiing accident, so only eight aircraft made it to the target.

The first wave, which consisted of a mixture of six Swordfish armed with torpedoes and six with bombs, was split into two sections when three of the bombers and one torpedo bomber strayed from the main force while flying through thin clouds. The smaller group continued to Taranto independently. The main group approached the harbour at 22:58. A flare was dropped east of the harbour, then the flare dropper and another aircraft made a [[dive bombing]] attack to set fire to oil tanks. The next three aircraft, led by Lt Cdr K. Williamson RN of 815 Squadron, attacked over San Pietro Island, and struck the battleship {{Ship|Italian battleship|Conte di Cavour||2}} with a torpedo that blasted a {{convert|27|ft|m|abbr=on}} hole in her side below her waterline. Williamson's plane was immediately shot down by the Italian battleship's [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s.<ref name=fabio>[http://www.fabiosiciliano.it/htm/verdeguerra/pdf/notte.pdf ''La Notte di Taranto''] {{it icon}}</ref> The two remaining aircraft in this sub-flight continued, dodging barrage balloons and receiving heavy anti-aircraft fire from the Italian warships and shore batteries, to press home an unsuccessful attack on the battleship {{Ship|Italian battleship|Andrea Doria||2}}. The next sub-flight of three attacked from a more northerly direction, attacking the battleship {{Ship|Italian battleship|Littorio||2}}, hitting it with two torpedoes and launching one torpedo at the flagship—the battleship {{Ship|Italian battleship|Vittorio Veneto||2}}—which failed to hit its target. The bomber force led by Captain O. Patch RM attacked next. They found the targets difficult to identify but attacked two cruisers from {{convert|1500|ft|m|abbr=on}}<!--height or range?--> followed by another aircraft which straddled four destroyers.<ref name="sturtivant"/>

The second wave of nine aircraft led by Lt.-Cdr. J. W. Hale of 819 Sqn., was now approaching, two of the four bombers also carried flares, the remaining five carrying torpedoes. Flares were dropped shortly before midnight. Two aircraft aimed their torpedoes at ''Littorio'', one of which hit. One aircraft, despite having been hit twice by anti-aircraft fire, aimed a torpedo at ''Vittorio Veneto'' but the torpedo missed. One aircraft hit the battleship {{Ship|Italian battleship|Caio Duilio||2}} with a torpedo, blowing a large hole in her hull and flooding both of her forward [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|magazine]]s. The aircraft flown by Lieutenant G. W. L. A. Bayly RN was shot down by antiaircraft fire from the heavy cruiser {{Ship|Italian cruiser|Gorizia||2}}<ref name=fabio/> while following the attack on ''Littorio'', this being the only aircraft lost from the second wave. The final aircraft to arrive on the scene 15 minutes behind the others made a [[dive bombing]] attack on an Italian cruiser despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, and then made a safe exit, returning to ''Illustrious'' at 02:39.<ref name="sturtivant"/>

Of the two aircraft shot down, the two crew members of the first plane were taken prisoner. The other two died in their plane.<ref name="ANAM">{{cite book|last=Australian Naval Aviation Museum| title=Flying Stations: a story of Australian naval aviation|publisher=Allen & Unwin|year=1998| location=Sydney|page=23|isbn=1-86448-846-8}}</ref>

The Italian battleships suffered significant damage:
*''Conte di Cavour'' had a {{convert|12|x|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} hole in the hull, and in the six hours following the attack all the attempts to prevent her from sinking failed. She was subsequently raised and was still undergoing repairs when Italy switched sides in the war, so she never returned to service;<ref name= "santoni"/>
*''Caio Duilio'' had only a slightly smaller hole ({{convert|11|x|7|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and was saved by running her aground;<ref name="santoni"/>
*''Littorio'' had considerable flooding caused by three torpedo hits. Despite underwater protection, (the 'Pugliese' system, standard in all Italian battleships), the damage was extensive. She suffered 32 crewmen dead and many wounded. She was holed in three places, once on the port side ({{convert|7|x|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}), and twice on the starboard side ({{convert|15|x|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|12|x|9|m|ft|abbr=on}}). She too was saved by running her aground. Despite this, in the morning the ship's bows were totally submerged.<ref name="santoni"/>

Italian defences fired 13,489 shells from the land batteries, while several thousand were fired from the ships. The anti-aircraft barrage was formidable, having 101 guns and 193 machine-guns. There were also 87 balloons, but strong winds caused the loss of 60 of them. Only {{convert|4.2|km|nmi mi|abbr=on}} of anti-torpedo nets were actually fielded around the ships, up to {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} in depth, while the need was for {{convert|12.8|km|nmi mi|abbr=on}}. There were also 13 [[aerophonic]] stations and 22 searchlights (the ships had two searchlights each).<ref name="santoni"/> Denis Boyd, Commanding Officer, HMS ''Illustrious'' stated in his after-action report, "It is notable that the enemy did not use the searchlights at all during either of the attacks."<ref>Boyd's Report was attached to an Intelligence Report filed with the Office of Naval Intelligence by Lt. Commander John N. Opie, III, USN. Opie's report is found at the National Archives, Record Group 38, A-1-z/22863D.</ref>

''Littorio'' was later repaired with all available resources, while restoration of the older battleships proceeded at a much slower pace (seven months for ''Caio Duilio'', never completed for ''Conte di Cavour''). In all, the Swordfish attack was made with just 20 aircraft. Two Italian aircraft were destroyed by the bombing, and two unexploded bombs hit the cruiser {{Ship|Italian cruiser|Trento||2}} and the destroyer ''Libeccio''. Near misses damaged the destroyer ''Pessagno''.<ref name="santoni">Santoni, Alberto: ''L'attacco inglese a Taranto''. Rivista Italiana di Difesa. November 1990, p.88-95 {{it icon}}</ref>

Meanwhile, X-Force cruisers [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1940)|attacked an Italian convoy]]. This force had three cruisers ({{HMS|Ajax|22|6}}, {{HMS|Orion|85|2}} and {{HMAS|Sydney|D48|6}}) and two [[Tribal class destroyer (1936)|''Tribal''-class]] destroyers ({{HMS|Nubian|F36|6}} and {{HMS|Mohawk|F31|2}}). Just past midnight, they met and destroyed four Italian merchantmen (''Capo Vado'', ''Catalani'', ''Locatelli'' and ''Premuda''), damaging the torpedo-boat ''Fabrizi'', while the auxiliary cruiser ''[[Ramb III]]'' fled.<ref name="santoni"/>

Cunningham and Lyster wanted to strike Taranto again the next night with Swordfish (six torpedo-bombers, seven bombers, and two flare-dispensers), - one wag in the pilot's room remarked, "They only asked the Light Brigade to do it once!"<ref>Newton, Don & A. Cecil Hampshire, ''Taranto'', London, W. Kimber, 1959, p 165.</ref> - but bad weather prevented the action.<ref name="santoni"/>

==Aftermath==
The Italian fleet lost half of its capital ships in one night; the next day, the ''Regia Marina'' transferred its undamaged ships from Taranto to Naples to protect them from similar attacks.<ref name= "sturtivant"/> Repairs to ''Littorio'' took about five months, to ''Caio Duilio'' six months; ''Conte di Cavour'' required extensive salvage work and her repairs were incomplete when Italy changed sides in 1943.<ref>Playfair, Vol I, p, 237</ref> Cunningham wrote after the attack: "The Taranto show has freed up our hands considerably & I hope now to shake these damned Itiys up a bit. I don't think their remaining three battleships will face us and if they do I'm quite prepared to take them on with only two." Indeed, the balance of power had swung to the British Mediterranean Fleet which now enjoyed more operational freedom: when previously forced to operate as one unit to match Italian capital ships, they could now split into two battlegroups; each built around one aircraft carrier and two battleships.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Hara|first=Vincent|title=Struggle for the Middle Sea|year=2009|location=London|pages=65}}</ref>

Nevertheless, Cunningham's estimate that Italians would be unwilling to risk their remaining heavy units was quickly proven wrong. Only five days after Taranto, Campioni sortied with two battleships, six cruisers and 14 destroyers to disrupt [[Operation White|a supply convoy to Malta]]. The follow-up to this operation led to the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]] on 27 November 1940. Two of the three damaged battleships were repaired by mid-1941 and control of the Mediterranean continued to swing back and forth until the [[Italian armistice]] in 1943.

However, measured against its primary task of disrupting Axis convoys to Africa, the Taranto attack had very little effect. In fact, Italian shipping to Libya increased between the months of October 1940–January 1941 to an average of 49,435 tons per month, up from the 37,204-ton average of the previous four months.<ref>Bragadin, Italian Navy in World War II, p. 356.</ref> Moreover, rather than change the balance of power in the central Mediterranean, British naval authorities had "failed to deliver the true knockout blow that would have changed the context within which the rest of the war in the Mediterranean was fought."<ref>Caravaggio, p.122.</ref>

Aerial torpedo experts in all modern navies had previously thought that torpedo attacks against ships must be in water at least {{convert|75|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep.<ref>Christopher O'Connor ''Taranto, The Raid, The Observer, The Aftermath'' Dog Ear Publishing, 2010, page 79</ref> Taranto harbour had a depth of only about {{convert|39|ft|m|abbr=on}}; but the Royal Navy had developed a new method of preventing torpedoes from diving too deep. A drum was attached beneath the nose of the aircraft, from which a roll of wire led to the nose of the torpedo. As it dropped, the tension from the wire pulled up the nose of the torpedo, producing a belly-flop rather than a nose dive.<ref>Lowry, Thomas P. & Wellham, J. W. G. "The Attack on Taranto". Stackpole Books, 1995, pp. 38-39</ref>
 
===Influence on Pearl Harbor===
It is likely the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s staff carefully studied the Taranto raid during planning for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] because of the issues with a shallow harbour. Japanese Lt. Cdr. Takeshi Naito, the assistant naval attaché to Berlin, flew to Taranto to investigate the attack firsthand, and probably wrote a report, but no copy of such a report has ever been found. Naito subsequently had a lengthy conversation with Commander [[Mitsuo Fuchida]] about his observations in October 1941.<ref>Interview with Mitsuo Fuchida,  25 February 1964, Donald M. Goldstein Papers, Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh</ref> Fuchida led the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941. More significant, perhaps, was a Japanese Military Mission to Italy in May, 1941. Japanese Navy officers visited Taranto and had lengthy discussions with their Italian navy opposite numbers.<ref>Fioravanzo, Giuseppe. "The Japanese Military Mission to Italy," "USNI Proceedings", January, 1956, pp. 24-32</ref> However, the Japanese had been working on shallow-water solutions since early 1939, with various shallow ports as the notional targets, including Manila, Singapore, Vladivostok, and Pearl Harbor.<ref name=Peattie144>{{cite book |last=Peattie |first=Mark R. |title=Sunburst: The Rise of Japanese Naval Air Power, 1909–1941 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |page=144 |year=2007 |isbn=9781591146643}}</ref> In the early 1930s, the Japanese were using a breakaway wooden nose to soften the torpedo's impact with the water.<ref name=Peattie144/> By mid-1941, the Japanese, regardless of any contribution made by studying the Taranto attack, had, through hard work and careful testing, perfected breakaway wooden fins for added aerial stability.<ref>Peattie 2007, p. 145.</ref>

The Japanese air attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, was a considerably larger operation than Taranto with six [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] fleet carriers, each one carrying an air wing that was more than double the planes that a British carrier had. It hence resulted in far more devastation, sinking or disabling seven American battleships, and seriously damaging other warships. However, the Japanese raid on the [[United States Pacific Fleet]] did not alter the balance of power in the Pacific in the same way that the attack on Taranto did in the Mediterranean Sea. The leaders of the U.S. Navy were forced to modernize their thinking and make [[aircraft carriers]] - which were untouched at Pearl Harbor - their [[capital ship]]s in naval warfare planning. Compared with the Italian battleships that were a threat in the narrow confines of the Mediterranean, the US Navy's [[Standard type battleship|battleship]]s which survived the raid proved to be of limited use in the vast expanse of the [[Pacific Ocean]], operating primarily as fire support for amphibious landings as they were too slow to escort the carriers.

The '''Exposition Universelle''' of 1900 was a [[world's fair]] held in [[Paris]], France, from 15 April to 12 November 1900, to celebrate the achievements of the past century and to accelerate development into the next. The style that was universally present in the Exposition was ''[[Art Nouveau]]''. The fair, visited by nearly 50 million, displayed many machines, inventions, and architecture that are now nearly universally known, including the [[Grande Roue de Paris]] [[Ferris wheel]], [[Matryoshka doll|Russian nesting dolls]], [[diesel engine]]s, [[Sound film|talking films]], [[escalator]]s, and the [[telegraphone]] (the first magnetic audio recorder).

==Background information==
The staging of the first [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|International Exhibition in 1855]] was motivated by a desire to re-establish pride and faith in the nation after a period of war.<ref name = "Allwood">Allwood, John. (1977), The Great Exhibitions, Great Britain: Cassell & Collier Macmillan Publishers, p. 7-107</ref> The succession of exhibitions followed in the same pattern; the regeneration of nationality after war.<ref name = "Allwood" />  Eight years before the launch of the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle the Republic of France announced the exhibition to be one which welcomed and celebrated the coming of a new century.<ref name = "Allwood" /> Countries from around the world were invited by France to showcase their achievements and lifestyles; the Exposition Universelle was a uniting and learning experience.<ref name = "Allwood" /> It presented the opportunity for foreigners to realize the similarities between nations as well as the unique differences. New cultures were experienced and an overall better understanding of the values each country had to offer was gained. The learning atmosphere aided in the attempts to increase cultural tolerance, necessary after a period of war.
The early announcement and the massively positive response disenchanted the interest that had been circling around the first German International Exposition.<ref name = "Allwood" /> The support for the exhibition was widespread, countries immediately began to plan their exhibits, but despite the enthusiasm the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle was not a financial success as only two thirds of the expected public was in attendance.<ref name = "Allwood" /> It is suspected that the Exposition Universelle did not do as financially well as expected because the general public did not have the funds to participate in the fair.<ref name = "Allwood" />

==Financial implications==
The 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle was so expensive to organize and run that the cost per visitor ended up being about six hundred [[francs]] more than the price of admission.<ref name = "Allwood" /> The exhibition lost a grand total of 82,000 francs after six months in operation.<ref name = "Allwood" /> Many Parisians had invested money in shares sold to raise money for the event and therefore lost their investment.<ref name = "Allwood" /> With a much larger expected turn out the exhibit sites had gone up in value.<ref name = "Allwood" /> Continuing to pay rent for the sites became increasingly hard for concessionaires as they were receiving fewer customers than anticipated.<ref name = "Allwood" /> The concessionaires went on strike, which ultimately resulted in the closure of a large part of the exposition.<ref name = "Allwood" /> To resolve the matter, the concessionaires were given a fractional refund of the rent they had paid.<ref name = "Allwood" /> The financial consequences of the 1900 Exposition Universelle were devastating for many Parisians and led to the decision to end the streak of international fairs with the 1900 loss.<ref name = "Allwood" />

== Achievements ==
The Exposition Universelle was where talking films and escalators were first publicized, and where Campbell's Soup was awarded a gold medal (an image of which still appears on many of the company's products). At the Exposition [[Rudolf Diesel]] exhibited his diesel engine, running on [[Vegetable oil used as fuel|peanut oil]]. Brief films of excerpts from opera and ballet are apparently the first films exhibited publicly with projection of both image and recorded sound. The Exposition also featured many [[panoramic painting]]s and extensions of the panorama technique, such as the [[Cinéorama]], [[Mareorama]], and [[Trans-Siberian Railway Panorama]].

The centrepiece of the Palais de l'Optique was the {{convert|1.25|m|in|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900|"Great Exposition Refractor"]]. This telescope was the largest [[refracting telescope]] at that time. The optical tube assembly was 60 meters long and 1.5 meters in diameter and was fixed in place due to its mass. Light from the sky was sent into the tube by a movable 2-meter mirror.

The Paris Expo included a  "Negro exposition" (''Exposition Nègres d'Amerique''), during which photos by [[Frances Benjamin Johnston]], a friend of [[Booker T. Washington]], of his black students of the [[Hampton Institute]] were presented.<ref name=Maxwell>Anne Maxell, "Montrer l'Autre: Franz Boas et les soeurs Gerhard", in ''Zoos humains.

Du Bois]], this exhibition aimed at showing [[African Americans]]' positive contributions to American society.<ref name=Maxwell/> Additionally, at a time when [[lynchings]] in the US were peaking, a [[human zoo]] diorama was also present at the exposition, entitled "Living in Madagascar".

Many of the buildings constructed for the Exposition Universelle were demolished after the conclusion of the exposition. Many of the buildings and statues of the world’s fair were made of staff, a low-cost temporary building material invented in Paris in 1876, which consisted of jute fiber, plaster of Paris, and cement. Often the temporary buildings were built on a framework of wood, and covered with staff, which was formed into columns, statuary, walls, stairs, etc. After the fair was over, the buildings were demolished and all items and materials that could be salvaged and sold were “recycled”.

The [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finnish]] Pavilion at the Exposition was designed by the architectural firm of [[Gesellius, Lindgren, and Saarinen]]. It was published in ''Dekorative Kunst 3'' (1900): 457-63, and in ''L'Architecture à l'Exposition Universelle de 1900'', p.&nbsp;65, Pl. X. Paris: Librairies-Imprimeries Réunies, 1900.

A special committee, led by [[Gustave Eiffel]], awarded a gold medal to [[Lavr Proskuryakov]]'s project for the [[Yenisei Bridge in Krasnoyarsk]].

Russian sparkling wine defeated all the French entries to claim the internationally coveted "Grand Prix de Champagne".<ref>[http://www.odessagne.co.uk/about.htm Odessagne Sparkling - Award Winning Wines from the Odessa Vines - 1900 Grand Prix de Champagne.]</ref> The exposition also was the showcasing of another Russian entry, the widely famous Matryoshka doll (Russian Nesting Doll).

==Appearance of Art Nouveau==
The [[Art Nouveau]] (“New Art”) style began to develop in the 1880s and became fashionable in Europe and the United States during the 1890s.<ref name = "Gontar">Gontar, Cybele. (2006), "Art Nouveau", Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. Retrieved from: http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/artn/hd_artn.htm</ref> The art form takes inspiration from the natural world, drawing references from botanical studies and deep sea organisms.<ref name = "Gontar" /> Fluid twisting, curving lines and a “whiplash” effect are the trademarks of the natural art form.<ref name = "Gontar" /> The art form took shape in works ranging from painting to sculpture and most notably architecture, appearing famously throughout the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle.<ref name = "Gontar" /> Structures such as the Porte Monumentale entrance, the Pavillon Bleu and the Grand and Petit Palais were largely oriented around the Art Nouveau theme.<ref name = "Gontar" /> Though Art Nouveau was showcased in the 1900 Exposition it was minutely used in the 1889 Paris Exposition by Emile Galle in a glass work project.<ref name = "Allwood" /> The small piece was the beginning of a massive fair to come based very much on the art form.

==Popular exhibits==
[[File:Jeton de l'Exposition Universelle de 1900 se tenant à Paris.jpg|thumb|Exposition Universelle]]
* '''La Porte Monumental Paris: The Triumphal Gateway of the Place de la Concord'''
The architect René Binet created the triumphal gateway, La Porte Monumental Paris, on the Place de la Concord as a whimsical piece of art and a means to attain tickets.<ref name = "Jullian">Jullian, Philipe. (1974), The Triumph of Art Nouveau: Paris Exhibition 1900, New York, New York: Larousse & Co, p. 38-83</ref> The gateway consisted of a dome and three arches, housed the fifty six ticket offices for the exhibition visitors.<ref name = "Jullian" /> As a work of art, the monumental gateway was ornate, strange and 'lacking in taste' and considered by exhibition goers to be the ugliest of all the exhibits.<ref name = "Jullian" /> The prow of a boat protrudes from the middle of the main arch, directly under the fifteen foot Parisienne statue perched atop the structure.<ref name = "Jullian" /> Adding to the overall dislike of La Porte Monumental Paris was the Parisienne, made by Moreau-Vauthier.<ref name = "Jullian" /> The Parisienne was ‘regarded as the triumph of prostitution’ because of her flowing robe and modernized figure and was criticized by many visitors of the triumphal gateway.<ref name = "Allwood" />

The structure as a whole was adorned with Byzantine motifs and Persian ceramic ornamentation, but the true inspiration behind the piece was not of cultural background.<ref name = "Jullian" /> Binet sought inspiration from the science, tucking the vertebrae of a dinosaur, the cells of a beehive, rams, peacocks, and poppies into the design alongside other animalistic stimulus.<ref name = "Jullian" /> La Porte Monumental Paris is considered to be a structure of the [[Salammbô]] style and ‘the most typically 1900 monument of the entire exhibition'.<ref name = "Jullian" /> The controversial gateway became known as ``La Salamanda`` among the public because it resembled the stocky and intricately designed salamander-stoves at the time, only adding to its ridicule.<ref name = "Allwood" />

* '''The Grand Palais'''
The [[Grand Palais]], a heavy stone structure on the outside and a light iron and glass arena on the inside, held in it ‘an exhibition hall for sculptures, a track for horse shows, and the Motor Show’.<ref name = "Jullian" /> The Grand Palais combined history and modern elements together; the exterior was reminiscent of the [[Neo-baroque|Neo-Baroque]] style, which focused on the glory of empires, paired with the interior, designed as an [[Art Nouveau]] inspired atmosphere.<ref name = "Jullian" /> The most recognized Art Nouveau structure within the Grand Palais is the iron staircase whose railings are intricately woven in fluid, organic shapes.<ref name = "Allwood" />

* '''The Petit Palais'''
The Art Nouveau inspired structure, the [[Petit Palais]], was constructed by the architect Giraud.<ref name = "Jullian"/> The Petit Palais was constructed to hold the exhibition of French art, but is known mainly for its Art Nouveau inspired iron work and general design.<ref name = "Jullian" /> Much like the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais combines the styles of Neo-Baroque and Art Nouveau.<ref name = "Jullian"/> Giraud’s palais is reminiscent of the Grand Trianon and the stable at Chantilly.<ref name = "Jullian" /> The widely loved entranceway was painted by Albert Besnard and Paul Albert Laurens, and is known to be the only artifact of decorative troupes.<ref name = "Jullian"/> The intricately designed iron flowed into a seamless pattern and paired with the colonnade of pink marble drew in visitors.<ref name = "Jullian"/> The piece was associated with the French pavilion.<ref name = "Jullian" />

* '''The Palace of Electricity: Palais de l`Électrique'''
The Palace of Electricity moderated all the energy flowing from one exhibit to the other, each exhibit was dependent on the palace in order to run.<ref name = "Jullian" /> The Palace of Electricity itself was fitted with five thousand multi-coloured incandescent lamps and eight monumental lamps on its massive one hundred and thirty meter breadth and seventy meter height.<ref name = "Jullian" /> Steam driven dynamos pumped the fuel necessary in running the entire exhibition and they were put on display attached to the Palais de l`Électricité.<ref name = "Allwood" /> It was a glowing beacon of life in the exposition quickly becoming the heart of the fair.<ref name = "Jullian" /> Aside from the machinery involved in the palace’s attraction people were drawn to its exterior decorations. The top of the building is ornamented with the figure of a chariot led by [http://www.mythicalcreaturesguide.com/page/Hippogriffs hippogryphs] and spews multi-coloured flames.<ref name = "Jullian"/> People were drawn to its extravagant performance and the amount of work needed to run the fair itself. The Palais de l`Electricité was one of the most loved exhibits of the exhibition.  The architects were Eugène Hénard and [[Edmond Paulin]].

==Foreign pavilions and events==
[[File:Paris Exposition Tour du Monde and Siamese Pavilion, Paris, France, 1900 n2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Tour du Monde pavilions displaying oriental architectures; such as Siam, Japan, and India]]
Each country funded, designed and on occasion constructed their pavilions, carrying the burden of some of the cost of the fair and the also the glory that followed in the praise of their homeland contributions.<ref  name = "Allwood"  /> The British Royalty pavilion, one of the largest exhibits, consisted of a mock-Elizabethan mansion decorated pictures and furniture, constructed by Sir Edwin Lutyens.<ref name = "Allwood" /> The pavilion was intended to provide the Commissioner with an Englishman's castle on the site of the exposition.<ref name = "Allwood" /> The public found it to be less grand and were aware that the intention of the exhibit was not for the public, therefore recognizing it as more of an annoyance than an exhibit.<ref name = "Allwood" /> The German pavilion, the second largest exhibit, was held in a large tower resembling a beer-hall, made out of wood and stained glass, inspired by Kaiser Wilhelm II who was in power at the time.<ref name = "Jullian" /> Inside the tower Germany presented the comfortable living of the country through the display of their passenger-liners and their successfully growing merchant navy through the pictorial reference of the scale model of the Rothe Sand lighthouse in Germany.<ref name = "Jullian"/> “[T]he colossal vestibule of the German section on the Esplanade des Invalides…the rooms fully furnished by the upholsterers and cabinet-makers of Berlin and Munich; the colossal pavilion of machines; the colossal installations of the metallurgy and agriculture sections…” said Andre Hallays of the German pavilion.<ref name = "Jullian" />

[[File:Paris Exposition, map in 1900.jpg|thumb||upright|left|Paris Exposition, map in 1900]]

The most ornate and whimsical pavilions were those of the Austrian domains in the Balkans, Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name = "Jullian"/> They offered displays on their lifestyles, consisting of; folklore traditions, highlighting peasant hood and the embroidery goods produced in the country.<ref name = "Jullian" /> The Austrian pavilion succeeded in uniting the styles of Art Nouveau and Classicism through their embroidered goods and decorated palace. The Hungarian cupola displayed mainly their skillful agricultural produce and hunting equipment.<ref name = "Jullian"/> Finland claimed the most revolutionary exhibit with its clean cut, simple and careful details.<ref name = "Allwood" /> Sweden's yellow and red structure covered in pine shingles drew much attention with its bright, welcoming colours and was a crowd favourite.<ref name = "Allwood" />

The American pavilion, contrastingly, attracted negative interest among those that were not from the United States.<ref name = "Allwood" /> The exhibit, a post office inspired building resembling the structures of Chicago, became a base for American visitors and offered little for foreigners to enjoy.<ref name = "Allwood" /> American [[Loie Fuller]] performed shows in her own theatre, a dance routine aided by coloured lights and costume.<ref name = "Allwood" /> Fuller's intention was to bring the Art Nouveau female, [[Salome|Salomé]], to life.<ref name = "Allwood" /> Fuller's performance helped introduce revolutionary audio-visual entertainment precursors of early motion picture equipment.<ref name = "Allwood" /> Fuller was filmed on ten 70mmm projectors that created a three hundred and thirty degree picture, patented [[Cinéorama]].<ref name = "Allwood" /> Cinéorama used ``handcoloured films, phonograph music and live commentary`` to bring to life Loie Fuller as the Art Nouveau figure, Salomé.<ref name = "Allwood" />

Tour du Monde pavilion displaying collection of exotic oriental architectures, such as the [[Thailand|Siamese]] pavilion, [[T?|Japanese pagoda]], and [[India]]n pavilion.

The 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle hosted the first [[Olympic Games]] outside of Greece.<ref name = "Allwood" /> The event was crafted to fully complete the expectations of the exposition’s broad scope of interests.<ref name = "Allwood" /> The games were few and winners were given tie-pins and pencils alongside one hundred francs used to buy their own medals.<ref name = "Allwood" /> The exposition held also a dinner for the French President, M. Loubert, and twenty thousand, seven hundred and seventy seven Mayors in attendance to the fair.<ref name = "Allwood" /> The dinner was prepared in eleven kitchens and served to six hundred and six widespread tables, the orders and needs of each table supervised by telephone and vehicle.<ref name = "Allwood" /> The enormous dinner was reviewed as a show of the unity and success of the French Republic.<ref name = "Allwood" />

== Colonial Exhibitions ==
Included in the exposition were various exhibitions of French colonies, particularly those of Sub-Saharan Africa. These exhibits were used to exemplify African primitiveness against French power, technology, and culture.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Races on Display: French Representations of Colonized peoples, 1886-1940|last = Hale|first = Dana S.|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 0253218993|location = Indiana, USA|pages = 23-46}}</ref> Miniature villages with African people participating in "authentic" activities such as art, music, and military were meant to educate and entertain the French public.

[[File:General scheme ionic prop.png|thumb|600px|General scheme ionic propagation. Propagating center can be radical, cationic or anionic.]]
In [[polymer chemistry]], '''ring-opening polymerization''' ('''ROP''') is a form of [[chain-growth polymerization]], in which the terminal end of a [[polymer]] chain acts as a [[reactive center]] where further [[cyclic compound|cyclic monomers]] can react by opening its ring system and form a longer polymer chain (see figure). The propagating center can be [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]], [[anion]]ic or [[cation]]ic. Some cyclic monomers such as [[norbornene]] or [[cyclooctadiene]] can be [[polymerization|polymerized]] to high [[molecular mass|molecular weight]] polymers by using metal [[Catalysis|catalysts]]. ROP continues to be the most versatile method of synthesis of major groups of [[biopolymer]]s, particularly when they are required in quantity.

The driving force for the ring-opening of cyclic monomers is via the relief of [[ring strain|bond-angle strain]] or [[steric effects|steric repulsions]] between atoms at the center of a ring. Thus, as is the case for other types of polymerization, the [[enthalpy]] change in ring-opening is negative.<ref name=Young>{{cite book|last=Young|first=Robert J.|title=Introduction to Polymers|year=2011|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=978-0-8493-3929-5}}</ref>

[[cyclic compound|Cyclic monomers]] that are polymerized using ROP encompass a variety of structures, such as:
*[[alkanes]], [[alkenes]], 
*compounds containing [[heteroatoms]] in the ring: 
**[[oxygen]]: [[ethers]], [[acetals]], [[esters]] ([[lactones]], [[lactides]], and [[carbonates]]), and [[anhydrides]], 
**[[sulfur]]: polysulfur, [[sulfides]] and [[polysulfides]], 
**[[nitrogen]]: [[amine]]s, [[amide]]s (lactames), [[imides]], N-carboxyanhydrides and 1,3-oxaza derivatives, 
**[[phosphorus]]: [[phosphates]], [[phosphonates]], [[phosphites]], [[phosphines]] and phosphazenes, 
**[[silicon]]: [[siloxanes]], silathers, carbosilanes and [[silanes]].

==History==
'''Ring-opening polymerization''' ('''ROP''') has been used since the beginning of the 1900s in order to synthesize [[polymer]]s. Synthesis of [[polypeptides]] which has the oldest history of ROP, dates back to the work in 1906 by Leuchs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Leuchs|first=H.|journal=Ber.|year=1906|volume=39|page=857}}</ref>  Many years later came the method of the ROP of anhydro [[sugars]], providing [[polysaccharides]], including synthetic [[dextran]], [[xanthan gum]], [[welan gum]], [[gellan gum]], diutan gum, and [[pullulan]]. Mechanisms and thermodynamics of ring-opening polymerization was further established in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dainton|first=F. S.|author2=Devlin, T. R. E. |author3=Small, P.

Nowadays, ROP plays an important role in industry such as production of [[nylon-6]]. ROP can introduce [[functional group]]s such as [[ether]], [[ester]], [[amide]], and [[carbonate]] into the polymer main chain, which cannot be achieved by [[vinyl polymer]]ization affording polymers only with C-C main chain. Polymers obtained by ROP can be also prepared by [[polycondensation]] in most cases, but following [[controlled radical polymerization]] is possible in ROP, which is difficult in polycondensation. 
Recently, development of novel [[monomer]]s and [[Catalysis|catalysts]] has enabled polymer chemists to control [[molecular mass|molecular weights]], structure, and configuration of the polymers precisely.<ref>{{cite book|last=Luck|first=edited by Rajender K.

Recently, ultra high molecular weight bisphenol A polycarbonate (> 2,000 kDa) has been synthesized by ROP of a large-membered bisphenol A-based [[cyclic carbonate]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sugiyama|first=J|author2=R. Nagahata |author3=M. Goyal |author4=M. Asai |author5=M. Ueda |author6=K. Takeuchi |journal=ACS polym. Prepr.|year=1998|volume=40|series=1|page=90}}</ref> The resulted polymer can be used as engineering plastics due to its thermal stability and high impact resistance.
When the reactive center of the propagating chain is a [[carbocation]], the polymerization is called '''cationic ring-opening polymerization'''.

==Mechanisms of ROP==
Ring-opening polymerization can proceed via [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]], anionic or cationic polymerization as described below in more details.  ROP can involve metal [[Catalysis|catalysts]] too and is best exemplified by the polymerization of [[Alkene|olefins]] while maintaining [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturation]] in the resulting polymer.  This mechanism is known as [[Ring-opening metathesis polymerisation|ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP)]].

===Radical ring-opening polymerization===
{{main|Radical polymerization}}

With radical ring-opening polymerization, it is possible to produce polymers of the same or lower density than the monomers. This is important for applications that require constant volume after polymerization, such as [[Dental restoration|tooth fillings]], coatings, and the molding of electrical and electronic components.<ref name=nuyken>{{cite journal|last=Nuyken|first=Oskar|author2=Stephen D. Pask |title=Ring-Opening Polymerization—An Introductory Review|journal=Polymers|date=25 April 2013|volume=5|pages=361–403|doi=10.3390/polym5020361}}</ref>  Additionally, radical ROP is useful in producing polymers with [[functional group]]s incorporated in the backbone chain that cannot otherwise be synthesized via conventional [[chain-growth polymerization]] of [[vinyl]] monomers. For instance, radical ROP can produce polymers with [[ethers]], [[esters]], [[amide]]s, and [[carbonates]] as functional groups along the main chain.<ref name=nuyken /><ref name=dubois>{{cite book|last=Dubois|first=Philippe|title=Handbook of ring-opening polymerization|year=2008|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|isbn=978-3-527-31953-4|edition=1.

[[Radical polymerization|Free radical polymerization]] techniques have been recently developed to control radical ROPs, thereby controlling the [[Molecular mass|molecular weight]] of the synthesized polymer chains. [[Reversible addition?fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization|Reversible Addition Fragmentation Transfer (RAFT)]] has been applied to radical ROP of a cyclopropane monomer.<ref name=dubois /> For instance, the RAFT polymerization of the [[cyclic compound|cyclic monomer]] to synthesize polymers with [[anthracene]] along the backbone chain has been demonstrated.<ref name=mori />

Examples of monomers that undergo radical ROP include vinyl substituted cyclic monomers, [[methylene group|methylene]] substituted cyclic monomers, bicyclobutanes, spiro monomers (which undergo double ring-opening). Degradable [[polyester]] can be synthesized via radical ring-opening homo- and [[copolymer]]ization.<ref name=nuyken />

A recent hot topic among scientists has been the study of radical ROP to undergo copolymerization for the production of [[copolymers]] with ketoester linkages in the main chain. The goal is to synthesize a final copolymer that is both [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyzable]] and [[Photodegradation|photodegradable]].<ref name=dubois />

====Mechanism====
In free radical ROP, the [[cyclic compound|cyclic]] structure will undergo [[Homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic dissociation]] rather than undergoing [[Heterolysis (chemistry)|heterolytic dissociation]] (as is the case for any ionic ROP). There are two typical mechanistic schemes in radical ROP.

'''Scheme 1:'''  The terminal vinyl group accepts a [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]]. The radical will be transformed into a [[carbon]] radical stabilized by [[functional group]]s (i.e. [[halogen]], [[aromaticity|aromatic]], or [[ester]] groups). This will lead to the generation of an internal [[Alkene|olefin]].

[[File:Grace figure revised.tif|thumb|800px|center|Radical ring-opening polymerization of vinyl cyclopropane]]

'''Scheme 2:'''  In this case, the [[methylene group|exo-methylene group]] is the radical [[electron acceptor|acceptor]]. The ring-opening reaction will form an ester bond, and the radical produced is stabilized by a [[phenyl group]].<ref name=dubois />

===Anionic ring-opening polymerization===
{{main|Anionic polymerization}}
[[File:Wiki566665.tif|thumb|400px|The general mechanism for anionic ring-opening polymerization. Polarized functional group is represented by X-Y, where the atom X (usually a carbon atom) becomes electron deficient due to the highly electron-withdrawing nature of Y (usually an oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, etc.). The nucleophile will attack atom X, thus releasing Y-. The newly formed nucleophile will then attack the atom X in another monomer molecule, and the sequence would repeat until the polymer is formed.<ref name=dubois />]]
Anionic ring-opening polymerizations (AROP) are ring-opening polymerizations that involve [[nucleophile|nucleophilic reagents]] as initiators. Monomers with a three-member ring structure - such as [[epoxide]], [[aziridine]], and [[episulfide]] - are able to undergo anionic ROP due to the ring-distortion, despite having a less [[electrophile|electrophilic]] functional group (e.g. [[ether]], [[amine]], and [[thioether]]). These [[cyclic compound|cyclic monomers]] are important for many practical applications. The [[polar effect|polarized]] [[functional group]] in cyclic monomers is characterized by one [[atom]] (usually a carbon) that is [[Electron deficiency|electron-deficient]] due to an adjacent atom that is highly [[deactivating groups|electron-withdrawing]] (e.g. [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]] etc.) Ring-opening will be triggered by the nucleophilic attack of the initiator to the carbon, forming a new species that will act as a [[nucleophile]]. The sequence will repeat until the polymer is formed.<ref name=dubois />

A typical example of anionic ROP is that of [[caprolactone|?-caprolactone]], initiated by an [[alkoxide]] functional group.<ref name=dubois />
[[File:Wiki65656.tif|thumb|600px|center|The anionic ring-opening polymerization of ? - caprolactone, initiated by alkoxide function]]

====Initiation====
Common [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] reagents used for the initiation of AROP usually will include [[organometallics|organometals]] (e.g. [[Organolithium reagent|alkyl lithium]], alkyl magnesium bromide, alkyl aluminum, etc.), metal [[amide]]s, [[alkoxides]], [[phosphines]], [[amine]]s, [[alcohols]] and water. The monomers that undergo AROP will contain [[polar bond|polarized bonds]] ([[ester]] [[carbonate]], [[amide]], [[urethane]], and [[phosphate]]), which respectively leads to the production of the corresponding [[polyester]], [[polycarbonate]], [[polyamide]], [[polyurethane]] and [[polyphosphate]].<ref name=dubois />

Monomer rings that are unsymmetrically substituted will open with [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] attack on the least substituted carbon atom.<ref name=nuyken />

====Propagation====
The general mechanism of propagation for anionic ROP relies on the [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] attack of a propagating chain end to a monomer.

Another possible mechanism for propagation is the [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] attack of an activated monomer to the growing chain end. [[caprolactam|?-caprolactam]] and N-carboxyanhydride undergo this kind of mechanism.<ref name=dubois />

====Transfer and termination====
Termination in AROP can be described as [[chain transfer]] reactions to monomer that is available. The [[Active center (polymer science)|active centers]] of AROP monomers are [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] and also act as [[base (chemistry)|bases]] to abstract [[proton]]s from the monomer, initiating new chains. Thus, AROP often results in low [[molecular mass|molecular-weight]] polymers. A possible method to increase the molecular mass of the polymer products is by adding [[crown ether]]s as [[Chelation|complexing agents]] for [[Counterion|counter-ions]] in the polymerization system. This causes the free-ions to preferentially add to monomer rather than abstract protons.<ref name=nuyken />

===Cationic ring-opening polymerization===
{{main|Cationic polymerization}}

Cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) is characterized by having a cationic initiator and intermediate.  Examples of [[cyclic compound|cyclic monomers]] that polymerize through this mechanism include [[lactone]]s, [[lactam]]s, [[amine]]s, and [[ether]]s.<ref name="cowie cation">{{cite book|last=Cowie|first=John McKenzie Grant|title=Polymers: Chemistry and Physics of Modern Materials|year=2008|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=978-0-8493-9813-1|pages=105–107}}</ref> CROP proceeds through an [[SN1 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>1]] or [[SN2 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>2]] propagation, chain-growth process.<ref name=nuyken>{{cite journal|last=Nuyken|first=Oskar|author2=Stephen D. Pask |title=Ring-Opening Polymerization - An Introductory Review|journal=Polymers|year=2013|volume=5|pages=361–403|doi=10.3390|accessdate=2 February 2014}}</ref>  The predominance of one mechanism over the other depends on the stability of the resulting [[ion|cationic]] species.  For example, if the atom bearing the positive charge is stabilized by [[activating group|electron-donating groups]], polymerization will proceed by the S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism.<ref name=dubois />   The cationic species is an [[heteroatom]] and the chain grows by the addition of cyclic monomers thereby opening the ring system.
[[File:Cationic ROP..png|thumb|center|900px|S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanisms of CROP.]]

Not all cyclic monomers containing an heteroatom undergo CROP.  Ring size influences whether the cyclic monomer polymerize through this mechanism.  For example, 4, 6 and 7-membered rings of cyclic [[esters]] polymerize through CROP.<ref name="controlled rop">{{cite book|last=Stridsberg|first=Kajsa M.|title=Controlled ring-opening polymerization : polymers with designed macromolecular architecture|year=2000|publisher=Tekniska högsk.|location=Stockholm|isbn=91-7170-522-8}}</ref> When considering the ring size of the monomer, the reactivity toward polymerization is dictated by the ability to release the [[ring strain]].  Therefore, cyclic monomers with small or lacking ring strain will not polymerize.<ref name="poly mat encyclo">{{cite book|title=Polymeric materials encyclopedia|year=1996|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=0-8493-2470-X|page=1931|editor=Joseph C. Salamone}}</ref>

====Initiation====
[[File:CROP initiation..png|thumb|700px|Initiation of CROP.]]
The monomers can be activated by [[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory|Bronsted acids]], [[carbenium ion]]s, [[Onium compound|onium ions]], [[photoinitiator]]s, and [[covalent bond|covalent]] initiators.<ref name=nuyken />

====Propagation====
The [[ion|cationic]] species is an [[heteroatom]] and the chain grows by the addition of [[cyclic compound|cyclic monomers]] thereby opening the ring system.

In CROP, three mechanisms are distinguished by the propagating species.<ref name=nuyken />
* When the [[ion|cationic]] species is a secondary ion, polymerization proceeds by ring expansion.  This mechanism is observed when the monomer is in low concentration.
* When it is a tertiary ion, polymerization proceeds by [[step-growth polymerization|linear growth]].
* The monomer can likewise be activated (i.e. cationic) and the propagation step will proceed via [[electrophilic addition]] of the activated monomer to the growing chain.

====Termination====
CROP can be considered as a [[living polymerization]] and can be terminated by intentionally adding termination reagents such as [[Alkoxy group|phenoxy anions]], [[phosphine]]s or [[Polyelectrolyte|polyanions]].<ref name=nuyken /> When the amount of monomers becomes depleted, termination can occur intra or intermolecularly.  The active end can "backbite" the chain, forming a [[macrocycle]].  [[Alkyl]] chain transfer is also possible, where the active end is quenched by transferring an alkyl chain to another polymer.

===Ring-opening metathesis polymerization===
{{main|Ring-opening metathesis polymerization}}
[[File:ROMP of olefin..png|thumb|400px|Ring opening metathesis polymerization of olefin.]]
[[Ring-opening metathesis polymerisation|Ring-opening metathesis polymerization]] (ROMP) is used for making [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] polymers from [[Alkene|olefin]] monomers that are typically [[cycloalkene]]s or bicycloalkenes.  It involves [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic catalysts]] of [[transition metals]] such as W, Mo, Re, Ru, and Ti [[Transition metal carbene complex|carbenes complexes]].<ref name="cowie romp">{{cite book|last=Arrighi|first=J.M.G. Cowie, Valeria|title=Polymers chemistry and physics of modern materials|year=2007|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=Boca Raton|isbn=978-0-8493-9813-1|pages=181–183|edition=3rd ed / J. M. G. Cowie and Valeria Arrighi}}</ref> Similarly, ROMP occurs for strained [[cyclic compound|cyclic monomers]].  The [[enthalpy]] for relieving the [[ring strain]] must be very favorable for ROMP to occur because the [[entropy]] decreases during polymerization (see [[Gibbs free energy]]).  Cyclic [[alkene]]s of 5, 7, and 8 member rings, for example, undergo ROMP at room temperature, whereas the 6 member ring analog does not.<ref name=nuyken />

The mechanism for ROMP follows similar pathways as [[olefin metathesis]].  The initiation process involves the coordination of the cycloalkene monomer to the [[Transition metal carbene complex|metal alkylidene complex]], followed by a [2+2] type [[cycloaddition]] to form the metallacyclobutane intermediate that cycloreverts to form a new alkylidene species.<ref name=sutthasupa>{{cite journal|last=Sutthasupa|first=Sutthira|author2=Shiotsuki, Masashi |author3=Sanda, Fumio |title=Recent advances in ring-opening metathesis polymerization, and application to synthesis of functional materials|journal=Polymer Journal|date=13 October 2010|volume=42|issue=12|pages=905–915|doi=10.1038/pj.2010.94}}</ref> This species can then propagate as shown in the figure.  The growing chain can be terminated by adding an [[alkene]], usually ethyl vinyl ether, to remove the polymer from the metal [[Catalysis|catalyst]].<ref name=sutthasupa /> 
[[File:Romp mechanism.png|thumb|center|850px|General scheme of the mechanism for ROMP.]]

Some commercially relevant [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] polymers are synthesized by ROMP, such as Norsorex ([[Norbornene|polynorbornene]]), Vestenamer (polycyclooctene), and Metton (polycyclopentadiene).

====Catalysts for ROMP====
{{See also|Olefin metathesis}}

The choice of [[catalysis|catalysts]] for ROMP will depend on their properties:<ref name=hartwig>{{cite book|last=Hartwig|first=John F.|title=Organotransition metal chemistry : from bonding to catalysis|year=2010|publisher=University Science Books|location=Sausalito, California|isbn=9781891389535}}</ref> 
*ability to control the polymer's [[molecular mass|molecular weight]] and [[Molar mass distribution|molecular weight distribution]],
*tolerance to high temperatures,
*ability to polymerize monomers with different [[functional group]]s,
*activity of the catalyst to sustain a [[living polymerization]]

Different catalysts have different properties.  Choosing the most suitable catalyst depends on the intended features of the resulting polymer.  For example:
* [[Olefin metathesis#Schrock catalysts|Schrock catalyst]]: tungsten- and molybdenum-based [[Homogeneous catalysis|homogeneous catalysts]] provide faster initiation and good control over [[Dispersity|polydispersity]] and chain [[tacticity]], but are limited by type of functional groups, thus type of monomers available.<ref name=allthingmetathesis>{{cite web|last=Boothe|first=Paul|title=Ring-opening metathesis polymerization|url=http://allthingsmetathesis.com/ring-opening-metathesis-polymerization/|work=All things metathesis|accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref> 
* [[Grubbs' catalyst|Grubbs catalyst]]: slower initiation and results in higher polydispersity but it's air-stable and a wider range of [[functional groups]] can be used.<ref name=allthingmetathesis />

==Copolymerization==
{{main|Copolymerization}}
[[File:Wiki333.tif|thumb|600px|Stoichiometric equation for ring-opening copolymerization]]
[[Copolymerization]] is the process of combining two polymers that are different. This is an industrial process that creates a substance that has long chains of molecules. In terms of ROP, the stoichiometric equation for copolymerization includes two or more of comonomers.

The following figure shows an example of such a copolymerization. By varying the ratio of monomers and the mode of initiation, many and varied polymers can be obtained, optimized for their use in agricultural, medicinal or pharmaceutical fields.
{{double image|center|Chakyoun_wikiproject_image1.png|350|Chakyoun_wikiproject_image2.png|400|Copolymerization of nonhomopolymerizable monomers, ?-butyrolactone (BL) and ?-caprolactone (CL).|Radical ring-opening copolymerization of a ketene acetal.}}

As an example of copolymerization of non-homopolymerizable monomers, [[?-butyrolactone]] (BL) and [[?-caprolactone]] (CL) show that the copolymerization provides high molar mass polymers: The BL/CL copolymer synthesis is viable despite the fact that BL monomer addition to its own –bl* active chain ends was highly reversible, as the –bl* unit could be blocked via a practically irreversible CL addition.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Duda|first=Andrzej|author2=Penczek, Stanislaw |author3=Dubois, Philippe |author4=Mecerreyes, David |author5= Jérôme, Robert |title=Oligomerization and copolymerization of ?-butyrolactone — a monomer known as unable to homopolymerize, 1.

Similarly, the earlier studies of S<sub>8</sub> copolymerization with [[thiiranes]] (propylene sulfide; PS), at temperatures below T<sub>f</sub> for S<sub>8</sub> homopolymerization, revealed that the average [[sulfur]] rank in the copolymer was increased from 1 to 7 when 8[S<sub>8</sub>]<sub>0</sub>/[PS]<sub>0</sub> ratio was increasing from 0 to 10.<ref>{{cite journal|last=PENCZEK|first=STANIS?AW|author2=?LAZAK, ROMUALD |author3=DUDA, ANDRZEJ |title=Anionic copolymerisation of elemental sulphur|journal=Nature|date=29 June 1978|volume=273|issue=5665|pages=738–739|doi=10.1038/273738a0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Duda|first=Andrzej|author2=Penczek, Stanislaw |title=Anionic copolymerization of elemental sulfur with propylene sulfide|journal=Macromolecules|date=January 1982|volume=15|issue=1|pages=36–40|doi=10.1021/ma00229a007}}</ref>

==Thermodynamics==

The ability of a [[cyclic compound|cyclic monomer]] to polymerize, using ROP is determined by two integral factors: the conversion of monomer molecules into [[macromolecules]] must be allowed both thermodynamically and kinetically. By practice, this means that: (i) monomer-macromolecule equilibrium must shift to the right-hand (macromolecules) side; and (ii) the corresponding polymerization mechanism should exist, which could enable conversion of the monomer molecules into the polymer repeating units, within the operable polymerization time.

The formal thermodynamic criterion of a given monomer polymerizability is related to a sign of the [[free enthalpy]] ([[Gibbs free energy]]) of polymerization:
:<math>\Delta G_p(xy) = \Delta H_p(xy)-T\Delta S_p(xy)</math>
where x and y indicate monomer and polymer states, respectively (x and/or y = l (liquid), g ([[gaseous]]), c ([[amorphous solid]]), c’ ([[crystalline solid]]), s ([[solution]])), ?H<sub>p</sub>(xy) and ?Sp(xy) are the corresponding [[enthalpy]] (SI unit: joule per kelvin) and [[entropy]] (SI unit: joule) of polymerization, and T is the absolute temperature (SI unit: kelvin).
The free [[enthalpy]] of polymerization (?G<sub>p</sub>) may be expressed as a sum of standard [[enthalpy]] of polymerization (?G<sub>p</sub>°) and a term related to instantaneous monomer molecules and growing [[macromolecules]] concentrations: 
:<math>\Delta G_p = \Delta G^\circ_p + RTln\frac{[...-(m)_{i+1} m^\ast]}{[M][...-(m)_i m^\ast]}</math>
where R is the [[gas constant]], M is the monomer, (m)<sub>i</sub> is the monomer in an initial state, and m<sup>*</sup> is the active monomer.
Following [[Flory–Huggins solution theory]] that the reactivity of an active center, located at a [[macromolecule]] of a sufficiently long macromolecular chain, does not depend on its [[degree of polymerization]] (DPi), and taking in to account that ?G<sub>p</sub>° = ?H<sub>p</sub>° - T?S<sub>p</sub>° (where ?H<sub>p</sub>° and ?S<sub>p</sub>° indicate a standard polymerization [[enthalpy]] and [[entropy]], respectively), we obtain:  
:<math>\Delta G_p = \Delta H^\circ_p - T(\Delta S^\circ_p + Rln[M])</math>
At [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] (?G<sub>p</sub> = 0), when polymerization is complete the monomer concentration ([M]<sub>eq</sub>) assumes a value determined by standard polymerization parameters (?H<sub>p</sub>° and ?S<sub>p</sub>°) and polymerization temperature:
:<math>[M]_{eq} = e^(\frac{\Delta H^\circ_p}{RT} - \frac{\Delta S^\circ_p}{R})</math>
:<math>ln(\frac{DP_n}{DP_n - 1}[M]_{eq}) = \frac{\Delta H^\circ_p}{RT} - \frac{\Delta S^\circ_p}{R}</math>
:<math>[M]_{eq} = \frac{DP_n - 1}{DP_n} e^(\frac{\Delta H^\circ_p}{RT} - \frac{\Delta S^\circ_p}{R})</math>
Polymerzation is possible only when [M]<sub>0</sub> > [M]<sub>eq</sub>. Eventually, at or above the so-called [[ceiling temperature]] (T<sub>c</sub>), at which [M]<sub>eq</sub> = [M]<sub>0</sub>, formation of the high polymer does not occur. 
:<math>T_c = \frac{\Delta H^\circ_p}{\Delta S^\circ_p + Rln[M]_0} ; (\Delta H^\circ_p<0, \Delta S^\circ_p<0)</math>
:<math>T_f = \frac{\Delta H^\circ_p}{\Delta S^\circ_p + Rln[M]_0} ; (\Delta H^\circ_p>0, \Delta S^\circ_p>0)</math>
For example, [[tetrahydrofuran]] (THF) cannot be polymerized above T<sub>c</sub> = 84&nbsp;°C, nor cyclo-octasulfur (S<sub>8</sub>) below T<sub>f</sub> = 159&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tobolsky|first=A.

The polymerization of a majority of monomers is accompanied by an [[entropy]] decrease, due mostly to the loss in the translational degrees of freedom. In this situation, polymerization is thermodynamically allowed only when the enthalpic contribution into ?G<sub>p</sub> prevails (thus, when ?H<sub>p</sub>° < 0 and ?S<sub>p</sub>° < 0, the inequality |?H<sub>p</sub>| > -T?S<sub>p</sub> is required). Therefore, the higher the ring strain, the lower the resulting monomer concentration at [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]].

'''Ezri Dax''' {{IPAc-en|?|?|z|r|i|_|?|d|æ|k|s}}, played by [[Nicole de Boer]], is a [[protagonist|main character]] in the seventh season of the American science fiction TV series ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''. In the series narrative Ezri Dax is a counselor aboard the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] space station [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]].

==Casting==
The role of Ezri Dax was created when [[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]] (who played [[Jadzia Dax]]) decided to leave the show and her character was subsequently killed by [[Dukat (Star Trek)|Dukat]].<ref name="tears">"[[Tears of the Prophets]]"</ref>

When Nicole de Boer read for the role in 1998, she was considered "one of the busiest actresses in Canada but a relative unknown south of the border".<ref name=Nemecek>Larry Nemecek, "Meet Nicole deBoer: Ezri Dax" ''Star Trek Communicator'' '''119''' November 1998: 10</ref> She used her own camera to tape her audition.<ref name=Nemecek/> De Boer admits that prior to being called to the show she did not know what a [[Trill (Star Trek)|Trill]] was.<ref name=Erdmann>Terry J. Erdmann & Paula M. Block, ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion''. New York: Pocket Books (2000): 598</ref> But she made sure to study, and watched previous shows, though careful not "to watch a whole bunch of Jadzia stuff."<ref name=Erdmann/>

==Story overview==

Ezri Dax was briefly introduced in the first episode of season seven, ''[[Image in the Sand]]''. The back story states that [[Ensign (Star Trek)|Ensign]] Ezri Tigan, a [[Trill (Star Trek)|Trill]] [[Starfleet]] officer, upon leaving Starfleet Academy was assigned to the USS ''Destiny'' as assistant ship's counselor. She had no interest in becoming joined with a Trill symbiont.

After [[Lieutenant Commander (Star Trek)|Lieutenant Commander]] [[Jadzia Dax]] is killed aboard [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]], the [[Dax (Star Trek)|Dax symbiont]] is saved by Dr. [[Julian Bashir]] and sent to Trill. However, the symbiont becomes gravely ill during its journey on the ''Destiny'' and, as the only Trill on board, Ezri is asked to join with Dax in order to save its life. Ezri is Dax's ninth host.

Upon joining, Ezri is assigned to Deep Space Nine and promoted early, because of her extensive Starfleet experience and knowledge from the Dax symbiont, to [[lieutenant, junior grade (Star Trek)|lieutenant, junior grade]]. She serves as counselor.

Jadzia was married to Lieutenant Commander [[Worf]], who at first refuses to speak to Ezri, convinced that Jadzia has gone on to [[Sto-Vo-Kor]] and can no longer exist through the Dax symbiont. However, the two later become friends and, briefly, lovers. 

Toward the end of the series, Ezri begins a romance with Dr. [[Julian Bashir]].

===Depiction after the series===
In [[Pocket Books]]' [[canon (Star Trek)|non-canon]] [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine relaunch|DS9 Relaunch]] novels, Ezri remains on Deep Space Nine but moves from counseling to command, receiving a promotion to [[lieutenant (Star Trek)|lieutenant]] and becoming [[executive officer]] of the [[USS Defiant|USS ''Defiant'']]. Following a mission on the Trill homeworld, she and Bashir end their romance but decide to remain close friends. In the ''Star Trek: Destiny'' trilogy Dax, who had transferred to second officer of the new ''Vesta''-class multimission explorer starship USS ''Aventine'', received a battlefield promotion to captain and commanding officer. She played a critical role in bringing about the final defeat of the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]]. As of the ''Star Trek: Typhon Pact'' and ''Star Trek: The Fall'' series, Dax continues to serve as captain of the ''Aventine''.

==Reception==
Compared to Jadzia, Ezri comes across as very insecure.<ref>Susan A. Lentz, "'Where No Woman Has Gone Before': Feminist Perspectives On ''Star Trek''" ''Star Trek Visions of Law and Justice'', edited by Robert H. Chaires (2003): 147. "Ezri Dax is physically petite. She is less assured, insecure, and uncertain who she is. Of course, Jadzia may have herself once been such a host. The growth and evolution of Ezri unfold as she acknowledges her "past lives."</ref> Some fans derided Ezri Dax as "Ally McTrill" (in reference to the [[Ally McBeal (character)|title character]] on ''[[Ally McBeal]]''), and one ''TV Guide'' reviewer took a cue from the fans. Nicole de Boer, however, took this as a compliment.<ref>Sandy Stone, "[http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/111289.html Report: Star Trek's ''Grand Slam'', Pt. II] April 7, 2007. Accessed October 18, 2007. "She didn't mind when TV Guide described her as 'Ally McTrill'—she took it as a compliment."</ref> After all, both Ally and Ezri, though being shy and self-complacent, are formidably good at their works as lawyer and spacewoman respectively.

'''''Europa Universalis''''' ('''''EU''''') is a [[Grand strategy game|grand strategy]] [[video game]] released on March 14, 2000<ref name="ParadoxRelease">{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/europa-universalis/release-info|title=MobyGames}}</ref> by [[Paradox Development Studio]] and distributed in [[North America]] by [[Strategy First]]. Originally based on a [[France|French]] [[board game]] of the [[Europa Universalis (board game)|same name]] by Philippe Thibault, ''Europa Universalis'' lets the player take control of one of seven [[Europe]]an nations (others are available in different scenarios) from 1492 to 1792, expanding its power through [[military]] might, [[diplomacy]], and [[colonization|colonial]] wealth. The game takes place on a map divided into approximately 1,500 provinces, and proceeds in a pausable [[Real-time computing|real time]] format. The lead [[game programmer]] was [[Johan Andersson (game programmer)|Johan Andersson]].

The game became a surprise hit for its depth and strategy. Paradox used this sudden success to springboard other titles such as ''[[Victoria: An Empire Under the Sun|Victoria]]'', ''[[Crusader Kings (video game)|Crusader Kings]]'', and ''[[Hearts of Iron]]''.

''Europa Universalis'' was followed by ''[[Europa Universalis II]]'', ''[[Europa Universalis III]]'', ''[[Europa Universalis: Rome]]'' and ''[[Europa Universalis IV]]''<ref name="EU IV Release">{{cite web|url=http://www.paradoxplaza.com/games/europa-universalis-iv|title=Europa Universalis IV at Paradox Plaza}}</ref>

The '''Apple Bandai Pippin''' is a multimedia technology console, designed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]. The console was based on the [[Apple Pippin]] platform – a derivative of the [[Apple Macintosh]] platform. Bandai produced the ATMARK and @WORLD consoles between 1995 and 1997.

The goal of the Bandai Pippin was to create an inexpensive computer aimed mostly at playing CD-based multimedia software, especially games, but also functioning as a [[network computer]]. The operating system was basically a stripped version of [[System 7#Version history|System 7.5.2]], and was based on a 66 [[Hertz|MHz]] [[PowerPC 603]] processor and a 14.4 [[Kilobyte|kb]]/s [[modem]]. It featured a 4×-speed [[CD-ROM]] drive and a video output that could connect to a standard television display.

==Marketing==
In Japan, Bandai produced Pippin-based systems called the {{Nihongo|Pippin Atmark|?????????|Pipin Attom?ku}}. Most of the Atmark systems used the same platinum color used on many of the Apple Macintosh models at the time.

In the United States and most parts of Europe, Bandai named the system the Bandai Pippin @WORLD (pronounced "at-world"). The @WORLD had the same specifications as the Pippin Atmark, but ran an English version of Mac OS. Most of the western systems used a black color.

==History==
{{more|Apple Pippin}}
Bandai manufactured fewer than 100,000 Pippins, but reportedly sold 42,000 systems before discontinuing the line. Production of the system was so limited, there were more keyboard and modem accessories produced than actual systems.<ref>Assembler (via Archive.org). ''[http://web.archive.org/web/20080321013705/http://assembler.roarvgm.com/Apple_Bandai_pippin/apple_bandai_pippin.html Apple Bandai Pippin]''. Retrieved March 21, 2008.</ref>

In May 2006, the Pippin placed 22nd in ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'''s list of the "25 Worst Tech Products of All Time."<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article/0,aid,125772,pg,6,00.asp#pippin The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time: 22. Apple Pippin @World (1996)] (Dan Tynan, ''PCWorld'', May 26, 2006)</ref>

==Software==
===Japan===
Very little software was produced for the Japanese version on release in early 1995. While some promised software may not have been released, the number that was released is less than 80 games and applications.<ref>''[http://web.mac.com/sebangulo/Pippin/About_the_Pippin.html The most accurate list of Pippin titles]''. Retrieved September 14, 2009.</ref>

===USA===
When Bandai released the U.S. version, it had only 18 games and applications sold separately, and six CDs came with the Pippin itself. Upgrades to the Pippin Browser were released as a new CD over time, and so was an update to ''TV Works'' (a text and drawing program).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100527212315/http://web.mac.com/sebangulo/Pippin/About_the_Pippin.html |title=About the Apple Pippin |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18}}</ref>

In 1956, the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) was formed by Australia's major record companies.<ref name="AARM"/> It was replaced in 1983 by the Australian Recording Industry Association, which was established by the six major record companies operating in Australia, [[EMI]] (now part of [[Universal Music Group]]), [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival Records]], CBS (now known as [[Sony Music]]), RCA (now part of Sony Music), WEA (now known as [[Warner Music]]) and [[Polygram]] (now known as Universal). It later included smaller record companies representing independent acts/labels and has over 100 members. By 1997, the six major labels provided 90% of all recordings made in Australia.<ref name="AARM"/> ARIA is administered by a Board of Directors comprising senior executives from record companies, both large and small.

In February 2004, the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) announced its own legal action against [[Kazaa]], alleging massive copyright breaches. The trial began on 29 November 2004. On 6 February 2005, the homes of two Sharman Networks executives and the offices of Sharman Networks in Australia were raided under a court order by ARIA to gather evidence for the trial.

In 2006, ARIA formed sponsorship deals with [[Motorola]] and [[Nova (radio network)|Nova]] and changed the appearance and conduct of the charting. Motorola took naming-rights sponsorship seeing the charts referred to in the media as the Motorola ARIA Charts. ARIA, have commented that as part of the same marketing printed charts would be reintroduced into media retailing shops and their website would be redesigned. As part of the deal Nova began broadcasting the charted singles in reverse order on a Sunday afternoon show before it was released on the ARIA charts website.

==ARIA Charts==
{{main|ARIA Charts}}
The '''ARIA Charts''' is the main Australian music sales charts, issued weekly by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The charts are a record of the highest selling [[Single (music)|singles]] and [[album]]s in various genres. All charts are compiled from data of both physical and digital sales from retailers in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-howare-chartsprepared.htm|title=How are the ARIA Charts prepared each week?|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref>

==ARIA Awards==
===ARIA No. 1 Chart Awards===
The '''ARIA No.&nbsp;1 Chart Awards''' were established in 2002 to recognise Australian recording artists, who reached number one on the ARIA albums, singles and music DVDs charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/ARIANo.1ChartAwards1July2005.htm|title=ARIA No. 1 Chart Awards (1 July 2005)|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref>

===ARIA Music Awards===
{{main|ARIA Music Awards}}
The '''ARIA Music Awards''' is an annual series of awards nights celebrating the [[Music of Australia|Australian music]] industry. The event has been held annually since 1987; it encompasses the general genre-specific and popular awards known as the ARIA Awards, as well as the Fine Arts Awards and Artisan Awards (held separately from 2004), Lifetime Achievement Awards and the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]] (held separately from 2005 to 2010 but returned to the general ceremony in 2011).

==Criticisms==
Like most recording industry associations, ARIA has been criticised for fighting [[copyright infringement]] matters aggressively, although in Australia this has largely taken the form of aggressive advertising campaigns particularly in cinemas directly preceding movies. This criticism is stauncher in Australia due to the absence of an equivalent [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] or state crimes acts which clearly establish copyright infringement as a crime.
<!-- This is not entirely correct, as Australia does have an amendment act to the copyright act which covers digital intellectual property, someone with exact knowledge of this should add information regarding it -->

In February 2004, the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) took legal action against [[Kazaa]], alleging massive copyright breaches. The trial began on 29 November 2004. On 6 February 2005, the homes of two [[Sharman Networks]] executives and the offices of Sharman Networks in Australia were raided under a court order by ARIA to gather evidence for the trial.

The ARIA charts have also been criticised as an easily manipulated market tool abused by aggressively marketed pop acts. "Gold" and "Platinum" ARIA awards are based on units shipped to retail outlets, not on how many of those units are sold to customers. A lukewarm album or single release can achieve Gold or Platinum status by flooding the market with copies, and if 99% are returned to the manufacturer that in no way affects the status of the award.

ARIA has been criticised by former [[Australian Idol]] judge and record producer [[Ian Dickson (music mogul)|Ian Dickson]] for a perceived intolerance of Australian Idol contestants, and a lack of nomination in the [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA Awards]].<ref>{{cite web | first=Bernard | last=Zuel | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/will-idol-graduates-ever-get-any-respect/2007/09/05/1188783289280.html?page=fullpage | title=Scarlet letters | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=2007-09-06 }}</ref>

[[IUPAC]] has [[deprecation|deprecated]] the use of the term ''polydispersity index'' having replaced it with the term ''dispersity'', represented by the symbol ''?'' (pronounced D-stroke<ref name=Stepto/>) which can refer to either molecular mass or degree of polymerization. It can be calculated using the equation ''?''<sub>M</sub> = ''M''<sub>w</sub>/''M''<sub>n</sub>, where ''M''<sub>w</sub> is the weight-average molar mass and ''M''<sub>n</sub> is the number-average molar mass.  It can also be calculated according to degree of polymerization, where ''?''<sub>X</sub> = ''X''<sub>w</sub>/''X''<sub>n</sub>, where ''X''<sub>w</sub> is the weight-average degree of polymerization and ''X''<sub>n</sub> is the number-average degree of polymerization. In certain limiting cases where ''?''<sub>M</sub> = ''?''<sub>X</sub>, it is simply referred to as ''?''. IUPAC has also deprecated the terms ''monodisperse'', which is considered to be self-contradictory, and ''polydisperse'', which is considered redundant, preferring the terms ''uniform'' and ''non-uniform'' instead.<ref name=Stepto>Stepto, R.

A polymer material is denoted by the term polydisperse, or non-uniform, if its chain lengths vary over a wide range of molecular masses. This is characteristic of man-made polymers.[http://www.chemicool.com/definition/polydisperse.html]. [[Natural organic matter]] produced by the decomposition of plants and wood debris in soils ([[humic substances]]) also has a pronounced polydispersed character. It is the case of [[humic acid]]s and [[fulvic acid]]s, natural [[polyelectrolyte]] substances having respectively higher and lower molecular weights.  Another interpretation of polydispersity index is explained in the article [[Dynamic light scattering]] (cumulant method subheading). In this sense, the PDI values are in the range from 0 to 1. 

The '''polydispersity index''' ('''PDI''') or heterogeneity index, or simply dispersity (?), is a measure of the distribution of [[molecular mass]] in a given [[polymer]] sample.  The PDI calculated is the [[weight average molecular weight]] (<math> M_w </math>) divided by the [[number average molecular weight]] (<math> M_n </math>).  It indicates the distribution of individual [[molecular mass]]es in a batch of [[polymer]]s.  The PDI has a value equal to or greater than 1, but as the polymer chains approach uniform chain length, the PDI approaches unity (1).<ref>Peter Atkins and Julio De Paula, ''Atkins' Physical Chemistry'', 9th edition (Oxford University Press, 2010, ISBN 978-0-19-954337-3)</ref> For some natural polymers PDI is almost taken as unity. 
The PDI from polymerization is often denoted as:

<math>\ PDI = M_w/M_n</math>,

where <math> M_w </math> is the [[weight average molecular weight]]  and  <math> M_n </math> is the [[number average molecular weight]]. <math> M_n </math> is more sensitive to molecules of low molecular mass, while <math> M_w </math> is more sensitive to molecules of high molecular mass.

== Effect of polymerization mechanism ==
Typical dispersities vary based on the mechanism of polymerization and can be affected by a variety of reaction conditions.  In synthetic polymers, it can vary greatly due to [[reactant]] ratio, how close the [[polymerization]] went to completion, etc.  For typical addition [[polymerization]], ? can range around 10 to 20.  For typical step polymerization, most probable values of ? are around 2 &mdash;[[Carothers' equation]] limits ? to values of 2 and below.

[[Living polymerization]], a special case of addition polymerization, leads to values very close to 1.  Such is the case also in biological polymers, where the dispersity can be very close or equal to 1, indicating only one length of polymer is present.

==Determination methods ==

* [[Gel permeation chromatography]] (also known as [[size exclusion chromatography]])
* [[Light scattering]] measurements such as [[dynamic light scattering]]
* Direct measurement via [[mass spectrometry]] using [[MALDI]] or [[ESI-MS]]

A tag system may also be viewed as an abstract machine, called a '''Post tag machine''' (not to be confused with [[Post-Turing machine]]s)—briefly, a [[finite state machine]] whose only tape is a [[FIFO]] [[Queue (data structure)|queue]] of unbounded length, such that in each transition the machine reads the symbol at the head of the queue, deletes a fixed number of symbols from the head, and to the tail appends a symbol-string preassigned to the deleted symbol. (Because all of the indicated operations are performed in ''each'' transition, a tag machine strictly has only one state.)  

== Definition ==

A ''tag system'' is a triplet (''m'', ''A'', ''P''), where

* ''m'' is a positive integer, called the ''deletion number''.

* ''A'' is a finite alphabet of symbols, one of which is a special ''halting symbol''. All finite (possibly empty) strings on ''A'' are called ''words''.

* ''P'' is a set of ''production rules'', assigning a word ''P(x)'' (called a ''production'') to each symbol ''x'' in ''A''.  The production (say ''P(<tt>H</tt>)'') assigned to the halting symbol is seen below to play no role in computations, but for convenience is taken to be ''P(<tt>H</tt>)'' = ''<tt>'H'</tt>''.  

The term ''m-tag system'' is often used to emphasise the deletion number.  Definitions vary somewhat in the literature (cf References), the one presented here being that of Rogozhin.

* A ''halting word'' is a word that either begins with the halting symbol or whose length is less than ''m''.

* A transformation ''t'' (called the ''tag operation'') is defined on the set of non-halting words, such that if ''x'' denotes the leftmost symbol of a word ''S'', then ''t''(''S'') is the result of deleting the leftmost ''m'' symbols of ''S'' and appending the word ''P(x)'' on the right.

* A ''computation'' by a tag system is a finite sequence of words produced by iterating the transformation ''t'', starting with an initially given word and halting when a halting word is produced.  (By this definition, a computation is not considered to exist unless a halting word is produced in finitely-many iterations.  Alternative definitions allow nonhalting computations, for example by using a special subset of the alphabet to identify words that encode output.)

The use of a halting symbol in the above definition allows the output of a computation to be encoded in the final word alone, whereas otherwise the output would be encoded in the entire sequence of words produced by iterating the tag operation.

A common alternative definition uses no halting symbol and treats all words of length less than ''m'' as halting words. Another definition is the original one used by Post 1943 (described in the historical note below), in which the only halting word is the empty string.

=== Example: A simple 2-tag illustration ===

This is merely to illustrate a simple 2-tag system that uses a halting symbol.

<pre>
2-tag system 
    Alphabet: {a,b,c,H} 
    Production rules:
         a  -->  ccbaH
         b  -->  cca
         c  -->  cc

Computation
    Initial word: baa
                    acca
                      caccbaH
                        ccbaHcc
                          baHcccc
                            Hcccccca (halt).
</pre>

=== Example: Computation of Collatz sequences ===

This simple 2-tag system is adapted from [De Mol, 2008].  It uses no halting symbol, but halts on any word of length less than 2, and computes a slightly modified version of the [[Collatz conjecture|Collatz sequence]]. 

In the original Collatz sequence, the successor of n is either ''n''/2 (for even&nbsp;''n'') or 3''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 (for odd n).  The value 3''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 is clearly even for odd&nbsp;''n'', hence the next term after 3''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 is surely (3''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)/2. In the sequence computed by the tag system below we skip this intermediate step, hence the successor of ''n'' is (3''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)/2 for odd&nbsp;''n''.

In this tag system, a positive integer ''n'' is represented by the word aa...a with ''n'' a's. 

<pre>
2-tag system 
    Alphabet: {a,b,c} 
    Production rules:
         a  -->  bc
         b  -->  a
         c  -->  aaa

Computation
    Initial word: aaa <--> n=3
                    abc  
                      cbc
                        caaa
                          aaaaa  <--> 5
                            aaabc
                              abcbc

== Turing-completeness of ''m''-tag systems ==

For each ''m'' > 1, the set of ''m''-tag systems is [[Turing-complete]]; i.e., for each ''m'' > 1, it is the case that for any given Turing machine '''T''', there is an ''m''-tag system that simulates '''T'''. In particular, a 2-tag system can be constructed to simulate a [[Universal Turing machine]], as was done by Wang 1963 and by Cocke & Minsky 1964.

Conversely, a Turing machine can be shown to be a Universal Turing Machine by proving that it can simulate a Turing-complete class of ''m''-tag systems. For example, Rogozhin 1996 proved the universality of the class of 2-tag systems with alphabet {''a<sub>1</sub>'', ..., ''a<sub>n</sub>'', <tt>H</tt>} and corresponding productions {''a<sub>n</sub>a<sub>n</sub>W<sub>1</sub>'', ..., ''a<sub>n</sub>a<sub>n</sub>W<sub>n-1</sub>'', ''a<sub>n</sub>a<sub>n</sub>'', <tt>H</tt>}, where the ''W<sub>k</sub>'' are nonempty words; he then proved the universality of a very small (4-state, 6-symbol) Turing machine by showing that it can simulate this class of tag systems.

== The 2-tag halting problem ==
This version of the [[halting problem]] is among the simplest, most-easily described [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] [[decision problem]]s:

Given an arbitrary positive integer ''n'' and a list of ''n''+1 arbitrary words ''P''<sub>1</sub>,''P''<sub>2</sub>,...,''P''<sub>''n''</sub>,''Q'' on the alphabet {1,2,...,''n''}, does repeated application of the tag operation ''t'': ''ijX'' ? ''XP''<sub>''i''</sub> eventually convert ''Q'' into a word of length less than 2?  That is, does the sequence ''Q'', ''t''<sup>1</sup>(''Q''), ''t''<sup>2</sup>(''Q''), ''t''<sup>3</sup>(''Q''), ... terminate?

== Historical note on the definition of tag system ==

The above definition differs from that of Post 1943, whose tag systems use no halting symbol, but rather halt only on the empty word, with the tag operation ''t'' being defined as follows:

* If ''x'' denotes the leftmost symbol of a nonempty word ''S'', then ''t''(''S'') is the operation consisting of <u>first appending</u> the word ''P(x)'' to the right end of ''S'', and <u>then deleting</u> the leftmost ''m'' symbols of the result &mdash; <u>deleting all</u> if there be less than ''m'' symbols.

The above remark concerning the Turing-completeness of the set of ''m''-tag systems, for any ''m'' &gt; 1, applies also to these tag systems as originally defined by Post.

=== Origin of the name "tag" ===

According to a footnote in Post 1943, B. P. Gill suggested the name for an earlier variant of the problem in which the first ''m'' symbols are left untouched, but rather a check mark indicating the current position moves to the right by ''m'' symbols every step. The name for the problem of determining whether or not the check mark ever touches the end of the sequence was then dubbed the "problem of tag", referring to the children's [[Tag (game)|game of tag]].

==Cyclic tag systems==

A cyclic tag system is a modification of the original tag system.  The alphabet consists of only two symbols, '''0''' and '''1''', and the production rules comprise a list of productions considered sequentially, cycling back to the beginning of the list after considering the "last" production on the list.  For each production, the leftmost symbol of the word is examined—if the symbol is '''1''', the current production is appended to the right end of the word; if the symbol is '''0''', no characters are appended to the word; in either case, the leftmost symbol is then deleted.  The system halts if and when the word becomes empty.

===Example===
<pre>
Cyclic Tag System
 Productions: (010, 000, 1111)

Computation
 Initial Word: 11001
    Production         Word
    ----------         --------------
       010             11001
       000              1001010
       1111              001010000
       010                01010000
       000                 1010000
       1111                 010000000
       010                   10000000
        .                      .
        .                      .
</pre>

Cyclic tag systems were created by [[Matthew Cook]] under the employ of [[Stephen Wolfram]], and were used in Cook's demonstration that the [[Rule 110 cellular automaton]] is universal.  A key part of the demonstration was that cyclic tag systems can emulate a [[Turing-complete]] class of tag systems.

==Emulation of tag systems by cyclic tag systems==

An ''m''-tag system with alphabet {''a<sub>1</sub>'', ..., ''a<sub>n</sub>''} and corresponding productions {''P<sub>1</sub>'', ..., ''P<sub>n</sub>''} is emulated by a cyclic tag system with ''m*n'' productions (''Q<sub>1</sub>'', ..., ''Q<sub>n</sub>'', -, -, ..., -), where all but the first ''n'' productions are the empty string (denoted by '<tt>-</tt>').  The ''Q<sub>k</sub>'' are encodings of the respective ''P<sub>k</sub>'', obtained by replacing each symbol of the tag system alphabet by a length-''n'' binary string as follows (these are to be applied also to the initial word of a tag system computation):

 ''a<sub>1</sub>'' = 100...00
 ''a<sub>2</sub>'' = 010...00
 .
 .
 .
 ''a<sub>n</sub>'' = 000...01

That is, ''a<sub>k</sub>'' is encoded as a binary string with a <tt>1</tt> in the k<sup>th</sup> position from the left, and <tt>0</tt>'s elsewhere.  Successive lines of a tag system computation will then occur encoded as every (''m*n'')<sup>th</sup> line of its emulation by the cyclic tag system.  

===Example===

This is a very small example to illustrate the emulation technique.
<pre>
2-tag system
    Production rules: (a --> bb, b --> abH, H --> H)
    Alphabet encoding: a = 100, b = 010, H = 001 
    Production encodings: (bb = 010 010, abH = 100 010 001, H = 001)

Cyclic tag system 
    Productions: (010 010, 100 010 001, 001, -, -, -)

    ...                                    ...
</pre>  
Every sixth line (marked by <tt>'*'</tt>) produced by the cyclic tag system is the encoding of a corresponding line of the tag system computation, until the emulated halt is reached.

'''Jan Železný''' ({{IPA-cs|?jan ???l?zni?|-|Cs-Jan Zelezny.ogg}}) (born 16 June 1966) is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[javelin throw]]er, world and [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] champion and world record holder. He holds the top five javelin performances of all time.<ref name="toplists">[http://www.iaaf.org/records/toplists/throws/javelin-throw/outdoor/men/senior IAAF toplists]</ref> 

==Biography==
Železný was born in [[Mladá Boleslav]], [[Czechoslovakia]].  He won the gold at the [[Athletics at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], [[Athletics at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Athletics at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] [[Summer Olympic Games]] and silver in the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]] as well as three World Championship titles; in 1993, 1995 and 2001. Because of his achievements he is widely considered to be the all time greatest javelin thrower. 

Železný holds the world record, at {{convert|98.48|m|ftin}} set in 1996, and the World Championships record of 92.80 m, set in [[2001 World Championships in Athletics|2001]]. As of 4 August 2013, Železný has made 53 of the total 99 throws over 90 meters, while second place on the list is shared by  [[Andreas Thorkildsen]] and [[Aki Parviainen]] by eight throws over 90 meters each. On the 26th of March 1997 in Stellenbosch, South Africa Železný threw 5 times over the 90m barrier in a single meeting. Železný is also the only athlete to throw more than 94 meters with the new type of javelin, something he achieved five times.<ref name="toplists" />

During his career he has had many great battles against the like of [[Steve Backley]], [[Sergey Alexandrovich Makarov|Sergey Makarov]], [[Boris Henry]], [[Seppo Räty]], [[Raymond Hecht]] and [[Aki Parviainen]].

He planned to retire after the [[2006 European Championships in Athletics|2006 European Championships]] in [[Gothenburg]], where he won the bronze with a throw of 85.92 m.
He took leave of his career on 19 September 2006 on exhibition in [[Mladá Boleslav]], the place where he started with athletics.

He will continue working for the [[IOC]] and as a coach in [[Prague]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} He coaches [[Vít?zslav Veselý]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://iaaf.org/competitions/dlm/news/newsid=65222.html|title=Bolt’s 9.79 victory tops the charts In Oslo – Samsung Diamond League|last=Rowbottom|first=Mike|date=7 June 2012|publisher=IAAF|accessdate=8 June 2012}}</ref> and [[Barbora Špotáková]].<ref>[http://sport.idnes.cz/spoluprace-svetovych-rekordmanu-spotakovou-povede-trener-zelezny-11t-/atletika.asp?c=A100820_113217_atletika_ten Spolupráce sv?tových rekordman?: Špotákovou povede trenér Železný]</ref>

'''''A Fish Called Wanda''''' is a 1988 [[Heist film|heist]]-[[comedy film]] written by [[John Cleese]] and [[Charles Crichton]]. It was directed by Crichton and stars Cleese, [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Kevin Kline]], and [[Michael Palin]]. Kline won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance as Otto. Cleese and Palin won [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] for Best Lead and Best Supporting for their acting.<ref>McCall, Douglas.  [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZTAFAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=BAFTA+cleese+palin&source=bl&ots=9Ce_hFlkdF&sig=h-bacz1XnJ9Jon1zGtBosiv0cJQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FbDNU_SABMfi8gHFuYF4&ved=0CG4Q6AEwCw#v=onepage&q=BAFTA%20cleese%20palin&f=false "Monty Python: A Chronology, 1969-2012, 2d ed."] ''Google Books''.  21 July 2014.</ref>

The plot involves members of the crew of a successful jewel [[robbery|heist]] who attempt to steal the jewels for themselves after finding that they have been moved. The actual location is known only to the gang leader, but he has been caught by the police. His lawyer becomes a central figure in the attempt to reveal their location.

==Plot==
[[London]]-based gangster George Thomason and his right-hand man, Ken Pile, an animal lover with a bad stutter, plan a jewel heist. They bring in two Americans to help: [[con artist]] Wanda Gershwitz and "weapons man" Otto West, a loud-mouthed [[Anglophobia|Anglophobe]] who fancies himself an intellectual and hates being (correctly) called stupid. Wanda and Otto are lovers, but they hide this from George and Ken, pretending to be brother and sister, so Wanda can work her charms on them. The robbery goes well, and the thieves get away with a large sum in [[diamond]]s. However, they are briefly spotted during their getaway by Mrs. Coady, an elderly lady walking her three [[dog]]s. The group then hide the loot in a safe in an old workshop. Soon after, Wanda and Otto betray George to the police and he is arrested. They return to collect the loot, with Wanda planning to double-cross Otto as well, only to find that George has moved it. Wanda decides to seduce George's [[barrister]], Archie Leach, so that he can persuade George to plead guilty and give up the location of the diamonds. Unhappily married, Leach is brow-beaten by his vindictive wife, Wendy, and spoiled daughter, Portia, so he quickly comes under the spell of Wanda's charms.

Otto is insanely jealous, and his interference, combined with instances of bad luck, causes Wanda and Archie's attempted liaisons at his friend's flat to go disastrously wrong. Wanda reveals that she likes Archie but would stay only with a rich man. Archie eventually calls off their attempted affair when a family walk into the flat, having agreed a new tenancy without his knowledge. Meanwhile, George gives Ken the task of killing Mrs. Coady, [[the Crown]]'s only eyewitness. During his various attempts to murder her, Ken accidentally kills off her three [[Yorkshire Terrier]]s one by one. This causes him great grief, as well as suffering bodily harm as each attempt goes wrong. When he kills the last of her dogs, Mrs. Coady suffers a fatal heart attack, and finally Ken is successful in his mission. Wanda and Otto want George to remain in [[jail]]; but, with no witness, he now seems set to get off. At his trial, defence witness Wanda gives evidence that will lead to a conviction rather than an acquittal. Archie, stunned by her unexpected testimony, flubs his cross-examination and inadvertently calls her "darling." Enraged, George starts a brawl that leads to everyone fleeing the [[courtroom]]. Archie is confronted by Wendy, who is now convinced he has had an ([[sexual intercourse|unconsummated]]) affair and decides to divorce him.

With his career and his marriage in ruins, Archie resolves to cut his losses, steal the loot himself, and flee to [[South America]]. Promised less jail time, George tells Archie that Ken knows where the diamonds are. Archie sees Wanda fleeing the courthouse, pulls her into his car, and races to Ken's apartment. They review what has happened, and he asks why he should take her to South America with him. She counters that she has the key to the [[safe deposit box]] where the loot has been moved. While the court drama is unfolding, Otto has been trying to get Ken to reveal the location of the diamonds. He torments Ken by eating the [[fish]] in his [[aquarium]] one by one, leaving the fish called Wanda until the end. Ken gives away the location of the diamonds, at a hotel near [[Heathrow Airport]]. Otto is leaving just as Archie runs into the building. Otto steals Archie's car, taking Wanda with him. Ken tells Archie, as quickly as he can – given his stutter – where they are going, and the two give chase. The protagonists all end up at Heathrow. Otto and Wanda recover the diamonds, but Wanda quickly double-crosses Otto and leaves him unconscious in a locked cupboard.

Otto shoots his way out of the cupboard and is briefly captured by Archie, only to turn the tables. As Otto is about to kill his love-rival, Archie manages to stall by taunting Otto about his nation's failures, such as the [[Vietnam War]]. Before Otto can shoot, he is distracted by the arrival of Ken driving a [[steamroller]], seeking vengeance for the demise of his fish. Otto accidentally stands in wet cement and is soon run over after he runs out of bullets. Archie joins Wanda on board the plane, which taxis for takeoff. Through the plane window, Otto, who has somehow survived the steamroller attack, curses them until he is blown off as the plane takes off. A closing text explains what happens to the gang members after the events of the movie. Archie and Wanda move to [[Rio de Janeiro]], have 17 children, and start a [[leper colony]]. Ken, his stutter lost, becomes the Master of Ceremonies at London's [[Sea World]]. The immoral Otto moves to [[South Africa]] and becomes [[Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development|Minister of Justice]] (at the time of filming, South Africa was still ruled under [[apartheid]]).

==Sequels and adaptations==
The principal cast reunited in 1997 for ''[[Fierce Creatures]]'' (dubbed an "[[spiritual sequel|equal]]" rather than a [[sequel]] or [[prequel]], by Kline), playing different roles.  ''Fierce Creatures'' was not as well received by critics as was ''A Fish Called Wanda''.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fierce_creatures/ "Fierce Creatures."] ''Rotten Tomatoes''.  21 July 2014.</ref>

The [[novelization]] of ''Fierce Creatures'', written by [[Iain Johnstone]], who co-wrote the film, begins with a letter from Archie to his brother Rollo ([[John Cleese]]'s character in the film).  According to the letter:
*Archie and Wanda are still living happily in Rio, and Wanda enjoys having a new child (or multiple children) each year;
*Otto visited them once, having left South Africa after [[Nelson Mandela]]'s election and the end of the [[apartheid]] regime; he is looking for like-minded individuals to form a similar group of [[National Socialists]], and Archie and Wanda are both heartily glad when he is gone;
*Ken is still Master of Ceremonies at the London Sea World; before visiting Rio, Otto "looked him up" as if they were old friends, but didn't even get close before Ken had security guards throw Otto out of the park.

In 2008, it was reported that John Cleese and his daughter, [[Cynthia Cleese|Cynthia]] (who played his screen daughter, Portia), had started to work on a stage musical version of the film.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2130261/Memories-of-Jamie-Lee-Curtis-make-John-Cleese-sing-again.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Memories of Jamie Lee Curtis make John Cleese sing again | first=Richard | last=Eden | date=June 14, 2008 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref>

==Ole Bentzen==
A Danish audiologist named Ole Bentzen died of laughing whilst watching a scene with Kevin Kline and Michael Palin. His heart was beating 250-500 times a minute. It is thought he finally gave out to cardiac arrest.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20080412072030/http://www.canongate.net/Lists/Death/9PeopleWhoDiedLaughing</ref>

U.S. relations with Sierra Leone began with [[missionary]] activities in the 19th century. In 1959, the U.S. opened a [[consulate]] in [[Freetown]] and elevated it to [[embassy]] status when Sierra Leone became independent in 1961. U.S.-Sierra Leone relations today are cordial, with ethnic ties between groups in the two countries receiving increasing historical interest. Many thousands of Sierra Leoneans reside in the United States. 

In fiscal year 2006, total U.S. bilateral aid to Sierra Leone in all categories were $29.538 million. U.S. assistance focused on the consolidation of peace, democracy and human rights, health education, particularly combating HIV/AIDS, and human resources development.

A '''humanoid'''  ({{IPAc-en|?|h|ju?|m|?n|??|d}}; from English ''[[human]]'' and ''-oid'' "resembling") is something that has an appearance resembling a human being.  The term first appeared in 1912 to refer to fossils which were [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar to, but not identical with, those of the human [[skeleton]].<ref name="OED">{{Cite book|title = The Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.|publisher = Oxford University|date = 1989|location = OED Online}}</ref> Although this usage was common in the sciences for much of the 20th century, it is now considered rare.<ref name="OED"/> More generally, the term can refer to anything with uniquely human characteristics and/or adaptations, such as possessing [[opposable]] [[appendage]] (thumbs), [[binocular vision]] (having two eyes), or [[biomechanic]] [[bipedalism]] (the ability to walk in an upright position).

==In theoretical convergent evolution==
{{see also|Convergent evolution|dinosaur intelligence}}

Though no human-shaped species has been discovered, the theory of [[convergent evolution]] speculates different species may evolve similar traits, and in the case of a humanoid these traits may include [[intelligence]] and [[bipedal]]ism and other humanoid [[Human skeletal changes due to bipedalism|skeletal changes]],  as a result of similar [[evolution]]ary pressures. American psychologist [[Harry Jerison]] suggested the possibility of sapient dinosaurs. In 1978, he gave a presentation titled "Smart dinosaurs and comparative psychology", at a meeting of the [[American Psychological Association]]. According to his speech, [[dromiceiomimus]] supposedly could have evolved into a highly intelligent species like human beings.<ref name="kaneko"/ In his book, ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argues that if the tape of life were re-wound and played back, life would have taken a very different course.<ref name=wonderfullife>{{wonderfullife}}</ref> [[Simon Conway Morris]] counters this argument, arguing that convergence is a dominant force in evolution and that since the same environmental and physical constraints act on all life, there is an "optimum" body plan that life will inevitably evolve toward, with evolution bound to stumble upon intelligence, a trait of [[primates]], [[crows]], and [[dolphins]], at some point.<ref name="SCM2005">{{Cite book

[[File:Dinosauroid.jpg|thumb|upright|A model of the hypothetical Dinosauroid, Dinosaur Museum, Dorchester]]
In 1982, [[Dale Russell]], curator of vertebrate fossils at the [[Canadian Museum of Nature|National Museum of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]], conjectured a possible evolutionary path that might have been taken by the dinosaur ''[[Troodon]]'' had it not perished in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] 66 million years ago, suggesting that it could have evolved into intelligent beings similar in body plan to humans, becoming a ''humanoid'' of dinosaur origin. Over geologic time, Russell noted that there had been a steady increase in the [[encephalization quotient]] or EQ (the relative brain weight when compared to other species with the same body weight) among the dinosaurs.<ref name="cosm">[http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/print/1444/smartasaurus Cosmos: Smartosarus]</ref> Russell had discovered the first Troodontid skull, and noted that, while its EQ was low compared to humans, it was six times higher than that of other dinosaurs. If the trend in ''Troodon'' evolution had continued to the present, its brain case could by now measure 1,100&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>; comparable to that of a human. [[Troodontid]]s had semi-manipulative fingers, able to grasp and hold objects to a certain degree, and binocular vision.<ref name=russell1982>{{Cite journal | last1 = Russell | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Séguin | first2 = R. | year = 1982 | title = Reconstruction of the small Cretaceous theropod ''Stenonychosaurus inequalis'' and a hypothetical dinosauroid | url = | journal = Syllogeus | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 1–43 }}</ref>

Russell proposed that this "[[Dinosauroid]]", like most dinosaurs of the troodontid family, would have had large eyes and three fingers on each hand, one of which would have been partially [[Opposable thumb|opposed]]. As with most modern reptiles (and birds), he conceived of its genitalia as internal. Russell speculated that it would have required a navel, as a placenta aids the development of a large brain case. However, it would not have possessed mammary glands, and would have fed its young, as birds do, on regurgitated food. He speculated that its language would have sounded somewhat like [[bird song]].<ref name=russell1982/><ref name="nash">Naish, D. (2006). [http://darrennaish.blogspot.com/2006/11/dinosauroids-revisited.html Dinosauroids Revisited] Darren Naish: Tetrapod Zoology, April 23, 2011.</ref> 

Russell's thought experiment has been met with criticism from other paleontologists since the 1980s, many of whom point out that his Dinosauroid is overly anthropomorphic. [[Gregory S. Paul]] (1988) and [[Thomas R. Holtz, Jr.]], consider it "suspiciously human" (Paul, 1988) and [[Darren Naish]] has argued that a large-brained, highly intelligent troodontid would retain a more standard theropod body plan, with a horizontal posture and long tail, and would probably manipulate objects with the snout and feet in the manner of a bird, rather than with human-like "hands".<ref name=nash/>

==In robotics==
{{Main|Humanoid robot}}
A ''humanoid robot'' is a robot that is based on the general structure of a human, such as a robot that walks on two legs and has an upper torso, or a robot that has two arms, two legs and a head. A humanoid robot does not necessarily look convincingly like a real person, for example the [[ASIMO]] humanoid robot has a helmet instead of a face.

An ''[[Android (robot)|android]]'' (male) or ''[[gynoid]]'' (female) is a humanoid robot designed to look as much like a real person as possible, although these words are frequently perceived to be synonymous with humanoid.

While there are many humanoid robots in fictional stories, some real [[humanoid robot]]s have been developed since the 1990s, and some real human-looking android robots have been developed since 2002.

Similarly to robots, virtual [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] may also be called humanoid when resembling humans.

==In mythology==
{{main|Mythic humanoids}}
[[Deities]] are often imagined in [[anthropomorphism|human shape]] (also known as "[[anthropotheism]]"), sometimes as [[mythological hybrid|hybrids]] (especially the [[nefer|gods]] of [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]). 
A fragment by the Greek poet [[Xenophanes]] describes this tendency, 
{{quote|...Men make gods in their own image; those of the [[Aethiopia|Ethiopians]] are black and narrow-nosed, those of the [[Thracians]] have blue eyes and red hair.<ref>Diels, B16,''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'', 1903, pp.38–58 (Xenophanes fr. B16, Diels-Kranz, Kirk/Raven no. 171 [= Clem. Alex. Strom. Vii.4]</ref>}}
In [[animism]] in general, the [[spirits]] innate in certain objects (like the Greek [[nymph]]s) are typically depicted in human shape, e.g. spirits of trees ([[Dryads]]), of the woodlands (the hybrid [[faun]]s), of wells or waterways ([[Nereids]], [[Neck (water spirit)|Necks]]), etc.

==In science fiction==
With regard to [[extraterrestrials in fiction]], the term humanoid is most commonly used to refer to [[Extraterrestrial life|alien beings]] with a [[body plan]] that is generally like that of a human, including upright stance and [[bipedalism]]. 

Many aliens in [[television]] and [[science fiction film]]s are presented as humanoid.  This is usually attributed to budget constraints, as human actors can more easily portray human-like aliens. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Fictional extraterrestrials===

In much of [[science fiction]], the reason for the abundance of humanoid aliens is not explained and requires [[suspension of disbelief]]. In some cases, however, explanations have been offered for this. In ''[[Star Trek]]'', the abundance of humanoid aliens within the ''Star Trek'' universe is explained by advancing the story of a primordial humanoid civilization, the [[Ancient humanoid (Star Trek)|Ancient humanoid]]s, who seeded the galaxy with genetically-engineered cells to guide the evolution of life on a multitude of worlds toward a humanoid form.<ref>{{Cite episode

Similarly, in its spin-off show ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', the explanation offered for the humanoid appearance of the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] is that the Wraith evolved from a parasite which incorporated human [[DNA]] into its own [[genome]] after feeding on humans, giving the Wraith their present form.<ref name="The Gift">{{sgcite|The Gift|Atlantis|show=ref}}</ref>

==In ufology==
In the field of [[ufology]], ''humanoid'' refers to any of the claimed [[extraterrestrials]] which abduct human victims, such as the [[Grey alien|Greys]],<ref>{{cite book| last = Bryan| first = C.D.B| title = Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind| year = 1995| publisher = Alfred A.

==In fantasy==
In fantasy settings the term ''humanoid'' is used to refer to a human-like fantastical creature, such as a [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] or an [[ogre]].  In some cases, such as older versions of the game Dungeons and Dragons, a distinction is made between [[demi-humans]], which are relatively similar to humans, and humanoids, which exhibit larger differences from humans. Animals that are humanoid are also shown in fantasy. 
Humanoids are also used in some old horror movies, for example in [[Creature From the Black Lagoon]], made in 1954 by [[Jack Arnold (director)|Jack Arnold]].

In [[economics]], the '''invisible hand of the market''' is a [[metaphor]] used by [[Adam Smith]] to describe the self-regulating behavior of the marketplace. Individuals can make profit, and maximize it without the need for government intervention.<ref>{{cite book

  | doi =
  | id =
  | isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}</ref> The exact phrase is used just [[#Other uses of the phrase by Smith|three times in Smith's writings]], but has come to capture his important claim that individuals' efforts to maximize their own gains in a free market may benefit society, even if the ambitious have no benevolent intentions. Smith came up with the two meanings of the phrase from [[Richard Cantillon]] who developed both economic applications in his model of the isolated estate.<ref>[[Mark Thornton|Thornton, Mark]]. "Cantillon and the Invisible Hand". ''[[Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics]]'', http://mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae12_2_3.pdf Vol. 12, No. 2 (2009) pp. 27–46.</ref>

He first introduced the concept in ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'', written in 1759. In this work, however, the idea of the market is not discussed, and the word "[[capitalism]]" is never used.<ref>Sen, Amartya. Introduction. The Theory of Moral Sentiments. By Adam Smith. 6th ed. 1790. New York: Penguin, 2009. vii–xxix.</ref> By the time he wrote ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' in 1776, Smith had studied the economic models of the French [[Physiocrats]] for many years, and in this work the invisible hand is more directly linked to the concept of the market: specifically that it is competition between buyers and sellers that channels the [[profit motive]] of individuals on both sides of the transaction such that improved products are produced and at lower costs. This process whereby competition channels ambition toward socially desirable ends comes out most clearly in ''The Wealth of Nations'', Book I, Chapter 7.

The idea of markets automatically channeling self-interest toward socially desirable ends is a central justification for the [[laissez-faire]] economic philosophy, which lies behind [[neoclassical economics]].<ref>Slater, D. & Tonkiss, F. (2001). ''Market Society: Maarkets and Modern Social Theory''. Cambridge: Polity Press, pp. 54–5</ref> In this sense, the central disagreement between economic ideologies can be viewed as a disagreement about how powerful the "invisible hand" is. In alternative models, forces which were nascent during Smith's life, such as large-scale industry, [[finance]], and advertising, reduce its effectiveness.<ref name="olsen153">Olsen, James Stewart. Encyclopedia of the Industrial Revolution. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002. pp. 153–154</ref>

== ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' ==
The first appearance of the invisible hand in Smith occurs in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' (1759) in Part IV, Chapter 1, where he describes a selfish landlord as being led by an invisible hand to distribute his harvest to those who work for him:

{{quote|The proud and unfeeling landlord views his extensive fields, and without a thought for the wants of his brethren, in imagination consumes himself the whole harvest ... [Yet] the capacity of his stomach bears no proportion to the immensity of his desires ... the rest he will be obliged to distribute among those, who prepare, in the nicest manner, that little which he himself makes use of, among those who fit up the palace in which this little is to be consumed, among those who provide and keep in order all the different baubles and trinkets which are employed in the economy of greatness; all of whom thus derive from his luxury and caprice, that share of the necessaries of life, which they would in vain have expected from his humanity or his justice...The rich...are led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of the necessaries of life, which would have been made, had the earth been divided into equal portions among all its inhabitants, and thus without intending it, without knowing it, advance the interest of the society...}}

Elsewhere in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith has described the desire of men to be respected by the members of the community in which they live, and the desire of men to feel that they are honorable beings.

== ''The Wealth of Nations'' ==
The part of ''The Wealth of Nations'' (1776) which describes what future generations would consider to be Smith's invisible hand, ironically, does not use the term.  The process by which market competition channels individual greed is most clearly described in Book I, Chapter 7.

Adam Smith uses the metaphor in Book IV, chapter II, paragraph IX of ''The Wealth of Nations''.
{{quote|By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an '''invisible hand''' to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was not part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.}}

== Economists' interpretation of the "invisible hand" quotation ==
The concept of the "invisible hand" is nearly always generalized beyond Smith's original uses. [[Milton Friedman]], a [[Nobel Prize]] winner in economics, called Smith's Invisible Hand "the possibility of cooperation without [[coercion]]."<ref>[http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/rdPncl0.html#Introduction,%20by%20Milton%20Friedman Friedman's Introduction to ''[[I, Pencil]]''</ref> [[Kaushik Basu]] has called the [[First Welfare Theorem]] the Invisible Hand Theorem.{{sfn|Basu|2010|p=[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ufj0xYUbuRUC&pg=PA16 16]}}

The theory for the Invisible Hand states that if each consumer is allowed to choose freely what to buy and each producer is allowed to choose freely what to sell and how to produce it, the market will settle on a product distribution and prices that are beneficial to all the individual members of a community, and hence to the community as a whole. The reason for this is that self-interest drives actors to beneficial behavior in a case of [[serendipity]]. Efficient methods of production are adopted to maximize profits. Low prices are charged to maximize revenue through gain in market share by undercutting competitors. Investors invest in those industries most urgently needed to maximize returns, and withdraw capital from those less efficient in creating value. All these effects take place dynamically and automatically.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Some economists question the integrity of how the term "invisible hand" is currently used.  Gavin Kennedy, Professor Emeritus at [[Heriot-Watt University]] in Edinburgh, Scotland, argues that its current use in modern economic thinking as a symbol of free market capitalism is not reconcilable with the rather modest and indeterminate manner in which it was employed by Smith.<ref>Kennedy, Gavin. 2009. Adam Smith and the Invisible Hand: From Metaphor to Myth. ''Econ Journal Watch'' 6(2): 239–263.[http://econjwatch.org/articles/adam-smith-and-the-invisible-hand-from-metaphor-to-myth]</ref> In response to Kennedy, [[Daniel B. Klein|Daniel Klein]] argues that reconciliation is legitimate.  Moreover, even if Smith did not intend the term "invisible hand" to be used in the current manner, its serviceability as such should not be rendered ineffective.<ref>Klein, Daniel B. 2009.

''Econ Journal Watch'' 6(2): 264–279.[http://econjwatch.org/articles/in-adam-smith-s-invisible-hands-comment-on-gavin-kennedy]</ref> In conclusion of their exchange, Kennedy insists that Smith's intentions are of utmost importance to the current debate, which is one of Smith's association with the term "invisible hand".  If the term is to be used as a symbol of liberty and economic coordination as it has been in the modern era, Kennedy argues that it should exist as a construct completely separate from Adam Smith since there is little evidence that Smith imputed any significance onto the term, much less the meanings given it at present.<ref>Kennedy, Gavin.

The former [[Drummond Professor of Political Economy]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[D. H. MacGregor]], argued that:

{{quote|The one case in which he referred to the ‘invisible hand’ was that in which private persons preferred the home trade to the foreign trade, and he held that such preference was in the national interest, since it replaced two domestic capitals while the foreign trade replaced only one. The argument of the two capitals was a bad one, since it is the amount of capital that matters, not its subdivision; but the invisible sanction was given to a Protectionist idea, not for defence but for employment. It is not surprising that Smith was often quoted in Parliament in support of Protection. His background, like ours today, was private enterprise; but any dogma of non-intervention by government has to make heavy weather in ''The Wealth of Nations''.<ref>D. H. MacGregor, ''Economic Thought and Policy'' (London: Oxford University Press, 1949), pp. 81–82.</ref>}}

[[Harvard]] economist [[Stephen Marglin]] argues that while the "invisible hand" is the "most enduring phrase in Smith's entire work", it is "also the most misunderstood."

{{quote|
Economists have taken this passage to be the first step in the cumulative effort of mainstream economics to prove that a competitive economy provides the largest possible economic pie (the so-called first welfare theorem, which demonstrates the Pareto optimality of a competitive regime). But Smith, it is evident from the context, was making a much narrower argument, namely, that the interests of businessmen in the security of their capital would lead them to invest in the domestic economy even at the sacrifice of somewhat higher returns that might be obtainable from foreign investment. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

[[David Ricardo]] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. echoed Smith .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [but] Smith's argument is at best incomplete, for it leaves out the role of foreigners' investment in the domestic economy. It would have to be shown that the gain to the British capital stock from the preference of British investors for Britain is greater than the loss to Britain from the preference of Dutch investors for the Netherlands and French investors for France."<ref>{{cite book |last= Marglin |first= Stephen |authorlink= Stephen A.

According to [[Emma Rothschild]], Smith was actually being ironic in his use of the term.<ref>{{cite book |last= Rothschild |first= Emma |authorlink= Emma Georgina Rothschild |year= 2001 |chapter=  |title= Economic Sentiments: Adam Smith, Condorcet, and the Enlightenment |location= Cambridge,&nbsp;MA |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |pages= 138–42 |isbn= 978-0-674-00489-4 }}</ref> [[Warren Samuels]] described it as "a means of relating modern high theory to Adam Smith and, as such, an interesting example in the development of language."{{sfn|Samuels|2011|p=[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-1CiI1skAbUC&pg=PR18 xviii]}}

== Understood as a metaphor ==
Smith uses the metaphor in the context of an argument against [[protectionism]] and government regulation of markets, but it is based on very broad principles developed by [[Bernard Mandeville]], [[Joseph Butler|Bishop Butler]], [[Lord Shaftesbury]], and [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]]. In general, the term "invisible hand" can apply to any individual action that has unplanned, unintended consequences, particularly those that arise from actions not orchestrated by a central command, and that have an observable, patterned effect on the community.

Bernard Mandeville argued that private vices are actually public benefits. In ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'' (1714), he laments that the "bees of social virtue are buzzing in Man's bonnet": that civilized man has stigmatized his private appetites and the result is the retardation of the common good.

Bishop Butler argued that pursuing the public good was the best way of advancing one's own good since the two were necessarily identical.

Lord Shaftesbury turned the convergence of public and private good around, claiming that acting in accordance with one's self-interest produces socially beneficial results. An underlying unifying force that Shaftesbury called the "Will of Nature"  maintains equilibrium, congruency, and harmony. This force, to operate freely, requires the individual pursuit of [[Rational selfishness|rational self-interest]], and the preservation and advancement of the self.

Francis Hutcheson also accepted this convergence between public and private interest, but he attributed the mechanism, not to rational self-interest, but to personal intuition, which he called a "moral sense." Smith developed his own version of this general principle in which six psychological motives combine in each individual to produce the common good. In ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', vol. II, page 316, he says, ''"By acting according to the dictates of our moral faculties, we necessarily pursue the most effective means for promoting the happiness of mankind."''

Contrary to common misconceptions, Smith did not assert that all self-interested labour necessarily benefits society, or that all public goods are produced through self-interested labour. His proposal is merely that in a free market, people ''usually'' tend to produce goods desired by their neighbours. The [[tragedy of the commons]] is an example where self-interest tends to bring an unwanted result.

== Examples and arguments ==
Since Smith's time, the principle of the invisible hand has been further incorporated into economic theory. Léon Walras developed a four-equation [[general equilibrium]] model that concludes that individual self-interest operating in a competitive market place produces the unique conditions under which a society's total utility is maximized. Vilfredo Pareto used an [[edgeworth box]] contact line to illustrate a similar social optimality.

[[Ludwig von Mises]], in [[Human Action]] (see note 3 at the bottom), claims that Smith believed that the invisible hand was that of God. He did not mean this as a criticism, since he held that secular reasoning leads to similar conclusions.

The invisible hand is traditionally understood as a concept in economics, but [[Robert Nozick]] argues in ''[[Anarchy, State and Utopia]]'' that substantively the same concept exists in a number of other areas of academic discourse under different names, notably Darwinian [[natural selection]]. In turn, [[Daniel Dennett]] argues in ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'' that this represents a "universal acid" that may be applied to a number of seemingly disparate areas of philosophical inquiry (consciousness and free will in particular).

== Tawney's interpretation ==
[[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] [[R. H. Tawney]] saw Smith as putting a name on an older idea:

{{quote|If preachers have not yet overtly identified themselves with the view of the natural man, expressed by an eighteenth-century writer in the words, trade is one thing and religion is another, they imply a not very different conclusion by their silence as to the possibility of collisions between them. The characteristic doctrine was one, in fact, which left little room for religious teaching as to economic morality, because it anticipated the theory, later epitomized by Adam Smith in his famous reference to the invisible hand, which saw in economic self-interest the operation of a providential plan... The existing order, except insofar as the short-sighted enactments of Governments interfered with it, was the natural order, and the order established by nature was the order established by God. Most educated men, in the middle of the [eighteenth] century, would have found their philosophy expressed in the lines of [[Alexander Pope|Pope]]:
: Thus God and Nature formed the general frame,
: And bade self-love and social be the same.
Naturally, again, such an attitude precluded a critical examination of institutions, and left as the sphere of Christian charity only those parts of life that could be reserved for philanthropy, precisely because they fell outside that larger area of normal human relations, in which the promptings of self-interest provided an all-sufficient motive and rule of conduct.  (''[[Religion and the Rise of Capitalism]]'', pp. 191–192.)}}

== Other uses of the phrase by Smith ==
Only in ''The History of Astronomy'' (written before 1758) Smith speaks of ''the invisible hand'', to which ignorants refer to explain natural phenomena otherwise unexplainable:

{{quote|Fire burns, and water refreshes; heavy bodies descend, and lighter substances fly upwards, by the necessity of their own nature; nor was the invisible hand of Jupiter ever apprehended to be employed in those matters.<ref>Smith, A., 1980, The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, 7 vol., Oxford University Press, vol. III, p. 49</ref>}}

In ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' (1759) and in ''The Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Adam Smith speaks of ''an'' invisible hand, never of ''the'' invisible hand. In ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' Smith uses the concept to sustain a "trickling down" theory, a concept also used in neoclassical development theory: The gluttony of the rich serves to feed the poor.

{{quote|The rich … consume little more than the poor, and in spite of their natural selfishness and rapacity, though they mean only their own conveniency, though the sole end which they propose from the labours of all the thousands whom they employ, be the gratification of their own vain and insatiable desires, they divide with the poor the produce of all their improvements. They are led by an ''invisible hand'' [emphasis added] to make nearly the same distribution of the necessaries of life, which would have been made, had the earth been divided into equal portions among all its inhabitants, and thus without intending it, without knowing it, advance the interest of the society, and afford means to the multiplication of the species. When Providence divided the earth among a few lordly masters, it neither forgot nor abandoned those who seemed to have been left out in the partition. These last too enjoy their share of all that it produces. In what constitutes the real happiness of human life, they are in no respect inferior to those who would seem so much above them. In ease of body and peace of mind, all the different ranks of life are nearly upon a level, and the beggar, who suns himself by the side of the highway, possesses that security which kings are fighting for (emphasis added).<ref>Smith, A., 1976, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, vol. 1, p. 184 in: The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, 7 vol., Oxford University Press</ref>}}

Smith's visit to France and his acquaintance to the French Économistes (known as [[Physiocracy|Physiocrats]]) changed his views from micro-economic optimisation to macro-economic growth as the end of [[Political Economy]]. So the landlord's gluttony in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' is denounced in the ''Wealth of Nations'' as ''[[unproductive labour]]''. [[Amasa Walker|Walker]], the first president (1885 to 92) of the [[American Economic Association]], concurred:

{{quote|The domestic servant … is not employed as a means to his master's profit. His master's income is not due in any part to his employment; on the contrary, that income is first acquired … and in the amount of the income is determined whether the servant shall be employed or not, while to the full extent of that employment the income is diminished. As Adam Smith expresses it "a man grows rich by employing a multitude of manufacturers; he grows poor by maintaining a multitude of menial servants."<ref>Walker, A., 1875, The Wage Question, N:Y: Henry Holt, p. 215</ref>}}

Smith's theoretical U-turn from a micro-economical to a macro-economical view is not reflected in ''The Wealth of Nations''. Large parts of this book are retaken from Smith's lectures before his visit to France. So one must distinguish in ''The Wealth of Nations'' a micro-economical and a macro-economical Adam Smith. Whether Smith's quotation of ''an invisible hand'' in the middle of his work is a micro-economical statement or a macro-economical statement condemning monopolies and government interferences as in the case of tariffs and patents is debatable.

== Criticisms ==

===Joseph E. Stiglitz===
The [[Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]], says: "the reason that the invisible hand often seems invisible is that it is often not there."<ref>The Roaring Nineties'', 2006</ref><ref name=HAND1>[http://blogs.iht.com/tribtalk/business/globalization/?p=177 ALTMAN, Daniel. ''Managing Globalization.'' In: ''Q & Answers'' with Joseph E. Stiglitz, Columbia University and ''The International Herald Tribune'', October 11, 2006 05:03AM.]</ref> Stiglitz explains his position:

{{quote|Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, is often cited as arguing for the "invisible hand" and [[free market]]s: firms, in the pursuit of profits, are led, as if by an invisible hand, to do what is best for the world. But unlike his followers, Adam Smith was aware of some of the limitations of free markets, and research since then has further clarified why free markets, by themselves, often do not lead to what is best. As I put it in my new book, Making Globalization Work, the reason that the invisible hand often seems invisible is that it is often not there. Whenever there are "externalities"—where the actions of an individual have impacts on others for which they do not pay, or for which they are not compensated—markets will not work well. Some of the important instances have long understood environmental externalities. Markets, by themselves, produce too much pollution. Markets, by themselves, also produce too little basic research. (The government was responsible for financing most of the important scientific breakthroughs, including the internet and the first telegraph line, and many bio-tech advances.) But recent research has shown that these externalities are pervasive, whenever there is imperfect information or imperfect risk markets—that is always.  Government plays an important role in banking and securities regulation, and a host of other areas: some regulation is required to make markets work. Government is needed, almost all would agree, at a minimum to enforce contracts and property rights. The real debate today is about finding the right balance between the market and government (and the third "sector" – governmental non-profit organizations.) Both are needed. They can each complement each other. This balance differs from time to time and place to place.<ref name="HAND1"/>}}

===Noam Chomsky===
{{See also|Equity home bias puzzle}}
[[Noam Chomsky]] suggests that Smith (and more specifically [[David Ricardo]]) sometimes used the phrase to refer to a "home bias" for investing domestically in opposition to [[Offshore outsourcing|outsourcing]] production and [[neoliberalism]].<ref name="ChomskySmith">"[http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20110824.htm American Decline: Causes and Consequences]" Noam Chomsky</ref>
{{quote|Rather interestingly these issues were foreseen by the great founders of modern economics, Adam Smith for example. He recognized and discussed what would happen to Britain if the masters adhered to the rules of sound economics – what's now called neoliberalism. He warned that if British manufacturers, merchants, and investors turned abroad, they might profit but England would suffer. However, he felt that this wouldn't happen because the masters would be guided by a home bias. So as if by an invisible hand England would be spared the ravages of economic rationality. That passage is pretty hard to miss. It's the only occurrence of the famous phrase "invisible hand" in ''Wealth of Nations'', namely in a critique of what we call neoliberalism.<ref>http://rabble.ca/audio/download/83486/NNI+Noam+Chomsky+.mp3</ref>}}

Chomsky's claim that Smith is making a critique of economic rationality is in tension with Smith's argument. Smith argues that supporting domestic industry at equal or slightly lower profit is economically rational because, "He can know better the character and situation of the persons whom he trusts; and if he should happen to be deceived, he knows better the laws of the country from which he must seek redress."<ref>http://www.bibliomania.com/2/1/65/112/frameset.html</ref>

===Stephen LeRoy===
Stephen LeRoy, professor emeritus at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, offered a critique of the Invisible Hand:
{{quote|The single most important proposition in economic theory, first stated by Adam Smith, is that competitive markets do a good job allocating resources. (...) The financial crisis has spurred a debate about the proper balance between markets and government and prompted some scholars to question whether the conditions assumed by Smith...are accurate for modern economies.<ref>http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2010/el2010-14.html</ref>}}

Among the conditions that were assumed, and which have since fallen into question, are that [[information asymmetry|information asymmetries]], incentive distortions, and the failure of government regulators to serve as a check.<ref>http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/5/9/864916/-Is-the-Invisible-Hand-stealing-our-Future-well-being</ref>

The Skyline and Cima were luxury vehicles in Japan in earlier forms, and were originally exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealership network called ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Prince Shop]],'' then later called ''Nissan Red Stage'' until the Japanese dealership network was disbanded.

In 2012, Infiniti moved its global headquarters from the Nissan corporate building in Yokohama and incorporated in [[Hong Kong]] as '''Infiniti Global Limited''', with [[Carlos Ghosn]] intending for Infiniti to have a greater focus on the burgeoning luxury market in mainland China as it forecast the country to become the largest luxury car market.<ref name=bloomberg013114>{{cite web|last=Philip|first=Siddharth|title=Nissan’s Infiniti Says Joint Daimler Platform Is Planned|url=http://origin-www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&tkr=DAI:GR&sid=a3WiCVY8tkhA|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref> Johan de Nysschen was appointed to head the Infiniti division in 2012.<ref>http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2012/06/former-audi-ceo-johan-de-nysschen-becomes-head-of-infiniti.html</ref> De Nysschen left the company as of August 2014 to become CEO of [[Cadillac]].

==History==

===The beginning===
[[File:1st-Infiniti-Q45.jpg|thumb|right|1990-1993 [[Infiniti Q45]]]]
The Infiniti brand was introduced in the [[USA]] in 1989. The [[marketing strategy]] was to target the premium vehicle segments in the United States that would not have otherwise fit in with Nissan's more mainstream image, and partially influenced by the [[Plaza Accord]] of 1985. The brand was created around the same time as Japanese rivals [[Toyota]] and [[Honda]] developed their [[Lexus]] and [[Acura]] premium brands. The [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] imposed [[voluntary export restraints]] for the U.S. market, so it was more profitable for automakers to export more expensive cars to the U.S.

The Infiniti marque was launched with two models, the [[Infiniti Q45|Q45]], and the [[Infiniti M30|M30]]. The Q45 was based on the all new second generation [[Japanese domestic market|JDM]] [[Nissan President#President HG50|Nissan President]] on a five millimeter shorter wheelbase [[automobile platform|platform]] at 2,875&nbsp;mm (113.2&nbsp;in). Starting with model year 1992, the wheelbase matched the President's wheelbase at 2880&nbsp;mm (113.4&nbsp;in). The Q45 included a {{convert|278|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} V8 engine, [[steering|four wheel steering]], and [[active suspension]] system offered on the first generation Q45t. The car's features would have made it competitive in the full-sized "luxury" segment against the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|Mercedes S-Class]], [[BMW 7 Series]], [[Jaguar XJ]] and [[Cadillac Fleetwood]].

[[File:Infiniti-M30-Coupe.jpg|thumb|right|1990 [[Infiniti M30]]]]
A second model was introduced in 1990, the 2-door [[Infiniti M|M30]], a [[badge engineered]] [[Nissan Leopard]]. It remained in production for three years as an alternative to the [[Lexus SC]]. The powertrain was the [[VG30E]] {{convert|162|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} engine and an automatic transmission. The M30 coupe was underpowered for its stock weight of {{convert|3333|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. The M30 convertible weighed even more, due to the required body and chassis reinforcements. The appearance of the M30 had almost no resemblance to the larger Q45, and the interior was almost completely different.

Infiniti did not offer an [[executive car|mid-luxury]] sedan to match the first Japanese luxury sedan introduced to North America, the [[Acura Legend]], which was later joined by the [[Lexus GS]]. Infiniti's first offering in the entry-level luxury segment was the [[Infiniti J30]], which had to compete with the revised 1992 [[Lexus ES]] and was unsuccessful owing to its small interior and unusual styling to which it was succeeded in 1996 by the [[Infiniti I]] series, related to the [[Nissan Maxima]] and in 2002 by the [[Infiniti G35]].

The Infiniti badge is a stylized representation of a road extending into the horizon, stretching to "Infiniti".

===1990s===
[[File:InfinitiG20P10.jpg|thumb|right|1990 [[Infiniti G20]]]]
[[File:Infiniti J30.jpg|thumb|right|1992 [[Infiniti J30]]]]
[[File:1997-2000 Infiniti QX4.jpg|thumb|right|1997-2000 [[Infiniti QX4]]]]
In 1991, Infiniti introduced a third model, the [[Infiniti G#First generation (P10, 1991–1996)|Infiniti G20]], derived from the compact and European-focused [[Nissan Primera]].

For the 1993 model year, Infiniti introduced a [[Coupé#Four-door coupé|four-door coupé]] [[Infiniti J30|J30]] with only one engine option, the {{convert|210|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[Nissan VG engine#VG30DE|VG30DE]]. This engine was from the {{convert|222|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}[[300ZX]], the JDM [[Nissan Cedric]], [[Nissan Gloria]] and the [[Nissan Cima]], and was the North American version of the third generation JDM [[Nissan Leopard]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Infiniti sales were slow.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The company's initial campaign aimed to bring about brand awareness with [[Zen]]-influenced spots that focused on nature and tranquility, without showing the actual cars.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Designers decided not to adorn the interiors with wood accents and chrome brightwork, opting instead for a [[monochrome]] appearance focusing on padded leather and vinyl throughout. Some buyers had faux wood appliques added to areas surrounding the center console and around the interior door handles. The only item that had a bright appearance was the centrally installed [[analog clock]] in all models, a design that is maintained by the designers.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

By the mid-1990s, Infiniti was lagging behind [[Lexus]] and [[Acura]] in sales. The Q45 had retreated considerably from its focused, taut rendition of a sporty full-size luxury sedan, having become a barely recognizable, ponderously handling sedan that earned the nickname "The Japanese Lincoln". In 1999, Infiniti revived the [[Infiniti G20|G20]], based on the discontinued JDM [[Nissan Primera]], a compact sport sedan whose production was halted for 1998 in Europe and Japan. The second generation G20 was marketed as a competitor to European entry-level luxury sport sedans, but it now weighed more than the first generation version. Because Infiniti continued to use the [[SR20DE]] four-cylinder engine and compact size, it fell short of sales expectations. The G20 was also marketed primarily to the wrong demographic, that being middle-aged professional women, and as such it was not as popular new as its main competition, the similarly priced [[Acura Integra]].

In 1997, Infiniti released the [[QX4]], modifying and adding premium accommodations to the [[Nissan Pathfinder]], becoming one of the first luxury car manufacturers to offer a mid-size premium SUV.

Infiniti replaced the J30 mid-sized rear drive sedan with the second-generation JDM [[Nissan Cefiro]], giving it the North American designation "I30" in 1996.  It offered one engine, the {{convert|193|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} [[Nissan VQ engine#VQ30DE|VQ30DE]] with front wheel drive shared with the Maxima. The I30 was redesigned for the 2000 model year, featuring an increase in power to 231 PS (170&nbsp;kW; 227&nbsp;hp). Infiniti made further changes to the I30's appearance and performance in 2002, upgrading the engine to the more powerful 259 PS (190&nbsp;kW; 255&nbsp;hp) [[Nissan VQ engine#VQ35DE|VQ35DE]]; this inspired a name change to the vehicle, which became the I35. Sales and the brand, bereft of an image or a following, floundered.

===2000s===
[[File:'02-'04 Infiniti I35.JPG|thumb|right|2002-2004 Infiniti I35]]
[[File:08-Infiniti-G37-Sport.jpg|thumb|right|2008 Infiniti G37 Sport]]
By 2000, large Japanese companies were feeling the effect of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]], and the reduced desirability of Infiniti's led to its facing extinction. The company rededicated itself to developing a dynamic and powerful line-up of sporty luxury cars. This coincided with parent company Nissan entering into a merger with Renault under the direction of Carlos Ghosn and the [[Nissan Motor Company#Alliance with Renault|Nissan Revival Plan]]. ''[[Car and Driver]]'' reported that Infiniti executives invited members of the motoring press to a meeting where they "swore never again to take their eyes off [[BMW]]."{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Although this effort began with a completely redesigned [[Infiniti Q45|Q45]] flagship for the 2002 model year, it was the [[Infiniti G|G35]] that helped improve Infiniti sales in 2003. In Japan, Nissan had a well established reputation with premium level performance sedans after Nissan acquired the [[Prince Motor Company]] and integrated the [[Nissan Skyline]], [[Nissan Laurel]] and [[Nissan Gloria]], originally Prince vehicles, in 1966-1968. A sports sedan replacing its [[Nissan Primera]]-based predecessor (the [[Infiniti G|G20]]), the [[Nissan Skyline]]-based Infiniti G35, was successful after it was voted [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]] in 2003.

The release of the sport-tuned [[Infiniti FX|FX35/45]] [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover]] that same year piggybacked on the G35's success. The FX used the same components as the G35 sport coupe and was designed for American tastes. It combined good handling and performance with [[station wagon]]-like versatility and all-weather capability. In 2004, Infiniti added an all-wheel drive version of the G35 sports sedan to compete with similar all-wheel drive sports sedans from [[Audi]] and [[BMW]]. Infiniti also introduced a larger SUV to compete with the [[Toyota Land Cruiser]]/Lexus LX470. This was the 2004 [[Infiniti QX#Second generation series JA60 (2004-present)|Infiniti QX56]] based on the U.S. market [[Nissan Armada]].

Nissan Motors President and CEO, [[Carlos Ghosn]], developed a [[Strategic management|business strategy]] to break Infiniti away from its Nissan roots. The G series helped re-define Infiniti as the "Japanese BMW", as it was aimed directly at the BMW 3 Series of sedans and coupes.[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/new-cars/auto-news/luxury-car-shopper-should-consider-a-japanese-bmw/article5763577/] The M35/M45 garnered acclaim from the automotive press, winning an eight-car comparison test in ''[[Car and Driver]]'', and the model was named the best luxury sedan by ''[[Consumer Reports]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The M45 model featured the same engine as the Q45, and the M45 became the flagship model after the Q45 was discontinued. The Infiniti M (2003–2005) and the Infiniti G (starting in 2003) were known in Japan as the Nissan Gloria and the Nissan Skyline.

For the 2007 model year a redesigned version of the G35 sedan was introduced, followed in 2008 by a new version of the company's G coupe, the G37. The coupe was first unveiled at the [[New York International Auto Show]]. Also released in 2008 was new [[Infiniti EX35]] compact crossover, Infiniti's entry into the compact luxury crossover market. The EX shared the G35's 3.5 liter, {{Convert|306|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, V6 engine.

Carlos Ghosn unveiled Infiniti’s arrival in Europe at the Geneva Motor Show 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7279777.stm|title=Nissan launches luxury brand in Europe|first=Jorn|last=Madslien|publisher=BBC News|date=6 March 2008|accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref> The official launch was late-2008, and was phased over a two-year period across 21 European countries. Four models are offered in Europe: the next generation of the [[Infiniti FX]]37 and [[Infiniti FX]]50 performance SUV, the [[Infiniti G37]], the [[Infiniti G37]] coupe, and the [[Infiniti EX]]37 crossover.

===2010s===
[[File:2011 Infiniti M56S 1 -- 06-16-2010.jpg|thumb|right|Infiniti M56]]
[[Carlos Ghosn]] unveiled the [[Infiniti M]] at a hotel in Los Angeles. It shares the [[VQ37VHR]] from the [[Infiniti G]], and [[Nissan 370Z]]. Featured are new powertrains: the 5.6 L V8 ([[Nissan VK engine#VK56VD|VK56VD]]) with [[VVEL]], [[Gasoline direct injection]], the Nissan-Renault [[V9X Engine]] V6 Turbo Diesel (only for Europe), and the newly developed hybrid that will include one electric motor and two clutches to allow the gas engine and electric motor to drive the rear wheels simultaneously. The lithium-ion battery pack will come from the [[Infiniti Essence]].

At the 2010 [[Geneva Motor Show]], Infiniti launched a new powertrain for Europe, with the new [[V9X Engine]] engine developed by the [[Renault-Nissan Alliance]]. The new engine is used in the [[Infiniti FX]], [[Infiniti EX]], and the new [[Infiniti M]]. The new Infiniti M made its European debut at the show.

In August 2010 Infiniti unveiled its new performance division named [[Infiniti Performance Line]], or IPL.<ref name="Migliore">{{cite web |url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20100814/PEBBLE/100819909 |title=IPL: Why Infiniti is Now Aiming for Performance |first=Greg |last=Migliore |date=14 August 2010 |work=autoweek.com |publisher=Crain Communications |accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref>

In August 2013 Infiniti announced that Simone Piattelli Palmarini would take up the role as head of [[public relations]] for Infiniti EMEA.

In February, 2014, the brand will be marketed for the first time in Japan. The model which will be initially introduced is a hybrid version of the Q50 and would be named Skyline. The [[Badge engineering|badge engineered]] Nissan Skyline will continue on sale.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/11/12/business/skyline-to-be-infiniti-debut-car-in-japan/#.UoJ_yiciyxs |title=Skyline to be Infiniti debut car in Japan |work=japantimes.co.jp |publisher=[[The Japan Times]] |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=12 November 2013}}</ref>

====Brand repositioning====
As of 2011, the [[Infiniti G|G]] Series (consisting of the sedan, coupe, and convertible) accounts for 60% of sales. This has been attributed to their SUVs (including crossovers) which have been seen as determinedly aimed at the narrowest of niches, a lost opportunity as SUVs are popular in the U.S. market. In contrast, at archrival Lexus, SUVs contributed half of the sales volume. In 2011, Infiniti sales fell, while other import luxury vehicles were doing well.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2011/autos/1112/gallery.most-disliked-cars.fortune/7.html | work=CNN | title=The most disliked cars of 2011}}</ref> Furthermore, Infiniti's performance over practicality emphasis has resulted in its crossovers and SUVs faring poorly among women compared to offerings from Acura and Lexus.<ref name="Monticello">{{cite web|last=Monticello |first=Mike |url=http://www.insideline.com/Infiniti/jx/2013/2013-Infiniti-jx35-awd-full-test-and-video.html |title=2013 Infiniti JX35 AWD Full Test and Video |publisher=Insideline.com |date=2012-03-28 |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref>

More importantly, the JX was meant to give Infiniti a credible rival to the [[Acura MDX]] and [[BMW X5]] crossovers that offer optional three-row seating.[http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1204_2013_Infiniti_jx35_2012_bmw_x5_2013_lincoln_mkt_and_2012_acura_mdx/viewall.html]<ref name="Monticello"/>

On December 17, 2012, Infiniti announced a new product nomenclature scheme where all sedans and coupes will carry a "Q" prefix while all crossovers and SUVs will carry a "QX" prefix. Instead of numbers indicating engine displacement after the prefix, the two digits will be used to indicate where in the brand's hierarchy the model falls. The first model to follow this scheme will be the upcoming Q50, which was intended on replacing the G sedan, but is now the Q40. The rest of the line was later transitioned to the new scheme for the 2014 model year.<ref name="Korzeniewski">{{cite web|last=Korzeniewski|first=Jeremy|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/12/17/Infiniti-queues-up-questionable-q-and-qx-naming-scheme/|title=Infiniti queues up questionable Q and QX naming scheme|publisher=Autoblog|date=2012-12-17|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>[http://www.vancouversun.com/cars/Infiniti+brand+repositions+take+German+giants/7871905/story.html]

==Models==
Infiniti's former model name designation included one letter for [[coupe|coupés]] and [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s (two letters for [[SUV]]s) and a number reflecting engine displacement. For example, the '''[[Infiniti QX56|QX56]]''' was an SUV featuring a 5.6&nbsp;L engine. An exception to this was the '''[[Infiniti QX4|QX4]]''' SUV, which featured a 3.3&nbsp;L engine (1997–2000) and later a 3.5&nbsp;L engine (2001–2003). An "'''x'''" following the engine displacement of Infiniti sedans denoted an [[all wheel drive]] model (e.g. [[Infiniti G35x]]), "'''s'''" denoted a sport package, "'''h'''" denoted a hybrid model, "'''d'''" denoted a diesel model (e.g. [[Infiniti M#M30d .28Diesel version.29 .282011.2B.29|M30d]]) and a "'''t'''" for a Touring model (older models only).

In 2013, Infiniti's model designation changed to the coupes and sedans starting with the letter Q, the SUVs and crossovers starting with the letters QX, and a number reflecting the model's place in the brand lineup. For instance, the M sedan became the Q70 while the G sedan was replaced with the Q50; meanwhile, the QX56 became the QX80 while the EX became the QX50.<ref name="Korzeniewski"/>

===Current===
Most Infiniti coupes, sedans and crossovers are based on the [[Nissan FM platform]]. The center of the engine is placed behind the front wheels. The exceptions are the QX80 full-size SUV that rides on the [[Nissan F-Alpha platform]] and the QX60 crossover that rides on the [[Nissan D platform]].

'''General Murtala Ramat Muhammed''' (November 8, 1938&ndash;February 13, 1976) was a [[List of Presidents of Nigeria|military ruler]] (Head of the Federal Military Government) of [[Nigeria]] from 1975 until his assassination in 1976. He is widely recognized as a hero in the country. 

==Role during 1960s coups==
Muhammed opposed the regime of [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]] which took power after a [[coup d'etat]] on January 15, 1966 carried out mainly by Christian [[Igbo people|Igbo]] from the south, in which several northern Nigerian leaders had been killed under gruesome circumstances. Aguiyi-Ironsi, as GOC of the Nigerian Army, brought normality back to the nation by imprisoning the coup makers and intimidating the federal cabinet into handing over the helms of government to him. However, Many northerners saw this and the reluctance of Ironsi to prosecute the coupist and the fact that the army was purportedly giving exceptional privileges to the coupist as an indication of Ironsi's support for the killings. Consequently northern politicians and civil servants mounted pressure upon northern officers such as Muhammed to avenge the coup. In the night of July 29, 1966, northern soldiers at Abeokuta barracks mutinied, thus precipitating a counter-coup, which may very well have been in the planning stages.  The counter-coup led to the installation of Lieutenant-Colonel [[Yakubu Gowon]] as Supreme Commander of the Nigerian Armed Forces, despite the intransigence of Muhammed who wanted the role of Supreme Commander for himself. However, as Gowon was militarily his senior, and finding a lack of support from the British and American advisors, he caved in. Gowon rewarded him by confirming his ranking (he had been an acting Lt. Colonel till then) and his appointment (Inspector of Signals).
In view of what I have just said and a lot more which time will not permit me to mention, we the Young Revolutionaries have once again taken over the Government to save Murtala from total disgrace and prevent him from committing further blunders and totally collapsing the country before he runs away in the name of retirement to enjoy the huge fortune he got through bribe which he has now stored outside this country. I believe that charity should begin at home. Please stay by your radio for further announcements. We are all together,” so ended the speech that was never read.

==Nigerian civil war==
During the [[Nigerian Civil War]], Muhammed was General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the [[Nigerian Army]]'s [[2nd Division (Nigeria)|2nd Division]]. This division was responsible for the legendary beating back of the Biafran Army from the midwestern region, as well as crossing the River Niger and linking up with the 1st Division, which was marching down from Nsukka and Enugu. It is on record that Gen. Murtala Muhammed supervised the cold blooded killings of innocent civilians in Asaba Delta State,when his men entered the town during the Biafran War.

Muhammed's encounter with disaster during the war happened shortly after, as he attempted to cross the River Niger to Biafra. Despite the recommendation of his superiors at Army Headquarters in Lagos that he wait for the bridge, which had been blown up by the retreating Biafran forces, to be rebuilt, he insisted on a riverine crossing.  Twice he was beaten back, but he steadfastly kept resolve and finally made it through on his third attempt. Shortly after this, Muhammed fed up with reprimands from Army HQ, decided to quit his command and left for an extended holiday in the United Kingdom, but not before threatening to resign his commission. His historic military feats during the war won him National acclaim and respect even from his adversaries.

==Role after the civil war==
On his return to Nigeria after the war, he was given back his old position of Army Signals Inspector and it seemed the last chapter had been written in his army career. However, with the declining popularity of the Gowon government, which had been characterized by excesses and corruption, some Army officers, acting in what they claimed to be patriotic interests, approached Brigadier Muhammed and two other wartime colleagues. It has been speculated that the real reason for the coup was the frustration on the part of wartime commanders, who felt that despite their efforts to win Nigeria the war, their army colleagues who had remained at Army HQ, away from the frontlines, were reaping the benefits amidst an atmosphere of corruption. The coupists identified with the now popular Muhammad as the one who would lead after deposing the Gowon government.

==Head of state==

On July 30, 1975, Brigadier (later General) Muhammed was made head of state, when General Gowon was overthrown while at an [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) summit in Kampala, Uganda.<ref>{{cite book|last=Falola|first=Toyin|title=A History of Nigeria|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=052168157X|author2=Heaton, Matthew}}</ref> Brigadiers Obasanjo (later Lt.General) and Danjuma (later Lt.General) were appointed as Chief of Staff, Supreme HQ and Chief of Army Staff, respectively.In the coup d'état that brought him to power he introduced the phrases "Fellow Nigerians" and "with immediate effect" to the national lexicon.<ref>Ndaeyo Uko, ''Romancing the Gun: The Press as a Promoter of Military Rule'', Africa Research & Publications, 2004. ISBN 978-1592211890</ref> In a short time, Murtala Muhammed's policies won him broad popular support, and his decisiveness elevated him to the status of a folk hero.<ref>{{cite book|title=Third World Politics: An Introduction|first=Christopher|last= Clapham|publisher= Routledge|year= 1985|isbn=0-7099-0757-5}}</ref>

One of his first acts was to scrap the 1973 census, which was weighted in favor of the north, and to revert to the 1963 count for official purposes. Murtala Muhammad removed top federal and state officials to break links with the Gowon regime and to restore public confidence in the federal government. More than 10,000 public officials and employees were dismissed without benefits, on account of age, health, incompetence, or malpractice. The purge affected the civil service, judiciary, police and armed forces, diplomatic service, public corporations, and universities. Some officials were brought to trial on charges of corruption. He also began the demobilization of 100,000 troops from the swollen ranks of the armed forces.

Twelve of the 25 ministerial posts on the new [[Federal Executive Council (Nigeria)|Federal Executive Council]] went to civilians, but the cabinet was secondary to the executive [[Supreme Military Council]]. Muhammad imposed the authority of the federal government in areas formerly reserved for the states, restricting the latitude exercised by state governments and their governors in determining and executing policy. Newly appointed military governors of the states were not given seats on the Supreme Military Council, but instead were expected to administer federal policies handed down by Muhammad through the military council. The federal government took over the operation of the country's two largest newspapers, made broadcasting a federal monopoly, and brought remaining state-run universities under federal control.

Murtala Muhammad initiated a comprehensive review of the Third National Development Plan. Singling out [[inflation]] as the greatest danger to the economy, he was determined to reduce the [[money supply]] that had been swollen by government expenditures on public works. Muhammad also announced that his government would encourage the rapid expansion of the private sector into areas dominated by public corporations. He reappraised foreign policy, stressing a "Nigeria first" orientation in line with [[OPEC]] price guidelines that was to the disadvantage of other African countries. Nigeria became "[[Neutral country|neutral]]" rather than "[[Non-Aligned Movement|nonaligned]]" in international affairs. The shift in orientation became apparent with respect to [[Angola]]. Nigeria had worked with the [[OAU]] to bring about a negotiated reconciliation of the warring factions in the former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony, but late in 1975 Murtala Muhammad announced Nigeria's support for the Soviet-backed [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]], citing [[South Africa|South Africa's]] armed intervention on the side of the rival National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]]). The realignment strained relations with the [[United States]], which argued for the withdrawal of [[Cuba]]n troops and Soviet advisers from Angola. In October the Nigerian Air Force took delivery of Soviet-built aircraft that had been ordered under Gowon.

==Assassination==
[[Image:Mohammedcar.jpg|thumb|right|Car in which Murtala Muhammed was assassinated.]]
Murtala Muhammed was killed, aged 37, along with his aide-de-camp, Lieutenant [[Akintunde Akinsehinwa]], on February 13, 1976 in an abortive coup attempt led by Lt. Col [[Buka Suka Dimka]], when his car was ambushed while en route to his office at [[Dodan Barracks]], [[Lagos]]. He was succeeded by the Chief of Staff, Supreme HQ [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], who completed his plan of an orderly transfer to civilian rule by handing power to [[Shehu Shagari]] on October 1, 1979. Today, his portrait adorns the 20 Naira note and he stands one of the only three national heroes of the Nigerian Republic. [[Murtala Muhammed International Airport]] in Lagos is named in his honor.

"'''Dulcinea del Toboso'''" (real name '''Aldonza Lorenzo''') is a [[fictional character]] who is referred to (but does not appear) in [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' novel ''[[Don Quixote]]''. Seeking the traditions of the [[Knight-errant|knights-errant]] of old, Don Quixote finds a true love whom he calls Dulcinea. She is a simple peasant in his home town, but Quixote imagines her to be the most beautiful of all women. At times, Quixote goes into detail about her appearance, though he freely admits that he has seen her only fleetingly and has never spoken with her.

Don Quixote describes her appearance in the following terms: "... her name is Dulcinea, her country [[El Toboso]], a village of [[La Mancha]], her rank must be at least that of a princess, since she is my queen and lady, and her beauty superhuman, since all the impossible and fanciful attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies are verified in her; for her [[blond|hairs are gold]], her forehead [[Elysium|Elysian fields]], her eyebrows rainbows, her eyes suns, her cheeks roses, her lips coral, her teeth pearls, her neck alabaster, her bosom marble, her hands ivory, her fairness snow, and what modesty conceals from sight such, I think and imagine, as rational reflection can only extol, not compare." [Volume 1/Chapter XIII]

However, [[Sancho Panza]], Don Quixote's squire, knows Dulcinea well. Her real name is Aldonza Lorenzo, and Sancho describes her as follows: "… I can tell you that she pitches a bar as well as the strongest lad in the whole village… She's a brawny girl, well built and tall and sturdy, and she will know how to keep her chin out of the mud with any knight errant who ever has her for his mistress. O the wench, what muscles she's got, and what a pair of lungs! I remember the day she went up the village belfry to call in some of their lads who were working in a fallow field of her father's, and they could hear her plainly as if they had been at the foot of the tower, although they were nearly two miles away. There's a good deal of the court-lady about her too, for she has a crack with everybody, and makes a joke and a mock of them all." [Volume 1/Chapter XXV]

[[Image:El_Toboso_Monumento_a_D._Quijote_y_Dulcinea.jpg|300px|thumb|Monument to Don Quixote and Dulcinea, [[Castilla-La Mancha]], Spain.]]
In the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] of the time, Dulcinea means something akin to an overly elegant "sweetness". In this way, Dulcinea is an entirely fictional person for whom Quixote relentlessly fights. To this day, a reference to someone as one's "Dulcinea" implies hopeless devotion and love for her, and particularly unrequited love.

She does appear in many stage and film adaptations of the book. In cinema and on stage, she has been played by (among others) [[Sophia Loren]], [[Joan Diener]], [[Rosemary Leach]], [[Hollis Resnik]], and [[Vanessa L. Williams|Vanessa Williams]]. In the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'', she is a self-described [[prostitute|whore]]. Her given name is Aldonza, and a prominent arc of the musical follows her distrust and then fervent belief in Don Quixote's quest. She begins as someone who has no self-worth, Aldonza, and through Quixote's belief in her, she begins to believe in herself as someone of great worth and takes on the name Dulcinea.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068909/ ''Man of La Mancha'' (1972)] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> In the stage version (but not in the 1972 film), the local priest sings a song called "To Each His Dulcinea", in which he reflects that although Dulcinea does not exist, the idea of her is what keeps Don Quixote alive and on his quest.

The [[Jules Massenet]] opera ''[[Don Quichotte]]'' depicts Dulcinée as a major character, the local queen who sends the knight on a quest to retrieve her jewels.

==In popular culture==

[[File:The Phantom of the Opera (1925).webm|thumb|''The Phantom of the Opera'']]
'''''The Phantom of the Opera''''' is a 1925 American [[Silent film|silent]] [[horror film]] adaptation of [[Gaston Leroux]]'s [[The Phantom of the Opera|1910 novel ''Le Fantôme de l'Opéra'']], directed by [[Rupert Julian]] and starring [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]] in the title role of the deformed Phantom who haunts the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera House]],<ref>''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; September 17, 1925, page 151.</ref> causing murder and mayhem in an attempt to make the woman he loves a star. The movie remains most famous for Chaney's ghastly, self-devised make-up, which was kept a studio secret until the film's premiere.

The picture also features [[Mary Philbin]], [[Norman Kerry]], [[Arthur Edmund Carewe]], [[Gibson Gowland]], [[John St. Polis]], and [[Snitz Edwards]]. The last surviving cast member was [[Carla Laemmle]] (1909–2014), niece of producer [[Carl Laemmle]], who played a small role as "prima ballerina" in the film when she was about 15.

The [[Film adaptation|film was adapted]] by [[Elliott J. Clawson]], [[Tom Reed (screenwriter)|Tom Reed]] and [[Raymond L. Schrock]] and was directed by [[Rupert Julian]] and with supplemental direction by [[Lon Chaney]]{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} and [[Edward Sedgwick]]{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}.

==Plot summary==
:''The scenario presented is based on the general release version of 1925, which has additional scenes and sequences in different order than the existing reissue print (see below).''
The film opens with the debut of the new season at the Paris Opera House, with a production of [[Gounod]]'s ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''. Comte Philippe de Chagny ([[John St. Polis]]) and his brother, the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny ([[Norman Kerry]]) are in attendance. Raoul attends only in the hope of hearing his sweetheart [[Christine Daaé]] ([[Mary Philbin]]) sing. Christine has made a sudden rise from the chorus to understudy of the [[prima donna]]. Raoul visits her in her dressing room during the performance, and makes his intentions known that he wishes for Christine to resign and marry him.  Christine refuses to let their relationship get in the way of her career.

At the height of the most prosperous season in the Opera's history, the management suddenly resign. As they leave, they tell the new managers of the Opera Ghost, a phantom who asks for opera box #5, among other things. The new managers laugh it off as a joke, but the old management leaves troubled.

After the performance, the ballet girls are disturbed by the sight of a mysterious man in a fez ([[Arthur Edmund Carewe]]), who dwells in the cellars. Arguing whether or not he is the Phantom, they decide to ask Joseph Buquet, a stagehand who has actually seen the ghost's face. Buquet describes a ghastly sight of a living skeleton to the girls, who are then startled by a shadow cast on the wall. The antics of stagehand Florine Papillon ([[Snitz Edwards]]) do not amuse Joseph's brother, Simon ([[Gibson Gowland]]), who chases him off.  Meanwhile, Mme. Carlotta ([[Virginia Pearson]]), the prima donna of the Paris Grand Opera, barges into the managers office enraged. She has received a letter from "The Phantom," demanding that Christine sing the role of Marguerite the following night, threatening dire consequences if his demands are not met.  Christine is in her dressing room at that moment, speaking to a phantom voice (which the audience sees as a shadow on a wall behind the dressing room.)  The voice warns her that she will take Carlotta's place on Wednesday and that she is to think only of her career and her master.

The following day, in a garden near the Opera House, Raoul meets Christine and asks her to reconsider his offer.  Christine admits that she has been tutored by a divine voice, the "Spirit of Music," and that it is now impossible to stop her career.  Raoul tells her that he thinks someone is playing a joke on her, and she storms off in anger.

Wednesday evening, Carlotta is ill and Christine takes her place in the opera. During the performance, the managers go to Box 5 to see exactly who has taken it. The keeper of the box does not know who it is, as she has never seen his face. The two managers enter the box and are startled to see a shadowy figure seated. They run out of the box and compose themselves, but when they enter the box again, the person is gone. In her next performance, Christine reaches her triumph during the finale and receives a standing ovation from the audience. When Raoul visits her in her dressing room, she pretends not to recognize him, because unbeknownst to those in the room, the phantom voice is present. Raoul spends the evening outside her door, and after the others have left, just as he is about to enter, he hears the voice within the room. He overhears the voice make his intentions to Christine: "Soon, Christine, this spirit will take form and will demand your love!" When Christine leaves her room alone, Raoul breaks in to find it empty. Carlotta receives another discordant note from the Phantom. Once again, it demands that she take ill and let Christine have her part. The managers also get a note, reiterating that if Christine does not sing, they will present "Faust" in a house with a curse on it.

[[Image:PhantomOp.jpg|left|thumb|Erik, The Phantom ([[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]) and Christine Daaé ([[Mary Philbin]])]]
The following evening, despite the Phantom's warnings, a defiant Carlotta appears as Marguerite.  At first, the performance goes well, but soon the Phantom's curse takes its effect, causing the great, crystal chandelier to fall down onto the audience. Christine runs to her dressing room and is entranced by a mysterious voice through a secret door behind the mirror, descending, in a dream-like sequence, semi-conscious on horseback by a winding staircase into the lower depths of the Opera. She is then taken by gondola over a subterranean lake by the masked Phantom into his lair. The Phantom introduces himself as [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik]] and declares his love; Christine faints, so Erik carries her to a suite fabricated for her comfort. The next day, when she awakens, she finds a note from Erik telling her that she is free to come and go as she pleases, but that she must never look behind his mask. In the next room, the Phantom is playing his composition, "Don Juan Triumphant." Christine's curiosity gets the better of her, and she sneaks up behind the Phantom and tears off his mask, revealing his hideously deformed face. Enraged, the Phantom makes his plans to hold her prisoner known. In an attempt to plead to him, he excuses her to visit her world one last time, with the condition that she never sees her lover again.

Released from the underground dungeon, Christine makes a rendezvous at the annual masked-ball, which is graced with the Phantom in the guise of the '[[The Masque of the Red Death|Red-Death]]' from the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] short story of the same name. Raoul finds Christine and they flee to the roof of the Opera House, where she tells him everything that followed the chandelier crash. However, an unseen jealous Phantom perching on the statue of Apollo overhears them. Raoul plans to whisk Christine safely away to London following the next performance.  As they leave the roof, the mysterious man with the fez approaches them.  Aware that the Phantom is waiting downstairs, he leads Chrstine and Raoul to another exit.

The following evening, Raoul meets Christine in her dressing room.  She has heard the voice of the Phantom, who has revealed that he knows their plans.  Raoul has arranged for a carriage and reassures her nothing will go wrong.

Backstage, Simon finds the body of his brother hanging by the strangler's noose and vows vengeance.  During the performance, the Phantom kidnaps Christine off the stage during a blackout.  Raoul rushes to Christine's dressing room, and meets the man in the fez, who reveals himself to be Inspector Ledoux, a secret policeman who has been studying Erik's moves as the Phantom since he escaped as a prisoner from [[Devil's Island]].  Ledoux reveals the secret door in Christine's room and the two men enter the catacombs of the Opera House in an attempt to rescue Christine.  Instead, they fall into the Phantom's dungeon, a torture room of his design.  Philippe has also found his way into the catacombs looking for his brother, and a clanging alarm alerts the Phantom to his presence in a canoe on the lake.  Phillipe is drowned by Erik, who returns to find the two men in the torture chamber.  Turning a switch, the Phantom subjects the two prisoners to intense heat.

The Phantom gives Christine a choice of two levers: one shaped like a scorpion and the other like a grasshopper. One of them will save Raoul's life, but at the cost of Christine marrying Erik, while the other will blow up the Opera. Christine picks the scorpion, but it is a trick by the Phantom to "save" Raoul and Ledoux from being killed by heat &mdash; by drowning them. Christine begs the Phantom to save Raoul, promising him anything in return, even becoming his wife. At the last second, the Phantom opens a trapdoor in his floor through which Raoul and Ledoux are saved.

A mob, led by Simon, infiltrates the Phantom's lair.  As the clanging alarm sounds and the mob approaches, the Phantom attempts to flee with Christine in the carriage meant for Raoul and Christine. While Raoul saves Christine, the Phantom is pursued and killed by a mob, who throw him into the [[Seine River]] to finally drown. In a brief epilogue, Raoul and Christine are shown on their honeymoon in Viroflay.

==Production==
In 1922, Carl Laemmle, the president of [[Universal Pictures]], took a vacation to Paris. During his vacation Laemmle met the author Gaston Leroux who was working in the French film industry. During a conversation they had, Laemmle told Leroux that he admired the Paris Opera House. Leroux gave Laemmle a copy of his 1911 novel ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]''. Laemmle read the book in one night and bought the film rights as a vehicle for actor [[Lon Chaney (1925 film)|Lon Chaney]].<ref name=pttpom>Preface to {{cite book |last=Forsyth |first=Frederick |year=1999 |title= The Phantom of Manhattan|url= |location= |publisher=Bantam Press |isbn=0-593-04510-6 |accessdate= }}</ref>  Production started in late 1924 at [[Universal Studios]] and did not go smoothly. According to the Director of Photography, Charles Van Enger, throughout the production Chaney and the rest of the cast and crew had strained relations with director [[Rupert Julian]]. The first cut of the film was previewed in [[Los Angeles]] on January 7 and 26, 1925. The score was prepared by [[Joseph Carl Breil]]. No information survives as to what the score consisted of other than Universal's release: "Presented with augmented concert orchestra, playing the score composed by J. Carl Briel, composer of music for "[[Birth of a Nation]]". The exact quote from the Opening Day full page ad in the Call Bulletin read: "Universal Weekly claimed a 60-piece orchestra. Moving Picture World reported that "The music from '[[Faust]]' supplied the music [for the picture]." Due to poor reviews and reactions, the January release was pulled. On advice from Chaney and others, Universal told Julian to re-shoot most of the picture and change the style, as it was feared that a Gothic melodrama would not recoup the film's massive budget. Julian eventually walked out.

Edward Sedgwick (later director of [[Buster Keaton]]'s 1928 film ''[[The Cameraman]]'') was then assigned by producer [[Carl Laemmle]] to re-shoot and redirect the bulk of the film. Raymond L. Schrock and original screenwriter Elliot Clawson wrote new scenes at the request of Sedgewick. The film was then changed into more of a romantic comedy with action elements than the dramatic thriller that was originally made. Most of the newly added scenes depicted added subplots, with [[Chester Conklin]] and Vola Vale as comedic relief to the heroes and Ward Crane as the Russian, "Count Ruboff" dueling with Raoul for Christine's affection. This version was previewed in San Francisco on April 26, 1925, and did not do well at all, with the audience booing it off of the screen. "The story drags to the point of nauseam", one reviewer stated.

The third and final version was the result of Universal hold-overs Maurice Pivar and [[Lois Weber]], who edited the production down to nine reels. Most of the Sedgwick material was deleted, though notably the ending, with the Phantom being hunted by a mob and then being thrown into the Seine River, remained. Much of the originally deleted Julian was reedited into the picture, though some important scenes and characters were still missing. This version, containing material from both the original 1924 shooting and some from the Sedgwick reworking, was then set to be released. It debuted on September 6, 1925, at the [[Astor Theatre (New York)|Astor Theatre]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Lon Chaney Plays Role Of Paris Opera Phantom |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50E17F9385E1A7A93C4A91782D85F418285F9 |quote=The Phantom of the Opera, which has been many months in the making, is to be presented this evening at the Astor Theatre.

The score for the Astor opening was to be composed by [[Gustav Hinrichs|Professor Gustav Hinrichs]]. Hinrichs' score was not prepared in time, so instead, according to Universal Weekly, the premiere featured a score by Eugene Conte, composed mainly of "french airs" and the appropriate Faust cues.<ref group=Note>Hinrichs' score was available by the time the film went into general release. (Reference: Music Institute of Chicago (2007) program note)</ref> No expense was spared at the premiere; Universal even had a full organ installed at the Astor for the event. (As it was a legitimate house, the Astor theater used an orchestra, not an organ, for its music.)

===Makeup===
Following the success of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' in 1923, Chaney was once again given the freedom to create his own make-up as the Phantom, a habit which became almost as famous as the films he starred in. Chaney painted his eye sockets black, giving a skull-like impression to them. He also pulled the tip of his nose up and pinned it in place with wire, enlarged his nostrils with black paint, and put a set of jagged false teeth into his mouth to complete the ghastly deformed look of the Phantom. When audiences first saw ''The Phantom of the Opera'', they were said to have screamed or fainted at the scene where Christine pulls the concealing mask away, revealing his skull-like features to the audience.

Chaney's appearance as the Phantom in the film has been the most accurate depiction of the title character, based on the description given in the novel, where Erik the Phantom is described as having a skull-like face with a few wisps of black hair on top of his head. As in the novel, Chaney's Phantom has been deformed since birth, rather than having been disfigured by acid or fire, as in later adaptations of ''The Phantom of the Opera''.

Carl Laemmle commissioned the construction of a set of the Paris Opera House.

For this reason it was not dismantled until 2014.<ref name=pttpom/> Sound stage 28 on the Universal Studios lot still contained portions of the opera house set and was the oldest surviving structure built specifically for a movie in the world until its demolition in 2014 and had been used in hundreds of movies and TV series.

==Reception==
[[Mordaunt Hall]] of ''[[The New York Times]]''' gave ''The Phantom of the Opera'' a positive review as a spectacle picture, but felt that the story and acting may have been slightly improved.<ref>[[Mordaunt Hall]], [http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C00E1DB1039E233A25754C0A96F9C946495D6CF&scp=1&sq=phantom%20of%20the%20opera%20chaney&st=cse "The Screen"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 7, 1925</ref> ''[[TIME]]'' praised the sets but felt the picture was "only pretty good".<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,721118,00.html "Cinema: The New Pictures Sep. 21, 1925"], ''[[TIME]]''</ref>

Despite the production problems, the film was a success at the box office, grossing over $2 million.

==1930 re-issue with sound==
After the successful introduction of sound pictures during the 1928–29 movie season, Universal announced that they had secured the rights to a sequel to ''The Phantom of the Opera'' from the Gaston Leroux estate.  Entitled ''The Return of the Phantom'', the picture would be in sound and color.<ref>"'U' to Make 'Phantom' Sequel in Sound and Color".  Film Daily, May 5, 1929, Pg. 1.</ref>  Universal could not use Chaney in the film as he was now under contract at [[MGM]],<ref>"Chaney Not For 'U' Sequel."  Film Daily, May 17, 1929, Pg. 6.</ref> and unbeknownst to the studio, Chaney was already sick from [[throat cancer]], the disease which would ultimately kill him the following year.

Universal scrapped the sequel idea, and instead opted to re-issue ''The Phantom of the Opera'' with a new synchronized score and effects track, as well as new dialog sequences. Directors Ernst Laemmle and Frank McCormick re-shot a little less than half of the picture in sound during August 1929, while the remainder of the film was scored with music and sound effects, with music arranged by Joseph Cherniavsky.  Mary Philbin and Norman Kerry reenacted their roles for the sound re-shoot, and Edward Martindel, George B. Williams, Phillips Smalley, Ray Holderness, and Edward Davis added to the cast to replace actors that were unavailable.<ref>"'Phantom' Dialogue Scenes Are Finished By Universal."  Motion Picture News, August 24, 1929, P. 724.</ref>  Universal was contractually unable to loop Chaney's dialogue, but "third person" dialogue by the Phantom was looped over shots of his shadow. (The voice-overs are uncredited, but are probably Phillips Smalley.) Because Chaney's talkie debut was eagerly anticipated by film-goers, advertisements emphasized, "Lon Chaney's portrayal is a silent one!"

The sound version of ''Phantom'' opened on February 16, 1930, and grossed another million dollars.  This re-issue of the film is lost, although the soundtrack discs survive.

The success of ''The Phantom of the Opera'' inspired Universal to finance the production of a [[Universal Monsters|long string of horror films]] such as ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'', ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'', ''[[The Invisible Man (film)|The Invisible Man]]'', and ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' as well as the numerous sequels of all five franchises.<ref>''The Phantom of the Opera'' by Gaston Leroux, 1988 edition published by Dorset Press, [[New York]].</ref> Many of the films are now considered studio classics.

==Differences from the novel==
Although this particular adaptation is often considered perhaps the most faithful, it contains some significant plot differences to the original novel.

In the movie, M. Debienne and M. Poligny transfer ownership of the opera to M. Montcharmin and M. Richard, while in the novel they are simply the old and new managers.

The character of Ledoux is not a mysterious Persian and is no longer a onetime acquaintance of the Phantom; he is now a French detective of the Secret Police. This character change was not originally scripted. It was a change made entirely during the title-card editing process.

The Phantom no longer has a history of having studied in [[Persia]]. Rather, he is an escapee from [[Devil's Island]], who is an expert in "[[Witchcraft|the Black Arts]]."

The filmmakers initially intended to preserve the original ending of the novel, and filmed scenes where the Phantom dies of a broken heart at his organ after Christine leaves his lair. There was also short scene showing Christine and Raoul on a honeymoon. Because of the preview audience's poor reaction, the studio decided to change the ending to a more exciting one. As a result, utility director Edward Sedgwick was hired to provide the climactic chase scene, with an alternate ending where the Phantom, after having saved Ledoux and Raoul, kidnaps Christine in Raoul's carriage. In a bittersweet ending, he is hunted down and cornered by an angry mob, beaten to death and thrown into the [[Seine]].

==Preservation==
The finest quality print of the film existing was struck from an original camera negative for [[George Eastman House]] in the early 1950s by Universal Pictures.  The original 1925 version only survives in 16&nbsp;mm "Show-At-Home" prints created by Universal for home movie use in the 1930s. There are several versions of these prints, but none is complete.  All are from the original, domestic camera negative.

Because of the better quality of the Eastman House print, many home video releases have opted to use this as the basis of their transfers.  This version has singer Mary Fabian in the role of "Carlotta". In the re-edited version, Virginia Pearson, who played "Carlotta" in the 1925 film, is credited and referred to as "Carlotta's Mother" instead.  The majority of silent footage in the 1930 version is actually from a second camera, used to photograph the film for foreign markets and second negatives- careful examination of the two versions shows similar shots are slightly askew in composition. In 2009 Reelclassicdvd.com issued a special edition multi-disc DVD set which included a match-shot, side by side comparison between the two versions, editing the 1925 show-at-home print's narrative and continuity to match the Eastman House print.

For the 2003 Image Entertainment/[[Photoplay Productions]] two-disc DVD, the 1930 soundtrack has been re-edited in an attempt to fit the Eastman House print as best as possible.  However, there are some problems with this attempt: There is no corresponding "man with lantern" sequence on the sound discs.  While the purely silent "music and effect" reels seem to follow the discs fairly closely, the scenes with speech (which at one point constituted about 60% of the film) are generally shorter than their corresponding sequences on the discs. Also, since the sound discs were meant for a projection speed of 24 frames per second (the established speed for sound film), and the film on the DVD is presented at a slower frame rate (to reproduce natural speed), the soundtrack as edited has been altered to run slower.  A sound reissue trailer included for the first time on the DVD runs at sound speed with the audio running at the correct pitch.

On November 1, 2011, Image Entertainment released a new [[Blu-ray Disc]] version of ''Phantom'', produced by Film Preservation Associates, the film preservation company owned by [[David Shepard (film preservationist)|David Shepard]].<ref>[http://www.silentera.com/ SilentEra website main page, New Releases]</ref>

===Eastman House print mystery===
No one knows for sure what the negative used to strike the Eastman House print was produced for, due to footage from the 1930 re-issue placed in it and its lack of wear or damage.

To add to the confusion, an opening prologue of a man with a lantern has been added, using a single continuous take, but no title cards or dialogue survives. It would seem that this shot was a talking sequence, but it shows up in the original 1925 version, this time truncated and with a different, close-up shot of the man with the lantern. To further confuse the issue of the 1930 re-issue, the opening title sequence, the lantern man, and the footage of Mary Fabian performing as Carlotta and Mary Philbin's opera performances are photographed at 24 frames per second (sound speed), and therefore are all new footage. It is possible that the 'lantern man' is meant to be Joseph Buquet, but the brief, remaining close-up footage of the character from the 1925 version does not appear to be Bernard Siegel, who plays Buquet. The man who appears in the re-shot footage could also be a different actor, but since there is no close-up of the man in this version, and the atmospheric lighting partially obscures his face, it is difficult to be certain.

While it was common practice to simultaneously shoot footage for prints designed for both domestic and foreign markets with multiple cameras, the film is one of few to survive with footage of both versions available (others include [[Buster Keaton|Buster Keaton's]] ''[[Steamboat Bill Jr.]]'' and [[Charlie Chaplin|Charlie Chaplin's]] ''[[The Gold Rush]]'').{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Comparisons of both versions (in both black & white and color footage) yield:
# Footage of most of the same scenes shot from slightly different angles
# Different takes for similar scenes
# 24fps sound scenes replacing silent scene footage
# Variations in many re-written dialogue and exposition cards in the same font

Several possibilities regarding the negative's origins are:
# It is an "[[International Sound Version]]" for foreign markets.
# It is a silent version for theaters not yet equipped with sound in 1930.
# it is a negative made for Universal Studio's reference.

====International Sound Version====
[[Image:Titlecards.jpg|frame|right|Two comparative frames of narrative titles from the 1930 sound reissue. The title on the left is from the Technicolor sequence, which survives in 35mm. On the right, a lost title card from a 16mm print-down, not sourced from the Eastman House version.]]
International versions were sound versions of films which the producing company did not feel were worth the expense of re-shooting in a foreign language. They were meant to cash in on the talkie craze; by 1930 anything with sound did well at the box-office while silent films were largely ignored by the public. These "international sound versions" were basically part-talkies and were largely silent except for musical sequences. Since the film included a synchronized music and a sound effect track, it could be advertised as a sound picture and could therefore capitalize on the talkie craze in foreign markets (instead of the more expensive method of actually re-filming talking sequences in foreign languages).

To make an international version, the studio would simply insert (on the soundtrack) music over any dialogue in the film and splice in some title cards (which would be replaced with the appropriate language of the country). Singing sequences were left intact as well as any sound sequences that did not involve speaking.

The surviving sound discs of ''The Phantom of the Opera'' belong to the domestic release and therefore do not synchronize with the dialogue portions of the film which have been abbreviated on the existing print. There is no record to substantiate what the "international version" of ''The Phantom'' was, nor is there any reference that it was even available. Furthermore, one negative was made for all of Europe and sent overseas. The negative was generally left there and the version that is now seen shows no signs of negative wear that would be consistent with that of a negative printed for a number of countries.

====Silent version====
During the transition to sound in 1930, it was not uncommon to see a silent and a sound version of a picture playing simultaneously (particularly from Universal, who kept a silent/sound policy longer than most studios).  One speculation is that the Eastman House print is actually a silent version of the film made for theaters not yet equipped with sound.

However, according to trade journals of the time, only the sound version was available.  The possibility is that Universal made a silent version from unused trims (the original negative was heavily worn, as seen by the Show-At-Home prints struck during this period), but decided not to do anything with it. Furthermore, by 1930 fewer exhibitors were booking totally silent films and this had forced all the major studios to add soundtracks and dialogue sequences to all of their major releases which had previously been intended for release as a silent picture. Studios did not spend much time or money in making silent versions, which were meant to be played in rural areas whose theaters could not yet afford the conversion to sound. Nevertheless, if the extant print is a silent version, it would explain why Universal still had it and also the lack of wear on the negative.

===Color preservation===
[[Image:Phantomtechnicolor.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Bal Masqué scene was highlighted by its use of the Technicolor process.]]

According to ''Harrison's Reports'', a trade journal, when the film was originally released, it contained 17 minutes of color footage; that color footage was retained in the 1930 part-talking version.<ref>''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; February 15, 1930, page 27.</ref> [[Technicolor]]'s records show 497 feet of color footage.  Judging from trade journals and reviews, all of the opera scenes of ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', as well as the "Bal Masqué" scene were shot in Process 2 Technicolor (a two-color system). Only the Bal Masqué scene survives in color. The Phantom's cape during the scene on the rooftop of the opera was colored red using the [[Handschiegl color process]]. This effect has been replicated in Photoplay Production/Kevin Brownlow's 1996 restoration by [[Film colorization|computer colorization]].

As with many films of the time, black-and-white footage was [[Film tinting|tinted]] various colors to provide mood. These included amber for interiors, blue for night scenes, green  for mysterious moods, red for fire and sunshine (yellow) for daylight exteriors.

==Legacy==
The film has been deemed "culturally significant" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. In the [[United States]], the film is in the [[public domain]] due to Universal's failure to renew the copyright in 1953,<ref>{{cite journal |first=David |last=Pierce |date=June 2007 |title=Forgotten Faces: Why Some of Our Cinema Heritage Is Part of the Public Domain  |journal=Film History: An International Journal |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=125–43 |issn=0892-2160 |oclc=15122313 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25165419 |accessdate=2012-01-05 |doi=10.2979/FIL.2007.19.2.125 }}</ref> and may be freely downloaded from the [[Internet Archive]]. It was parodied in the 1970s film ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'' and by the [[Terry Pratchett]] novel ''[[Maskerade]]''.

This film was #52 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''100 Scariest Movie Moments'' The film was one of 400 films nominated to be on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition). The avant-garde jazz ensemble [[Club Foot Orchestra]] has written a new [[Film score|score for the film]] and performed it live in accompaniment to the film.

Universal would be involved in four more ''Phantom'' adaptations. They released [[Phantom of the Opera (1943 film)|a remake]] in 1943, distributed the [[Hammer Films]] [[The Phantom of the Opera (1962 film)|remake]] in 1962, distributed the [[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|2004 adaptation]] of the [[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|musical]] in Latin America and Australia as well as the [[The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall|2012 adaptation]] of the same musical.

'''Beatrice "Bebe" Neuwirth''' ({{IPAc-en|?|b|i?|?|t|r|?|s|_|?|b|i?|b|i?|_|?|nj|u?|w|??|?}}; born December 31, 1958) is an American actress, musician and dancer. She has worked in television and is known for her portrayal of [[Lilith Sternin|Dr. Lilith Sternin]], [[Frasier Crane|Dr. Frasier Crane]]'s wife (later ex-wife), on both the TV sitcom ''[[Cheers]]'' (in a starring role), and its spin-off ''[[Frasier]]'' (in a recurring guest role). On stage, she is also known for the role of Nickie in the revival of ''[[Sweet Charity]]'', the role of Velma Kelly in the revival of ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' (for both of which she won [[Tony award|Tony Awards]]) and for the role of  [[Morticia Addams]] in ''[[The Addams Family (musical)|The Addams Family]]'' musical.

As of 2014, she currently stars as Nadine Tolliver in ''[[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]]''.

==Early life==
Neuwirth was born in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], the daughter of Sydney Anne, a painter, and Lee Paul Neuwirth,<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=24491|title=Lee Paul Neuwirth}}</ref> a [[mathematician]]. She has an older brother Peter, an [[actuary]].<ref>Television "Cheers": A Comprehensive Guide, p. 98</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=July 4, 2008|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/67/Bebe-Neuwirth.html|title=Bebe Neuwirth Biography|work=filmreference}}</ref> Neuwirth is Jewish, and attended [[Chapin School (New Jersey)|Chapin School]] in New Jersey as well as [[Princeton Day School]] (New Jersey) of Princeton, but graduated from Princeton High School (a public school) in 1976.<ref name=JNW>{{cite news|author=Bloom, Nate|title=Celebrity Jews: Bebe and Lilith|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/22838/edition_id/457/format/html/displaystory.html|work=Jewish News Weekly|date=June 25, 2004|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}</ref> 

She began to study [[ballet]] at the age of five, and chose it as her field of concentration when she attended [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] in New York City in 1976 and 1977,<ref name="Alumni News Feb 2009">{{cite web | url = http://www.juilliard.edu/alumni/news/news_decades/2008-2009/0902/index.php | title = Alumni News: February 2009 | work = Juilliard.edu | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20111111121909/http://juilliard.edu/alumni/news/news_decades/2008-2009/0902/index.php | archivedate = 2011-11-11 | quote = Bebe Neuwirth (’77, dance)}}</ref> during which time she performed with the [[American Repertory Ballet|Princeton Ballet Company]] in ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', and ''[[Coppélia]]'', also appearing in community theater musicals. Neuwirth always dreamed of becoming a ballet dancer; the only other career she reportedly seriously contemplated was being a [[veterinarian]].<ref>Television "Cheers": A Comprehensive Guide</ref>

==Career==

===Theatre work===
Neuwirth made her Broadway debut in the role of Sheila in ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' in 1980. She later appeared in revivals of ''[[Little Me (musical)|Little Me]]'' (1982) ''[[Sweet Charity]]'' (1986), for which she won the [[Tony Award]] for Best Featured Actress in a Musical, and ''[[Damn Yankees]]'' (1994). 1996 saw her play Velma Kelly in the Broadway revival of ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. That role brought her her greatest stage recognition to date, and several awards including the Tony Award, [[Drama Desk Award]] and [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] for Best Leading Actress in a Musical. Neuwirth would later return to the still-running revival of ''Chicago'' in 2006, this time as Roxie Hart. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

She appeared in a musical revue ''Here Lies Jenny'', that featured songs by [[Kurt Weill]], sung and danced by Neuwirth and a four-person supporting cast, as part of an unspoken ambiguous story in an anonymous seedy bar possibly in Berlin in the 1930s. The show ran from May 7 through October 3, 2004, in the Zipper Theater in New York City.<ref>Jones, Kenneth.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/88107-Jenny-Made-Her-Mind-Up-Here-Lies-Jenny-Will-Extend-One-Last-Time-to-Oct-3 "Jenny Made Her Mind Up: Here Lies Jenny Will Extend One Last Time, to Oct. 3"] playbill.com, August 27, 2004</ref> ''Here Lies Jenny'' was also presented by Neuwirth in San Francisco in 2005. In 2009, Neuwirth toured a one-woman cabaret show with pianist Scott Cady. The cabaret included music by Kurt Weill, [[Stephen Sondheim]], [[Tom Waits]], [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] amongst others. In 2010, she returned to Broadway to create the role of [[Morticia Addams]] in the original production of ''[[The Addams Family (musical)|The Addams Family]]'' opposite [[Nathan Lane]].<ref>[http://www.nypost.com/seven/06252008/entertainment/theater/evening_up_addams_117140.htm "''The Addams Family'' Lands Bebe Neuwirth And Tempts Nathan Lane"], ''New York Post''</ref>

===Film and television===
[[File:Bebe Neuwirth.jpg|thumb|upright|At the Governor's Ball after the 43rd Annual Emmy Awards, August 25, 1991]]

Her screen credits include ''[[Green Card (film)|Green Card]]'', ''[[Bugsy]]'', ''[[Say Anything...]]'', ''[[Jumanji]]'', ''[[Summer of Sam]]'', ''[[Liberty Heights]]'', ''[[Tadpole (film)|Tadpole]]'' (for which the [[Seattle Film Critics]] named her Best Supporting Actress), ''[[The Associate]]'', ''[[How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days]]'', ''[[Malice (film)|Malice]]'', ''[[The Big Bounce (2004 film)|The Big Bounce]]'', ''[[The Faculty]]'' and [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]''.

On television, from 1986 to 1993 Neuwirth played Dr. [[Lilith Sternin]], who married Dr. [[Frasier Crane]] in the hit comedy series ''[[Cheers]].'' From the fourth to the seventh season, Neuwirth portrayed Lilith in a regular recurring role, and she appeared on the show as a main star from season eight to the final season, season eleven. Like [[Kelsey Grammer]] when he started on the show as Frasier Crane, she was not immediately given star billing in the opening credits, but at the end for seasons eight and nine; she appeared in the opening credits with her own portrait in seasons ten and eleven. She auditioned for this role with her arm in a sling, following a fall a week earlier. She won two [[Emmy Awards]] for the role, in 1990 and 1991. The character also made an appearance in the series ''[[Wings (1990 TV series)|Wings]]'' and in 12 episodes of the ''Cheers'' spin-off ''[[Frasier]]'', which earned her a 1995 Emmy Award nomination as Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.

Other small-screen credits include a guest appearance in the first season of ''[[NewsRadio]]'', a small role on ''[[The Adventures of Pete and Pete]]'' (episode: "The Call"), ''[[Deadline (American TV series)|Deadline]]'' (2000), ''[[Hack (TV series)|Hack]]'' (2003), ''[[Law & Order: Trial by Jury]]'' (2005), ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' (1999 as a modeling agent/suspect; 2005 as A.D.A  Tracey Kibre), and the miniseries ''[[Wild Palms]]'' and the fourth season ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode, First Contact, as Lanel. 

She appeared as herself in episodes of ''[[Will and Grace]]'', ''[[Strangers with Candy]]'' and ''[[Celebrity Jeopardy!]]''. In 2009, she co-starred as Ms. Kraft in the remake of ''[[Fame (2009 film)|Fame]]''. She recently had a recurring role as Caroline, the literary editor of Jonathan Ames, on the HBO series ''[[Bored to Death]]''.  She is currently a member of the cast in "Madam Secretary" on CBS.

==Personal life==
Neuwirth's 1984 marriage to Paul Dorman ended in divorce in 1991. Since 2009, she has been married to Chris Calkins.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20276707,00.html|title=Frasier's Bebe Neuwirth Ties the Knot|accessdate=October 1, 2009|author=Mary Green|date=May 5, 2009|publisher= People magazine}}</ref>

[[File:Croix de Lorraine 3.svg|thumb|200px|right|Patriarchal cross, in modern times known as the Cross of Lorraine]]

The '''Cross of Lorraine''' (French: ''Croix de Lorraine'') was originally a [[heraldry|heraldic]] [[cross]]. The [[two-barred cross]] consists of a vertical line crossed by two shorter horizontal bars. In most renditions, the horizontal bars are "graded" with the upper bar being the shorter, though variations with the bars of equal length are also seen. The ''Lorraine'' name has come to signify several cross variations, including the [[patriarchal cross]] with its bars near the top.

Among pious Filipino Roman Catholics, the symbol is known as the '''Crusader's cross''' or ''Cruzado'', associated with [[Knights]] and the [[Knights Templar|Order of Templar]] and more contemporary, the [[Crusaders of the Divine Church of Christ]], a [[Protestant]] sect with [[Catholic]] traditions in the Philippines.

==Design==
The Cross of Lorraine consists of one vertical and two horizontal bars. It is a heraldic cross, used by the [[List of rulers of Lorraine|Dukes of Lorraine]]. René d’Anjou (also Duke of Lorraine 1431–1453) "was a major transmitter of the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] tradition in Italy and had the cross of Lorraine as his personal [[Seal (emblem)|sigil]]".<ref>Christopher McIntosh: [http://books.google.de/books?id=wjwanPuMIWgC&pg=PA130#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Gardens of the Gods: Myth, Magic and Meaning in Horticulture'']. London: I.B. Tauris 2005, p. 130.</ref> This cross is related to the [[Cross#In heraldry|Crusader's cross]], and the six globes of the [[Medici family]].

==History==
The Lorraine cross was carried to the [[Crusades]] by the original [[Knights Templar]], granted to them for their use by the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]].<ref>Nwaocha Ogechukwu: [http://books.google.de/books?id=_VtdidLC5eEC&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Secret Behind the Cross and Crucifix'']. Eloquent Books 2009, p. 23.</ref><ref>Souheil Sami Bayoud: [http://books.google.de/books?id=WhQs-4P5WGcC&pg=PA76#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Coin of the Temple'']. Bloomington: AuthorHouse 2006, p. 76.</ref>

In the [[Catholic Church]], an equal-armed Lorraine Cross denotes the office of [[archbishop]].

==Symbol in France==
[[Image:Flag of Free France 1940-1944.svg|thumb|right|200px|The flag of Free France is a regular [[flag of France]] that ''[[Defacement (flag)|has been defaced]]'' with a Lorraine cross.]]
In France, the Cross of Lorraine was the symbol of [[Free France]] during [[World War II]], the liberation of France from [[Nazi Germany]], and [[Gaullism]] and includes several variations of a [[two barred cross]]. The bars are supposed to be equally spaced<ref>{{citation | publisher = BCY | place = CA | url=http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/symbolism/cross/cross_lorraine.html | title = Cross of Lorraine | section = Symbolism}}.</ref> as can be seen on most images relating to the [[Free French Forces]], though variations are common.

The Cross of Lorraine is part of the heraldic arms of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] in eastern [[France]].  Between 1871 and 1918 (and again between 1940 and 1944), the northern third of Lorraine was annexed to Germany, along with [[Alsace]]. During that period the Cross served as a rallying point for French ambitions to recover its lost provinces. This historical significance lent it considerable weight as a symbol of French patriotism. During the War, ''[[Ranks in the French Navy|Capitaine de corvette]]'' [[Thierry d'Argenlieu]] suggested the Cross of Lorraine as the symbol of the Free French Forces led by [[Charles de Gaulle]] as an answer to the [[Swastika#As the symbol of Nazism|Nazi swastika]].

The Cross was displayed on the flags of Free French warships, and the fuselages of Free French aircraft. The medal of the [[Ordre de la Libération|Order of Liberation]] bears the Cross of Lorraine.

De Gaulle himself is memorialised by a {{convert|43|m|ft|adj=on}} high Cross of Lorraine in his home village of [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises]]. The Cross of Lorraine was later adopted by Gaullist political groups such as the [[Rally for the Republic]].

==New World==
French [[Jesuit]] missionaries and settlers to the New World carried the Cross of Lorraine c. 1750–1810. The symbol was said to have helped the missionaries to convert the native peoples they encountered, because the two armed cross resembled existing local imagery.<ref>Charlotte Gray 'The Museum Called Canada: 25 Rooms of Wonder' Random House, 2004</ref>

==European heraldry==
The [[flag of Slovakia|flag]] and the [[coat of arms of Slovakia]] both include the double cross. It was introduced to the territory of today's Slovakia by Constantine and Methodius, who brought Christianity to Slavic empire of Great Moravia in the 9th century. In Slovakia, the double cross as a symbol of Lorraine is considered to have arisen when the Great Moravian king [[Svätopluk I]] "passed" it to [[Zwentibold]] of Lorraine, the godchild of Svätopluk and son of the emperor [[Arnulf of Carinthia]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The [[coat of arms of Hungary]] depicts a double cross, which is often attributed to [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] influence as King [[Béla III of Hungary]] was raised in the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the 12th century, and it was during his rule when the double cross became a symbol of Hungary.

A golden double cross with equal bars, known as the Cross of Jagiellons, was used  by [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] and [[King of Poland]] [[Jogaila]] since his conversion to Christianity in 1386, as a personal insignia and was introduced in the [[Coat of Arms of Lithuania]]. Initially, the lower bar of the cross was longer than the upper, since it originates from the Hungarian type of the double cross. It later became the symbol of [[Jagiellon dynasty]] and is one of the [[Symbols of Lithuania|national symbols]] of [[Lithuania]], featured in the [[Order of the Cross of Vytis]] and the badge of the [[Lithuanian Air Force]].

The double-barred cross is one of the national symbols in [[Belarus]], both as the Jagiellon Cross and as the [[Cross of Saint Euphrosyne|Cross of St. Euphrosyne of Polatsk]], an important religious artifact. The symbol is supposed to have [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] roots and is used by the [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church]] as a symbol uniting [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern-Byzantine]] and [[Latin Church|Western-Latin]] church traditions. The Belarusian Cross can be found on the traditional coat of arms of Belarus, the [[Pahonia]].

==Miscellaneous uses==

The cross is used as an emblem by the [[American Lung Association]] and related organizations through the world, and as such is familiar from their [[Christmas Seal]]s program. Its use was suggested in 1902 by Paris physician Gilbert Sersiron as a symbol for the "crusade" against [[tuberculosis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tbalert.org/about/cross.php|publisher=[[TB Alert]]|title=The Cross of Lorraine – a symbol of the anti-TB "crusade"|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ab.lung.ca/about_us/cross_lorraine.php |title=History of the Double-Barred Cross|publisher=Alberta Lung Association|accessdate=2006-11-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080113123528/http://www.ab.lung.ca/about_us/cross_lorraine.php |archivedate = 2008-01-13}}</ref>

For its defense of France in [[World War I]], the American [[79th Infantry Division (United States)|79th Infantry Division]] was nicknamed the "Cross of Lorraine" Division; its insignia is the cross. The German [[79th Infantry Division (Germany)|79th Infantry Division]] of [[World War II]] used the cross of Lorraine as its insignia because its first attack was in the Lorraine region.

In the television series ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', Thomas Magnum and his Vietnam War comrades were all shown to wear rings that bore the cross of Lorraine.

Ironically, the cross is also used as the symbol of the fascist [[Norsefire]] party in the [[V for Vendetta (film)|film version]] of the graphic novel ''[[V for Vendetta]]''.

The cross of Lorraine was previously used in the [[Sabre Travel Network|SABRE]], [[Apollo Reservation System|Apollo]], and [[Worldspan]] [[global distribution system]]s (GDS) as a [[delimiter]] in various input formats, however, the latest version of the [[Graphical User Interface]] for each system uses a different symbol: Apollo displays it as a [[Plus and minus signs|plus]] sign, Worldspan as a [[number sign]], and Sabre as a [[Japanese yen|yen]] symbol.

The "Cross of Lorraine" symbol appears in [[Unicode]] as {{unichar|2628|CROSS OF LORRAINE|html=}}. It is not to be confused with {{unichar|2021|double dagger|html=}}.

The Cross of Lorraine was noted as a symbol of the Free French in the film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''. A ring bearing the Cross was worn by [[Norway|Norwegian]] underground agent Berger and shown to one of the movies heroes (Victor Laszlo) as proof of loyalty.

It has also been used as a symbol for the city [[Roeselare]] (black cross) and [[Ypres]] (red cross) in Belgium.

282 (East Ham) Squadron, [[Air Training Corps]] have the "Cross of Lorraine" on their unit crest in honour of their previous Squadron President, [[Odette Hallowes]] who worked for an independent French section of the [[Special Operations Executive]] during World War II.

The Cross is also used as the symbol for the Celebritarian Corporation/art movement, created and led by musician/painter [[Marilyn Manson]].

The Anglo-Canadian [[hardcore punk]] band [[Gallows_(band)|Gallows]] use the cross as a symbol, as well as having named a song after it.

'''agrep''' (approximate [[grep]]) is a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] [[approximate string matching]] program, developed by [[Udi Manber]] and Sun Wu between 1988 and 1991, for use with the [[Unix]] operating system. It was later ported to [[OS/2]], [[DOS]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

It selects the best-suited algorithm for the current query from a variety of the known fastest (built-in) [[string searching algorithm]]s, including Manber and Wu's [[bitap algorithm]] based on [[Levenshtein distance]]s.

agrep is also the [[search engine]] in the indexer program [[GLIMPSE]]. agrep is free for private and non-commercial use only, and belongs to the University of Arizona.

== Alternative implementations ==
A more recent agrep is the command-line tool provided with the [[TRE (computing)|TRE]] regular expression library. TRE agrep is more powerful than Wu-Manber agrep since it allows weights and total costs to be assigned separately to individual groups in the pattern. It can also handle Unicode.<ref>{{cite web | title=TRE - TRE regexp matching package - Features | url=http://laurikari.net/tre/about }}</ref> Unlike Wu-Manber agrep, TRE agrep is licensed under a [[BSD_licenses#BSD-style_licenses|2-clause BSD-like license]].

FREJ (Fuzzy Regular Expressions for Java) open-source library provides command-line interface which could be used in the way similar to agrep. Unlike agrep or TRE it could be used for constructing complex substitutions for matched text.<ref>{{cite web | title=FREJ - Fuzzy Regular Expressions for Java - Guide and Examples | url=http://frej.sf.net/rules.html }}</ref> However its syntax and matching abilities differs significantly from ones of ordinary [[regular expression]]s.

==Early life==
Slater was born in [[Bethpage, New York]], the daughter of Alice Joan ([[married and maiden names|née]] Citrin), a [[lawyer]] and [[nuclear disarmament]] peace activist based in New York City, and Gerald Slater, a television executive;<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/87/Helen-Slater.html Helen Slater Biography (1963–)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the two divorced in 1974.<ref>[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800017593/bio Helen Slater Biography – Yahoo!

Shine Great Neck South High School|Great Neck South High School]] and then transferred to the [[High School of Performing Arts]] from which she was graduated in 1982.  She is not related to actor [[Christian Slater]].

==Film and television work==
Slater made her acting debut in the [[ABC Afterschool Special]] "Amy & the Angel", aired in 1982, alongside [[James Earl Jones]], [[Meg Ryan]], and [[Matthew Modine]]. This was also the only film she appeared in as a brunette. In 1984, she played the [[Supergirl|title character]], versus [[Faye Dunaway]] as Selena, in the film ''[[Supergirl (film)|Supergirl]]''. The film, directed by [[Jeannot Szwarc]], received mixed reviews, and was not a box-office success but has gained a cult following since its release.

In her next film, she was cast alongside [[Christian Slater]] (no relation) and [[Yeardley Smith]] as Billie Jean Davy, a folk hero that styles herself as a modern day [[Joan of Arc]], in the film ''[[The Legend of Billie Jean]]'' (1985). Next she appeared in two high-profile comedies, ''[[Ruthless People]]'' (1986) and ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of My Success]]'' (1987). More high-profile roles followed when she appeared in the cult classic independent comedy ''[[Sticky Fingers (1988 film)|Sticky Fingers]]'' (1988) with longtime friend [[Melanie Mayron]], the steamy ''[[A House in the Hills]]'' (1993) with [[Michael Madsen]], and the action-crime drama ''[[No Way Back (1995 film)|No Way Back]]'' opposite [[Russell Crowe]]  (1996).  Other noteworthy performances were seen in films including ''[[12:01]]'' (1993), ''[[Betrayal of the Dove]]'', and opposite [[Andy Richter]] in ''[[Seeing Other People]]'' (2004). 

Slater has appeared on episodes of various [[TV series|television series]], including ''[[The New Adventures of Old Christine]]'', ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', four episodes as the voice of [[Talia al Ghul]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', and others.  She was a series regular on the half-season run of the 1990 [[ABC network|ABC]] newsroom drama ''[[Capital News]]'' and the 2011-2013 two season run of the [[ABC Family]] series ''[[The Lying Game]]''.

During her career, Slater has maintained direct and indirect ties to her 1984 role of Supergirl.  She made a brief guest appearance on ''[[The Good Samaritan (Seinfeld episode)|Seinfeld]]'' as a love interest of [[Jerry Seinfeld]], who in reality is a huge fan of the [[Superman]] universe. Slater made a return to the Superman franchise, as she was seen in a recurring role as [[Clark Kent]]'s biological mother, [[Lara (comics)|Lara]], on the Superman-themed TV series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]].''

Slater was a spokeswoman for Preference by [[L'Oréal]] in both television and print ads.

===Musical career===
Slater has stated that she pursued musical efforts even before doing movies. In the 1989 [[Patrick Dempsey]] [[romcom]] ''[[Happy Together (1989 American film)|Happy Together]]'', she sang a medley of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] songs as well other songs. In the 1994 movie ''Lassie'', she also sang. For the soundtrack of the film ''Nowhere In Sight'' (2000), she contributed the song "The Detour".

In 2003, she released a CD, ''One of These Days'', consisting of her original songs. Notably, the tracks were real-time recordings with Slater singing and playing piano, plus six other musicians total; no multitracking, editing, or dubbing were employed. In [[2005 in music|2005]], she released a second CD, ''Crossword'', using the same recording approach as the first CD. Both albums were produced by [[Phillip Swann|Phil Swann]]. In 2008 Cortes Alexander recorded Slater's "Any Day Now" and "Love'll Come & Do Just That" on his album ''Swell''.<ref>Saporito, Joseph R., [http://qmetropolis.com/?p=187 Cortés Alexander, Thou ‘Swell’], qmetropolis.com, March 18, 2009</ref> Her third album, ''Shine'', was released in late 2010.

Specific [[Grand unified theory|Grand unified theories]] (GUTs) can predict the grand unification energy but, usually, with large uncertainties due to model dependent details such as the choice of the [[Yang-Mills Theory|gauge group]], the [[Higgs]] sector, the matter content or further free parameters. Furthermore, at the moment it seems fair to state that there is no agreed ''minimal GUT''.

The unification of the [[electroweak force]]s and the [[strong force]] with the [[gravitational force]] in a so-called [[theory of everything|"Theory of Everything"]] requires an even higher energy level which is generally assumed to be close to the [[Planck Scale]]. In theory, at such short distances, gravity becomes comparable in strength to the other three forces of nature known to date. This statement is modified if there exist additional dimensions of space at intermediate scales. In this case, the strength of gravitational interactions increases faster at smaller distances, and the energy scale at which all known forces of nature unify, can be considerably lower. This effect is exploited in models of [[large extra dimensions]].

The exact value of the grand unification energy (if grand unification is indeed realized in nature) depends on the precise physics present at shorter distance scales not yet explored by experiments. If one assumes the [[Desert (particle physics)|Desert]] and [[supersymmetry]], it is at around 10<sup>16</sup> GeV.

The most powerful [[particle accelerator|collider]] to date, the [[LHC]], is designed to reach a center of mass energy of 1.4x10<sup>4</sup> GeV in proton-proton collisions. The scale 10<sup>16</sup> GeV is only a few [[orders of magnitude]] below the [[Planck scale]], and thus not within reach of man-made earth bound colliders.

[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-720-0318-04, Frankreich, Parade der Milice Francaise.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black-and-white photo of men in uniform with guns|Members of the Milice, armed with captured British [[Bren light machine gun|Bren guns]] and [[Lee-Enfield#Rifle No 4|No. 4 Lee-Enfield rifles]]]]
The '''''Milice française''''' ([[France|French]] [[Militia]]), generally called the '''''Milice''''' ({{IPA-fr|milis}}), was a [[paramilitary]] force created on January 30, 1943 by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] (with [[Nazi Germany|German]] aid) to help fight against the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]]. The Milice's formal head was Prime Minister [[Pierre Laval]], although its Chief of operations and ''de facto'' leader was Secretary General [[Joseph Darnand]]. It participated in [[summary execution]]s and [[assassination]]s, helping to round up Jews and ''résistants'' in France for deportation. It was the successor to Joseph Darnand's ''[[Service d'ordre légionnaire]]'' (SOL) militia.

The Milice frequently used [[torture]] to extract information or confessions from those whom they interrogated. The French Resistance considered the Milice more dangerous than the [[Gestapo]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] because they were native Frenchmen who understood local dialects fluently, had extensive knowledge of the towns and countryside, and knew local people and informants.

Milice troops (known as ''miliciens'') wore a blue uniform jacket, brown shirt and a wide blue [[beret]]. (During active paramilitary-style operations, a pre-war French Army helmet was used.) Its newspaper was ''Combats'' (not to be confused with the underground Resistance newspaper, ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]''). It employed full-time and part-time personnel, and had a youth wing. The Milice's armed forces were officially known as the ''[[Franc-Garde]]''. Contemporary photographs show the Milice armed with a variety of weapons captured from Allied forces.

==Membership==
[[File:Milice poster.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Maroon poster, with white Greek letter gamma covering red hammer and sickle|Recruitment poster for the Milice: "[[Anti-Communism|Against Communism]] / French Militia / [[Secretary-General]] [[Joseph Darnand]]"]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-107-24, Frankreich, Einsatz gegen die Resistance.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Captured men, with hands behind their heads|Resistance members captured by the Milice, July 1944. One of the ''milicien'' is armed with a captured British [[Sten]] gun.]]
Early Milice volunteers included members of France's pre-war far-right parties (such as the [[Action Française]]) and [[working-class]] men convinced of the benefits of Vichy. In addition to ideology, incentives for joining the Milice included employment, regular pay and rations. (The latter became particularly important as the war continued, and civilian rations dwindled to near-starvation levels.) Some joined because members of their families had been killed or injured in Allied bombing raids or had been threatened, extorted or attacked by [[French Resistance]] groups. Still others joined for more mundane reasons: petty criminals were recruited by being told their sentences would be commuted if they joined the organization, and Milice volunteers were exempt from transportation to Germany as forced labour. It is estimated by several historians (including [[Julian Jackson]]) that the Milice's membership reached 25,000–30,000 by 1944, although official figures are difficult to obtain.

==Emblem==
The chosen emblem for the Milice carried the [[Greek language|Greek]] letter '''?''' ([[gamma]]), the symbol of the [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] [[astrological sign]] in the [[Zodiac]], ostensibly representing rejuvenation, and replenishment of energy. The color scheme chosen was silver  in blue background within a red circle for ordinary ''miliciens'', white in black background for the arm-carrying militants, and white in red background for the active combatants.

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-720-0318-36, Frankreich, Milizionär bewacht Widerstandskämpfer.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Man in uniform, wearing a beret and holding a revolver|Milice member guarding Resistance [[prisoner of war|PoWs]] wearing a German Army Wound Badge (indicating previous service with a German Army unit) and armed with a Spanish copy of the [[Smith & Wesson Model 10]] revolver, chambered in [[8mm French Ordnance]].]]
The Resistance targeted individual ''miliciens'' for assassination, often in open areas such as cafés and public streets. On April 24, 1943, they shot and killed Paul de Gassovski, a ''milicien'' in [[Marseilles]]. By late November, ''Combats'' reported that 25 ''miliciens'' had been killed and 27 wounded in Resistance attacks.

The most prominent person killed by the Resistance was [[Philippe Henriot]], the Vichy regime's Minister of Information and Propaganda, who was known as "the French [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]]." He was killed in his apartment in the Ministry of Information in the rue Solferino in the predawn hours of June 28, 1944 by ''résistants'' dressed as ''miliciens.'' His wife, who was in the same room, was spared. The Milice retaliated for this by killing several well-known [[anti-Nazi]] politicians and intellectuals (such as [[Victor Basch]]) and prewar conservative leader [[Georges Mandel]].

The Milice initially operated in the former ''[[Zone libre]]'' of France under the control of the Vichy regime.  In January 1944, the radicalized Milice moved into what had been the ''[[zone occupée]]'' of France (including Paris). They established their headquarters in the old Communist Party headquarters at 44 rue Le Peletier and at 61 rue Monceau. (The house was formerly owned by the [[Menier family]], makers of France's best-known chocolates.) The [[Lycée Louis-Le-Grand]] was occupied as a barracks, and an officer candidate school was established in the [[Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy|Auteuil]] synagogue.

[[Image:Brigade-speciale-IMG 0894.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Membership card with photo, stamp and tricolor diagonal lettering|Counterfeit Milices card prepared for French Resistance member Serge Ravanel, under the alias of Charles Guillemot]]
Perhaps the largest and best-known operation undertaken by the Milice was the [[Maquis des Glières|Battle of Glières]], its attempt in March 1944 to suppress the Resistance in the ''département'' of [[Haute-Savoie]] (in southeastern France, near the Swiss border).<ref>[http://worldatwar.net/article/glieres/index.html "Battle of Glieres"], World at War</ref> The Milice could not overcome the Resistance, and had to call in German troops to complete the operation. On Bastille Day, 14 July 1944, ''miliciens'' suppressed a revolt among the prisoners at Paris' [[La Santé Prison|Santé prison]].

The legal standing of the Milice was never clarified by the Vichy government; it operated parallel to (but separate from) the Vichy French police force. The Milice operated outside civilian law, and its actions were not subject to judicial review or control.

In August 1944, as the tide of war was shifting and fearing he would be held accountable for the operations of the Milice, Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] distanced himself from the organization by writing a harsh letter rebuking Darnand for the organization's excesses. Darnand's response suggested that Pétain ought to have voiced his objections sooner.

As noted, historians have debated the strength of the organization, but it was probably between 25,000–35,000 (including part-time members and non-combatants) by the time of the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944. The membership began melting away rapidly thereafter. Following the [[Liberation of France]], members who failed to flee to Germany (where they were impressed into the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)|Charlemagne Division]] of the [[Waffen-SS]]) or elsewhere generally faced imprisonment for treason, execution following courts-martial or murdered by vengeful ''résistants'' and civilians.

An unknown number of ''miliciens'' managed to escape prison or execution, either by going underground or fleeing abroad. A few were later prosecuted. The most notable of these was [[Paul Touvier]], the former commander of the Milice in [[Lyon]]. In 1994, he was convicted of ordering the retaliatory execution of seven Jews at [[Rillieux-la-Pape]]. He died in prison two years later.

==In popular culture==
*Since the war, the term ''milice'' has acquired a derogatory meaning in [[France]].
*The French hard rock ensemble [[Trust (band)|Trust]] had a hit named "Police Milice", where its frontman [[Bernard Bonvoisin]] compared modern-day [[police officer]]s to the Milice. 
*[[Louis Malle]]'s films ''[[Lacombe Lucien]]'' and ''[[Au revoir, les enfants]]'' include the Milice as part of the plot.
*The 2003 drama ''[[The Statement (film)|The Statement]]'', directed by [[Norman Jewison]] and starring [[Michael Caine]], was adapted from the 1996 novel by the same name by [[Brian Moore (novelist)|Brian Moore]]. He shaped it from the story of [[Paul Touvier]], a Vichy French Milice official who hid for years (often sheltered by the Catholic Church) and was indicted in 1991 for [[war crimes]].
* The film ''[[Female Agents]]'' ({{lang-fr|Les Femmes de l'ombre}}), set during World War II, has a scene where two of the female agents walk past a recruitment poster for the Milice which says "Against Communism / French Militia / Secretary-General Joseph Darnand".

'''Yan Xishan''' (or '''Yen Hsi-shan''', {{IPA-cmn|i???n ?í???n|IPA}}; 8 October 1883 &ndash; 22 July 1960) was a Chinese [[warlord]] who served in the [[politics of the Republic of China|government of the Republic of China]]. Yan effectively controlled the province of [[Shanxi]] from the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]] to the 1949 Communist victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. As the leader of a relatively small, poor, remote province, Yan Xishan survived the machinations of [[Yuan Shikai]], the [[Warlord Era]], the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Era]], the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]], and the [[Chinese Civil War|subsequent civil war]], being forced from office only when the Nationalist armies with which he was aligned had completely lost control of the Chinese mainland, isolating Shanxi from any source of economic or military supply. Yan has been viewed by Western biographers as a transitional figure who advocated using Western technology to protect Chinese traditions, while at the same time reforming older political, social, and economic conditions in a way that paved the way for the radical changes that would occur after his rule.<ref name="Portrait1">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 289</ref>

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Yan Xishan was born in the late [[Qing]] dynasty in northwestern Shanxi to a family which had been bankers and merchants for generations (Shanxi was known for its many successful banks until the late 19th century). As a young man he worked for several years at his father's bank while pursuing a traditional Confucian education at a local village school.  After his father was ruined by a late 19th-century depression that ravaged the Chinese economy, Yan enrolled in a free military school that was run and financed by the Manchu government in [[Taiyuan]]. While studying at this school, Yan was first introduced to mathematics, physics, and various other subjects imported directly from the West. In 1904 Yan accompanied his class to Japan, where he was entered into the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy|Imperial Military Academy]], from which he graduated in 1909.<ref name="Portrait2">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 290</ref>

===Experience in Japan===
Over the five years that Yan studied in Japan he became impressed by Japan's efforts to successfully modernize. He observed the progress made by the Japanese (who the Chinese had previously considered unsophisticated and backward), and began to worry about the consequences if China were to fall behind the rest of the world. This formative experience was later cited as a period of great inspiration for Yan's later efforts to modernize Shanxi.<ref name="Portrait2" />

Yan eventually concluded that the Japanese had successfully modernized largely due to the Japanese government's abilities to mobilize its populace in support of its policies, and due to the close, respectful relationship that existed between the Japanese military and civilian populations. Yan attributed the surprising Japanese victory in the 1905 [[Russo-Japanese War]] to the enthusiastic mobilization of the Japanese public in support of the Japanese military. After returning to China in 1909, Yan wrote a pamphlet warning China that his country was in danger of being overtaken by Japan unless they developed a local form of [[bushido]].<ref name="Portrait3">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 291</ref>

Even before studying in Japan, Yan had become disgusted with the open and widespread corruption of Qing officials in Shanxi, and had become convinced that China's relative helplessness in the 19th century was the result of the dynasty's general unprogressiveness and a grossly inept foreign policy. While he was in Japan, Yan Joined [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s [[Tongmenghui|Revolutionary Alliance]] (Tongmenghui) and attempted to popularize Sun's ideology by organizing an affiliated "Blood and Iron Society" within the Imperial Military Academy. The apparent goal of this student group was to organize a revolution that would lead to the creation of a strong and united China, similar to how [[Otto von Bismarck]] had created a strong and united Germany.<ref name="Portrait3" /> He also joined a more militant organization of Chinese revolutionaries, the "Dare-to-Die Corps".<ref name="W399">Wang 399</ref>

===Return to China===
When he returned to China in 1909, Yan was assigned to be a division commander in Shanxi,<ref name="Portrait4" /> but secretly worked to overthrow the Qing.<ref name="W399" /> During the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]], Yan led local revolutionary forces to drive the Manchu forces from the province, proclaiming it independent of the Qing government. Yan justified his actions by attacking the Qing's failure to repel foreign aggression, and promised a wide range of social and political reforms.<ref name="Portrait4">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 292</ref>

==Career in the early Republic==
[[File:Yan Xishan3.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Yan Xishan in the early 1920s, shortly after taking power in Shanxi.]]

===Conflict with Yuan Shikai===
In 1911 Yan hoped to join forces with another prominent Shanxi revolutionary, Wu Luzhen, in order to undermine [[Yuan Shikai]]'s control of north China, but these plans were aborted after Wu was assassinated.<ref name="W399" /> Yan was elected military governor by his comrades, but was unable to prevent a subsequent invasion by the troops of [[Yuan Shikai]] from occupying most parts of Shanxi in 1913.  During the period of Yuan's invasion, Yan was only able to survive by withdrawing northward and aligning himself with a friendly insurgent group in neighboring [[Shaanxi]] province. By avoiding a decisive military confrontation with Yuan, Yan was able to preserve his own base of power. Though he was friends with [[Sun Yat-sen]], Yan withheld support for him in 1913, ingratiating himself to Yuan, who allowed Yan to return as military governor of Shanxi, commanding a military that was then staffed by Yuan's own henchmen.<ref name="Portrait4" /> In 1917, shortly after [[Yuan Shikai]]'s death, Yan solidified his control over [[Shanxi]], ruling there uncontested.<ref name="Spence1">Spence 406</ref>  After Yuan's death in 1916, China descended into a period of warlordism.

The determination of Shanxi to resist Manchu rule was a factor leading Yuan to believe that only the abolition of the Qing dynasty could bring peace to China and end the civil war. Yan's inability to resist Yuan's military domination of northern China was a factor contributing to [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s decision not to personally pursue the presidency of the [[Republic of China|Republic]], which was established after the end of the [[Qing dynasty]]. The demonstrated futility of opposing Yuan's military domination can only have made it seem more important to Sun to bring Yuan into the process of ruling of the Republic, and to come to terms with his (potential) enemy.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 18</ref>

===Efforts to modernize Shanxi===
By 1911, Shanxi was one of the poorest provinces in China.  Yan believed that, unless he was able to modernize and revive Shanxi's economy and infrastructure, he would be unable to prevent Shanxi from being overrun by rival warlords.<ref>Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 302</ref>  A military defeat in 1919 to a rival warlord convinced Yan that Shanxi was not sufficiently developed to compete for hegemony with other warlords, and he avoided the violent national politics of the time by enforcing a neutrality policy on Shanxi, freeing his province from the [[warlord era|civil wars]]. Instead of participating in the ongoing civil wars, Yan devoted himself almost exclusively to modernizing Shanxi and developing its resources. The success of his reforms were sufficient for him to be dubbed by outsiders as the "Model Governor", with Shanxi the "Model Province".<ref name="Portrait4" />

Yan's determination to modernize Shanxi was mostly inspired from his experiences in Japan, but also by his experiences with foreign doctors and personnel who arrived in Shanxi in 1918 in order to help Yan suppress an epidemic which was ravaging the province. Yan was impressed with the zeal, talents, and modern outlook of these personnel, and subsequently compared foreigners favorably to his own conservative and generally apathetic officials. Conversations with other famous reformers, including [[John Dewey]], [[Hu Shih]], and Yan's close friend [[H. H. Kung]], reinforced Yan's determination to Westernize Shanxi.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 22</ref>

===Involvement in the Northern Expedition===
{{Main|Northern Expedition}}
In order to maintain Shanxi's neutrality and free it from serious military confrontations with rival warlords, Yan developed a strategy of shifting alliances between various warring cliques, inevitably joining only winning sides. Although he was weaker than many of the warlords that surrounded him, he often held the balance of power between neighboring rivals, and even those that he betrayed hesitated to retaliate against him, in case they might need his support in the future.  In order to resist the domination of the Manchurian warlord [[Zhang Zuolin]], Yan allied himself with the forces of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in 1927, during the Nationalist's [[Northern Expedition]]. While aiding Chiang, Yan's occupation of Beijing in June, 1928, brought the Northern Expedition to a successful conclusion.<ref name="Portrait5">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 293</ref>  Yan's assistance to Chiang was rewarded shortly afterwards by his being named Minister of the Interior<ref>''TIME Magazine'' Dec. 24, 1928.  p.293</ref> and deputy commander-in-chief of all Kuomintang armies<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 111</ref> Yan's support for Chiang's military campaigns and his [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|suppression of Communists]] influenced Chiang to recognize Yan as the governor of Shanxi, and to allow Yan to expand his influence into [[Hebei]].<ref name="W399" />

===Involvement in the Central Plains War===
{{Main|Central Plains War}}
[[File:Yen Hsi-shan TIME Cover.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Yan Xishan: "China's Next President".]]
Yan's alliance with Chiang was interrupted the next year, in 1929, when Yan joined Chiang's enemies to establish an alternative national government in northern China. Yan's allies included the northern warlord [[Feng Yuxiang]], the [[New Guangxi clique|Guangxi Clique]] led by [[Li Zongren]], and the left-leaning Kuomintang faction led by [[Wang Jingwei]]. While Feng and Chiang's armies were annihilating each other, Yan marched virtually unopposed through Shandong, capturing the provincial capital in June, 1930. After these victories, Yan attempted to forge a new national government, with himself as President, by calling an "Enlarged Party Conference". Yan was to be president, and Wang Jingwei was to serve as Yan's prime minister. This conference attempted to draft a national constitution and involved the participation of numerous high-ranking Chinese militarists and politicians from among Chiang's rivals. These deliberations were deliberately interrupted by [[Chiang Kai-shek]] who, after decisively defeating Feng's armies, invaded Shandong and virtually annihilated Yan's army.  When the governor of Manchuria, [[Zhang Xueliang]], publicly declared his allegiance to Chiang (whose support Zhang required in order to contest the Russians and Japanese), Yan fled to [[Dalian]] in [[Manchuria]], only returning to an unconquered Shanxi after making peace with Chiang in 1931.<ref name="W399" /><ref name="Portrait5" /><ref>''TIME Magazine'' Sep. 29, 1930</ref>  During this "[[Central Plains War]]", the [[Kuomintang]] encouraged Muslims and Mongols to overthrow both [[Feng Yuxiang]] and Yan.<ref>Lin 22</ref>  Chiang's defeat of Yan and Feng in 1930 is considered the end of China's [[Warlord Era]].

The events between 1927 and 1931 are best explained as the strategies of warlords accustomed to the constantly shifting, chaotic alliances which had characterized Chinese politics since the breakdown of the central government a decade earlier. The main cause of Yan's defeat was the low population and lack of development in the areas that Yan had under his control, making him incapable of fielding a large and well-equipped army similar to the armies commanded by Chiang at the time.<ref name="Portrait5" /> Yan was also unable to match the quality of leadership in Chiang's officer corps and the prestige that Chiang and the Nationalist army possessed at the time.<ref name="Portrait6">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 294</ref> Before Chiang's armies defeated Feng and Yan, Yan Xishan appeared on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]], including the subtitle "China's Next President."<ref>''TIME Magazine''. May 19, 1930</ref>  The attention given to him by foreign observers in this period, and the support and assistance that he had secured from other high-profile Chinese statesmen, implies that there was a credible expectation that Yan would lead a central government if Chiang failed to defeat Yan's alliance.

===Return to Shanxi===
Yan was only able to return to Shanxi through a complex effort of intrigue and politicking. Much of Chiang's failure to immediately and permanently eject Yan or his subordinates from Shanxi was due largely to the influence of Zhang Xueliang and the Japanese, who were anxious to prevent the extension of Chiang's authority into Manchuria. In Yan's absence, the civil government of Shanxi ground to a halt, and the various military leaders of Shanxi struggled with each other to fill the vacuum, forcing Chiang's government to appoint Shanxi's leaders from among Yan's subordinates. Although he did not immediately declare his return to provincial politics, Yan returned to Shanxi in 1931 with the support and protection of Zhang. This move was not protested by Chiang due to Chiang's involvement in suppressing the forces of [[Li Zongren]], who had marched up to northern [[Hunan]] from his base in [[Guangxi]] in support of Yan.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 118-122</ref>

Yan remained in the background of Shanxi politics until the Nanjing government's failure to resist the Japanese takeover of Manchuria after the [[Mukden Incident]] gave Yan and his followers an opportunity to informally overthrow the Kuomintang in Shanxi. In December 18, 1931, a group of students (supported and perhaps orchestrated by officials loyal to Yan) gathered in Taiyuan to protest the Nanjing government's policy of not fighting the Japanese.  This demonstration became so violent that Kuomintang police fired into the crowd.  The outrage that this "Massacre of December Eighteenth"  generated was strong enough that it gave Yan's officials a pretext to expel the Kuomintang from the province, on the grounds of public safety. After this event the Kuomintang ceased to exist in Shanxi except as a dummy organization whose members were more loyal to Yan Xishan than to Chiang Kai-shek.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 122-123</ref>

Future difficulties in securing the loyalty of other Chinese warlords across China, the ongoing civil war with the Communists, and the ongoing threat of Japanese invasion motivated Chiang to let Yan retain the title of Pacification Commissioner in 1932, and he appointed Yan to the central government's [[Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission]].  In 1934 Chiang finally flew to Taiyuan, where he praised Yan's administration in return for Yan's public support for Nanjing. By publicly praising Yan's government, Chiang in effect admitted that Yan remained the undisputed ruler of Shanxi.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 123-124</ref>

===Subsequent relationship with the Nationalist government===
After 1931, Yan continued to give nominal support to the Nanjing government while maintaining de facto control over Shanxi, alternatively cooperating and conflicting with Communist agents active in his province.  Although he was not an active participant, Yan supported the 1936 [[Xian Incident]], in which [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was violently arrested by Nationalist officers led by [[Zhang Xueliang]], and released only when Chiang agreed to make peace with the Communists and form a [[Second United Front|"united front"]] to resist the impending Japanese invasion of China. In his correspondence with [[Zhang Xueliang]] in 1936, Yan indicated that the growing rift between Yan and Chiang was due to Yan's anxieties over the potential for a Japanese invasion and a concern for the subsequent fate of China, and because Yan was not convinced of the correctness of focusing China's resources on anti-Communist campaigns.<ref name="Spence1" /> During the Xian Incident itself, Yan actively involved himself in the negotiations, sending representatives to prevent Chiang's execution (and the civil war that Yan believed would follow), while pushing for a united front to resist the Japanese invasion of China that Yan believed was imminent.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 339-241</ref>

The financial relationship between Shanxi and the central government remained complicated.  Yan was successful in creating a complex of heavy industries around Taiyuan, but neglected to publicize the extent of his success outside of Shanxi, probably to deceive Chiang Kai-shek.  Despite his measured successes in modernizing the industry of Shanxi, Yan repeatedly petitioned the central government for financial assistance in order to extend the local railroad, and for other reasons, but was generally refused. When Yan refused to send taxes collected from the trade of salt (produced in Shanxi's public factories) to the central government, Chiang retaliated by flooding the market of northern China with so much salt (produced around coastal China) that the price of salt in China's northern provinces dropped extremely low: due to these artificially low salt prices, neighboring provinces virtually stopped purchasing Shanxi salt altogether. In 1935, Chiang's announcement of a "five year plan" to modernize Chinese industry was perhaps inspired by the successes of the "Ten Year Plan" that Yan had announced several years before.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 193</ref>

==Public policies==
In Shanxi, Yan implemented numerous successful reforms in an effort to centralize his control over the province.  Although embracing the traditional values of the landed gentry, he denounced their "oppression" of the peasantry, and took steps to initiate land reform and to weaken the power of landowners over the populace in the countryside. These reforms weakened potential rivals in his province in addition to benefiting Shanxi farmers.<ref name="Portrait1" />

Yan attempted to develop his army as a locally recruited force which cultivated a public image of being servants, rather than masters, of the people.  He developed an all-encompassing, idiosyncratic ideology (literally "Yan Xishan Thought") and disseminated it by sponsoring a network of village newspapers and travelling dramatic troupes. He coordinated dramatic public meetings in which participants confessed their own misdeeds and/or denounced those of others.  He devised a system of public education, producing a population of trained workers and farmers literate enough to be indoctrinated without difficulty.  The early date by which Yan devised and implemented these reforms (during the Warlord Era) contradicts later claims that these reforms were modeled on Communist programs, and not vice versa.<ref name="Portrait2" />

===Military policies===
When Yan returned from Japan in 1909 he was a firm proponent of militarism, and proposed a system of national conscription along German and Japanese lines.  Germany's defeat in [[World War I]] and Yan's defeat in [[Henan]] in 1919 caused Yan to reassess the value of militarism as a way of life. Yan then decreased the size of the army until 1923 (in order to save money), until a rumor circulated that rival warlords were planning on invading Shanxi.  Yan then introduced military reforms designed to train a rural militia of 100,000 men along the lines of Japanese and American reserves.<ref name="Gillin Warlord 24">Gillin ''Warlord'' 24</ref>

Yan attempted, via conscription, to create a civilian reserve that would become the foundation of society in Shanxi.  Because his troops were perhaps the only army in the Warlord era drawn exclusively from the province in which they were stationed, because Yan insisted that his soldiers perform work to improve Shanxi's infrastructure, including road-maintenance and assisting farmers, and because Yan's discipline ensured that his soldiers actually paid for anything that they took from civilians, the army in Shanxi enjoyed much more popular support than most of his rival's armies in China.<ref name="Portrait6" />

Yan's officer corps was drawn from Shanxi's gentry, and given two years of education at government expense.  Despite efforts to subject his officers to a rigorous, Japanese-style training regimen, and to indocrinate them in Yan Xishan Thought, his armies never proved to be especially well-trained or disciplined in battle.  In general, Yan's record of military defeats is not considered positive, and it is unclear whether Yan's officer corps either understood or sympathized with Yan's objectives, instead entering his service solely in the interests of achieving prestige and a higher standard of living. Yan built an arsenal in Taiyuan that, for the entire period of his administration, remained the only center in China capable of producing field artillery.  The presence of this arsenal was one of the main reasons that Yan was able to maintain Shanxi's relative independence.<ref name="Portrait6" /> While not effective fighting rival warlords, Yan's army was successful in eradicating banditry in Shanxi, allowing Yan to maintain a relatively high level of public order and security.<ref name="Portrait7">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 295</ref>  Yan's successes in eradicating banditry in Shanxi include his cooperation with Yuan Shikai to defeat Bai Lang's remnant rebels after the failed 1913-1914 [[Bai Lang Rebellion]].

===Attempts at social reform===
Yan went to great lengths to eradicate social traditions which he considered antiquated. He insisted that all men in Shanxi abandon their Qing-era queves, giving police instructions to clip off the queves of anyone still wearing them.  In one instance, Yan lured people into theatres in order to have his police systematically cut the hair of the audience.<ref name="Portrait7" />  Yan attempted to combat widespread female illiteracy by creating in each district at least one vocational school in which peasant girls could be given a primary-school education and taught domestic skills.  After Kuomintang military victories in 1925 generated great interest in Shanxi for the Nationalist ideology, including women's rights, Yan allowed girls to enroll in middle school and college, where they promptly formed a women's association.<ref name="Gillin Warlord 24"/>

Yan attempted to eradicate the custom of footbinding, threatening to sentence men who married women with bound feet, and mothers who bound their daughters' feet, to hard labour in state-run factories. He discouraged the use of the traditional lunar calendar and encouraged the development of local boy scout organizations. Like the Communists who later succeeded Yan, he punished habitual lawbreakers to "redemption through labour" in state-run factories.<ref name="Portrait7" />

===Attempts to eradicate opium use===
In 1916 at least 10% of Shanxi's eleven million people were addicted to opium, and Yan attempted to eradicate opium use in Shanxi after he came to power.  At first, Yan dealt with opium dealers and addicts severely, throwing opium addicts in prison and exposing them and their families to public humiliation.  Many convicted of opium-related offences then died of sudden withdrawal from the drug.  After 1922, partly due to public opposition to harsh punishment, Yan abandoned punishing addicts in favor of attempting to rehabilitate them, pressuring individuals through their families and constructing sanitariums designed to slowly cure addicts of their addictions.<ref name="Warlord1">Gillin ''Warlord'' 38-40</ref>

Yan's attempts to suppress the opium trade in Shanxi were largely successful, and the number of opium addicts in the province was reduced by 80% by 1922.  In the absence of efforts by other warlords to combat opium production and trade, Yan's efforts to combat opium use only increased the price of opium so high that narcotics of all kinds were drawn into Shanxi from other provinces.  Users often switched from opium to pills mixed from morphine and heroin, which were easier to smuggle and use.  Because the most influential and powerful gentry in Shanxi were often the worst offenders, officials drawn from the privileged class of Shanxi seldom enforced Yan's decrees outlawing the use of narcotics, and often evaded punishment themselves.  Eventually Yan was forced to abandon his efforts to suppress opium trafficking, and attempted instead to establish a government monopoly on the production and sale of opium in Shanxi.<ref name="Warlord1" />  Yan continued to complain about the availability of narcotics into the 1930s, and after 1932 executed over 600 people caught smuggling drugs into Shanxi.  The traffic persisted, but Yan's interests in opposing it were perhaps limited by a fear of provoking the Japanese, who manufactured most of the morphine and heroin available in China inside their concession area in [[Tianjin]], and who came to control much of the drug trade in northern China in the 1930s.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 138</ref>

===Limitations of economic reforms===
Yan's efforts to stimulate Shanxi's economy mostly consisted of state-led investment in a broad variety of industries, and he generally failed to encourage private investment and trade. Though gains were made to improve the economy of Shanxi, Yan's efforts were limited by the fact that he himself had little formal training in economic or industrial theory.  Yan also suffered from a lack of experienced, trained advisers capable of directing even moderately complicated tasks related to economic development. Because most of the educated staff that he did have access to were solidly entrenched within the landed gentry of Shanxi, it is possible that many of his officials may have deliberately sabotaged Yan's efforts for reform, preferring that the peasants working their fields continue their cheap, traditional labour.<ref>Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 305</ref>

==Yan Xishan Thought==
Throughout his life Yan Xishan attempted to identify, formulate, and disseminate a comprehensive ideology that would improve the morale and loyalty of his officials and the people of Shanxi.  During his time of study in Japan, Yan became attracted to [[militarism]] and [[Social Darwinism]], but he renounced these after World War I.  Throughout the rest of Yan's life, he identified with the position of most Chinese conservatives at the time: that social and economic reform would progress from ethical reform, and that the problems confronting China could only be solved by the moral rehabilitation of the Chinese people.<ref name =Warlord59>Gillin ''Warlord'' 59</ref>  Believing that no single ideology existed to unify the Chinese people at the time that he came to power, Yan attempted to generate an ideal ideology himself, and once boasted that he had succeeded in creating a comprehensive system of belief that embodied the best features of "militarism, nationalism, anarchism, democracy, capitalism, communism, individualism, imperialism, universalism, paternalism, and utopianism".<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 63</ref>  Much of Yan's attempts to spread his ideology were through a network of semi-religious organizations known as "Heart-Washing Societies".

===Influence of Confucianism===
Yan was emotionally attached to [[Confucianism]] by virtue of his upbringing, and because he identified its values as a historically effective solution to the chaos and disorder of his time. Yan justified his rule via Confucian political theories, and attempted to revive Confucian virtues as being universally accepted.  In his speeches and writing Yan developed an extravagant admiration for the virtues of moderation and harmony associated with the Confucian [[Doctrine of the Mean]].  Many of the reforms that Yan attempted were undertaken with the intention of demonstrating that he was a ''junzi'', the epitome of Confucian virtue.<ref name="Warlord59" />

Yan's interpretations of Confucianism were mostly borrowed from the form of [[Neo-Confucianism]] that was popular in the Qing dynasty.  He taught that everyone had a capacity for innate goodness, but that in order to fulfill this capacity people had to subordinate their emotions and desires to the control of their conscience.  He admired the [[Ming dynasty]] philosophers [[Lu Jiuyuan]] and [[Wang Yangming]], who disparaged knowledge and who urged men to act on the basis of their intuition.  Because Yan believed that human beings could only achieve their potentials through intense self-criticism and self-cultivation, Yan established in every town a Heart-Washing Society, whose members gathered each Sunday to meditate and listen to sermons based on the themes of the Confucian classics.  Everyone at these meetings was supposed to rise and confess aloud his misdeeds of the past week, inviting criticism from the other members.<ref name ="Warlord60">Gillin ''Warlord'' 60</ref>

===Influence of Christianity===
Yan attributed much of the West's vitality to Christianity, and believed that China could only resist and overtake the West by generating an ideological tradition that was equally inspiring.  Yan appreciated the efforts of missionaries (mostly Americans who maintained a complex of schools in [[Taigu County|Taigu]]) to educate and modernize Shanxi.  Yan regularly addressed the graduating classes of these schools, but was generally unsuccessful in recruiting these students to serve his regime.  Yan supported the indigenous Christian church in Taiyuan, and at one time seriously considered using Christian chaplains in his army. Yan's public support of Christianity waned after 1925, when he failed to come to the defense of Christians during anti-foreigner and anti-Christian demonstrations that polarized Taiyuan.<ref name ="Warlord61">Gillin ''Warlord'' 61-62</ref>

Yan deliberately organized many features of his Heart-Washing Society on the Christian church, including ending each service with hymns praising Confucius. Yan urged his subjects to place their faith in a supreme being that he called "''Shangdi''": he justified his belief in ''Shangdi'' via the Confucian classics, but described ''Shangdi'' in terms very similar to the Christian interpretation of God. Like Christianity, Yan Xishan Thought was permeated with the belief that, through accepting his ideology, people could become regenerated or reborn.<ref name ="Warlord61" />

===Influence of Chinese Nationalism===
In 1911 Yan came to power in Shanxi as a disciple of Chinese Nationalism, but subsequently came to view Nationalism as merely another set of ideas which could be used to achieve his own objectives. Yan stated that the primary goal of the Heart-Washing Society was to encourage Chinese patriotism by reviving the Confucian church, leading foreigners to accuse him of attempting to create a Chinese version of [[Shinto]].<ref name ="Warlord63">Gillin ''Warlord'' 63-64</ref>

Yan attempted to moderate some aspects of [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s ideology that he viewed as potentially threatening to his rule.  Yan altered some of Sun's doctrines before disseminating them in Shanxi, formulating his own version of Sun's [[Three Principles of the People]] that replaced the principles of nationalism and democracy with the principles of virtue and knowledge. During the 1919 [[May Fourth Movement]], when students in Taiyuan staged anti-foreign demonstrations, Yan warned that patriotism, like rainfall, was beneficial only when moderate.<ref name ="Warlord63" />

After the [[Kuomintang]] succeeded in forming a nominal central government in 1930, Yan encouraged Nationalist principles that he viewed as socially beneficial.  During the 1930s Yan attempted to set up in every village a "Good People's Movement" in order to promote the values of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[New Life Movement]].  These values included honesty, friendliness, dignity, diligence, modesty, thrift, personal neatness, and obedience.<ref name ="Warlord60" />

===Influence of socialism and communism===
In 1931 Yan returned from his exile in Dalian impressed with the apparent successes of [[First Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|the Soviet Union's first Five-year plan]], and attempted to reorganize the economy of Shanxi using Soviet methods, according to a local "Ten Year Plan" that Yan himself developed.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 129</ref> Throughout the 1930s Yan bluntly equated economic development with state control of industry and finance, and he was successful in bringing most major industry and commerce under state control by the late 1930s.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 134</ref>

Yan's speeches after 1931 reflect an interpretation of Marxist economics (mostly drawn from ''[[Das Kapital]]'') that Yan gained while in exile in Dalian.  Following this interpretation, Yan attempted to change the economy of Shanxi to become more like that of the USSR, inspiring a scheme of economic "distribution according to labour".  When the threat of Chinese Communists became a significant threat to Yan's rule, Yan defended the Communists as courageous and self-sacrificing fanatics who were different from common bandits (contrary to Kuomintang propaganda) and whose challenge must be met by social and economic reforms that alleviated the conditions responsible for communism.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 163-164</ref>

Like [[Karl Marx|Marx]], Yan wanted to eliminate what he saw as unearned profit by restructuring Shanxi's economy to reward only those who worked. Unlike Marx, Yan reinterpreted Communism to correct what he believed was [[Marxism]]'s chief flaw: the inevitability of class warfare. Yan praised Marx for his analysis of the material aspects of human society, but professed to believe that there was a moral and spiritual unity of mankind that implied that a state of harmony was closer to the human ideal than conflict. By rejecting [[economic determinism]] in favor of morality and free will, Yan hoped to create a society that would be more productive and less violent than he perceived communism to be, while avoiding the exploitation and human misery that he believed was the inevitable result of capitalism.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 164</ref>

Yan interpreted [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt's]] [[New Deal]] as promoting socialism in order to combat the spread of communism. "The New Deal is an effective way of stopping communism," Yan said, "by having the government step in and ride roughshod over the interests of the rich." Yan then undertook a series of public works projects inspired by the New Deal in order to reduce unemployment in his own province.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 166-167.</ref>

===Extent of success===
In spite of his efforts, Yan did not succeed in making Yan Xishan Thought widely popular in Shanxi, and most of his subjects refused to believe that his true objectives differed substantially from those of past regimes. Yan himself blamed the failure of his ideology to become popular on the faults of his officials, charging that they abused their power and failed to explain his ideas to the common people. In general, the officials of Shanxi misappropriated funds intended to be used for propaganda, attempted to explain Yan's ideas in language too sophisticated for the common people, and often behaved in a dictatorial manner that discredited Yan's ideology and failed to generate popular enthusiasm for Yan's regime.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 65-66</ref>

==Threats to Yan's rule==

===Early conflict with Japan===
Yan did not come into serious conflict with the Japanese until the early 1930s. While he was in exile in Dalian in 1930, Yan became aware of [[Mukden Incident|Japanese plans to invade Manchuria]], and feigned collaboration with the Japanese in order to pressure Chiang Kai-shek into allowing Yan to return to Shanxi before warning Chiang of Japan's intent. Japan's subsequent success in taking Manchuria in 1931 terrified Yan, who stated that a major objective of his Ten Year Plan was to strengthen Shanxi's defense against the Japanese. In the early 1930s Yan supported anti-Japanese riots, denounced the Japanese occupation of Manchuria as "barbarous" and "evil", publicly appealed to Chiang to send troops to Manchuria, and arranged for his arsenal to arm partisans fighting the Japanese occupation in Manchuria.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 211</ref>

In December 1931 Yan was warned that, after taking control of Manchuria, the Japanese would attempt to take control of [[Inner Mongolia]] by subverting Chinese authority in [[Chahar Province|Chahar]] and [[Suiyuan]]. In order to prevent this Yan took control of Suiyuan first, developing Suiyuan's large iron deposits (24% of all iron in China), and settling the province with thousands of soldier-farmers. When Manchurian soldiers (armed and led by the Japanese) finally invaded Chahar in 1935, Yan virtually declared war on the Japanese by accepting a position as "advisor" of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council, an organization created by the central government to organize Mongolian opposition to the Japanese.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 212-214</ref>

The Japanese began promoting "autonomy" for northern China in the summer of 1935.  Apparently, many high-ranking Japanese in China believed that Yan and many others in the north were fundamentally pro-Japanese, and would readily subordinate themselves to the Japanese in exchange for protection from Chiang Kai-shek. Yan published an open letter in September in which he accused the Japanese of desiring to conquer all of China over the next two decades.  According to Japanese sources, Yan entered into negotiations with the Japanese in 1935, but was never very enthusiastic about "autonomy" and rejected their overtures when he realized that they intended to make him their puppet. Yan likely used these negotiations to frighten Chiang Kai-shek into using his armies to defend Shanxi, since he was afraid that Chiang was preparing to sacrifice northern China to avoid fighting the Japanese. If these were Yan's intentions, they were successful, as Chiang assured Yan that he would defend Shanxi with his army in the event that Shanxi was invaded.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 216-218</ref>

===Early conflict with the Chinese Communist Party===
Although Yan admired its philosophy and economic methods, he feared the threat posed by Chinese communists almost as much as the Japanese. In the early 1930s Yan observed that, if it invaded Shanxi, the Red Army would enjoy the support of 70% of his subjects, and would readily be able to recruit one million men from among the most desperate citizens of Shanxi. Yan remarked that "the job of suppressing communism is 70 percent political and only 30 percent military, while the job of preventing its growth altogether is 90 percent political."  In order to prevent a Communist threat to Shanxi, Yan sent troops to fight the Communists in [[Jiangxi–Fujian Soviet|Jiangxi]] and (later) [[Shaanxi]], organized the gentry and village authorities into anti-corruption and anti-communist political organizations, and attempted (mostly unsuccessfully) to undertake a large-scale programme of land reform.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 218-220</ref>

These reforms did not prevent the spread of Communist guerrilla operations into Shanxi.  Led by [[Liu Zhidan]] and [[Xu Haidong]], 34,000 Communist troops crossed into southwestern Shanxi in February 1936. As Yan predicted, the Communists enjoyed massive popular support; and, although they were outnumbered and ill-armed, succeeded in occupying the southern third of Shanxi in less than a month. The Communists' strategy of guerrilla warfare was extremely effective against, and demoralizing for, Yan's forces, who repeatedly fell victim to surprise attacks. The Communists in Shanxi made good use of cooperation supplied by local peasants to evade and easily locate Yan's forces. When reinforcements sent by the central government forced the Communists to withdraw from Shanxi, the Red Army escaped by splitting into small groups that were actively supplied and hidden by local supporters. Yan himself admitted that his forces had fought poorly during the campaign. The KMT forces that remained in Shanxi expressed hostility to Yan's rule, but did not interfere with his governance.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 220-221</ref>

===Invasion by Mengguguo===
In March 1936, [[Manchukuo|Manchurian]] troops occupying the Inner Mongolian province of [[Chahar Province|Chahar]] invaded northeastern [[Suiyuan]], which Yan controlled.  These Japanese-aligned troops seized the city of [[Bailingmiao]] in northern Suiyuan, where the pro-Japanese [[Inner Mongolian Autonomous Political Council]] maintained its headquarters. Three months later, the head of the Political Council, [[Demchugdongrub|Prince De (Demchugdongrub)]] declared that he was the ruler of an independent Mongolia ([[Mengjiang|Mengguguo]]), and organized an army with the aid of Japanese equipment and training. In August 1936 Prince De's army attempted to invade eastern Suiyuan, but it was defeated by Yan's forces under the command of [[Fu Zuoyi]]. Following this defeat, Prince De planned another invasion while Japanese agents carefully sketched and photographed Suiyuan's defenses.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 230</ref>

To prepare for the imminent threat of Japanese invasion that Yan felt after Suiyuan was invaded, Yan attempted to force all students to undergo several months of compulsive military training, and formed an informal alliance with the Communists for the purpose of fighting the Japanese, several months before the [[Xi'an Incident]] compelled Chiang Kai-shek to do the same. In November 1936 the army of Prince De presented Fu Zuoyi with an ultimatum to surrender. When Fu responded that Prince De was merely a puppet of "certain quarters" and requested that De submit to the authority of the central government, Prince Teh's Mongolian and Manchurian armies launched another, more ambitious attack. Teh's 15,000 soldiers were armed with Japanese weapons, supported by Japanese aircraft, and often led by Japanese officers. (Japanese soldiers fighting for Mengguguo were often executed after their capture as illegal combatants, since Mengguguo was not recognized as being part of Japan).<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 230-234</ref>

In anticipation of this war, Japanese spies destroyed a large supply depot in [[Datong]] and carried out other acts of sabotage. Yan placed his best troops and most able generals, including [[Zhao Chengshou]] and Yan's son-in-law, [[Wang Jingguo]], under the command of Fu Zuoyi. During the month of fighting that ensued, the army or Mengguguo suffered severe casualties.  Fu's forces succeeded in occupying Bailingmiao on November 24, 1936, and was considering invading Chahar before he was warned by the [[Kwantung Army]] that doing so would provoke an attack by the Japanese Army. Prince De's forces repeatedly attempted to retake Bailingmiao, but this only provoked Fu into sending troops north, where he successfully seized the last of De's bases in Suiyuan and virtually annihilated his army. After Japanese officers were found to be aiding De, Yan publicly accused Japan of aiding the invaders. Yan's victories in Suiyuan over Japanese-backed forces were praised by Chinese newspapers and magazines, other warlords and political leaders, and many students and members of the Chinese public.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 234-236</ref>

==The Second Sino-Japanese War==
During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945), most regions of Shanxi were quickly overrun by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]], but Yan refused to flee the province after losing the provincial capital, Taiyuan. He relocated his headquarters to a remote corner of the province, effectively resisting Japanese attempts to completely seize Shanxi. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese made no less than five attempts to negotiate peace terms with Yan and hoped that Yan would become a second [[Wang Jingwei]], but Yan refused and stayed on the Chinese side.

===Alliance with the Communists===
After the failed attempt by the [[Chinese Red Army]] to establish bases in southern Shanxi in early 1936, the subsequent continued presence of Nationalist soldiers there, and the Japanese attempts to take Suiyuan that summer, Yan became convinced that the Communists were lesser threats to his rule than either the Nationalists or the Japanese. Yan then negotiated a secret anti-Japanese "united front" with the Communists in October 1936; and, after the [[Xi'an Incident]] two months later, he successfully influenced Chiang Kai-shek to entered into a similar agreement with the Communists. After establishing his alliance with the Communists Yan lifted the ban on Communist activities in Shanxi.<ref>Feng and Goodman 156-157</ref> He allowed Communist agents working under [[Zhou Enlai]] to establish a secret headquarters in [[Taiyuan]],<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 263</ref> and released Communists that he had been holding in prison (including at least one general, Wang Ruofei).<ref>Wortzel 33</ref>

Yan, under the slogan "resistance against the enemy and defense of the soil" attempted to recruit young, patriotic intellectuals to his government in order to organize a local resistance to the threat of Japanese invasion. By 1936 Taiyuan had become a gathering point for anti-Japanese intellectuals who had fled from [[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]], and [[Northeast China]] who readily cooperated with Yan, but he also recruited natives of Shanxi who were living across China regardless of their former political associations. Some Shanxi officials attracted to Yan's cause in the late 1930s later became important figures in the Chinese government, including [[Bo Yibo]].<ref>Feng and Goodman 157-158</ref>

===Early campaigns===
In July 1937, after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] provoked the Japanese into attacking Chinese forces in and around Beijing, the Japanese sent a large amount of warplanes and Manchurian soldiers to reinforce Prince Teh's army.  This caused Yan to believe that a Japanese invasion of Shanxi was imminent, and he flew to Nanjing to communicate the situation to Chiang Kai-shek. Yan left his meeting in Nanjing with an appointment as commander of the Second War Zone, comprising Shanxi, Suiyuan, Chahar, and northern Shaanxi.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 257</ref>

After returning to Shanxi, Yan encouraged his officials to be suspicious of enemy spies and ''[[hanjian]]'', and ordered his forces to attack Prince Teh's forces in northern Chahar, hoping to surprise and overwhelm them quickly. The Mongolian and Manchu forces were quickly routed, and Japanese reinforcements attempting to force their way through the strategic Nankou pass suffered heavy casualties. Overwhelming Japanese firepower, including artillery, bombers, and tanks, eventually forced Yan's forces to surrender Nankou, after which Japanese forces quickly seized Suiyuan and Datong.  The Japanese then began the invasion of Shanxi in earnest.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 257-259</ref>

As the Japanese advanced southward into Taiyuan basin, Yan attempted to impose discipline on his army by executing General [[Li Fuying]] and other officers guilty of retreating from the enemy. He issued orders not to withdraw or surrender under any circumstances, vowed to resist Japan until the Japanese had been defeated, and invited his own soldiers to kill him if he betrayed his promise. In the face of continued Japanese advances Yan apologized to the central government for his army's defeats, asked it to assume responsibility for the defense of Shanxi, and agreed to share control of the provincial government with one of Chiang Kai-shek's representatives.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 262-263</ref>

When it became clear to Yan that his forces may not be successful in repelling the Japanese army, Yan invited Communist military forces to re-enter Shanxi. [[Zhu De]] became the commander of the [[Eighth Route Army]] active in Shanxi and was named the vice-commander of the Second War Zone, under Yan himself. Yan initially responded warmly to the re-entry of the arrival of Communist forces, and they were greeted with enthusiasm by Yan's officials and officers. Communist forces arrived in Shanxi just in time to help defeat a decisively more powerful Japanese force attempting to move through the strategic mountain pass of [[Battle of Pingxingguan|Pingxingguan]]. After the Japanese responded to this defeat by outflanking the defenders and moving towards Taiyuan, the Communists avoided decisive battles and mostly attempted to harass Japanese forces and sabotage Japanese lines of supply and communication. The Japanese suffered, but mostly ignored the Eighth Route Army and continued to advance towards Yan's capital. The lack of attention directed at their forces gave the Communists time to recruit and propagandize among the local peasant populations (who generally welcomed Communist forces enthusiastically) and to organize a network of militia units, local guerrilla bands, and popular mass organizations.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 263-264</ref>

Genuine Communist efforts to resist the Japanese gave them the authority to carry out sweeping and radical social and economic reforms, mostly related to land and wealth redistribution, which they defended by labeling those who resisted as ''[[hanjian]]''. Communist efforts to resist the Japanese also won over Shanxi's small population of patriotic intellectuals, and conservative fears of resisting them effectively gave the Communists unlimited access to the rural population. Subsequent atrocities committed by the Japanese in the effort to rid Shanxi of Communist guerrillas aroused the hatred of millions in the Shanxi countryside, causing the rural population to turn to the Communists for leadership against the Japanese. All of these factors explain how, within a year of re-entering Shanxi, the Communists were able to take control of most of Shanxi not firmly held by the Japanese.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 271</ref>

===Fall of Taiyuan===
[[File:Chinese troops marching in Xinkou.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Chinese troops marching to defend the mountain pass at Xinkou.]]
By executing commanders guilty of retreating, Yan succeeded in improving the morale of his forces. During the [[Battle of Pingxingguan]] Shanxi troops successfully resisted numerous Japanese assaults while the Eight Route Army harassed the Japanese from the rear and along their flanks. Other units of Yan's army successfully defended other nearby passes.  After the Japanese successfully broke into the Taiyan basin, the Japanese continued to encounter ferocious resistance. At [[Yuanping, Shanxi|Yuanping]], a single brigade of Yan's troops held out against the entire Japanese advance for over a week, allowing reinforcements sent by the central government to take up defensive positions at [[Battle of Xinkou|Xinkou]]. The Communist generals Zhu De and [[Peng Dehuai]] criticized Yan for what they called "suicidal tactics", but Yan was confident that the heavy losses suffered by the Japanese would eventually demoralize them, forcing the Japanese to abandon their effort to take Shanxi.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 271-272</ref>

During the [[Battle of Xinkou]], the Chinese defenders resisted the efforts of Japan's elite [[Seishir? Itagaki|Itakagi Division]] for over a month, despite Japanese advantages in artillery and air support. By the end of October, 1937, Japan's losses were four times greater than those suffered at Pingxingguan, and the Itakagi Division was close to defeat. Contemporary Communist accounts called the battle "the most fierce in North China", while Japanese accounts called the battle a "stalemate". In an effort to save their forces at Xinkou, Japanese forces began an effort to occupy Shanxi from a second direction, in the east. After a week of fighting, Japanese forces captured the strategic [[Niangzi Pass]], opening the way to capturing Taiyuan. Communist guerrilla tactics were ineffective in slowing down the Japanese advance. The defenders at Xinkou, realizing that they were in danger of being outflanked, withdrew southward, past Taiyuan, leaving a small force of 6,000 men to hold off the entire Japanese army. A representative of the Japanese army, speaking of [[Battle of Taiyuan|the final defense of Taiyuan]], said that "nowhere in China have the Chinese fought so obstinately".<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 272-273</ref>

The Japanese suffered 30,000 dead and an equal number wounded in their effort to take northern Shanxi. A Japanese study found that the battles of Pingxingguan, Xinkou, and Taiyuan were responsible for over half of all casualties suffered by the Japanese army in North China. Yan himself was forced to withdraw after having 90% of his army destroyed, including a large force of reinforcements sent into Shanxi by the central government. Throughout 1937 numerous high-ranking Communist leaders, including [[Mao Zedong]], lavished praise on Yan for waging an uncompromising campaign of resistance against the Japanese.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 273-274, 279</ref>

===Re-establishment of Yan's authority===
Shortly before losing Taiyuan Yan moved his headquarters to [[Linfen]], in southwestern Shanxi. Japanese forces halted their advance in order to focus on combating Communist guerrilla unts still active in their territory, and communicated to Yan that they would exterminate his forces within a year, but that he and his supporters would be treated with consideration if they severed relations with the central government and assisted the Japanese in suppressing the Communists. Yan responded by repeating his promise not to surrender until Japan had been defeated. Possibly because of the severity of his losses in northern Shanxi, Yan abandoned a plan of defense based on positional warfare, and began to reform his army as a force capable of waging guerrilla warfare. After 1938 most of Yan's followers came to refer to his regime as a "guerrilla administration".<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 273-275</ref>

Yan's intransigence obliged the Japanese to invade Linfen. Yan's defenses, under the command of [[Wei Lihuang]], put up a stiff defense at [[Lingshi]] Pass, but were eventually forced to abandon the position when a Japanese column broke through a different pass and threatened Linfen from the east. Wei was successful in preventing the Japanese from seizing the strategic [[Zhongtiao Mountains|Zhongtiao mountain range]], but the loss of Linfen and Lingshi forced Yan to withdraw with what remained of his army across the [[Yellow River]], into neighboring Shaanxi.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 275-276</ref>

In the spring of 1938 the Japanese redistributed many of their forces away from Shanxi, and Yan succeeded in re-establishing his authority, setting up a headquarters in the remote, mountainous district of [[Qi County, Shanxi|Qixian]]. The Japanese made several raids into southern Shanxi, but withdrew after encountering heavy resistance. By 1938, Yan's tactics had evolved to resemble the guerrilla warfare practiced by Communist forces in other parts of Shanxi, and his defenses featured coordination with Communist forces and with regular divisions of the Nationalist army.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 277</ref>

Yan's alliance with the Communists eventually suffered as tensions escalated between the KMT and CCP in other parts of China. Yan himself eventually came to fear the rapid power and influence that Communist forces operating in Shanxi quickly gained, and this fear caused Yan to become increasingly hostile to Communist agents and soldiers. These tensions eventually led to the breakdown of Yan's good relations with the Communists in 1939, when Yan began another offensive against the Japanese and attempted to wipe out the units of his army most friendly with the Communists by having them do most of the fighting. These units eventually rebelled against Yan, receiving assistance from the Communists, while soldiers aligned with the central government aided Yan. Yan eventually succeeded in driving the Communists and their sympathizers from the territory that he controlled, but most of the rural territory of northwestern Shanxi passed into the control of the Eighth Route Army. Yan's forces continued to battle the Japanese throughout 1940 as part of an indecisive guerrilla campaign.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 278-279</ref>

===Negotiations with the Japanese===
In 1940 Yan's friend, [[Ry?kichi Tanaka|Tanaka Ryukichi]], became chief of staff of the Japanese First Army, which was stationed in Shanxi. After Yan's animosity with the Communists became apparent, Tanaka began negotiations with Yan in the effort of inducing Yan to enter into an anti-Communist alliance with Japan. Yan agreed to send a high-level representative to meet with the Japanese, and obtained permission from the central government to negotiate with the Japanese for an agreement to remove all troops from Shanxi in exchange for Yan's cooperation. Perhaps because the Japanese were unwilling to meet these demands, Yan withdrew from negotiations in December, 1940, when Tanaka's superiors recalled him to Japan. Two months later the Japanese repeated their charge that Yan was a "dupe" of the Communists.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 279-280</ref>

In May 1941 Tanaka Ryukichi returned to Shanxi and reopened negotiations with Yan, despite a general resistance from other Japanese military leaders in North China. Tanaka returned to Tokyo in August 1941, paving way for talks between Yan and General Iwamatsu, then the commander of the Japanese First Army in Shanxi. In the summer of 1942 Yan told the Japanese that he would aid them in their fight against the Communists if the Japanese withdrew a large part of their forces from Shanxi and provided his army with food, weapons, and CH$15 million of precious metals.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 280</ref>

When Iwamatsu sent his chief of staff, Colonel Hanatani, to Qixian for the purpose of delivering what Yan demanded, Yan called the Japanese concessions inadequate and refused to negotiate with the Japanese.  This refusal is variously explained as Yan's resentment over the arrogance of the Japanese, his conviction that the Japanese would lose the war in the Pacific after he heard about the [[Battle of Midway]], and/or the result of a translation error that convinced Yan that the Japanese were using the negotiations as a ploy to ambush and attack him by surprise. Because they had allowed Yan to deceive them, Iwamatsu lost his command and Hanatani was reassigned to the Pacific.<ref>Gillin ''Warlords'' 280-281</ref>

After 1943 the Japanese began to negotiate with Yan clandestinely through civilian representatives (notably Yan's friend, Komoto Daisaku) in an effort to avoid being humiliated by him. Through Komoto's efforts Yan and the Japanese came to observe an informal ceasefire, though the terms of this agreement are unknown. By 1944 Yan's troops were actively battling the Communists, possibly with the cooperation and assistance of the Japanese. Yan's relationship with Chiang also declined by 1944, when Yan warned that the masses would turn to communism if Chiang's government did not improve considerably. An American reporter who visited Shanxi in 1944 observed that Yan "was thought of not necessarily as a puppet but rather as a compromise between the extremes of the treason at Nanjing and national resistance at Chongqing" by the Japanese.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 281-282</ref>

===Relationship with the Japanese after 1945===
Yan Xishan was notable for his ability to recruit thousands of Japanese soldiers stationed in northwest Shanxi in 1945, including their commanding officers, into his army. He was recorded to have successfully used a variety of tactics to achieve these defections: flattery, face-saving gestures, appeals to idealism, and genuine expressions of mutual interest. In cases where these were not completely successful, he sometimes resorted to "bribes and women". His tactics in both convincing the Japanese to stay and in preventing them from leaving were highly successful, as the efforts of the Japanese were instrumental in keeping the area surrounding Taiyuan free from Communist control for the four years before the Communists won the civil war.<ref name="Journal1">Gillin and Etter 500</ref>

Yan was successful in keeping the presence of the Japanese from American and Nationalist observers. He was known for making shows of disarming Japanese, only to rearm them at night. In one instance, he disarmed several units of Japanese, had a reporter take a picture of the stacked weapons to show that he was following orders, and then gave the weapons back to the Japanese. He once officially labelled a detachment of Japanese troops as "railway repair labourers" in public records before sending them, fully armed, into areas without railway tracks but full of Communist insurgents.<ref name="Journal1" />

By recruiting the Japanese into his service in the manner that he did, Yan retained both the extensive industrial complex around Taiyuan and virtually all of the managerial and technical personnel employed by the Japanese to run it. Yan was so successful in convincing surrendered Japanese to work for him that, as word spread to other areas of north China, Japanese soldiers from those areas began to converge on Taiyuan to serve his government and army. At its greatest strength, the Japanese "special forces" under Yan totaled 15,000 troops, plus an officer corps that was distributed throughout Yan's army. These numbers were reduced to 10,000 after serious American efforts to repatriate the Japanese were partially successful. By 1949, serious casualties had reduced the number of Japanese soldiers under Yan's command to 3,000. The leader of the Japanese under Yan's command, Imamura Hosaku, committed suicide on the day that Taiyuan fell to Communist forces.<ref>Gillin and Etter 506-508</ref>

== Civil war ==
[[File:Yan Xishan1947.jpg|thumb|190px|Yan Xishan in 1947]]
After [[World War II|the Second World War]], Yan's troops (including thousands of former Japanese troops) held out against the Communists during the [[Chinese Civil War]] for four years. His forces held out until April, 1949, after the Nationalist government had lost control northern China, allowing the PLA to encircle and besiege his forces.  The area surrounding the provincial capital of Taiyuan was the longest to resist Communist control.

===The Shangdang Campaign===
{{Main|Shangdang Campaign}}
The [[Shangdang Campaign]] was the first battle between Communist and KMT forces after World War II. It began as an attempt by Yan (authorized by [[Chiang Kai-shek]]) to re-assert control over southern Shanxi, where the [[People's Liberation Army]] was known to be especially active. At the same time, Yan's former general, Fu Zuoyi, had captured several important cities in [[Inner Mongolia]]: [[Baotou]] and [[Hohhot]]. If both Yan and Fu had been successful, they would have cut off the Communist headquarters in Yan'an from their forces in [[Northeast China]]. The local commander, [[Liu Bocheng]], (later named one of China's "[[Yuan Shuai#People's Republic of China|Ten Great Marshals]]) decided to direct his forces against Yan in order to prevent this from happening. Liu's political commissar was [[Deng Xiaoping]], who later became China's "[[paramount leader]]".<ref name=Lew2234>Lew 22-23</ref>

The initial skirmishes of the campaign were fought on August 19, 1945, when Yan dispatched 16,000 troops under [[Shi Zebo]] to capture the city of [[Changzhi]], in southeast Shanxi. On September 1, Liu arrived with 31,000 troops and encircled Changzhi. After initial engagements between Shi Zebo and Liu Bocheng's forces, Shi barricaded his forces inside the regional center of Chengzhi. Liu's army occupied the area surrounding Chengzhi, but was not able to take the city, leading to a stalemate.<ref name=Lew2234 />

After it became clear that Liu's forces were in danger of being defeated, Yan sent 20,000 more troops, commanded by Peng Yubin, to reinforce Shi and break the siege. Liu responded by concentrating his forces against Peng, leaving only a screening force behind to carry out low-level suppression activities in Changzhi.<ref name=Lew2234 /> Most of the forces left behind in Changzhi were selected from a local 50,000-man irregular militia unit, which had been used by Liu mainly for logistical support.

Peng was initially successful in defeating PLA detachments, but eventually his forces were led into an ambush. He was killed, and his army quickly surrendered en masse. When Shi realized that he had no hope of relief he attempted to breakout and flee to Taiyuan on October 8, but was caught on open ground, ambushed, and forced to surrender on October 10.<ref>Lew 23</ref> He was taken alive as a prisoner of war.

Although both forces suffered the same amount of dead or wounded, 4,000-5,000, the Communists were able to capture 31,000 of Yan's troops, who surrendered once they fell into these ambushes. After surrendering, most of Yan's forces were subjected to organized persuasion or coercion and eventually joined the Communists.<ref>Lew 23-24</ref> Most of the PLA casualties in the campaign occurred when they attempted to confront Peng's reinforcements in an orthodox battle, allowing Yan's forces to successfully target Liu's forces with their superior arms. After these tactics failed, PLA forces were able to kill or capture both Shi's and Peng's forces by leading them each into a series of well-orchestrated ambushes.

The Shangdang Campaign ended with the Communists in firm control of southern Shanxi. Because the army fielded by Yan was much better supplied and armed, the victory allowed the local PLA to acquire much greater arms than had previously been available to them (including, for the first time, field artillery). It is said that the PLA victory in the Shangdang campaign altered the course of the ongoing Chongqing peace negotiations, allowing [[Mao Zedong]] to act from a stronger negotiating position.  Their victory in the Shangdang campaign boosted the long-term prestige of both Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping.<ref>Yang 454</ref> Following the campaign, Liu left a small force behind to defend southern Shanxi, leading most of his best units and captured equipment to confront the forces of [[Sun Lianzhong]] in the [[Handan Campaign|Pinghan Campaign]].<ref>Lew 24</ref>

In 1946 Communist forces in [[Northwest China]] identified the capture of Yan's capital of Taiyuan as one of their main objectives, and throughout 1946 and 1947 Yan was constantly involved in efforts to defend the north and retake the south.<ref>Lew 50-52</ref> These efforts were only temporarily successful, and by the winter of 1947 Yan's control of Shanxi was restricted to the area of northern Shanxi adjacent to Taiyuan. Yan observed that the Communists were growing stronger, and predicted that within six months they would rule half of China. After losing southern Shanxi Yan undertook preparations to defend Taiyuan to the death, perhaps in the hopes that if he and other anti-Communist leaders could hold out long enough the United States would eventually join the war on their side, saving his forces from destruction.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 286</ref>

===The Taiyuan Campaign===
{{Main|Taiyuan Campaign}}
[[File:Yan Xishan 1948.jpg|right|thumb|220px|During the siege of Taiyuan, Yan told foreign journalists that he and his followers would swallow cyanide pills before they let the PLA take Shanxi. Many of his followers committed suicide when Taiyuan fell.]]
By 1948, Yan's forces had suffered a succession of serious military defeats by the PLA, losing control of southern and central Shanxi, and were surrounded on all sides by territory controlled by the Communists. Anticipating an assault on northern Shanxi, Yan prepared his armies by fortifying over 5,000 bunkers, constructed over the rugged natural terrain surrounding Taiyuan. The Nationalist 30th Army was airlifted from Xian to Taiyuan to fortify the city, which was protected by over six hundred pieces of artillery. Yan repeatedly declared his intentions to die in the city during this period. The total number of Nationalist troops present in northern Shanxi by the fall of 1948 was 145,000.

To overcome these defenses, the Communist commander [[Xu Xiangqian]] developed a strategy of engaging positions on the outskirts of Taiyuan before besieging the city itself. The first hostilities in the Taiyuan Campaign occurred on October 5, 1948.

By November 13, 1948, the Communists succeeded in taking the area around the eastern side of Taiyuan. The Nationalists suffered serious setbacks when entire divisions defected or surrendered. In one case, a Nationalist division led by [[Dai Bingnan]] pretended to surrender, but then arrested the Communist officers who entered Dai's camp to accept. Yan Xishan mistakenly believed the leader of the arrested group, [[Jin Fu]], was the high-ranking Communist leader [[Hu Yaobang]] (who the Nationalists believed was active in the region). Yen airlifted the captured group to Chiang Kai-shek, who executed them after they failed to produce important information. Dai himself was rewarded with a large amount of gold for his actions, but was not allowed to be airlifted out of Taiyuan. After the city fell he was captured, put on a well-propagandized show trial, and publicly executed.

Between November, 1948, and April, 1949, a stalemate was reached and there was little advancement by either side.  Tactics used by the Communists during this time included psychological warfare, forcing relatives of the Nationalist defenders to the front to ask for the defenders' surrender.  These tactics were successful as, from December 1, 1948, through March, 1949, over 12,000 Nationalist soldiers surrendered.

After [[Pingjin Campaign|major PLA victories in Hebei in late January, 1949]], Communist armies in Shanxi were reinforced with additional troops and artillery. After this reinforcement, the total number of men under Liu's command exceeded 320,000 men, of which 220,000 were reserves. By the end of 1948, Yan Xishan had lost over 40,000 troops, but attempted to supplement this number through large-scale drafting.

Yan Xishan himself (along with most of the provincial treasury) was airlifted out of Taiyuan on March 1949 for the express purpose of asking the central government for more supplies. Yan left behind [[Sun Chu]] as the commander of his military police force, with Yan's son-in-law, [[Wang Jingguo]], in charge of most Nationalist forces. Overall command was delegated to Imamura Hosaku, the Japanese lieutenant-general who had joined Yan after World War II.<ref name="Gillin Warlord 288">Gillin ''Warlord'' 288</ref>

Shortly after Yan himself was airlifted out of Taiyuan, Nationalist planes stopped dropping food and supplies for the defenders due to fears of being shot down by the advancing Communists.<ref name="Gillin Warlord 288"/> The Communists, depending largely on their reinforcements of artillery, launched a major assault on April 20, 1949, and succeeded in taking all positions surrounding Taiyuan by April 22.  A subsequent appeal to the defenders to surrender was refused.  On the morning of April 22, 1949, the PLA bombarded Taiyuan with 1,300 pieces of artillery and breached the city's walls, initiating bloody street-to-street fighting for control of the city.  By 10:00 am, April 22, the Taiyuan Campaign ended with the Communists in complete control of Shanxi.  Total Nationalist casualties amounted to all 145,000 defenders, many of which survived as POWs.  The Communists lost 45,000 men and an unknown number of civilian labourers that they had drafted, all of which were either killed or injured.

The fall of Taiyuan was one of the few examples in the Chinese Civil War in which Nationalist forces echoed the defeated Ming loyalists who had, in the 17th century, brought entire cities to ruins resisting the invading Manchus. Many Nationalist officers were reported to have committed suicide when the city fell. The dead included Yan's nephew-in-law, who was serving as governor, and his cousin, who ran his household. [[Liang Huazhi]], the head of Yan's "Patriotic Sacrifice League", had fought for years against the Communists in Shanxi until he was finally trapped in the massively fortified city of Taiyuan.  For six months Liang led a savage resistance, leading both Yan's remaining forces and those of the warlord's thousands of Japanese mercenaries. When Communist troops finally broke into the city and began to occupy large sections of it, Liang barricaded himself inside a large, fortified prison complex filled with Communist prisoners. In a final act of self-sacrifice, Liang set fire to the prison and committed suicide as the entire compound burned to the ground.<ref>Spence 488</ref>

==Last Years==

===Premier of the Republic of China===
In March 1949 Yan flew to the capital of Nanjing for the purpose of asking the central government for more food and ammunition, taking most of the provincial treasury with him, and did not return before Taiyuan fell to Communist forces. Shortly after arriving in Nanjing, Yan insinuated himself into a quarrel between the acting president of the Chinese Republic, [[Li Zongren]], and Chiang Kai-shek, who had resigned from the presidency in January 1949. Although Chiang had resigned, many officials and generals remained loyal to him, and Chiang retained over US$200 million, which he did not allow Li to use in order to fight the Communists or to stabilize the currency. The ongoing power struggle between Li and Chiang seriously disrupted the larger effort to defend Nationalist territory from Communist forces.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 288-289</ref>

Yan focused his efforts on attempting to promote greater cooperation between Li and Chiang. On one occasion Yan broke down in tears when attempting, at Chiang's request, to convince Li not to resign. He repeatedly used the example of the loss of Shanxi, and warned that the Nationalist cause was doomed unless Li and Chiang's relationship improved. Li eventually attempted to form a government, including both Chiang's supporters and critics, with Yan as premier. Despite Yan's efforts, Chiang refused to allow Li access to more than a fraction of the wealth that Chiang had sent to Taiwan, and officers loyal to Chiang refused to follow Li's orders, frustrating efforts to coordinate Nationalist defenses and to stabilize the currency.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 289-290</ref>

By late 1949 the Nationalist's position had become desperate. The currency issued by the central government rapidly declined in value until it became virtually worthless. Military forces loyal to Li attempted to defend [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]], while those loyal to Chiang attempted to defend [[Sichuan]]. Both forces refused to cooperate with each other, eventually leading to the loss of both regions. Yan's constant attempts to work with both sides led to his being alienated from both Li and Chiang, both of whom resented Yan for cooperating with either side. The Communists succeeded in taking all territory held on the mainland by the end of 1949, defeating both Li and Chiang. Li went into exile in the United States, while Yan continued to serve as Premier, in Taiwan, until 1950, when Chiang re-assumed the presidency.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 290-291</ref>

===Retirement in Taiwan===

[[File:Yan Xishan 1950.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Yan retired from public life in 1950. He spent much of his retirement writing, analyzing contemporary political issues and promoting Yan Xishan Thought.]]

Yan's final years were filled with disappointment and sadness. After following Chiang to Taiwan he enjoyed the title of "senior advisor" to Chiang, but in reality was utterly powerless. Chiang may have held a long-term grudge against Yan due to Yan's activities on behalf of Li in Guangdong. On more than one occasion Yan requested permission to go to Japan, but was not allowed to leave Taiwan.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 291</ref>

Yan was deserted by all but a handful of followers, and spent most of his remaining years writing books on philosophy, history, and contemporary events, which he frequently had translated into English.<ref name="Gillin291">Gillin ''Warlord'' 291-292</ref> Yan's late philosophical perspective has been described as "anti-communist and anti-capitalist Confucian utopianism". Several months before the [[Korean War]] Yan published a book, ''Peace or World War'', in which he predicted that [[North Korea]] would invade [[South Korea]], that South Korea would be quickly overcome, that the United States would intervene on the side of South Korea, that the North Koreans would be pushed back to the [[Yalu River]], that Communist China would intervene on the side of North Korea, that a stalemate would result, and that the Americans would retain a long-term presence in South Korea afterwards. All of these events later occurred over the course of the Korean War.<ref>Lawson</ref>

Yan died in Taiwan in May 24, 1960.<ref name="Gillin291" /> He was buried in the Qixingjun region of [[Yangmingshan]]. For decades Yan's residence and grave were cared for by a small number of former aides, who had accompanied Yan from Shanxi. In 2011, when the last of his aides turned eighty-one and became unable to care for the residence, the responsibility of maintaining the site was taken over by the Taipei City Government.<ref>Zhou</ref>

==Legacy==
After the civil war, Yan, like most Nationalist generals who did not switch sides, was demonized by Communist propaganda.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 282</ref> It was not until after 1979, with new reforms in China, that Yan began to be viewed more positively (and thus, more realistically) as a pragmatic anti-Japanese hero. The contributions by Yan during his period in office are beginning to be recognized by the current Chinese government. One of his achievements, Yan's success in containing one of the [[epidemics]] in Shanxi, was cited recently by various Chinese governmental organizations as an example to follow to contain the [[H5N1|bird flu]] and [[severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] epidemics in China, and was used to criticize the incompetence of Chinese governmental officials in handling such epidemics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Yan was sincere about his attempts to modernize Shanxi, and achieved success in some regards. Throughout his rule Yan attempted to promote social reforms that later came to be taken for granted, but which were highly controversial in his time: the abolition of foot binding; work for women outside the home; universal primary education; and, the existence of peasant militias as a fundamental unit of the army. Yan was possibly the warlord most committed to his province in his era, but was constantly challenged by his own dilettantism and the talents of his own officials.<ref name="Bonavia138">Bonavia 138-139</ref>

Although Yan constantly spoke of the desirability and need for reforms, until the 1930s he remained too conservative to implement anything resembling the kind of reforms needed to successfully modernize Shanxi. Many of his attempts at reform in the 1920s had been attempted generations before, during the [[Tongzhi Restoration]]. These Qing Dynasty reformers had found their reforms inadequate solutions to the problems of their time, and under the Model Governor these reforms proved equally unsatisfactory. During the 1930s Yan became increasingly open to radical social and economic policies, including wealth redistribution via graduated taxation, state-led industrialization, opposition to the money economy, an orientation towards functional (vs. "moral") education, and the large-scale assimilation of Western technology. Despite his adoption of Soviet-style economic policies and increasingly radical attempts at social reform, Yan was regarded as a "conservative" throughout his career, suggesting that the term "conservative" must be used carefully within the context of modern Chinese history.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 293-295</ref>

After Yan's time Shanxi became of site of [[Mao Zedong]]'s "model brigade" of [[Dazhai, Xiyang County|Dazhai]]: a utopian communist scheme in [[Xiyang County]] that was supposed to be the model for all other peasants in China to emulate. If the people of Dazhai were especially suited for such an experiment, it is possible that decades of Yan's socialist indoctrination may have prepared the people of Shanxi for Communist rule. After the death of Mao, the experiment was discontinued, and most peasants reverted to private farming.<ref name="Bonavia138" />

The '''music of Afghanistan''' has existed for a long time, but since the late 1970s the country has been involved in constant wars and people were less concerned about [[music]]. As such, music in [[Afghanistan]] has been suppressed and recording for outsiders minimal{{Clarify|date=January 2011}}, despite a rich musical heritage.

Located on the crossroads between many trade routes, Afghanistan's music tradition was influenced by Arabs, Persians, Indians, Mongolians, Chinese and many others passing through. Thus Afghan music features a mix of Persian melodies, Arab scales, Indian compositional principles as well as sounds from ethnic groups such as the Pashtuns or Tajiks and the instruments used range from Indian tablas to long-necked lutes.

During the 1990s, the post-Soviet and [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban governments]] banned instrumental music and much public music-making.<ref name="almaty">[http://www.hauntedink.com/almaty/photos1.html Almaty or Bust]</ref> In spite of arrests and destruction of [[musical instrument]]s, musicians have continued to ply their trade into the present. The multi-ethnic city of [[Kabul]] has long been the regional cultural capital, but outsiders have tended to focus on the city of [[Herat]], which is home to traditions more closely related to [[Music of Iran|Iranian music]] than in the rest of the country.<ref name="doubleday4">Doubleday, pg. 4</ref> Lyrics throughout most of Afghanistan are typically in [[Dari (Persian)]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]].

==Folk and traditional music==
{{Main|Pashto music}}

===Religious music===
{{Main|Muslim music}}
The Afghan concept of music is closely associated with instruments, and thus unaccompanied religious singing is not considered music. [[Koran]] recitation is an important kind of unaccompanied religious performance, as is the ecstatic [[Zikr]] ritual of the [[Sufi]]s which uses songs called ''na't'', and the [[Shi'a]] solo and group singing styles like ''[[mursia]]'', ''[[manqasat]]'', ''[[nowheh]]'' and ''[[rowzeh]]''. The [[Chishti Sufi]] sect of Kabul is an exception in that they use instruments like the [[Rubab (instrument)|rubab]], [[tabla]] and [[Pump organ|harmonium]] in their worship; this music is called ''tatti'' ("food for the soul").<ref name="mikalina" />

==Classic==
{{Main|Klasik}}
[[File:Afghan musicians.jpg|thumb|Afghan men performing at the new Afghan Cultural Center on [[Camp Leatherneck]] in [[Helmand Province]].]]
[[File:Afghan rubab.jpg|thumb|upright|Afghan [[Rubab (instrument)|rubab]]]]

The classical musical form of Afghanistan is called [[klasik]], which includes both instrumental and vocal and belly dancing [[ragas]], as well as [[Tarana]] and [[Ghazal]]s.<ref name="doubleday3">Doubleday, pg. 3</ref>  Many ''Ustads'', or professional musicians, have learned [[Hindustani classical music|North Indian classical music]] in  [[India]], and some of them were Indian descendants who moved from India to the royal court in [[Kabul]] in the 1860s.<ref name="mikalina" /> They maintain cultural and personal ties with India—through discipleship or intermarriage—and they use the Hindustani musical theories and terminology, for example ''raga'' (melodic form) and ''tala'' (rhythmic cycle)''.

Afghan ragas, in contrast to Indian ones, tend to be more focused on rhythm, and are usually played with the [[tabla]], or the local [[zerbaghali]], [[dayra]] or [[dohol]], all [[percussion instrument|percussive instruments]].<ref name="doubleday3" /> Other Afghan classical instruments include the [[dutar]], [[sorna]], [[sitar]], [[dilruba]], [[tambur]], [[ghichak]], and [[Rubab (instrument)|Rubab]].

Afghanistan's classical singers include the late Ustad [[Mohammad Hussain Sarahang]] (1924-1983), who is one of the master singers of Patiala Gharana in North Indian classical music and is also well known throughout [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] as a contemporary of Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. His composition "Pai Ashk" was used in the theme song of the Hindi film ''Mera Saya''. [[Ubaidullah Jan|Ubaidullah Jan Kandaharai]] is regarded as the king of Pashto music in the southern Afghanistan region. He died in the 1980s but his music is still very much enjoyed by the [[Pashtun diaspora]] around the world, mainly by the Pashtuns in the [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]]-[[Quetta]] regions. Other classical singers are [[Ustad Qasim]], Ustad [[Rahim Bakhsh]], and [[Ustad Nato]].

===Rubab===
{{Main|Rubab (instrument)}}

The [[Rubab (instrument)|rubab]] is a common [[lute]]-like instrument in Afghanistan, and is the forerunner of the Indian [[sarod]].<ref name="doubleday4" /> The rubab is sometimes considered the national instrument of Afghanistan, and is called the "lion of instruments";<ref>Doubleday, pg. 4 <small>"Afghans have a special feeling for the rubab, describing it as their 'national instrument'."</ref> one reviewer claims it sounds like "a Middle Eastern predecessor to the [[blues]] that popped up in the [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] 100 years ago".<ref>[http://www.adequacy.net/review.php?reviewID=3579 Delusions of Adequacy Reviews]</ref> The rubab has a double-chambered body carved from [[mulberry]] wood and has three main strings and a [[plectrum]] made from [[ivory]], bone or wood.

Famous players of the rubab are [[Mohammad Omar (musician)|Mohammad Omar]] his famous student Sardar Mado of Qargha-Kabul, now is Sardar Mado, while modern performers include [[Essa Kassemi]], [[Homayun Sakhi]], and [[Mohammed Rahim Khushnawaz]].<ref name="doubleday4" /> 
They use instruments that are made out of wood specially Rubab because it can not be made from other material and can not produce its original music with the traditional taste.

===Dombura===
{{Main|Dombura}}
The dombura is a popular folk instrument, particularly among the northern [[Tajiks]] and the [[Hazaras]] in the central part of the country. Notable Afghan dombura players include [[Dilagha Surood]], [[Naseer Parwani]], [[Mir Maftoon]], [[Safdar Tawkloi]] and [[Rajab Haideri]]. The dombura is played with much banging and scratching on the instrument to help give a [[percussion|percussive]] sound. The two strings are made of [[nylon]] (in modern times) or [[gut string|gut]]. They cross a short [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] to a pin at the other end of the body. There is a tiny sound hole in the back of the instrument, while the top is thick wood. It is not finished with any [[varnish]], [[Filing (metalworking)|filing]] or [[sanding]] of any kind, and as with all other Afghan instruments there is some decoration.<ref name="central">[http://www.atlasofpluckedinstruments.com/central_asia.htm Atlas of plucked instruments - Central Asia]</ref>

===Ghichak===
[[Ghichak]] is a string instrument made by the [[Hazara people]] of Afghanistan

==Pop music==

[[File:Farhad Darya's Peace Concert 2010.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Farhad Darya]] performing at a concert in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]].]]

[[File:Naghma 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Naghma]]]]
In 1925, Afghanistan began [[radio broadcasting]], but its station was destroyed in 1929. Broadcasting did not resume until [[Radio Kabul]] opened in 1940.<ref>[http://www.mikalina.com/Texts/music-afghanistan.htm Mikalina] <small>''Radio broadcasting was initiated in 1925 during the reign of Amanullah. The radio station was destroyed in 1929 in the uprising against his modernist policies, and there was no serious attempt to resume radio transmissions until Radio Kabul was officially opened in 1940, with German equipment and  assistance.''</ref>
As [[Radio Afghanistan]] reached the entire country, popular music grew more important. In 1951, Parwin became the first Afghan woman to sing live in Radio. [[Mahwash|Farida Mahwash]], one of the famous female singers who then gained the title of ''Ustad'' (Master), had a major hit with "O bacheh" in 1977; she was "perhaps the most notable" of pop singers.<ref>Doubleday, pgs. 4-5</ref>

Modern [[popular music]] did not arise until the 1950s when radio became commonplace in the country. They used orchestras featuring both Afghan and Indian instruments, as well as European [[clarinet]]s, [[guitar]]s and [[violin]]s. The 1970s were the [[golden age]] of Afghanistan's music industry. Popular music also included Indian and Pakistani cinema film and music imported from Iran, Tajikistan, the Arab world and elsewhere.<ref name="mikalina">[http://www.mikalina.com/Texts/music-afghanistan.htm Mikalina]</ref>

There is also a thriving Afghan music industry in neighboring [[Pakistan]], primarily located in the cities of [[Peshawer]], [[Karachi]] and the capital city, [[Islamabad]].  Much of the Afghan music industry was preserved via circulation in Pakistan and the holding of concerts for Afghan performers there which helped to keep the industry alive.  Afghan performers regularly perform on Pakistani television programs and hold concerts throughout the country for the estimated 3-4 million Afghans that still live there.

Since the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 US intervention in Afghanistan]] and the removal of the [[Taliban]], the music scene has begun to re-emerge. Some groups, like the [[Kaboul Ensemble]], have gained an international reputation.<ref name="almaty" /> In addition, traditional [[Pashtun culture|Pashtun music]] (especially in the southeast of the country) has entered a period of "golden years", according to a prominent spokesman for Afghan [[Ministry of Interior]], Lutfullah Mashal.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2005/05/22/the_tale_of_the_pashtun_poetess/ Boston Globe]</ref>

===History of pop===
Pop music emerged in Afghanistan during the 1950s, and became very popular until the late 1970s. What helped the emergence of pop music in Afghanistan were amateur singers from non-traditional music backgrounds who wanted to showcase their talents in the studio (Radio Kabul). These singers were from middle- to upper-class families and were more educated than singers from traditional music backgrounds.

These amateurs innovated in Afghan music and created a more modern approach to the traditional folklore and classical music of Afghans. Amateur singers included [[[[Farhad Darya]]]] { the legend of Afghan's today music}, [[Ahmad Zahir]], Nashinas (Dr. Sadiq Fitrat) [[Ahmad Wali]], [[Zahir Howaida]], [[Rahim Mehryar]], [[Mahwash]], [[Haidar Salim]], [[Ehsan Aman]], [[Najim Nawabi]], [[Salma Jahani]], [[Sharif Ghazal]], [[Hangama]], [[Parasto]], [[Naghma]], [[Mangal]], [[Farhad Darya]], [[Sarban]], and others. Ahmad Zahir was among Afghanistan's most famous singers; throughout the 60s and 70s he gained national and international recognition in countries like Iran and Tajikistan.

Rock music is slow to gain a foothold in the country, and [[Kabul Dreams]] is one of the few Afghan rock bands; formed in 2008 by ex-pats, they claim to be the first one.<ref name="najib">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8426436.stm|title=Afghan dreams of rock and roll|last=Najib|first=Moska|date=5 January 2010|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=21 February 2014}}</ref>

== Afghan hip hop ==
In addition to reggae, [[Adam Nicholas]] imported hip hop to Afghanistan, as well as most of Central Asia. Afghan hip hop is a type of music popular among Afghanistan's youth and immigrant community.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Coghlan |title=Gangsta Rap, Afghan Style |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4755701.stm |work= |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2006-05-10 |accessdate=2007-03-06 }}</ref> It inherits much of the style of traditional hip hop, but puts added emphasis on rare cultural sounds. Afghan hip hop is mostly sung in Dari (Persian), Pashto, and English. One popular hip hop artist is DJ Besho (Bezhan Zafarmal), a resident of Kabul. Another is 'Awesome Qasim', who is known in Canada and raps in Farsi, Pashto, and English. Qasim's most recent album came out in February 2013 in Canada.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tim|last=Albone|title=Gangsta rapper of Kabul puts peace before guns 'n' girls |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article708636.ece |work= |publisher=[[The Times]] |date=2006-04-24 |accessdate=2007-03-06 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Abdul|last=Saboor|title=Afghan rapper wins fans with message of peace |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006\05\13\story_13-5-2006_pg4_28 |work= |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2010-02-02 }}</ref> Kabul musician [[Soosan Firooz]] has been described as Afghanistan's first female rapper.<ref name="Yousafzai">{{cite news|last=Yousafzai|first=Sami|last2=Moreau|first2=Ron|title=Susan Feroz: Afghanistan’s First Female Rapper|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2013/01/04/susan-feroz-afghanistan-s-first-female-rapper.html|newspaper=Newsweek|date=4 January 2013}}</ref>

The '''Congress of Lushnjë''' ({{Lang-sq|Kongresi i Lushnjës}}) was a conference of Albanian political leaders held from January 28 to January 31, 1920 in [[Lushnjë]], [[Albania]].<ref name="Pearson2004">{{cite book|last=Pearson|first=Owen|title=Albania in the twentieth century: a history|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3_Sh3y9IMZAC&pg=PA138|accessdate=24 December 2011|year=2004|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-013-0|page=138}}</ref> 

Its objective was to deal with the issues arising from the military control of the country by mainly Italian and secondarily French troops and its political leadership by the pro-Italian [[Durrës]]-based government. Held in the residence of Kaso Fuga it was attended by 56 delegates from Albania, adjacent Albanian-inhabited territories and representatives of Albanian emigrant colonies.

[[Aqif Elbasani]] was elected president of the congress and [[Ferit Vokopola]] secretary. The congress declared the Durrës government invalid and formed a new cabinet under  [[Sulejman Delvina]]. The new government consisted of the High Council ({{lang-sq|Këshilli i Lartë}}) the National Council ({{lang-sq|Këshilli Kombëtar}}). The last decision of the congress was the designation of [[Tiranë]] as the new capital of Albania. The congress's decisions would eventually lead a few months later to the [[Vlora War]] and as a result to the total withdrawal of the Italian army from Albania and the final affirmation of the country's territorial integrity in 1921. The building where it was held became a [[Congress of Lushnjë Museum|museum]] in 1970.

The Congress was also concerned with the [[Congress of Durrës#Government of Durrës|Government of Durrës]] that had the backing of the invading [[Italy|Italian]] army. It was alleged that [[Abdyl Ypi]], the initiator of the Congress, had been assassinated by members of the Government of Durrës, who wanted to scare off the other delegates to the Congress. During its first session, the Congress decided unanimously on the downing of the Government of Durrës and the organization of armed against the Italian forces that were in control of part of southern Albania. The High Council was made up of [[Luigj Bumçi]], [[Aqif Pashë Elbasani]], [[Abdi Toptani]], and [[Mihal Turtulli]] who would perform the function of the leaders of the new Albanian state, whereas the National Council would function as the Parliament.

'''Liu Chih''' ([[Chinese character|Chinese]]: ??; [[pinyin]]: Liu Zhi; 1892–1971) was a prominent [[Kuomintang]] military and political leader in the [[Republic of China]].

==Biography==
Liu was born into a peasant family in Jiangxi province in 1892. His parents died when he was young and he was raised by his grandfather. He was educated in a local school before travelling to Japan to receive advanced education. When the Japanese government started to expel Chinese students on behalf of the Manchurian imperial government, he return to China and enrolled in military academies in [[Wuhan]]. In 1914 he entered the [[Baoding Military Academy]] and after services in numerous regional armies, Liu joined the faculty of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] in 1924 and became a field commander during the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]]. He became friends with many important allies of Generallissimo [[Chiang Kai Shek]] and they proved to be extremely helpful to his rise in the KMT government.

==Rise and fall in the KMT government==
He was instrumental in defeating Chiang's rival warlords in the [[Central Plains War]] and expanding KMT military power throughout the 1930s by defeating Chinese Communist forces in [[Henan]] Province. Chiang Kai Shek rewarded him by appointing as governor of [[Hennan]] Province and named a county after him. When the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out, Liu was named as deputy commander of the first war zone and commander-in-chief of the [[2nd Army Group]]. By this time he seemed to gradually lost his military prowess when the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] easily overwhelmed his forces and breakthrough the Chinese defensive lines despite being greatly outnumbered. Liu was forced to abandon much of [[Hebei]] province in North China and this defeat contributed to the [[1938 Yellow River flood]] and he was relieved from his posts by Chiang. When the nationalist government retreated to [[Chongqing|Chongking]], Chiang again named him as commander of the city's air defense, when  but the Japanese air force started the [[Bombing of Chongqing|bombing of Chongking]], Liu proved to ineffective to provide much leadership to stop the Japanese terror raids and raise civilian morale, plus dismissed in 1942. In 1942 he succeeded General [[Li Zongren]] as commander-in-chief of the fifth war zone. When War with Japan was over, he was named as pacification director of [[Zhengzhou]] garrison, controlling first and fifth war zones. When the [[Campaign of the North China Plain Pocket]] broke out in the summer of 1946, he failed to destroyed the communist forces under Marshal [[Liu Bocheng]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]] and was relieved of his command once more. In the fall of 1948, He became the commander-in-chief of the [[Suppression General Headquarter of Xuzhou Garrison]], controlled some 800,000 nationalist soldiers, but when his capable deputy commander-in-chief [[Du Yuming]] was recalled to [[Manchuria]] to salvage the nationalist positions there when Marshal [[Lin Biao]] launched the [[Liaoshen Campaign]] on September 12, 1948. He went into a panic and did not organized an effective defensive line around his command sector when communist commander [[Su Yu]] attacked Xuzhou in the [[Huaihai Campaign]]. Although President [[Chiang Kai Shek]] again dispatched Lieutenant General [[Du Yuming]] to save the situation, but Liu's ineffective leadership and timidness has already doomed KMT position in Central China. When the communist forces finally defeated the nationalist troops the next year and deputy commander-in-chief [[Du Yuming]] was captured, Liu was again fired by Chiang Kai Shek, who was lucky enough to escape Xuzhou via plane.

==Taiwan==
Liu first fled to [[Hong Kong]] then made a living in [[Indonesia]] as a Chinese language teacher, in 1953 he was allowed to return to [[Taiwan]] as a political advisor to Chiang Kai Shek. He was decorated with the [[Order of Blue Sky and White Sun]], he died in Taiwan in 1972.

==Evaluation==
General Liu Zhi's early military career was full of victories and successes, but he seemed to lose his combat skills after the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], many of his colleagues called him '''The Long-legged general''' or President Chiang's '''Lucky General''', to poke fun of his uselessness on battlefield and shamelessness when many other talented officers were not promoted for heroic deeds and he was brazenly enough to accept such high positions. Even the first lady [[Soong May-ling]] said to President [[Chiang Kai Shek]]:" There are many people spoke negatively about General Liu Zhi, Are You still going to use him?" Chiang replied calmly:" Liu is a mess on battlefield, but he is more obedient than all my commanders."

'''Vestigiality''' refers to genetically determined structures or attributes that have apparently lost most or all of their ancestral function in a given species, but have been retained through [[evolution]].<ref name="DelahousseMeganck2009">{{cite book|author1=Bernard Delahousse|author2=Martin Meganck|title=Engineering in Context|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MUz3qg3uB0UC&pg=PA270|year=2009|publisher=Academica|isbn=978-87-7675-700-7|pages=270}}</ref> Assessment of the vestigiality must generally rely on comparison with [[homology (biology)|homologous]] features in related species. The emergence of vestigiality occurs by normal evolutionary processes, typically by loss of function of a feature that is no longer subject to [[Directional selection|positive]] [[Evolutionary pressure|selection pressures]] when it loses its value in a changing environment. More urgently the feature may be [[Negative selection (natural selection)|selected against]] when its function becomes definitely harmful. Typical examples of both types occur in the loss of flying capability in [[Island ecology|island-dwelling]] species.

==Overview==
Vestigial features may take various forms; for example they may be patterns of behavior, anatomical structures, or biochemical processes. Like most other physical features, however functional, vestigial features in a given species may successively appear, develop, and persist or disappear at various stages within the [[Ontogeny|life cycle]] of the organism, ranging from early [[Ontogeny|embryonic development]] to late adulthood.

The term ''vestigiality'' is useful in referring to many genetically determined features, either morphological, behavioral, or physiological; in any such context however, it need not follow that a vestigial feature must be completely useless. A classic example at the level of gross anatomy is the human [[vermiform appendix]] &mdash; though vestigial in the sense of retaining no significant ''digestive'' function, the appendix still has immunological roles and is useful in maintaining gut flora.

Similar concepts apply at the molecular level &mdash; some [[nucleic acid]] sequences in [[eukaryotic]] [[genomes]] have no known biological function; some of them may be [[Junk DNA|"junk DNA"]], but it is a difficult matter to demonstrate that a particular sequence in a particular region of a given genome is truly nonfunctional. The simple fact that it is [[noncoding DNA]] does not establish that it is functionless. Furthermore, even if an extant DNA sequence is functionless, it does not follow that it has descended from an ancestral sequence of functional DNA. Logically such DNA would not be vestigial in the sense of being the vestige of a functional structure. In contrast [[pseudogenes]] have lost their protein-coding ability or are otherwise no longer expressed in the cell. Whether they have any extant function or not, they have lost their former function and in that sense they do fit the definition of vestigiality.

'''Vestigial structures''' are often called ''vestigial organs'', although many of them are not actually [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. Such vestigial structures typically are degenerate, atrophied, or rudimentary,<ref>Lawrence, Eleanor (2005) ''Henderson's Dictionary of Biology''. Pearson, Prentice Hall. ISBN 0-13-127384-1</ref> and tend to be much more [[genetic variation|variable]] than homologous non-vestigial parts. Although structures commonly regarded "vestigial" may have lost some or all of the functional roles that they had played in ancestral organisms, such structures may retain lesser functions or may have become adapted to new roles in extant populations.<ref name=Muller>Muller, G. B. (2002) "Vestigial Organs and Structures." in Encyclopedia of Evolution. Mark Pagel, editor in chief, New York: Oxford University Press. pp 1131-1133</ref>

It is important to avoid confusion of the concept of vestigiality with that of [[exaptation]]. Both may occur together in the same example, depending on the relevant point of view. In exaptation a structure originally used for one purpose is modified for a new one.  For example, the wings of [[penguin]]s would be exaptational in the sense of serving a substantial new purpose (underwater locomotion), but might still be regarded as vestigial in the sense of having lost the function of flight. In contrast Darwin argued that the wings of [[emu]]s would be definitely vestigial, as they appear to have no major extant function; however, function is a matter of degree, so judgements on what is a "major" function are arbitrary; the emu does seem to use its wings as organs of balance in running. Similarly, the [[ostrich]] uses its wings in displays and temperature control, though they are undoubtedly vestigial as structures for flight.

Vestigial characters range from detrimental through neutral to favorable in terms of selection. Some may be of some limited utility to an organism but still degenerate over time if they do not confer a significant enough advantage in terms of [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] to avoid the effects of [[genetic drift]] or competing [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressures]].  Vestigiality in its various forms presents many examples of [[Evidence of common descent|evidence for biological evolution]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==History==
[[Image:Blindmaus-drawing.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[blind mole rat]] (''Spalax typhlus'') has tiny eyes completely covered by a layer of skin.]]
Vestigial structures have been noticed since ancient times, and the reason for their existence was long speculated upon before [[Darwinian evolution]] provided a widely accepted explanation.  In the 4th century BC, [[Aristotle]] was one of the earliest writers to comment, in his ''[[History of Animals]]'', on the vestigial eyes of moles, calling them "stunted in development".<ref>[[Aristotle]].[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/a8ha/ "History of Animals" (Book 1, Chapter 9)]</ref> However, only in recent centuries have anatomical vestiges become a subject of serious study. In 1798, [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] noted on vestigial structures:

{{cquote|Whereas useless in this circumstance, these rudiments... have not been eliminated, because [[Natura non facit saltus|Nature never works by rapid jumps]], and She always leaves vestiges of an organ, even though it is completely superfluous, if that organ plays an important role in the other species of the same family.<ref>[[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|St. Hilaire, Geoffroy]] (1798). "Observations sur l'aile de l'Autruche, par le citoyen Geoffroy", ''La Decade Egyptienne, Journal Litteraire et D'Economie Politique'' 1 (pp. 46–51).</ref>}}

His colleague, [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], named a number of vestigial structures in his 1809 book ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]''. Lamarck noted "[[Guillaume-Antoine Olivier|Olivier]]'s ''[[blind mole rat|Spalax]]'', which lives underground like the mole, and is apparently exposed to daylight even less than the mole, has altogether lost the use of sight: so that it shows nothing more than vestiges of this organ."<ref>[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck, Jean-Baptiste]] (1809). ''[[Philosophie Zoologique|Philosophie zoologique]] ou exposition des considérations relatives à l'histoire naturelle des animaux''.</ref>

[[Charles Darwin]] was familiar with the concept of vestigial structures, though the term for them did not yet exist. He listed a number of them in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'', including the [[Intrinsic muscles of external ear|muscles of the ear]], [[wisdom teeth]], the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]], the [[tail bone]], [[body hair]], and the [[Nictitating membrane|semilunar fold]] in the corner of the [[human eye|eye]]. Darwin also noted, in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', that a vestigial structure could be useless for its primary function, but still retain secondary anatomical roles: "An organ serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or utterly aborted for one, even the more important purpose, and remain perfectly efficient for the other.... [A]n organ may become rudimentary for its proper purpose, and be used for a distinct object."<ref name=Darwin>[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection]]''. John Murray: London.</ref>

In the first edition of ''On the Origin of Species'', Darwin briefly mentioned [[inheritance of acquired characters]] under the heading "''Effects of Use and Disuse''", expressing little doubt that use "strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited".<ref>Darwin, 1859, pp. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=152 134–139].<!--also mentioned on pages 143, 161, 168, 447 and 490--> Barrett P. H. et al. 1981, ''A concordance to Darwin's Origin of Species first edition'', Cornaell, Ithaca and London, lists only four mentions of the phrase "use and disuse".</ref> In later editions he expanded his thoughts on this,<ref>[[Adrian Desmond|Desmond A.]] & [[James Moore (biographer)|Moore, J.]] (1991) ''Darwin'' Penguin Books p.617 "Darwin was {{sic|?|loathe|reason="loath" would be correct here}} to let go of the notion that a well-used and strengthened organ could be inherited"</ref> and in the final chapter of the 6th edition concluded that species have been modified "chiefly through the natural selection of numerous successive, slight, favourable variations; aided in an important manner by the inherited effects of the use and disuse of parts".<ref>Darwin (1872) ''[[On the Origin of Species|The Origin of Species]]'', 6th Edn., p. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F391&pageseq=449 421]</ref>

In 1893, [[Robert Wiedersheim]] published a list of 86 human organs that were, in his words, "formerly of greater physiological significance than at present". Theorizing that they were vestiges of evolution, he called them "vestigial".<ref>[[Robert Wiedersheim|Wiedersheim, Robert]] (1893). ''The Structure of Man: an index to his past history.''

Later versions of Wiedersheim's list were expanded to as many as 180 human "vestigial organs". This is why the zoologist Horatio Newman said in a written statement read into evidence in the [[Scopes Trial]] that "There are, according to Wiedersheim, no less than 180 vestigial structures in the human body, sufficient to make of a man a veritable walking museum of antiquities."<ref>Darrow, Clarence and William J.

==Common descent and evolutionary theory==
{{Further2|[[Evidence of common descent]]}}

Vestigial structures are often [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to structures that are functioning normally in other species. Therefore, vestigial structures can be considered evidence for [[evolution]], the process by which beneficial heritable traits arise in populations over an extended period of time. The existence of vestigial traits can be attributed to changes in the environment and behavior patterns of the organism in question. As the function of the trait is no longer beneficial for survival, the likelihood that future offspring will inherit the "normal" form of it decreases. In some cases the structure becomes detrimental to the organism (for example the eyes of a mole can become infected<ref name=Darwin />). In many cases the structure is of no direct harm, yet all structures require extra [[energy]] in terms of development, maintenance, and weight, and are also a risk in terms of disease (e.g., [[infection]], [[cancer]]), providing some [[natural selection|selective]] pressure for the removal of parts that do not contribute to an organism's fitness. A structure that is not harmful will take longer to be 'phased out' than one that is.  However, some vestigial structures may persist due to limitations in development, such that complete loss of the structure could not occur without major alterations of the organism's developmental pattern, and such alterations would likely produce numerous negative side-effects. The toes of many animals such as [[horse]]s, which stand on a single [[toe]], are still evident in a vestigial form and may become evident, although rarely, from time to time in individuals.

The vestigial versions of the structure can be compared to the original version of the structure in other species in order to determine the homology of a vestigial structure. Homologous structures indicate [[common descent|common ancestry]] with those organisms that have a functional version of the structure.<ref>{{cite web

Vestigial traits can still be considered [[adaptation]]s. This is because an adaptation is often defined as a trait that has been favored by natural selection. Adaptations, therefore, need not be ''adaptive'', as long as they were at some point.<ref>{{cite book

==Examples==

===Animals===
[[Image:Whale skeleton.png|350px|thumb|Letter ''c'' in the picture indicates the undeveloped hind legs of a [[baleen whale]].]]
Vestigial characters are present throughout the [[animal]] kingdom, and an almost endless list could be given. Darwin said that "it would be impossible to name one of the higher animals in which some part or other is not in a rudimentary condition."<ref name=Darwin /The whale's pelvis has been speculated as vestigial. This is false. The pelvis is a backup and a helper for reproduction and whales would not be able to reproduce without it. Evolutionists try to use the "vestigial" pelvis as support for evolution, but as shown, it is needed and is very vital in the life of a whale. 


The wings of [[ostrich]]es, [[emu]]s, and other [[flightless bird]]s are vestigial; they are remnants of their flying ancestors' wings.

The eyes of certain [[cavefish]] and [[salamander]]s are vestigial, as they no longer allow the organism to see, and are remnants of their ancestors' functional eyes.

[[Boidae|Boas]] and [[Pythonidae|pythons]] have vestigial pelvis remnants, which are externally visible as two small [[pelvic spur]]s on each side of the cloaca. These spurs are sometimes used in copulation, but are not essential, as no colubroid snake (the vast majority of species) possesses these remnants. Furthermore, in most snakes the left lung is greatly reduced or absent. [[Amphisbaenia]]ns, which independently evolved limblessness, also retain vestiges of the pelvis as well as the pectoral girdle, and have lost their right lung.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Accessory [[sclerite]]s (black) are present in normal clamps but absent in simplified clamps. ''[[Lethacotyle]]'' (right) has no clamp at all.]]
A case of vestigial organs was described in [[polyopisthocotylea]]n [[Monogenea]]ns ([[parasite|parasitic]] [[flatworm]]s). These parasites usually have a posterior attachment organ with several [[clamp (zoology)|clamps]], which are sclerotised organs attaching the worm to the gill of the [[host (biology)|host]] fish. These clamps are extremely important for the survival of the parasite. In the family [[Protomicrocotylidae]], species have either normal clamps, simplified clamps, or no clamps at all (in the genus ''[[Lethacotyle]]''). After a comparative study of the relative surface of clamps in more than 100 [[Monogenea]]ns, this has been interpreted as an evolutionary sequence leading to the loss of clamps. Coincidentally, other attachment structures (lateral flaps, transverse striations) have evolved in protomicrocotylids. Therefore, [[clamp (zoology)|clamps]] in [[Protomicrocotylidae|protomicrocotylids]] were considered vestigial organs.<ref>{{Cite journal| author =  Justine J-L, Rahmouni C, Gey D, Schoelinck C, Hoberg EP| title = The Monogenean which lost its clamps| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0079155| journal = PLOS ONE| year = 2013| pmid = 24278118 | pmc = 3838368| volume=8| issue=11| pages=e79155}}</ref>

In the foregoing examples the vestigiality is generally the (sometimes incidental) result of [[Adaptation|adaptive evolution]]. However, there are many examples of vestigiality as the product of drastic [[mutation]], and such vestigiality is usually harmful or counter-adaptive. One of the earliest documented examples was that of vestigial wings in ''[[Drosophila]]''.<ref>Morgan, Thomas Hunt and Bridges, Calvin B. Sex-linked Inheritance in Drosophila. Carnegie Institution of Washington, publication 237, 1916. [http://archive.org/details/sexlinkedinherit34368gut]</ref>  Many examples in many other contexts have emerged since.<ref name= "SnustadPOG">Snustad, D. Peter. & Simmons, Michael J.

===Humans===
{{Main|Human vestigiality}}
[[Image:Gray906.png|225px|thumb|The muscles connected to the ears of a human do not develop enough to have the same mobility allowed to many animals.]]
Human vestigiality is related to [[human evolution]], and includes a variety of characters occurring in the [[human]] species. Many examples of these are vestigial in other [[primate]]s and related animals, whereas other examples are still highly developed. The human [[caecum]] is vestigial, as often is the case in [[omnivore]]s, being reduced to a single chamber receiving the content of the [[ileum]] into the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]. The ancestral caecum would have been a large, blind diverticulum in which resistant plant material such as [[cellulose]] would have been fermented in preparation for absorption in the colon.<ref name=Descent>[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1871).

There are also vestigial molecular structures in humans, which are no longer in use but may indicate common ancestry with other species. One example of this is a gene that is functional in most other mammals and which produces [[L-gulonolactone oxidase]], an [[enzyme]] that can make [[vitamin C]]. A documented mutation deactivated the gene in an ancestor of the modern infraorder of [[Simian|monkeys and apes]], and it now remains in their [[genome]]s, including the [[human genome]], as a vestigial sequence called a [[pseudogene]].<ref>{{cite journal

'''Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle upon Tyne and 1st Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne''', [[Order of the Garter|KG]], [[Privy Council of Great Britain|PC]] (21 July 1693 – 17 November 1768) was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[British Whig Party|Whig]] [[Politician|statesman]], whose official life extended throughout the Whig supremacy of the 18th century. He is commonly known as the '''[[Duke of Newcastle]]'''.

A protégé of Sir [[Robert Walpole]], he served under him for more than twenty years, until 1742. He held power with his brother, [[Henry Pelham]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister of Great Britain]]), until 1754. He had at this point served as a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] continuously for thirty years—dominating British foreign policy.

After Henry's death the Duke held his late brother's position for six years, in two separate periods. While his first premiership was not particularly notable, Newcastle precipitated the [[Seven Years' War]], which would cause his resignation from his high position.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}After his second term as Prime Minister, he served for a short while in [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]]'s ministry, before retiring from government.

Historian Harry Dickinson says that he became:
: notorious for his fussiness and fretfulness, his petty jealousies, his reluctance to accept responsibility for his actions, and his inability to pursue any political objective to his own satisfaction or to the nations profit.... Many modern historians have depicted him as the epitome of unredeemed mediocrity and as a veritable buffoon in office.<ref> Harry T.

==Early life==

[[Image:NewcastleHouseJohnBowles1754.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Newcastle House]] which he inherited from his uncle in 1711, and used as his primary London residence, often throwing lavish parties there.]]

Thomas Pelham was born in London on 21 July 1693<ref>Browning p.1</ref> the eldest son of  [[Thomas Pelham, 1st Baron Pelham]], by his second wife, the former Lady Grace Holles, younger sister of the [[John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne]]. He studied at [[Westminster School]] and was admitted a fellow-commoner at [[Clare College, Cambridge]] in 1710.<ref>{{acad|id=PLHN709T|name=Pelham, Thomas}}</ref> Pelham's uncle died in 1711, and his father the next year, both leaving their large estates to their nephew and son. When he came of age in 1714, Lord Pelham was one of the greatest landowners in the kingdom, enjoying enormous patronage in the county of [[Sussex]]. One stipulation of his uncle's will was that his nephew add Holles to his name, which he faithfully did, thereafter styling himself as Thomas Pelham-Holles.<ref>Browning p.2–3</ref> A long-standing legal dispute over the estate with his Aunt was finally settled in 1714.

He increasingly identified with [[Whig (British political faction)|Whig]] politics, like his father and uncle - but whereas they had been moderate in their views, he grew increasingly more partisan and militant in his views.<ref>Browning p.6–10</ref> Britain at the time was very divided between Whigs who favoured the succession of [[George I of Great Britain|George of Hanover]] after [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]'s death and [[Tories]] who supported the return of the Jacobite [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]], known later as the 'old pretender'. This issue dominated British politics during the last few years of Queen Anne's reign, leading up to her death in 1714 - and had a profound impact on the future career of the young Duke of Newcastle. He joined the [[Hannover Club]] and the [[Kit Kat Club]], both leading centres of Whig thinking and organisation. [[Newcastle House]] in London became his premier residence.  
==Early political career==
[[Image:Robert Walpole prime minister of Britain.jpg|140px|thumb|From 1720 Newcastle allied himself with Sir [[Robert Walpole]]. They would be political partners for the next twenty years, and Newcastle would remain a loyalist until Walpole's fall in 1742.]]Newcastle vigorously sustained the Whigs at [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne's]] death, and had much influence in making the Londoners accept [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]], even organising so-called 'Newcastle mobs' to fight with rival [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] in the street.<ref>Browning p.10</ref>

His services were too great to be neglected by the new Hanoverian King, and in 1714 he was created '''Earl of Clare''', and in 1715 '''Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne''' two titles previously held by his late uncle John Holles.<ref name=browningondb>Browning. ODNB online Ed</ref> He also became [[Lord-Lieutenant]] of the Counties of [[Middlesex]] and [[Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire|Nottingham]] and a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]]. In his new position he was in charge of suppressing Jacobitism in the counties under his control. In Middlesex he arrested and questioned eight hundred people, and then drew up a Voluntary Defence Association to defend the county. During 1715 he became involved in a riot that ended with two men being killed, and Newcastle fleeing along rooftops.<ref>Browning p.9–10</ref> The succession of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] was secured in late 1715 by the defeat of a Jacobite army at the [[Battle of Preston (1715)|Battle of Preston]] and the subsequent flight of the [[Old Pretender]].<ref>Browning p.10–11</ref>

The victory of the Hanoverians over the Jacobites marked the beginning of the [[Whig Ascendancy]] which lasted for much of the 18th century. Because the Tory opposition had been tainted, in the eyes of George I, by their support of the Jacobite pretenders, he did not trust them, and drew all his ministers and officials from the Whig faction. Following their victory, the Whigs split with one group forming the government for George I, while the other dissident Whigs became the effective opposition in Parliament. After a period of political manoeuvring, during which time he was for a while associated with a Whig faction led by [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|James Stanhope]], from 1720 Newcastle began to identify strongly with the Government Whigs, who had quickly come to be dominated by Sir [[Robert Walpole]].<ref>Browning p.23–25</ref>

Walpole gladly welcomed the young Newcastle into his coterie, firstly because he believed he could easily control him, and secondly because it would strengthen his hand against the rival Whig factions.<ref>Browning p.25</ref> Newcastle joined with Walpole because he, correctly, believed that he was going to dominate British politics for a generation. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}} From 1721 Walpole began to serve as Britain's first official [[Prime Minister]], a position he would hold for the next 21 years. He was related to Walpole's leading ally [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]], strengthening his bond with the leader of the new administration.

On 2 April 1717 he increased his Whig connections by marrying [[Henrietta Pelham-Holles, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Lady Henrietta Godolphin]] the granddaughter of the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]], a national hero following his victories in the recent [[War of the Spanish Succession|European war]] and considered a Whig icon.<ref>Browning p.12–13</ref>

==Lord Chamberlain==

[[Image:NewcastleLincoln.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Newcastle (left) and [[w:Henry Clinton, 7th Earl of Lincoln|Henry Clinton, 7th Earl of Lincoln]] as painted by [[Godfrey Kneller]], ca. 1721.]]

In 1717, at the age of twenty three, Newcastle first attained high political office as [[Lord Chamberlain]] of the Household, and was given the responsibility of overseeing theatres.<ref>Browning p.14</ref> Plays at the time were often extremely political, and Newcastle was tasked with suppressing any plays or playwrights believed to be too critical of the Hanoverian succession or the Whig government. During this time Newcastle clashed repeatedly with [[Sir Richard Steele]], a leading playwright.<ref>Field p.350–352</ref> In 1719 he was one of the three main investors in [[George Frideric Handel]]'s new opera company, the [[Royal Academy of Music (1719)]]. The Duke ordered Handel in May 1719 to go to the continent and contract singers for as long as possible.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

He held the post for seven years, and performed well enough to be considered for further promotion. Despite his youth, he had demonstrated his strength in several [[general elections]] when he had been able to get as many as twenty MPs elected to seats he controlled through his family's wealth and political patronage. He survived in the office during the turmoil in the Whig party between 1717 and 1721 and his switch of allegiance to Walpole secured his position thereafter. Walpole had overseen a brief end to the rift between the Whig factions, following the collapse of the [[South Sea Company]], which had left thousands ruined. Newcastle himself had lost £4,000 he had invested when the [[South Sea Bubble]] was at its height.<ref>Browning p.23</ref> Following this, Walpole was seen as the only man to steady both the country and the Whig Party, and was granted unprecedented powers, effectively making him the first [[Prime Minister of Great Britain]].

During his time in the office, Newcastle and his wife had become famous for throwing lavish parties, which were attended by much of London society including many of his political opponents. He was also prodigiously fond of [[fox hunting|hunting]] and often went down to [[Bishopstone, East Sussex|Bishopstone]], one of his Sussex properties, expressly for this purpose.<ref>Browning p.5</ref> During his time as Lord Chamberlain he oversaw a major overhaul of public buildings, many of which had fallen into very poor repair.<ref>Browning p.14–15</ref>

==Secretary of State==

===Appointment===
In 1724 Newcastle was chosen by [[Robert Walpole|Sir Robert Walpole]] to be [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department]] in place of [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Carteret]], a move largely engineered by Townshend. He had been for some time considered the third most important man in the government behind Walpole and Townshend, and his new position confirmed this. Newcastle had for several years been growing increasingly interested in Foreign Affairs, and had been educating himself on the subtle ins-and-outs of [[diplomacy]] and the [[European State System]]. In spite of this, for the first few years in this office he deferred control of British foreign policy to the other Secretary of State, Townshend, and effectively served as his deputy. Walpole too was generally happy to allow Townshend to control foreign affairs, as he agreed with him on most issues.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===The French Alliance===
{{Main|Anglo-French Alliance (1716–31)}}
Since the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] which had ended the [[War of the Spanish Succession|last major European war]], Britain had been an ally of France - a strong reversal in policy, as France had previously been considered the premier enemy of Britain.<ref>Rodger ''Command of the Ocean'' p.227</ref> The reasons for the alliance were complex, and many had doubted the détente could last long, but by the time Newcastle became Secretary of State they had been allies for nearly a decade. By 1719 they had become part of a wider Quadruple Alliance, which was overwhelmingly the most powerful force in European politics. This had been demonstrated during the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]], a largely naval war in the Mediterranean by which the powers had defeated a Spanish attempt to reclaim lost territory in Italy.<ref>Simms p.138</ref> The alliance was unpopular, however, with many in parliament and in the country who continued to consider France Britain's natural enemy.

[[Image:1stDukeOfNewcastleYoung.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Newcastle in 1735 when he was [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department|Southern Secretary]] in the [[Walpole Government]]]]

Newcastle had been joined in government by his young brother [[Henry Pelham]]. The two brothers got on well, although they were prone to have intractable disputes. One constant source of tension between them was Newcastle's poor handling of the family fortune, which was being constantly depleted through his out of control spending. Pelham was also considered by many to be the abler of the two brothers, but it was the Duke who had got initially further in politics. In spite of their differences, they remained firm political allies.

===Domestic crisis===
The Administration faced a crisis in 1727 when [[George I of Britain|George I]] died unexpectedly and his son [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] succeeded to the throne.<ref>Browning p.51</ref> The new King had previously had exceptionally bad relations with Walpole and Newcastle and during one altercation between them George's poor English had made Newcastle think he had challenged him to a duel.<ref>Simms p.126</ref> Their relationship had not improved in recent years, and many anticipated the imminent replacement of the government. Instead Walpole made himself extremely useful to George II, who soon became convinced of his competence and retained him in his post. The thawing of relations was helped by the friendship between Newcastle and George's daughter [[Princess Amelia of Great Britain|Amelia]] leading many to speculate, without substantive evidence, that they were having an affair.<ref>Browning p.62–63</ref> By November 1727 Walpole and Newcastle's positions were both safe once more, boosted by an election victory which saw them gain 430 seats to the opposition's 128 in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]].<ref>Browning p.53</ref>

In 1729 a rift broke out in the government over the direction of Britain's foreign policy. Townshend was convinced that Britain's principal enemy was now [[Imperial Austria|Austria]].<ref>Browning p.49–50</ref> Walpole and Newcastle saw Spain as the main threat to British power, because of their large navy and colonial interests. Eventually Walpole had his way, forcing Townshend from office, and replacing him with [[William Stanhope, 1st Earl of Harrington|Lord Harrington]]. From then on Newcastle served as the senior Secretary of State, and largely controlled British foreign policy himself. Newcastle was saddened by the demise of his relative and former patron, although their partnership had become increasingly strained and the new situation offered enormous possibilities to him personally.<ref>Simms p.219</ref>

===Peace policy===
Together Newcastle and Walpole managed to drive a wedge between Spain and Austria, making an ally of the latter, and directing their future efforts against Spain. Subsequently, however, it turned out that Britain's long-term major rival was neither of the two but France, which had been considered a close ally up to that point. The increasingly confrontational actions of the French Prime Minister [[Cardinal Fleury]] soon convinced them that they had been wrong.<ref>Simms p.216–17</ref> This misjudgment was later used by the [[Patriot Whigs]] to castigate the Ministry for their lack of preparation against the French threat.

[[Image:KING GEORGE II.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] who reigned from 1727 to 1760. Despite their initial violent hatred of each other, he and Newcastle grew to have a very productive relationship which lasted for over three decades.]]

In general, Newcastle shared Walpole's abhorrence of war, and wished to prevent Britain getting dragged into major wars on the continent. Notably Britain did not become embroiled in the [[War of the Polish Succession]], and indeed tried to prevent it from breaking out. Newcastle attempted to throw both the French and Austrians off-guard by being cagey about Britain's response should any war break out, but this did not stop the conflict.<ref>Browning p.66–67</ref> Once the war had started, George II tried to push for Britain to honour its commitment to assist Austria, but he was blocked by Walpole who insisted Britain should not join the war. Newcastle broadly supported the same position as the King, but he accepted the decision.<ref>Browning p.67–68</ref>

By this stage Newcastle's brother [[Henry Pelham]] had attained the lucrative position of [[Paymaster General]], and had effectively replaced Townshend as the third man of the government. The three men continued what had become dubbed as the [[Norfolk Congress]] by meeting regularly at [[Houghton Hall]], Sir Robert Walpole's [[country house]] in [[Norfolk]]. The three men would hold private meetings, draw up wide-ranging policies on foreign and domestic issues, and then present them to parliament for their seal of approval, which their vast majority allowed them to do. Slowly, however, Newcastle and his brother were moving out of the shadow of Walpole, and being more assertive. Newcastle was particularly annoyed by what he saw as the abandonment of Austria, and by the suggestion that Walpole no longer trusted him.<ref>Browning p.73–76</ref>

By 1735 Newcastle had largely assumed control of colonial affairs, further increasing the amount of patronage he controlled. A devout [[Anglican]], he was also given control over [[ecclesiastical]] matters. His growing independence from Walpole, was helped by the support of his brother and his best friend, [[Baron Hardwicke|Hardwicke]], who had become Lord Chancellor.<ref>Browning p.78–82</ref> During the latter half of the decade his job was increasingly dominated by managing relations with Spain, which included trade disputes and objections to the controversial founding of the British colony of [[Georgia (colony)|Georgia]] in 1733. Because of this the long-standing peace policy was beginning to look extremely fragile. He also acted as a mediator in the [[War of the Polish Succession]], helping to bring the conflict to an end in 1738.

===Jenkins' Ear and Spanish America===
{{Main|War of Jenkins' Ear}}
The growing tension between Britain and Spain came to a head in 1731 during an incident known as [[Robert Jenkins (master mariner)|Jenkins' Ear]], when a British merchant captain was captured for illegal trading off the coast of [[Cuba]] by a Spanish privateer, and in punishment for his alleged breach of the strict laws forbidding foreign commerce with Spanish colonies, he had an ear cut off.<ref>Rodger. ''Command of the Ocean''. p.235</ref> The incident shocked Britain, not so much because of its brutality, but because many saw it as an outrage that Spain should have the temerity to harm a British subject simply for trading—which many held to be a legitimate occupation.<ref>Simms p.248</ref>

In 1738 Jenkins appeared in parliament to testify about his treatment. Other merchants sent petitions, and the powerful [[South Sea Company]] mobilised popular opinion. To many the [[Spanish Empire]] was crumbling, and its South American possessions were ripe for the picking. A vociferous group in parliament demanded war with Spain. Walpole was adamantly opposed to such a policy, and became a target for unprecedented attacks.<ref>Simms p.247–252</ref> Newcastle too came under intense pressure, though he initially considered the demands that Britain declare war with Spain a dangerous step and in spite of his increasingly bellicose statements, he still considered the idea of an Anglo-Spanish alliance as late as 1739. He tried to negotiate a solution to the crisis with the [[Convention of Pardo]], which agreed a sum of compensation to be paid to British merchants<ref>Browning p.95</ref> but British public opinion had shifted and Walpole felt that there was no option but to declare war in December 1739.
[[Image:Henry Pelham.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Newcastle enjoyed a close but at times strained relationship with his brother [[Henry Pelham]]. The two men formed a formidable political partnership following the fall of Walpole, and together dominated British politics until Henry's death in 1754.]]
The British opened the war with a victory, capturing [[Battle of Porto Bello|Porto Bello]] in [[Panama]]. This led to an outbreak of patriotic fervour, and further increased the pressure on Walpole and Newcastle for their perceived unwilling prosecution of the war.<ref>Rodger ''Command of the Ocean'' p.236–37</ref> Newcastle tried to combat this by cultivating a reputation as the leading "patriot" of the cabinet. He took on additional military responsibilities and, for the first two years of war, served as a ''de facto'' Minister of War.<ref>Browning p.94–97</ref> One of his most notable suggestions during the period was the recruitment of large numbers of troops drawn from the [[British America|American colonies]], whose growing manpower had previously gone largely untapped.

In 1741 the main British campaign against Spain was a combined amphibious attack on the South American city of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], which had experienced considerable delays. Command was awarded to [[Admiral Edward Vernon]], the victor of Porto Bello, who was given a force of 31,000 soldiers and sailors to take the city. [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|The siege]] proved to be a total disaster for the British, who lost thousands of men before being forced to withdraw. Although Newcastle had issued the orders, and had overseen the organisation of the expedition, much of the blame for the disaster fell on the shoulders of the ailing Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole.

===Fall of Walpole===
In the wake of the Cartagena disaster, Britain held a general election. The result reduced Walpole's former dominance of the House to a now unworkable majority. Within months he had been forced out of office, and succeeded by [[Lord Wilmington]]. Though he stayed with Walpole to the end, Newcastle was later accused by many of Walpole's supporters of undermining him.<ref>Simms p.302</ref> [[Horace Walpole]], his son, continued to attack his behaviour for years to come.

Newcastle continued in office after Walpole's fall and became more powerful on his younger brother [[Henry Pelham]] becoming Prime Minister in 1743. Together the two brothers and their supporters known as the 'Old Whigs' made a coalition with the 'New Whigs', previous opponents of the Walpole government. In spite of this there remained a strident opposition, led vocally by men like [[Pitt the Elder|William Pitt]] and [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]].<ref>N.A.M Rodger ''Lord Sandwich'' p.18</ref>

===War of the Austrian Succession===
{{Main|War of the Austrian Succession}}
[[Image:Battle-of-Fontenoy.jpg|thumb|left|140|Newcastle was a strong supporter of [[Hasburg Empire|Austria]], and advocated aid to the country during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. After the war he built his system for retaining peace around the alliance with Austria, only for it to collapse spectacularly in 1756.]]
In 1740 a short while after the declaration of war with Spain, a separate war had broken out simultaneously in Europe, into which the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] soon became submerged. In a dispute over the throne of the [[Austrian Empire]], France and Prussia had invaded Austria, planning to remove [[Empress Maria Theresa]] and replace her with their own claimant. Austria's long-standing alliance with Britain required Britain to declare war. It was also considered by many that a French victory would leave the French too strong in Europe. Because of this, Britain soon found itself dragged into this wider war despite the reluctance of the government.

Initially Britain's involvement was limited to financial subsidies and diplomacy in support of Austria, By 1742 it was apparent that a more substantial commitment would be needed, if the alliance were not to end in defeat. The same year 16,000 British troops were sent to the continent. Newcastle was a staunch [[Austrophile]]<ref>Browning p.102</ref> and strongly supported aid to the Austrians. He had long thought the only way Britain could defeat France was in alliance with Austria, a view sharply at odds with many other leading thinkers of the era, including Walpole and Pitt.

Newcastle's position had briefly been threatened by [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|Carteret]], a royal favourite, but by 1743 he and his brother were firmly in control of British policy—a position that would last until 1756. He now set about drawing up a fresh scheme to enhance British power on the continent. This included an attempt to persuade the [[Dutch Republic]] into the anti-French alliance, and mediating the dispute between Austria and Prussia that led to the [[Treaty of Dresden]] in 1745. He also approved plans for [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|a colonial raid against Louisbourg in 1745]], which was successful. Along with the defeat of a [[Spanish Invasion of Georgia]] in 1742, this strengthened the British position in North America.

===Jacobite Rising===
{{Main|Jacobite Rising}}
In 1745 the Jacobite Rising broke out in Scotland, and had soon spread to [[northern England]]. Newcastle feared both an attack from the north by [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]] who had gathered 5,000 men in [[Derby]] and a French invasion of southern England. In the panic a number of false rumours circulated around London, including news that Newcastle had fled to the continent fearing all was lost. He was forced to show himself to a crowd that had gathered outside [[Newcastle House]], to prove he was still there.<ref>Browning p.132</ref> Nonetheless his position was threatened, if the Jacobites were triumphant his estates would likely have been confiscated and he would have been forced into exile.

Newcastle awoke to the threat posed by the Jacobites, much faster than George II or many of his colleagues who dismissed the rebellion as a farce, and organised a response. By late 1745 he had rallied all the southern militias and regular forces, and the Jacobites withdrew to northern Scotland where they were defeated at [[Battle of Culloden|Culloden]] in 1746.

===Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle===
{{Main|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|}}
On the [[Continental Europe|Continent]] the British continued the war effort, but they were now under pressure from the [[Dutch Republic]] to make peace with the French. The Dutch feared that the French were about launch a devastating onslaught to overrun their country. Newcastle considered that any peace that would be made at that time would be extremely disadvantageous to Britain, and he tried to keep the anti-French coalition strong through constant diplomacy and offers of [[Golden Cavalry of St George|financial subsidies]].

Talks for a peace settlement were convened in the city of [[Breda]] in 1746. Newcastle was instrumental in securing the appointment of [[Lord Sandwich]] as the British representative at the talks, as his views were very close to his own.<ref>Rodger ''The Instatiable Earl'' p.41–42</ref> Sandwich's instructions were principally to delay the talks, until a significant British victory allowed them to negotiate from a position of strength. The [[Congress of Breda]] did not progress well initially, because the participants were not yet fully committed to peace. The Allies continued to do badly, suffering severe defeats at [[Siege of Bergen op Zoom (1747)|Bergen op Zoom]] and [[Battle of Lauffeld|Lauffeld]]. Newcastle's brother, Henry, was now strongly advocating peace, but Newcastle firmly rejected this—still convinced a major Allied victory was imminent.

In 1747 Newcastle was involved in organising a coup to put the [[William IV, Prince of Orange|Prince of Orange]] in power in the Netherlands. Orange was more hard-line and wanted to continue the war with the French. However, he soon had to apply to the British for a massive loan,<ref>Browning p.149</ref> and Newcastle became aware how close the Dutch were to collapsing altogether. He reluctantly turned towards seeking a peace accommodation with France. He berated himself for his "ignorance, obstinacy and credulity" and half expected his misjudgment in putting so much faith in the Dutch to result in his dismissal,<ref>Browning p.150</ref> but both the King and the rest of the cabinet retained their faith in him.

To better oversee the peace settlement, Newcastle switched across to the position of [[Northern Secretary of State|Northern Secretary]]. He secured Sandwich's promotion to [[First Lord of the Admiralty|the Admiralty]] although he had wanted him to succeed him as [[Southern Secretary]].<ref>Rodger ''The Instatiable Earl'' p.58–59</ref> During the summer of 1748 Newcastle made his first ever trip outside Britain when he visited [[Hanover]], and was received with a rapturous reception wherever he went.<ref>Browning p.152–53</ref> When the talks got under way they went far more smoothly and in October 1748 the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] was formally concluded. Britain would give back [[Louisbourg]] to France in exchange for the return of [[Madras]] and a full French withdrawal from the Low Countries. The issue of free trade for which Britain had gone to war with Spain in 1739 was not mentioned at all.<ref>Browning p.154–55</ref>

Newcastle was immediately attacked by his opponents for giving up [[Louisbourg]], but many of them failed to realise just how weak the British position on the Continent had become.<ref>Simms p.351–52</ref> Austria was also deeply unhappy as they felt the British had abandoned them, and hadn't pushed hard enough for [[Silesia]] to be returned to them.<ref>Browning p.</ref> Nonetheless Newcastle was happy with the terms that had been gained, and observers on the continent were full of praise about the way he had overturned so apparently a disadvantageous situation.

===Newcastle's System===

Following the peace, Newcastle began to put in practice a policy he had been developing for a very long time. He believed that the [[stately quadrille]], which had seen states continually shifting alliances, had been unstable and led to repeated wars. He instead wanted to use vigorous diplomacy to create a lasting peace, built around a strong and stable British alliance with [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance|Austria]]. Like many Whigs he saw maintaining the [[European Balance of Power]] as essential. He described this process as 'restoring the [[Old System]]', but it was popularly known as the [[Newcastle System]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

He came under continuous attack from Pitt and the [[Patriot Whigs]] who despised his European policy, pointing to their belief that the previous war had shown that increasingly North America was the most important theatre of war. They mocked Newcastle for his perceived lack of vision, ignoring the complex nature of European politics and Britain's relationship with Hanover and the fact that as early as 1740 Newcastle had been aware of the expanding power of the [[British America|American colonies]].

Newcastle remained extremely attentive to the Austrian Alliance. He spent several years trying to secure the election of [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa's]] son, the future Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], as [[King of the Romans]], a title of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] that carried enormous prestige but little real power—only to see this scheme fail because of Austrian indifference. During these years there were a number of warning signs that all was not well with the alliance, but Newcastle ignored most of them—convinced that neither Austria or Britain had any other serious potential allies to turn to. Referring to the election, Newcastle believed that if his scheme failed "France and Prussia will dictate to all the world".<ref>Murphy p.41</ref> He managed to broker a compromise at a [[Congress of Hanover]] whereby he had secured the election of Joseph. His triumph at the Congress were soon undermined by his failure to secure Austrian backing.

During these years he managed to successfully outmanoeuvre the [[John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]], engineering his resignation and the dismissal of [[Lord Sandwich]] who Newcastle had now begun to consider a dangerously ambitious rival. The ease with which he did this demonstrated his total control of British politics, as Bedford led a strong faction. He had, however, made a significant enemy who would later try to undermine Newcastle.

In 1752 he made a rare trip abroad, accompanying George II on his annual trip to [[Hanover]]. During the visit, Newcastle made an attempt to cultivate [[Lord North]], a future Prime Minister, as an ally into his political faction.<ref>Whiteley p.13</ref> He was unsuccessful although the two became good friends, and North later spoke out in defence of Newcastle.

On [[Henry Pelham's]] death in 6 March 1754, Newcastle succeeded him as Prime Minister. He had initially hoped to stay in his role as [[Northern Secretary]] as he much preferred foreign affairs, but he was persuaded there was no other serious candidate and accepted the seals of office from the King in March.<ref>Browning p.194</ref>

==Prime Minister – first term==

[[Image:Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland by John Giles Eccardt.jpg|thumb|right|Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland, by [[John Giles Eccardt]], after [[Jean Baptiste van Loo]], ca. 1740]]

Newcastle's first task was to select someone [[Leader of the House of Commons|to represent the government in the Commons]]. To great surprise he rejected the favourites [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] and [[Henry Fox]], and chose [[Sir Thomas Robinson]]—who had barely even been considered a candidate by most.<ref>Browning p.198–99</ref> Newcastle was largely instrumental in appointing men considered slightly weaker so that he could dominate them. Both Pitt and Fox bore a grudge over this perceived slight, and stepped up their attacks on the Ministry.

During 1754 Newcastle oversaw a general election, largely adopting the electoral strategy drawn up by his brother, and winning a large majority. His own personal ability to have MPs elected on his slate reached new heights.<ref>Browning p.204</ref> He now felt emboldened enough to try and push through some financial reforms. He proposed measures to reduce the amount of interest paid to the [[Bank of England]] on the [[National Debt]]. His decision to do so may partly have been to deflect criticism that he was not sufficiently qualified on financial matters to control the Treasury.<ref>Browning p.207–08</ref> At the same time he was still largely directing foreign policy and that was where his main emphasis was.

===America===
{{Main|French and Indian War}}
The rivalry between Britain and France in North America had been growing for some time. Both coveted the [[Ohio Country]] which offered enormous potential for a new wealthy colony to be founded. Both nations sent military forces to occupy the territory. While the British set up the first initial post, they were [[Battle of Fort Necessity|driven out by a French expedition]] in 1754. Many wealthy Americans agitated for military action, but the preparations of the individual colonies for conflict were poor. There was pressure in London too from [[Patriot Whigs]] who felt the time was ripe for [[British America]] to expand into the interior.

For 1755 a [[Braddock Expedition|major expedition]] was planned against the French in America. A force of British regulars would be sent to seize Ohio, while another of [[New England]] provincials would take control of [[Nova Scotia]]. A new [[Commander in Chief for North America|Commander in Chief]] [[Edward Braddock]] would be appointed to oversee this, taking over from the fractious efforts of the colonial assemblies. The architect of this scheme was the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]], who held enormous political sway at the time. Braddock was a favourite of his, though Newcastle had his doubts about both Braddock and the plans. Newcastle had temporary made an alliance with [[Henry Fox]], who he also disliked. Fox was a strong supporter of the campaign, forcing Newcastle's hand.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

A few months after arriving in America, Braddock's force was engulfed by disaster at the [[Battle of Monongahela]]. Attacked by a mixed force of French and American Natives in the wilderness, more than half were killed, including Braddock. The remainder retreated back to [[Philadelphia]], leaving the French in full control of the interior.<ref>Anderson p.105</ref> The Nova Scotia scheme had been more successful, but the [[Great Expulsion]] that had followed in its wake had created a large amount of problems for Newcastle.

All these events had taken place without war being formally declared. With the decline in the American situation, Newcastle was forced to abandon his plans for financial reform, as the money would instead need to be spent on military forces.

===Loss of Minorca===
{{Main|Seven Years' War}}
[[Image:Elderpitt.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] was the leader of the [[Patriot Whigs]], and a constant thorn in Newcastle's side. Many were surprised when the two formed [[Second Newcastle Ministry|an electoral partnership]] in 1757.]]

While Newcastle had been paying attention to the American campaign, more pressing events in Europe demanded his attention. 
Austria had been growing increasingly wary, feeding into a long-standing belief that the British would abandon them when it came to crucial moments.<ref>Simms p.167–68</ref> Newcastle's worst fears were confirmed in 1756 when Austria concluded an alliance with France ([[Diplomatic Revolution]]) suddenly throwing the whole balance of power in Europe askew.

Newcastle had hoped to prevent the outbreak of a major war in Europe by encircling France with hostile powers. He believed this would both deter them from attacking their neighbours and from sending reinforcements to North America.<ref>Simms p.672–73</ref> He thought that the only way war could happen now was if [[Frederick the Great]] unilaterally attacked Austria which, given the clear disparity in numbers, he would be a "madman" to do.<ref>Anderson p.129</ref> Newcastle hoped he had managed to avert war in Europe, but in 1756 Frederick invaded [[Saxony and Bohemia]] triggering the major European war Newcastle had feared and failed to prevent. What had begun as a limited war in the [[Ohio country]] between Britain and France now took on global proportions.

Newcastle was widely blamed for Britain's poor start to the Seven Years' War and in November 1756 he was replaced by the [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]]. Some had even called for his execution following the [[loss of Minorca]] in 1756.<ref>Simms p.675</ref> Instead the commander of the British fleet [[John Byng]] was shot after a court-martial, which many considered a [[smoke screen]] to protect Newcastle.

For his long services he was created '''Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne''', with remainder to the [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne|9th Earl of Lincoln]], who had married his niece Catherine Pelham.

==Interlude: The Devonshire Prime Ministership ==
{{Main|William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire}}
Between 16 November 1756 and 25 June 1757, The Duke of Devonshire replaced Newcastle as Prime Minister, although [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Pitt]] is widely credited as the main influence on policy.

==The Second Term==
{{Main|Second Newcastle Ministry|Great Britain in the Seven Years War}}

===Return===
In July 1757 he again became Prime Minister — as [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Pitt]] could not control enough support in parliament. It is often incorrectly stated that Pitt was Prime Minister during the war, when in fact it was Newcastle who held the office. Their relationship grew into a fruitful partnership, and provided a determined leadership that some felt had been lacking for some time.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
[[Image:Quibcardinaux2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|1759 became known as the '[[Annus Mirablis]]' after Britain enjoyed victories on several continents as well as at sea. In November a French fleet [[Planned French Invasion of Britain (1759)|planning to invade England]] was defeated at [[Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon]]. Much of the credit went to Pitt rather than Newcastle]]

On paper it was an implausible alliance.<ref>McLynn p.95</ref> Pitt had been a strident critic of Newcastle for years, and they had separate, conflicting visions of strategy. Newcastle's saw Britain's best chance of victory in directing resources to the war on the continent, while Pitt wanted a wholesale shift in policy to concentrate British forces in North America, West Africa and Asia where the French were most vulnerable. In spite of this they shared some views, were both ardent Whigs, and had once before tried to create a political alliance. Newcastle had previously tried to have Pitt appointed Secretary of War in 1745, but George II had vetoed the appointment.<ref>Browning p.133</ref>

===Seven Years' War===
Ultimately British policies were formed of a mixture of these two views. Newcastle insisted on British involvement on the continent to tie down French troops, while at the same time authorising a number of expeditions against French colonies. As they were successful the expeditions began to grow in number and size. Pitt largely took over control of directing them, while Newcastle rubber-stamped them and made sure that [[Parliament of Great Britain|parliament]] was kept on side by mobilising his control of MPs. However Pitt and Newcastle would discuss strategy along with a small number of other figures such as [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Hardwicke]], [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|Anson]] and [[Edward Ligonier, 1st Earl Ligonier|Ligonier]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Newcastle had been deeply concerned by Britain's poor start to the war, particularly by the loss of [[Minorca]] and the French occupation of key ports in the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. To try and boost Britain's position in the Meditarannean he pushed for an invasion of [[Corsica]], then controlled by neutral [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], to use as a naval base or for a British attack on [[Ostend]] to drive the French out. Pitt was alarmed that either of these prospects would lead Britain into conflict with Austria or Genoa who they were not at war with. Instead, to placate Newcastle and George II, Pitt agreed to send a British contingent to fight in Germany in 1758.

===Success===
{{Main|Annus Mirabilis of 1759}}
From 1758 Pitt began despatching expeditions around the world to seize French colonies. In 1758 they captured [[Senegal]] and [[Gambia]] in [[West Africa]] and [[Louisbourg]] in [[North America]]. He planned to intensify this the following year by despatching large expeditions to the [[West Indies]] and [[Canada]]. In order to do this Pitt stripped the [[British Isles]] of troops and ships which caused Newcastle to worry that they were ill-defended. His fears increased when the British received intelligence of French plans to launch an [[Planned French Invasion of Britain (1759)|invasion of Britain]]. Pitt was determined to press ahead with that year's plans, but agreed to lessen the scale of colonial expeditions for 1760, as he expected that 1759 would provide a knock-out blow to the French war effort.

Newcastle had retained his previous belief that Britain needed to create as broad a coalition as possible, and that events in Europe rather than the Americas would be decisive, and to this end he attempted to persuade a number of different states to join the anti-French alliance. He was largely unsuccessful, as the Dutch, Danes and Portuguese remained neutral while Sweden and Russia joined the French and Austrians in attacking Prussia. In the absence of this, he authorised large sums to be paid as subsidies to the Prussians, who were fighting countries whose land forces dwarfed their own.

One of Newcastle's greatest personal achievements in this period was his use of diplomacy to keep Spain out of the war until 1762, by which time it was too late to significantly alter the balance of power. In 1759 he and Pitt organised Britain's defences against a [[Planned French Invasion of Britian (1759)|planned French invasion]] which failed because of British naval victories at [[Battle of Lagos|Lagos]] and [[Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon]].

===Dismissal===
Under this "[[Broad bottom government]]", Britain became famous abroad, but it gradually fell before the affection of the new King, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] — for [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]], who, after supplanting Pitt, became Prime Minister in place of Newcastle in May 1762. George III had described Pitt as a "snake in the grass" and Newcastle as a "Knave".<ref>Hibbert p.27</ref> Despite the undeniably competent prosecution of the war, the new King did not trust either man with the future of Britain and cast them both into opposition. It marked arguably the last occasion on which a British monarch was able to remove a Prime Minister purely because of personal animosity, a privilege that would in future be entirely ceded to parliament. As Bute was a Tory, it marked the end of the Whig monopoly on government which had lasted since the Hanoverian Succession in 1714.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Later years==
[[File:Claremont.JPG|thumb|left|Newcastle spent much of his last few years at [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]]. He was exceptionally proud of the house and its [[Claremont Landscape Garden|extensive gardens]] on which he had spent a fortune.]]

===Opposition===

The Duke went into opposition, and lost his two Lord-Lieutenancies for opposing the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|peace of 1763]]. Along with Pitt he felt the terms of peace were overly generous to France and Spain, considering the position of strength the British held. A number of the territories captured during the war were handed back, though the French presence had been effectively destroyed for good in Canada and India.

He spent much of his time at his house at [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]], which he considered one of his finest achievements. Newcastle had been in government for almost forty five continuous years, and he initially enjoyed the new freedom that opposition gave him.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Final return===
In 1765 he became [[Lord Privy Seal]] in the government of [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]].<ref>Browning p.322</ref> Rockingham shared many similarities with Newcastle, and the two men were both wealthy Whig grandees. Newcastle was at one point offered the position of [[Southern Secretary]] by the King, but turned it down. He lasted in this post for a few months before the government collapsed, to be replaced by that of the [[Duke of Grafton]].

===Retirement===
He remained in active opposition, although he accepted he would not hold office again.<ref>Browning p.322–23</ref> He continued to wield enormous patronage and influence, but his health was fast giving way, and he died in November 1768. In his final few months he had counselled against the [[coercive acts]] on [[British America]]. After his death Claremont was sold to [[Robert Clive]] who had made his name in the [[Seven Years' War]].

The Duke was industrious and energetic, and to his credit be it said that the statesman who almost monopolised the patronage of office for half a century twice refused a pension, and finally left office £300,000 poorer than he entered it because of his heavy spending on political campaigns, his lavish life style, and his neglect of the family budget.<ref>Ray A. Kelch, ''Newcastle: A Duke without Money'' (1974)</ref>

==Legacy and popular culture==
Newcastle was widely caricatured, often being portrayed as a muddle-headed buffoon who struggled to understand the business of government. He was one of the most ridiculed politicians of the 18th century.<ref>Whitely p.26</ref> A common and widely circulated example of his cluelessness is his reported response to being told that [[Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia|Annapolis]] needed to be defended, to which Newcastle allegedly replied "Annapolis! Oh yes, Annapolis must be defended, to be sure. Annapolis must be defended—where is Annapolis?".<ref>McLynn p.96–97</ref>

Historical opinion has generally been divided, with some historians drawing the conclusion that he was unfit for his office, while others regard him as a shrewd political operator, who subtly navigated the complex European State System of the 18th century. He is both praised and criticised as being perhaps the greatest "machine politics" operator of the 18th century, who commanded immense voting strength in parliament. He could often organise majorities in the House of Commons for seemingly perplexing, unpopular and absurd policies of the government.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Generally praise for Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War has gone to Pitt rather than Newcastle, despite the fact it was he who officially headed the government. Traditionally accounts of the war have portrayed Pitt as a visionary who won the war by reversing Newcastle's previous unwise policy of focusing on European affairs. Others have defended Newcastle by contrasting his 'continental policy' with the failure of [[Lord North]] to gather European allies during the [[American War of Independence]] which led to Britain's eventual defeat. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

He was portrayed in the novel ''[[Humphrey Clinker]]'' by [[Tobias Smollett]] as a bungling fool, ignorant of all geography, who is convinced that [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] is not an island.<ref>McLynn p.97</ref> Newcastle was played in the 1948 film ''[[Bonnie Prince Charlie (1948 film)|Bonnie Prince Charlie]]'' by [[G.H. Mulcaster]]. He also features in the British television series ''[[City of Vice]]'' which covers the early years of the [[Bow Street Runners]].

==Family==
[[Image:Thomas Pelham-Holles (1693-1768).jpg|thumb|upright|Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne]]

In 1718 the Duke married [[Harriet Pelham-Holles, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Lady Harriet Godolphin]], daughter of the [[Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin|2nd Earl of Godolphin]] and granddaughter of [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]]. The Duchess suffered from poor health and the couple had no children.<ref>[http://www.thepeerage.com/p10600.htm#i105993 Sir Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyme]</ref>

In 1731, at [[Houghton Hall]], Sir Robert Walpole's [[country house]] in [[Norfolk]], the Duke, with the [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke of Lorraine]] (later the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]), was made a Master Mason by the Grand Master, Lord Lovell, at an Occasional Lodge.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 1739, at the creation of London's [[Foundling Hospital]], he acted as one of the charity's founding governors.<ref>Nichols and Wray p. 345</ref>

===Succession===
With the prospect that the dukedom of Newcastle upon Tyne would become extinct once again, [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] also created the '''Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne''' in 1756, with a special remainder for inheritance through his nephew, the [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne|9th Earl of Lincoln]].

In addition, in 1762 he was also created '''Baron Pelham of Stanmer''', with inheritance to his cousin and male heir, [[Thomas Pelham, 1st Earl of Chichester|Thomas Pelham]].

On his death in 1768, the title Baron Pelham of Stanmer, together with the bulk of the Pelham estates in Sussex and the Duke's private papers, were left to Thomas, who was later created [[Earl of Chichester]]. Pelham and his brother were buried at All Saints' Church in [[Laughton, East Sussex]].<ref name="ThPelODNB">''ThPelODNB''.</ref>

The Holles/Clare estates, meanwhile, together with his Newcastle dukedom, were inherited by Lord Lincoln, from whom the Duke had by then become estranged.

{{Chinese name|[[Chen (surname)|Chen]]}}

'''Chen Yi''' ({{zh|s=??|p=Chén Yì|w=Chen I}}; August 26, 1901 – January 6, 1972) was a [[Communist Party of China|Chinese communist]] military commander and politician. He served as [[Mayor of Shanghai]] from 1949 to 1958 and as [[Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China|Foreign Minister of China]] from 1958 to 1972.

==Biography==
Chen was born in [[Lezhi County]] near [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]], into a moderately wealthy magistrate's family.

A comrade of [[Lin Biao]] from their guerilla days, Chen was a commander of the [[New Fourth Army]] during the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)]], spearheaded the [[Shandong]] counter-offensive during the [[Chinese Civil War]], and later commanded the Communist armies that defeated the KMT forces during the [[Huaihai Campaign]] and conquered the lower [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] region in 1948–49. He was made a Marshal of the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) in 1955.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chen became mayor of Shanghai. He also served as vice premier from 1954 to 1972 and foreign minister from 1958 to 1972 and president of the [[China Foreign Affairs University]] from 1961 to 1969. As vice premier, he was present during the breakup of Sino-Soviet relations. In August 1960, Chen Yi attempted to ease tensions with the Soviets, declaring on one instance to the [[Stepan_Chervonenko|Soviet Ambassador to Beijing]] that Moscow should stop "severing the friendship between the two nations.", and two weeks later to the Soviet ''deputy'' foreign minister that Moscow and Beijing should ''both'' try to save the alliance.<ref>Shu Guang Zhang, 2010, The Sino-Soviet alliance and the Cold War in Asia, 1954-1962. The Cambridge History of the Cold War, Vol 1, p.371.</ref> During the [[Cultural Revolution]], he was criticized in 1967, but never dismissed, so [[Zhou Enlai]] performed the duties of foreign minister in his place. He was a member of the [[8th Politburo of the Communist Party of China|8th CPC Politburo]] from 1956 to 1967 and he was not admitted to the [[9th Politburo of the Communist Party of China|9th Politburo]] (1969), though he was a member of the [[9th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|9th CPC Central Committee]].

After Marshal [[Lin Biao]]'s death in 1971, he was restored to favor, although not to his former power. [[Mao Zedong]] attended Chen's funeral in 1972.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/world/asia/a-student-leader-in-maos-cultural-revolution.html?pagewanted=2|newspaper=New York Times|last=Perlez|first=Jane|accessdate=26 December 2013|date=6 December 2013|title=A Leader in Mao's Cultural Revolution Faces His Past}}</ref> This was Mao's last public appearance and his first appearance at anyone's funeral during the Cultural Revolution.

{{Chinese name|[[Liu]]}}
'''Liu Bocheng''' ({{zh|s=???|t=???|p=Liú Bóchéng|w=Liu Po-ch'eng}}; December 4, 1892 &ndash; October 7, 1986) was a [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] military commander and [[Marshal]] of the [[People's Liberation Army]].

Liu is known as one of the "Three and A Half" Strategists of China in modern history. (The other two are [[Lin Biao]], commander of the CPC, and [[Kuomintang]] commander [[Bai Chongxi]], and the half refers to CPC commander [[Su Yu]].) Officially, Liu was recognised as a revolutionary, military strategist and theoretician, and one of the founders of the People's Liberation Army. Liu's nicknames, ''Chinese [[Mars]] '' and ''The One-eyed Dragon'', also reflect his character and military achievement.

==Early life==
Liu was born to a peasant family in Kaixian, [[Sichuan]] (the site is currently submerged by the [[Three Gorges Dam]]). Although he grew up in poverty, Liu made a determined effort in his studies and gained good grades at school. Influenced by the revolutionary theories of [[Sun Yat-sen]], he later decided to dedicate himself to the cause of establishing a democratic and modern China.

In 1911, Liu joined the [[Scouting in Mainland China|Boy Scouts]] in support of the [[Xinhai Revolution]]. In the following year, he enrolled in the [[Chongqing]] Military Academy and later joined the army against [[Yuan Shikai]], who was planning to undermine the Xinhai Revolution and proclaim himself Emperor. In 1914, Liu joined Sun Yat-sen's party and gained extensive military experience.

During one battle during this period he captured 10,000 enemy soldiers, for which he was promoted to brigade commander.<ref name="Barron" />
In 1916, he lost his right eye in a battle for Fengdu county, Sichuan. After he lost the eye he gained the nickname "One-Eyed Dragon".<ref name="Lew 12">Lew 12</ref> Alternative accounts of how Liu lost his eye have included the speculation that he lost it either earlier, in the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]], or later, during the [[Long March]].<ref name="Barron">Barron</ref> 

In 1923, during a war against the warlord [[Wu Peifu]], in response to the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]] of the [[Kuomintang]], Liu was appointed commander of the Eastern Route, and later was promoted to commanding general in Sichuan. Liu displayed his military talent in battles against various warlords. 

While fighting the army of [[Long Yun]], a [[Yunnan]] warlord, Liu defeated a force commanded by [[Zhu De]], who would later become one of his closest comrades in the Red Army.<ref name="Lew 12" /> In the same year, Liu became acquainted with Yang Angong (???, the elder brother of [[Yang Shangkun]]) and [[Wu Yuzhang]] (???), who were among the earliest [[Communists]] of Sichuan. Their relationship marked Liu's first real exposure to the theory and practice of [[Communism]]. In May 1926, Liu joined the CPC and was appointed military commissioner of Chongqing. In December 1926, along with Zhu De and Yang, Liu masterminded the Luzhou and Nanchong uprising, fought against local warlords, while supporting the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]]. 

In 1927, Liu was appointed army corps commander of the 15th Temporarily Organized [[National Revolutionary Army]]. It was during this time that Liu witnessed the split between the [[Kuomintang]] and the CPC. After joining the CPC, Liu led the [[Nanchang Uprising]] together with Zhu De, [[He Long]], [[Ye Ting]], [[Li Lisan]] and [[Zhou Enlai]], effectively declaring war on the KMT. 

During this uprising, Liu was appointed the first chief of staff of the newly born Chinese Red Army. However, after a series of defeats Liu's forces were destroyed, and its leaders went underground. In 1927 Liu was selected to travel to [[Moscow]], where he mastered Russian and attended the prestigious [[Military Academies and Schools of the central administration and Ground Forces#M.V. Frunze Military Academy|Frunze Military Academy]]. While studying in the [[Soviet Union]] he learned conventional, Western-style military tactics. While in Russia he translated a Russian textbook into Chinese, ''Combined Arms Tactics'', produced a commentary of [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[Art of War]]'', both of which promoted conventional tactics.<ref name="Lew 12" /> Later on, Liu gave a lecture on the subject at the 6th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, which was held in Moscow.

==Commander of the CPC Army==
In the summer of 1930, Liu was sent back to China and was appointed as commissioner of the Central Military Committee of the CPC as well as Military Secretary of the [[Yangtze River]] division of the CPC. In December 1930, Liu went to [[Shanghai]] to assist Zhou Enlai in the daily administration of CPC military affairs. 

In 1931, the CPC suffered great losses in several major cities and was forced to retreat to the countryside. Liu was sent to the Central Soviet Territory, the CPC’s [[Jiangxi-Fujian Soviet|power base in Jiangxi]]. In January 1932, Liu was appointed president and commissar of the Red Army Military Academy. By October he was promoted to Chief of Staff of the Red Army, assisting Zhu De and Zhou in the war against [[Chiang Kai-shek]]’s 4th Suppression on the Central Soviet Territory. 

At the time, the CPC was under the reign of members of the [[28 Bolsheviks]], including [[Bo Gu]], [[Zhang Wentian]], and [[Otto Braun (Li De)|Otto Braun]] (also known by his Chinese name, Li De), the Military Advisor of [[Comintern]], took control of military command. All three were educated in Moscow, and Liu found common ground with these young men. During his time in the Jiangxi-Fujian Soviet (and during the subsequent Long March) Liu experienced conflicts with other Communist leaders, including [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Peng Dehuai]]. 

Liu's conflict with Mao may partly be due to Liu's support for conventional tactics, which contradicted Mao's advocacy of guerrilla warfare. According to a later account by [[Zhang Guotao]], Liu described Mao as being a "pedant", and resented Mao's tendency to micromanage his military officers, rather than delegating authority to Red Army's general staff.<ref name="Lew 12" /> Peng once led his troops during a siege of Guangchang under the orders of Bo and Li De, which resulted in the troops suffering heavy casualties. Peng blamed this on his army's poor weaponry and resources. to inferior weaponry and resources. Peng was know for being outspoken and bad-tempered. After the battle Peng became furious, leading him into direct conflict with Liu.

Liu grew to oppose the leadership of Bo and Braun later, after the Red Army began to suffer repeated defeats. In the Red Army’s endeavour against the KMT's [[Fifth Encirclement Campaign]], Liu was demoted to Chief of Staff of the 5th Field Army following his dissidence with Bo and Braun. Bo and Braun led by way of doctrine and extremism, and the Red Army waged a face-to-face general war against the better-equipped and larger KMT army. Failure was inevitable; the CPC had to retreat from its territory to seek refuge, marking the beginning of the [[Long March]].



During the Long March, near the end of 1934, Liu was reappointed as Chief of the General Staff of the Red Army and commander of Central Column, which consisted of the majority of the CPC senior leaders, such as Bo, Braun, Zhou and Mao. Liu led the army across the Wu River and took control of [[Zunyi]], a county of [[Guizhou]] province. It was in this small city that the famous [[Zunyi Conference]] was held in January 1935. During this conference, Liu and most of the attendees showed their support for Mao. 

As a result of this conference, Bo, who was then Braun’s command in military, was replaced by a new three-man team consisting of Mao, Zhou and [[Wang Jiaxiang]]. Later on, Liu assisted Mao and Zhu across the Red Water River four times. Liu himself led troops in the takeover of the Jiaopin ferry, securing the route across the [[Jinsha River]] for the major troops. In May, Liu was appointed commander of avant-courier army and worked with commissar [[Nie Rongzhen]] on securing the route for the remaining troops. When his army entered the ethnic settlement areas, Liu pledged brotherhood with a chieftain of the local [[Yi people|Yi]] ethnicity, which significantly reduced the minorities’ hostility towards the CPC.<ref>[http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/ljzg/3584/t17925.htm The Yi Ethnic Minority] Ministry of Foreign Affairs of PRC</ref> Liu then led the 1st Division of the Red Army across the [[Dadu River (Sichuan)|Dadu River]], where [[Chiang Kai-shek|Chiang]] plotted to have the CPC armies annihilated, in the same manner as [[Shi Dakai]] and his army’s road to perdition almost a century before.

When Mao's 1st Red Army later united with [[Zhang Guotao]]’s 4th Red Army, Liu stayed Chief of Staff. During a dispute between Mao and Zhang over major issues, which led to their later split, Liu maintained his support for Mao. By the time they reached [[Yan'an]], it was obvious that Mao was the winner.

==War with Japan==
[[File:1938 Deng Xiaoping in NRA uniform.jpg|thumb|300px|Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping in NRA uniform]]
In 1936, after the [[Xian Incident]], Chiang agreed to set up an alliance with the CPC in the fight against Japanese invaders. On July 7, 1937, after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]], general war between China and Japan broke out. Under the agreement with Chiang, CPC armies were reorganised into [[8th Route Army]], and Liu was appointed commander of the 129th Division, one of its three divisions. It was then that he began his long cooperation with [[Deng Xiaoping]], his commissar at that time. 

According to the orthodox record of the CCP, their cooperation and friendship lasted more than five decades. Their respective military and political talents complemented the other's perfectly, and there was a very high level of trust between them. They were said to have formed a perfect pair.

However, their true relationship might not have been as close as it seemed. Firstly, Mao distrusted most of his generals, and sent his associates out as commissars to supervise these generals. Deng, who was Mao’s close associate from 1930’s when he worked in Jiangxi, was sent out for Liu, and Luo Ronghuan for [[Lin Biao]]. Secondly, in contrast to Liu's role as a professional soldier, Deng was a political activist and knew little about the military. Their personalities and personal lives were vastly different, which might have posed a barrier to their becoming true friends. 

Liu, Deng and Deputy Commander [[Xu Xiangqian]] led their troops to [[Shanxi]], and carried out bushfighting around Taihang Mountain. After rounds of successful battles against the Japanese army, they set up the Jinjiyu Base Area ?????????? which consisted of parts of [[Shanxi]], [[Hebei]] and [[Henan]]. In 1940, Liu led his division in the [[Hundred Regiments Campaign]], a major campaign led by Peng to breach the blockage on CPC base areas enforced by Japanese forces under the command of General [[Yasuji Okamura|Okamura Yasuji]] ('''????'''). At the same time, Liu integrated regular forces with militia, using frontal attack and bushfighting to frustrate the Japanese army’s suppression and clean-out efforts. The Japanese were so irritated that they sent agents to assassinate Liu. Although their mission was a failure, they did succeed in murdering Liu’s first daughter when she was kept in kindergarten. The Japanese thought that this revenge might distract Liu, but they underestimated Liu’s willpower. His heightened loathing for the Japanese gave him more courage under fire and more inspiration in command. 

In 1943, Liu was called back to Yan'an for [[Yan'an Rectification Movement|Zheng Feng]]. He pledged his allegiance to Mao and supported Mao’s power struggle with [[Wang Ming]]. On the contrary, Peng stood by Wang and as a result fell out of favour with Mao. This was an indication of Liu's prudence in politics as well. (Despite this, Liu was still labelled a dogmatist for pursuing his studies in Russia, and he had to make a public apology against his will in 1959.) In 1945, Liu attended the 7th National Congress of the CPC in Yan'an, and prepared the counterattack against the Japanese and the forthcoming civil war with KMT armies.

==Chinese Civil War==
At the end of the war against the Japanese, the war-scourged Chinese people pleaded for peace. Chiang then invited Mao to Chongqing for peace talks, during which, [[Yan Xishan]] sent his armies to attack CPC territories in Shanxi under Chiang's authorisation. Liu and Deng led the [[Shangdang Campaign]] and defeated 13 divisions of Yan’s troops totaled more than 35,000, and then headed east and annihilated another of Yan's army corps in the [[Handan Campaign]]. These two campaigns were the first experiences of the CPC army's shift from bushfight to campaign in movement, and proved to be valuable practice for the army groups campaign of CPC armies. They assisted in the CPC’s quick occupation of [[Manchuria]], and won advantageous status for Mao and his peace talk delegation in Chongqing. Under immense pressure, Chiang was forced to sign a peace agreement with Mao in October 1945.

The peace, however, was fragile, and civil war broke out in 1946. Liu and Deng led several campaigns in movement, undermining the strategic attack of KMT armies. In 1947, when the territories controlled by the CPC could no longer sustain so many troops, Mao decided to send part of his army to the territories controlled by KMT, in order to relieve the heavy burden on his own territories, and to position enemies at the gates of the KMT. He ordered Liu and Deng to lead their armies from their northern China base in [[Henan]], [[Shanxi]] and [[Hebei]], to [[Anhui]] in southern China. This involved sending 100,000 soldiers across the [[Yellow River]], and marching over 1000 kilometers into central plain. Liu and Deng both saw it as a gamble rather than a strategic move, and even Mao himself was not certain if such gamble would pay off by openly discussing the three possible outcomes: 
# The [[communist]] force could not even reach [[Dabie Shan]].
# The communist force would be driven out by the [[Kuomintang]] force after reaching [[Dabie Shan]].
# The [[communist]] force would be able to establish new base in [[Dabie Shan|Dabie Mountain]].

Although many expressed their concerns, Mao would not change his mind. During the expedition, they faced elite KMT armies. Liu launched the Southwestern [[Shandong]] Campaign defeating over nine brigades of KMT troops. Under this plot and cover, Liu’s army promptly moved south and went into the [[Dabie Shan|Dabie Mountain]] areas. Liu’s armies suffered great losses; half of the troops were wiped out and all of their heavy artilleries were lost, which greatly weakened their military abilities in later campaigns.  Liu and Deng's troops survived further rounds of attack. Far away from the power base, with few support armies and supplies, Liu led self-sufficient soldiers and broke rounds of heavy blockade, while boosting his strength back to the original 100,000.  Mao and his associates were very impressed by Liu's achievement and it was only then did they begin to maintain that the direct threat to [[Nanjing]] and [[Wuhan]] was a great achievement; a knife into the heart of KMT governance.  Liu's success was indeed forced the nationalists to redeploy nearly two dozen [[brigade]]s against him, disrupting [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s original plan, thus relieved nationalist pressure on other [[communist]] forces.  Mao's gamble had paid off with Liu's clever military strategies.

Liu's success did not end there, he carried out to expand his initial victories over the nationalists by carrying out several campaigns with armies led by [[Chen Yi (communist)|Chen Yi]] and [[Su Yu]], another army led by [[Chen Geng]] (??), to annihilate a great number of KMT troops led by two prominent generals, [[Chen Cheng]] and [[Bai Chongxi]]. After ten months of hard work, Liu and Deng had significantly enlarged the area of central plain area occupied by the CPC, and forced the KMT armies into strategic defense, as Chiang no longer had enough troops for attack. In Nov 1948, Liu, Deng, Chen, Su and Tan Zhenlin (???) together formed the Military Committee to command the massive [[Huai Hai Campaign]], which was carried out by CPC troops in East China and the central plain to fight against the KMT main forces in [[Xuzhou]] and Anhui. In this decisive battle, more than 500,000 KMT soldiers were annihilated; among the [[POW]]s was General [[Du Yuming]], Chiang's most distinguished protégé.

In April 1949, after illusive peace talks between the CPC and the KMT were broken, Liu led his armies across the Yangtze River and conquered huge areas of Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and [[Fujian]], taking over Nanjing, the capital of the KMT. Liu was appointed mayor of Nanjing for a short while. With assistance from He Long, Liu and Deng launched new campaigns to liberate vast areas in Southwestern China, by using long distance bypass and siege strategies. Among the areas conquered were his and Deng’s own hometowns, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan and Xikang.

==After the Establishment of the PRC==
On October 1, 1949, Mao announced the establishment of the [[People’s Republic of China]]. During the ceremony, Liu stood next to Mao. This marked the peak of his career as a military commander. In January 1950, Liu was appointed chairman of the Southwestern Division of the Central People’s Government of PRC, together with [[Gao Gang]], [[Rao Shushi]], Peng and [[Lin Biao]]. The rewards of conquering southwestern China, however, proved only to be temporary. Mao soon sent his favorite general [[He Long]] to work alongside Liu, to supervise and share the power with Liu. During his short tenure as governor, Liu led his soldiers in the crackdown of bandits and restored law and order, oversaw economic development, and more importantly, made plans for the communist invasion of [[Tibet]].

Towards the end of 1950, Liu was transferred to Nanjing as president and commissar of the Military Academy of the PLA, which would be considered a demotion for Liu. There were no clear or generally accepted reasons on record for his falling out of favour. One popular opinion holds that, during the long period of time that Liu worked with or under Mao, he's never really earned Mao's trust. Liu himself knew that too. From the Chinese history, he learnt that most generals that helped establish a new dynasty ended up getting killed by the suspicious Emperor. In order to prevent that from happening on himself, he tried to stay as far away from politics as possible. Because of his early year military training in Soviet Union, he used that as an excuse to quit his job in the government and become the president and commissar of the Military Academy of the PLA. Mao approved his request. The other story says that, while Liu was still chairman, someone unknown to the public submitted a biography of Liu in support of his promotion. In this biography he described Liu as an offspring of [[Liu Bang]], founder and first emperor of the [[Han Dynasty]], and hinted that Liu himself could set up his own empire as his ancestor did. Knowing of the cruelties and conspiracies in Chinese history, Liu was worried instead of happy, because he knew that it would arouse Mao's suspicions over Liu's intentions. Although Liu had this man arrested, Mao still learnt of the event, and Liu’s worries eventually turned into reality. This only served to further increase Mao’s long-time distrust of Liu.

Despite the demotion, Liu was dedicated to his new job, attempting to bring what he learned during his years in the [[Soviet Union]] to the Academy. He organised the translations of numerous military textbooks from the Soviet Union and other countries, introducing major campaigns from ancient times to [[World War II]] to students, and sowing the seeds of the PLA's evolution into a modern army. Although Liu was appointed Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Committee of the CPC and PRC in 1954 as a reward for his contributions, these titles did not promise real power as Peng's did. (Peng was appointed [[Defense Minister]] for his battle achievements in the [[Korean War]].) In 1955, Liu attained the rank of [[field marshal]], ranking as the 4th amongst 10 field marshals of the PLA, next to Zhu De, Peng and Lin Biao.

In 1956, after [[Nikita Khrushchev]] shook the Communist world by making his famous [[Secret Speech]] denouncing the [[cult of personality]] that surrounded [[Joseph Stalin]], Mao wanted to ensure that a similar incident within the CPC would not happen. He wrote an article, "On Ten Relationships", arguing that the CPC should learn from foreign countries selectively, analytically and with criticism. The CPC center then issued documents to call on all CPC members to overcome the trend of dogmatism and empiricism at work. Investigations and purges were carried out by the military, under the direction of Peng. As an advocate of learning from other countries, Liu became a key target. Some of his subordinates and deputies, including General [[Xiao Ke]], were censored and kept in custody. Liu had to make numerous self-criticisms for his association and support of these officials. Under heavy pressure, his health worsened (he eventually lost all sight in his remaining eye), and he finally submitted his resignation as president.

In 1959, Liu left Nanjing for Beijing and lived in half-reclusion. Although he was since elected as member of the [[Politburo]] in the 8th to 11th National Congress of the CPC, Vice-Chairman of the 2nd to 5th Standing Committee of the [[National People’s Congress]], and all the while holding the title of Vice-Chairman of the Military Committee, he did not participate very much in politics, citing health problems as a reason for his absence. This saved him from the following rounds of purges carried out by Mao. Peng, however, was not as fortunate. He was purged in the [[Lushan Conference]] in 1959 and later tortured to death during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

By the time of the Cultural Revolution, Liu had become completely blind. Nonetheless, he survived the purges and witnessed his long-time friend Deng returning to power again. He supported Deng in the power struggle against Mao’s widow, [[Jiang Qing]], and her [[Gang of Four]], and also advocated Deng's policy of reforming and opening up China to the outside world, a policy that Liu himself had practiced in the Academy decades ago.

In 1982, Liu retired due to worsening health problems. This gave Deng a boost in his calling for the retirement of aging leaders in order to clear the way for younger leaders of the CPC. On October 7, 1986, Liu died in Beijing, at the age of 94. In the lament given to him, Liu was rehabilitated and cleared of all charges against him during the movements against dogmatism.

==Anecdotes==
During the Fengdu campaign in 1916, Liu was hit by a bullet in the head, which passed through his right temple and went out from his right eye.  A German surgeon performed surgery for him to remove the eyeball and debride necrotic tissues. To keep his brain nerves from being damaged by the [[anaesthetic]]s, Liu insisted on operation without anesthesia. After the procedure was finished, Liu told the surgeon that he counted a total of 72 cuts. The doctor was greatly moved by this display of courage and perseverance, and out of great respect he gave Liu the nickname "Chinese [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]".

Deng's famous “Cats Theory” (“Whether it is a black cat or a white cat, as long as it can catch the rat, it is a good cat”), in fact, originated from Liu.<ref>[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/dengxp/vol1/text/a1400.html Restore Agricultural Production, July 7, 1962] ''Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume I (1938-1965)</ref> During his long military career, Liu often stated that “Whether it is a black cat or a yellow cat, as long as it can catch the rat, it is a good cat” to demonstrate that the purpose of war is to win, no matter what strategies you take.

Once, Deng made fun of Liu by complaining that his partner's only shortcoming was being a dull man; he spent all his time on reading and thinking except when he is commanding, without any entertainment at all.

Liu and Deng’s relationship prior to the communist takeover was not so close as it appeared on record. After their army won a battle, Deng claimed it was a great victory of Maoism. Liu refuted: "If we lose, can we say it is a great loss of Maoism?"

Liu and Deng's relationship grew strong only after the communist takeover because both were discontent with [[Mao Zedong]]'s disastrous policies, such as [[Great Leap Forward]] and [[Cultural Revolution]]: As Liu was persecuted in the late 1950s, Deng showed his support to Liu, as the latter was making rounds of analyses and apologies for the so-called "dogmatism" and "empiricism". Similarly, Liu showed his support to Deng for Deng's economic policy in the early 1960s to reform the Chinese economy.  

Deng's entire family attended Liu's funeral, which only happened in the case of very close family ties in traditional Chinese culture. Liu wanted a small funeral in the hospital he died in. However, because too many military and political leaders requested to attend the funeral, the funeral was moved to a bigger hall.

===False Anecdotes===
Liu and Deng's relationship was greatly exaggerated by the Chinese general populace as a way to protest [[Mao Zedong]]'s disastrous [[Cultural Revolution]]: In 1972, shortly after the death of Chinese [[Field Marshal]] [[Chen Yi (communist)|Chen Yi]], Liu told his family that after his death, he wanted his funeral to be held by Deng, and his eulogy to be done by Deng, and this was when Deng was still under house arrest and Liu did so to show his support.  However, the general Chinese populace had gravely turned this incident into something out of proportion as a way to protest the disastrous [[Cultural Revolution]] by claiming that after the [[Hua Guofeng]] was named by Mao as his successor, Liu had make a request in a face-to-face conversation with [[Hua Guofeng]], wanting his funeral to be held by Deng, and his eulogy to be done by Deng, or else he would rather have his son to throw his cadaver in the fields to feed the wild dogs.

In reality, there is no official record that Liu had made such outrageous request, or had any face-to-face conversations with [[Hua Guofeng]] either, or made any formal request to the Chinese regime to have his funeral held by Deng and his eulogy done by Deng. However, it was definitely his personal wish which is revealed to his family.  This personal wish of Liu became a reality after his death as his family informed the Chinese regime about his wish, and by that time, Deng was already the paramount leader of China and nobody could stop him from honoring Liu's personal wish.<ref>[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/dengxp/vol3/text/c1600.html In Memory of Liu Bocheng, October 21, 1986] ''Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume III (1982-1992)'', first published in [[People's Daily]]</ref>

==Legacy==
Unlike other CCP generals, such as Lin Biao and Peng Dehuai, Liu never won the trust and support of Mao. Liu earned his reputation and title through his own outstanding military skills and sublime personality. He oversaw the development of the CPC armies’ expertise in regular battle, frontal attack, army groups campaigns, and sieges. Liu was also the first to introduce modern military strategies and the tactics of foreign countries to the CPC army, and incorporated science and artistry into military training. All of these endeavours shifted public perception of the CPC army from being a guerrilla force consisting of peasants and proletarians with little regular training to becoming a sophisticated and highly skilled modern military force.

'''Tewkesbury''' ({{IPAc-en|?|tj|u?|k|s|b|r|i}} {{respell|TYEWKS|bree}}) is a town and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in [[Gloucestershire]], [[England]]. It stands at the [[confluence]] of the [[River Severn]] and the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|River Avon]], and also minor tributaries the Swilgate and Carrant Brook. It gives its name to the [[Tewkesbury (borough)|Borough of Tewkesbury]], of which the town is the second largest settlement.

The name Tewkesbury comes from Theoc, the name of a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] who founded a [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] there in the 7th century, and in the [[Old English]] tongue was called Theocsbury.<ref name=Leland>[[Lucy Toulmin Smith|Toulmin Smith L.]], ed. 1909, ''The Itinerary of John Leland'', London, IV, 150</ref> An erroneous derivation from [[Theotokos]] enjoyed currency in the monastic period of the town's history.

It is in a rural environment (out of town) and is in lowland which makes it easier to flood, because of the ham, a plain.

==Demography==
At the [[2011 UK census]] the town itself had a population of 10,704. If the neighbouring parishes of Wheatpieces (3,577), Northway (5,080) and Ashchurch Rural (957) are added, the figure rises to 20,318. The Tewkesbury urban area is divided in two by the north-south running [[M5 motorway]], opened in February 1971. However, the town is generally considered as the built-up area to the immediate east and west of the M5 at junction 9, with the town centre, abbey and old town situated to the west. The close proximity of large areas of land that are prone to flooding, as evidenced by the severe floods that struck the region in July 2007, would make further expansion difficult. However, the present [[Tewkesbury (borough)|Borough of Tewkesbury]], created on 1 April 1974, also contains a large portion of rural north Gloucestershire, extending as far as the edges of Gloucester itself and also Cheltenham, and has a present population of 81,943.<ref>[http://www.tewkesbury.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=432 Tewkesbury Borough Council – Statistics]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref>

==Landmarks==
[[File:Tewkesbury War Memorial.jpg|thumb|The Tewkesbury War Memorial, locally known as the Cross]]
The town features many notable [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] buildings, but its major claim to fame is [[Tewkesbury Abbey]], a fine [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[Abbey]], originally part of a [[monastery]], which was saved from the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] by King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] after being bought by the townspeople for £453 to use as their [[parish church]].<ref>[http://www.tewkesburyabbey.org.uk/his.htm Tewkesbury Abbey – History]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref> Most of the monastery buildings, as well as the [[vineyard]]s, were destroyed during this time. The Abbey Mill however still remains, resting upon the Mill Avon, a channel built by the [[monk]]s. The weir exists to this day, and the channel represents one of the biggest projects in Tewkesbury's history, though the present sluice gate dates only from the 1990s, replacing two installed in the 1930s. The Abbey Mill is also sometimes known as "Abel Fletcher's Mill", but this is simply the name given to it in Dinah Craik's novel ''John Halifax, Gentleman'', whose setting Norton Bury is based on Tewkesbury (see the ''Tewkesbury in Literature'' section below).

The abbey is thought to be the site of the place where the hermit Theoc once lived. The great [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] arch on the west front is particularly striking, and the stained glass window at that end has been restored. The monastery was founded by the [[Despensers]] as a family mausoleum, and the Despenser and Neville tombs are fine examples of small-scale late [[medieval]] [[stonework]].

The tower is believed to be the largest Norman tower still in existence (though that at [[Norwich Cathedral]] is another strong contender). The tower once had a wooden spire which may have taken the total height of the building to as much as 260 feet (79&nbsp;m), but this was blown off in a heavy storm on [[Easter Monday]] 1559; the present pinnacles and [[battlements]] were added in 1600 to give the tower a more "finished" look. The height to the top of the pinnacles is 148 feet (45&nbsp;m). The abbey is thought to be the third largest church in [[Great Britain|Britain]] that is not a cathedral (after [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[Beverley Minster]]). From end to end it measures 331 feet (101&nbsp;m), though prior to the destruction of the original Lady Chapel (also at the time of the dissolution), the total length was 375 feet (114&nbsp;m). The abbey is a [[parish church]], still used for daily services, and is believed to be the second-largest parish church in England, again, after [[Beverley Minster]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jenkins |first1=Simon |title= England's Thousand Best Churches|year= 1999|page=228}}</ref>
[[File:Royal Hop Pole.jpg|thumb|The Royal Hop Pole, mentioned in 'The Pickwick papers']]

Tewkesbury claims Gloucestershire's oldest [[public house]], the ''Black Bear'', dating from 1308.<ref>[http://www.pub-explorer.com/gloucs/pub/oldeblackbeartewkesbury.htm Pub-explorer.com]. Pub-explorer.com.</ref> Other notable buildings are the Royal Hop Pole Hotel in Church Street (which has recently been converted into a part of the [[Wetherspoons]] pub chain with the discovery of a former medieval banqueting hall in the structure), mentioned in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', the Bell Hotel, a large [[half-timbered]] structure opposite the Abbey gateway, and the House of the Nodding Gables in the High Street.

The historic Abbey Cottages, over 500 years old, were rescued from dereliction in the 1970s; one houses a museum, the others are residential homes and commercial offices. At the Tudor House Hotel in the High Street however, although it is indeed chiefly a Tudor building, the frontage comprises artificial half-timbering attached to a brick-built façade. The local branch of Store Twenty-One (formerly Marks & Spencer and before that Iceland) was once the location of the Swan Hotel, where a balcony still exists today and from which local election results were announced.

Also notable in the town architecture is the Old Baptist Chapel (on Church Street) built in about 1655, as one of the earliest examples from that denomination – behind the chapel is a small cemetery for those who were members of the chapel.

Just to the west of the town is [[Thomas Telford]]'s impressive [[Mythe Bridge]] over the [[River Severn]], a [[cast-iron]] structure with a 170-foot span, opened in 1826. Tewkesbury's other notable bridge is the stone-built King John's Bridge over the Avon, commissioned by [[John of England|King John]] in the late 12th century as part of improvements to the main road from [[Gloucester]] to [[Worcester]]. Original stonework can still be seen on its north side; the bridge was widened in the mid-to-late 1950s to meet  traffic requirements.

==Railways==
[[Ashchurch for Tewkesbury railway station]] is one mile from the town centre. It was the last mainline station in Gloucestershire to be reopened, as [[British Rail]] was being fragmented into [[Railtrack]].

The nearby [[Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway]] has views of Tewkesbury Abbey en route between Cheltenham Racecourse and Winchcombe.

==Road transport==
Tewkesbury is served by the [[M5 motorway]], the [[M50 motorway (Great Britain)|M50 motorway]], the [[A38 road|A38]] [[trunk road]] and the [[A46 road|A46]] trunk road. There are frequent direct buses to [[Ashchurch for Tewkesbury railway station]] and to [[Cheltenham]]. Other direct bus services include Gloucester and Evesham. Congestion on the A46 around Ashchurch and junction 9 of the M5 is being addressed through a series of road works starting in 2014.<ref>http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/road-projects/a46-ashchurch-and-m5-junction-improvements</ref>

*Since 2005, an annual Food and Drink Festival has been held, in or near the Abbey grounds.<ref>[http://www.tewkesbury.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1645 ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref>
*In July the town hosts [[Tewkesbury Medieval Festival]], "Europe's largest battle re-enactment and fair". Thousands of re-enactors travel to the town from around the world to re-enact the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] near to the original battle site. The festival includes a "living history" recreation of a [[medieval]] encampment, games, food and a large fair where re-enactment clothing, furniture and weaponry can be purchased. In 2008 the festival celebrated its 25th anniversary.

*In July the Water Festival takes place with events on the river and the banks including an evening procession of lit boats ending with a [[firework]] display. The festival started in 1996 but its future is now in question due to funding issues and the 2006 event was much reduced in scale. The event was cancelled in 2007 as it coincided with the Summer 2007 Flood (it went ahead later in the year). The event was scheduled for 2008 on Saturday, 20 September, but was again cancelled due to flooding in the weeks prior to the event.
*In October the town holds the annual [[mop fair]]. Originally a hiring fair where people came to seek employment, the event is now a large [[travelling funfair]] taking over much of the centre of town. The fair itself is also an underlining point of Tewkesbury's industrial past, as Walker Gallopers were produced in the area by Walkers in the early 20th century.<ref>Anthea Jones ''Tewkesbury''</ref> The fair is organised by The Showmen's Guild of Great Britain (Western Section)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showmensguild.co.uk/ |title=Showmen's Guild of Great Britain Central Office |publisher=Showmensguild.co.uk |date=}}</ref>
*Every year at the end of July and into August the Abbey hosts a festival of liturgical music entitled Musica Deo Sacra (Music Sacred to God).<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/musicadeosacra/ Musica Deo Sacra]</ref>

==Cultural references==
*[[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[author]] [[Dinah Craik]] (1826–1887) visited Tewkesbury in 1852, and later set her most famous work ''[[John Halifax, Gentleman]]'' (pub. 1857) in the town, calling it Norton Bury in the book. There is a "Craik House" in Church Street, near the Abbey, but Mrs Craik never lived there and had no other connection with Tewkesbury. There is a memorial to her in the Abbey's south [[transept]].

Another of his books, ''Brensham Village'' (pub. 1946) used nearby [[Bredon]] as its basis. A local museum has been named after him.
*[[A.E. Housman]]'s ''[[A Shropshire Lad]]'' also mentions Tewkesbury, as well as nearby [[Bredon Hill]], even though neither place is in [[Shropshire]].
*The opening scene of the 1995 film version of [[Richard III (1995 film)|Richard III]] takes place at the Field Headquarters of King Henry's army at Tewkesbury.
* In 2008 an episode of the UK TV series [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]] was filmed in the vicinity, with a car being used as the "fox" in a fox hunt.

'''Augustus Henry FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton''', [[Order of the Garter|KG]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] (28 September 1735 – 14 March 1811), styled '''Earl of Euston''' between 1747 and 1757, was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[British Whig Party|Whig]] [[wikt:statesman|statesman]] of the [[Georgian era]]. He is one of a handful of [[duke]]s who have served as [[Prime Minister of Great Britain|Prime Minister]].

He became Prime Minister in 1768 at the age of 33, leading the supporters of [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]], and was the youngest person to have held the office until the appointment of [[William Pitt the Younger]] 15 years later. However, he struggled to demonstrate an ability to counter increasing challenges to Britain's global dominance following the nation's [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|victory in the Seven Years' War]]. He was [[Corsican Crisis|widely attacked]] for allowing France to annex Corsica, and stepped down in 1770, handing over power to [[Lord North]].

==Background and education==
He was a son of [[Lord Augustus FitzRoy]], a Captain in the [[Royal Navy]],<ref>http://thepeerage.com/p1040.htm#i10395</ref> and Elizabeth Cosby, daughter of Colonel [[William Cosby]], who served as a colonial [[Governor of New York]]. His father was the third son of the [[Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton|2nd Duke of Grafton]] and Lady Henrietta Somerset, which made FitzRoy a great-grandson of both the [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton|1st Duke of Grafton]] and the [[Charles Somerset, Marquess of Worcester|Marquess of Worcester]]. He was notably a fourth-generation descendant of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and the [[Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland|1st Duchess of Cleveland]]. His younger brother was the [[Charles FitzRoy, 1st Baron Southampton|1st Baron Southampton]]. From the death of his uncle in 1747, he was styled '''Earl of Euston''' as his grandfather's heir apparent.

Lord Euston was educated at Hackney School, made the [[Grand Tour]] and obtained a degree at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]], [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=FTSY751AH|name=Fitzory, Augustus Henry}}</ref>

==Political career==
In 1756, he entered [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] as [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Boroughbridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Boroughbridge]], a [[pocket borough]]; several months later, he switched constituencies to [[Bury St Edmunds]], which was controlled by his family. However, a year later, his grandfather died and he succeeded as 3rd Duke of Grafton, which elevated him to the [[House of Lords]].

He first became known in politics as an opponent of [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]],<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Fitzroy, Augustus Henry}}</ref> a favourite of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. Grafton aligned himself with the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Duke of Newcastle]] against Lord Bute, whose term as Prime Minister was short-lived largely because it was felt that the peace terms to which he had agreed at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] were not a sufficient return for [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's performance in the Seven Years War]].

In 1765, Grafton was appointed a [[Privy Council of Great Britain|Privy Counsellor]]; then, following discussions with [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]], he was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department|Northern Secretary]] in [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham's]] first government. However, he retired the following year, and Pitt (by then Lord Chatham) formed a ministry in which Grafton was [[First Lord of the Treasury]] but not Prime Minister.

Chatham's illness, at the end of 1767, resulted in Grafton becoming the Government's effective leader (he is credited with entering the office of Prime Minister in 1768), but political differences, the impact of the [[Corsican Crisis]] and the attacks of "[[Junius]]" led to his resignation in January 1770. Also, in 1768, Grafton became Chancellor of Cambridge University. He became [[Lord Privy Seal]] in [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North's]] ministry (1771) but resigned in 1775, being in favour of conciliatory action towards the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonists]]. In the second Rockingham ministry of 1782, he was again Lord Privy Seal. In later years he was a prominent [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], being one of the early members of the inaugural [[Essex Street Chapel]] under Rev. [[Theophilus Lindsey]].

==Legacy==

[[Grafton County, New Hampshire]],<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA140#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt. Print. Off. | author=Gannett, Henry | year=1905 | pages=140}}</ref> in the [[United States]], is named in his honour, as are the towns of [[Grafton, New South Wales|Grafton]], New South Wales, Australia, the town of [[Grafton, New York]], the unincorporated community of [[Grafton, Virginia]], and possibly the township (since 1856 a city) of [[Grafton, West Virginia]]. The Grafton Centre Shopping Mall in Cambridge is also named after him, and indeed lies on Fitzroy Street.

==Family==
On 29&nbsp;January 1756, he married The Hon. Anne Liddell (1737–1804), daughter of the [[Henry Liddell, 1st Baron Ravensworth|1st Baron Ravensworth]]. They had three children:

He married, secondly, Lady Frances Stewart (24&nbsp;June 1777 – 9&nbsp;February 1810) on 10&nbsp;March 1799 and had three children. His sons [[Charles Augustus FitzRoy|Sir Charles FitzRoy]] (1796–1858), governor of [[New South Wales]], and [[Robert FitzRoy]], the hydrographer, were notable for their achievements.

After the Duchess had become pregnant by her lover, the [[John FitzPatrick, 2nd Earl of Upper Ossory|Earl of Upper Ossory]], she and the Duke were divorced by Act of Parliament in 1769. Two months later, in May 1769, the Duke married Elizabeth Wrottesley (1&nbsp;November 1745 – 25 May 1822), daughter of the [[Sir Richard Wrottesley, 7th Baronet|Reverend Sir Richard Wrottesley]], [[Dean of Worcester]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hellicar|1978|p=28}}</ref> They had the following children:

* [[Admiral]] [[Lord William FitzRoy]] (1&nbsp;June 1782 – 13&nbsp;May 1857), who married Georgiana Raikes (died 2&nbsp;December 1861) in 1816 and had two children.
* [[Lord John FitzRoy|Lord John Edward FitzRoy]] (24 September 1785 – 28 December 1856), MP, died unmarried.
* Lady Charlotte FitzRoy (d. 23 June 1857).
* Lady Elizabeth FitzRoy (died 13 March 1839), who married her cousin [[William FitzRoy|Lt. Gen. The Hon. William FitzRoy]] (1773–1837), son of the [[Charles FitzRoy, 1st Baron Southampton|1st Baron Southampton]], on 4&nbsp;July 1811.
* Lady Isabella FitzRoy (died 10&nbsp;December 1866), who married Barrington Pope Blachford (3&nbsp;December 1783 – 14&nbsp;May 1816) on 11&nbsp;August 1812.

A '''vertical and/or short take-off and landing''' ('''V/STOL''') aircraft is an [[airplane]] able to [[takeoff and landing|take-off or land]] vertically or on short runways. [[VTOL|Vertical takeoff and landing]] (VTOL) aircraft are a subset of V/STOL craft that do not require runways at all. Generally, a V/STOL aircraft needs to be able to hover. Helicopters are not considered under the V/STOL classification as the classification is only used for airplanes, aircraft that achieve lift in forward flight by planing the air, thereby achieving speed and fuel efficiency that is typically greater than helicopters are capable of.

Most V/STOL aircraft types were experiments or outright failures from the 1950s to 1970s.  V/STOL aircraft types that have been produced in large numbers include the [[Harrier Jump Jet|Harrier]], [[Yak-38 Forger]] and [[V-22 Osprey]].

A rolling takeoff, sometimes with a ramp ([[Flight Deck#Ski-jump ramp|ski-jump]]), reduces the amount of thrust required to lift an aircraft from the ground (compared with vertical takeoff), and hence increases the payload and range that can be achieved for a given thrust. For instance, the Harrier is incapable of taking off vertically with a full weapons and fuel load.  Hence V/STOL aircraft generally use a runway if it is available.  I.e. short takeoff and vertical landing ([[STOVL]]) or conventional takeoff and landing ([[CTOL]]) operation is preferred to [[VTOL]] operation.

V/STOL was developed to allow fast jets to be operated from clearings in forests, from very short runways, and from small [[aircraft carrier]]s that would previously only have been able to carry [[helicopter]]s.

The main advantage of V/STOL aircraft is closer basing to the enemy, which reduces response time and tanker support requirements. In the case of the [[Falklands War]], it also permitted high performance fighter air cover and ground attack without a large aircraft carrier equipped with a catapult.

The latest V/STOL aircraft is the [[F-35B]], which is expected to enter service in 2016.<ref>[http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=news-000003175295 "Report: F-35 Work Falls Behind Two More Years."] ''CQ Politics'', 23 July 2009.</ref>

{{Chinese name|[[Du (surname)|Du]]}}
'''Du Yuming''' ({{zh|c=???|p=Dù Yùmíng}}; 1904–1981) was a [[Kuomintang]] field commander. He was a graduate of the first class of [[Whampoa Academy]], took part in Chiang's [[Northern Expedition]], and was active in southern China and in the Burma theatre of the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Sino-Japanese War]]. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, he was an important commander in the [[Chinese Civil War]].

From 1945-47 Du commanded Nationalist forces in [[Northeast China]] and won several important battles against Communist forces there, including defeating the Communist general [[Lin Biao]] twice at [[Siping]]. Despite his successes, Chiang relieved him from command in 1947, after which Communist forces quickly took control of the region.

Du was captured later in the civil war and spent a decade as a prisoner of war. He was released in 1959, and given a position in the Communist government.

==Biography==
===Early Military Career===
A trusted protégé of [[Chiang Kai-shek]], Du was a graduate of the first cadet class at the [[Whampoa Military Academy]]. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], he commanded the KMT 5th Corps in the [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|First Changsha Campaign]], and [[Battle of South Guangxi]].

During World War II, he commanded the same 5th Corps or Nationalist Fifth Army of the [[Chinese Expeditionary Force in Burma]] in the [[Battle of Yunnan-Burma Road]] from mid March to early June 1942, during the [[Burma Campaign]] under Lieutenant General [[Joseph Stilwell]]. When the [[British Army]] collapsed and abandoned Burma under Japanese pressure, Du was forced to order a hastily planned withdrawal that resulted in the loss of 50,000 Chinese soldiers. Du fell back to China despite General [[Sun Li-Jen]]'s advice that, because the route back to China was hazardous, he should instead retreat with the British to India. Most men that followed Du Died in the Burmese jungle of tropical disease and starvation or were killed by the Axis forces, while Sun's army retreated in an orderly fashion into India. Because he was acting on the orders of Chiang Kai-shek when he withdrew to China, he was not punished for the outcome of the campaign.

===Chinese Civil War===
After the war, Du helped strengthen the Nationalist position in the Southwest by removing [[Long Yun]], the local warlord of [[Yunnan]], in October 1945. Du was then transferred to the [[Northeast China|Northeast]] Theatre to consolidate Kuomintang control. After the [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] resumed in 1945, Du was able to win a number of victories.

In November 1945 he retook strategic positions around [[Shanhai Pass|Shanhaiguan]] from Communist forces. Later, on November 22, he retook the strategic city of [[Jinzhou]], which forced Communist forces to temporarily abandon any attempts to take major cities in the region and to agree to a temporary ceasefire. Fighting resumed in April 1946, and in May Du defeated [[Lin Biao]] in the [[Battle of Siping]]. Following the Communist withdrawal he pursued them, capturing [[Gongzhuling]] on May 21 and [[Changchun]] on May 23. His advance was eventually halted at the south bank of the [[Songhua River]] due to concerns about overextending his forces. Du's victory in Siping led to a general ceasefire across China brokered by [[George Marshall]], during which Du consolidated his communication and supply lines.<ref>Lew, Christopher R. ''The Third Chinese Revolutionary War, 1945-1949: An Analysis of Communist Strategy and Leadership''. The USA and Canada: Routelage. 2009. ISBN 0-415-77730-5. pp.28-37, 54-55</ref>

The ceasefire held in Northeast China until January 1947, when Du led the majority of his forces to attack Communist forces on the Korean border in January 1947. When Du led his forces south, Lin Biao ordered 20,000 of his soldiers to cross the Songjiang River, where they staged guerrilla raids, ambushed relief forces, attacked isolated garrisons, and avoided decisive confrontations with strong and well-prepared armies that Du had sent to counterattack them. While the Communists did so they looted large quantities of supplies and destroyed the infrastructure of the KMT-held territories that they passed through, including bridges, railroads, fortifications, electrical lines, and boats. When Du sent forces north, Communist forces in the south advanced and besieged Du's forces at [[Tonghua]]. When Du sent his forces back south to attack the Communist headquarters at [[Linjiang]], they fell into an ambush and were destroyed. When Du requested reinforcements from [[Chiang Kai-shek]], his request was rejected.<ref>Lew, Christopher R. ''The Third Chinese Revolutionary War, 1945-1949: An Analysis of Communist Strategy and Leadership''. The USA and Canada: Routelage. 2009. ISBN 0-415-77730-5. pp.66-69</ref>

Following his forces' defeat in the summer of 1947, Du reorganized his forces into six divisions, and focused on the defense of [[Changchun]], [[Jilin City]], [[Siping, Jilin|Siping]] (which was already under siege) and West [[Liaoning]], which was necessary to maintain communication with [[Beiping]] and [[Nanjing]]. By focusing on defense he effectively adopted a reactionary position and lost the initiative of the campaign.<ref>Lew, Christopher R. ''The Third Chinese Revolutionary War, 1945-1949: An Analysis of Communist Strategy and Leadership''. The USA and Canada: Routelage. 2009. ISBN 0-415-77730-5. p.70</ref>

On June 11 Lin's forces returned to [[Siping]] and began to engage and besiege ir. Du's commander in the siege of Siping was [[Chen Mingren]], who commanded 29,000 soldiers. Before Lin's forces arrived, Chen was able to entrench his forces in strong positions, and the first waves of Communist attackers suffered heavy casualties. The defenders in Siping also benefited from effective air support. The Communists were able to break into the city twice, but were driven back both times with heavy casualties. By mid-June the attackers were beginning to suffer from attrition and exhaustion, and by June 24 Nationalist reinforcements began to arrive from [[Hebei]], and from Du's garrisons in other areas. On July 1 the siege was broken and the attackers were ordered to retreat north of the Songjiang river.<ref>Lew, Christopher R. ''The Third Chinese Revolutionary War, 1945-1949: An Analysis of Communist Strategy and Leadership''. The USA and Canada: Routelage. 2009. ISBN 0-415-77730-5. pp.70-71</ref>

The Communists suffered between 13,000-40,000 casualties (depending on the source), while the Nationalist garrison at Siping was reduced to slightly over 3,000 men. Nationalist sources also reported that they had captured 94,000 enemy soldiers, and that 143,000 men in Lin's army had defected. Communist sources confirm slightly lower rates of desertion, with some divisions reporting a desertion rate of over 20%. Chiang Kai-shek interpreted the battle as decisive victory, but recalled Du from the Northeast and replaced him with [[Chen Cheng]], who was one of Chiang's favourite generals. After Du's victory at Siping, Chiang may have sent Chen to the Northeast in order for Chen to have what Chiang believed would be the "final blow" against Lin.<ref>Lew, Christopher R. ''The Third Chinese Revolutionary War, 1945-1949: An Analysis of Communist Strategy and Leadership''. The USA and Canada: Routelage. 2009. ISBN 0-415-77730-5. pp.71, 86</ref> Shortly after Du was recalled, Lin Biao defeated Chen, taking control of Manchuria in 1948.

===Later Career===
Toward the end of the Civil War, Du correctly guessed that Major General [[Guo Rugui]] ({{lang|zh|???}}), one of Chiang's most trusted staff officers, was a Communist agent. Unfortunately, the only evidence he was able to present was that Guo, unlike most Nationalist cadres and officers, was clean. Chiang did not consider this a good reason to suspect Guo and became enraged when Du presented his view because Chiang believed it implied that all of the Nationalists were corrupt, and that only the Communists were clean. Du's wife had also been a Communist herself.

Du was captured during the [[Huaihai Campaign]] and held in prison until his pardon in 1959, after which he was rewarded with a high-ranking position in the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]]. The Communist leadership may have promoted Du to this role in order to convince his son-in-law [[Yang Zhenning]], a Nobel laureate in physics, to return to China. Guo Rugui, who was in fact a Communist spy after all, was also placed in the same political organization as Du, and the two became friends.

'''Nie Rongzhen''' ({{zh|s=???|t=???|p=Niè Róngzh?n|w=Nieh Jung-chen}}) (December 29, 1899 - May 14, 1992) was a prominent [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] military leader, and one of ten [[Yuan Shuai|Marshals]] in the [[People's Liberation Army]] of China. He was the last surviving PLA officer with the rank of Marshal.

==Biography==
Nie was born in [[Jiangjin District|Jiangjin County]] in [[Sichuan]] (now part of [[Chongqing]] municipality), the cosmopolitan and well-educated son of a wealthy family. In his 20s, Nie applied to Université du Travail, in [[Charleroi]], [[Belgium]], with a scholarship from the Socialist Party and be able to study science in Charleroi. 

=== Political leanings ===
[[Zhou Enlai]] spent a night in Charleroi and met with Nie. Nie agreed to join the group of Chinese students in France on a work-study program, where he studied [[engineering]] and became a protégé of Zhou Enlai.  He joined the [[Communist Party of China]] in 1923. 

A graduate of the [[Soviet Red Army Military College]] and [[Whampoa Academy]], Nie spent his early career first as a political officer in Whampoa's Political Department, where Zhou served as the Deputy Director, and in the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army|Red Army]]. 

=== World War II ===
During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], he was first assigned as the deputy division commander of the 115th division of the [[Eighth Route Army]], with the commander being [[Lin Biao]], and in the late 1930s he was given a field command close to [[Yan Xishan]]'s [[Shanxi]] stronghold.

=== Civil War ===
In the [[Chinese Civil War]] he commanded the Northern China Military Region, and with his deputy [[Xu Xiangqian]], his force defeated [[Fu Zuoyi]]'s forces in [[Tianjin]] near Beijing. During the [[Korean War]], Nie took part in high level command decision making, military operations planning, and shared responsibility for war mobilization. Nie was made a Marshal of the PLA in 1955 and later ran the [[Chinese nuclear weapons program]]. 

=== Purge and rehabilitation ===
He was purged during the [[Cultural Revolution]], but was later rehabilitated and became vice chairman of the Central Military Committee, which controlled the nation's armed forces, and also became the vice chairman of the National People's Congress. He retired in 1987 and died in Beijing.

'''William Petty, 1st Marquess of Lansdowne''', [[Knight of the Garter|KG]], [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (2 May 1737 – 7 May 1805), known as '''The Earl of Shelburne''' between 1761 and 1784, by which title he is generally known to history, was an [[Kingdom of Ireland|Irish]]-born [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] [[wikt:statesman|statesman]] who was the first [[Home Secretary]] in 1782 and then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] 1782–1783 during the final months of the [[American War of Independence]]. He succeeded in securing peace with America and this feat remains his legacy.<ref name=www.number10.gov.uk>{{cite web|last=www.number10.gov.uk|first=www.number10.gov.uk|title=Past British Prime Ministers|publisher=British Government|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> He was also well known as a collector of antiquities and works of art<ref>I. Bignamini, C. Hornsby, ''Digging And Dealing in Eighteenth-Century Rome'' (2010), p.321-322</ref>

Lord Shelburne was born in [[Dublin]] in 1737 and spent his formative years in Ireland. After attending [[Oxford University]] he served in the British army during the [[Seven Years' War]] taking part in the [[Raid on Rochefort]] and the [[Battle of Minden]]. As a reward for his conduct at the [[Battle of Kloster Kampen]] Shelburne was appointed an [[aide-de-camp]] to [[George III of Great Britain|George III]]. He became involved in politics, becoming a member of parliament in 1760. After his father's death in 1761 he inherited his title and was elevated to the [[House of Lords]] and took an active role in politics. He served as [[President of the Board of Trade]] in the [[Grenville Ministry]] but resigned this position after only a few months and began to associate with the opposition leader [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]].

When Pitt was made Prime Minister in 1766 Shelburne was appointed as [[Southern Secretary]], a position which he held for two years. He departed office during the [[Corsican Crisis]] and joined the Opposition. Along with Pitt he was an advocate of a conciliatory policy towards Britain's [[British America|American Colonies]] and a long-term critic of the [[North Ministry|North Government]]'s measures in America. Following the fall of the North government Shelburne joined its replacement led by [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]]. Shelburne was made Prime Minister in 1782 following Rockingham's death with the American War still being fought. Shelburne's government was brought down largely due to the terms of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] which brought the conflict to an end which were considered excessively generous.

Shelburne was one of the first British statesmen to advocate [[free trade]],<ref name=www.bowood.org.uk>Bowood House web page</ref> his conversion to which he attributed to a journey he made to London in 1761, when he accompanied [[Adam Smith]]. In 1795 he described this to [[Dugald Stewart]]:

<blockquote>I owe to a journey I made with Mr Smith from Edinburgh to London, the difference between light and darkness through the best part of my life. The novelty of his principles, added to my youth and prejudices, made me unable to comprehend them at the time, but he urged them with so much benevolence, as well as eloquence, that they took a certain hold, which, though it did not develope itself so as to arrive at full conviction for some few years after, I can fairly say, has constituted, ever since, the happiness of my life, as well as any little consideration I may have enjoyed in it.<ref>Ian S. Ross (ed.), ''On The Wealth of Nations. Contemporary Responses to Adam Smith'' (Bristol: Theommes Press, 1998), p. 147.</ref></blockquote>

==Early life==
He was born '''William Fitzmaurice''' in [[Dublin]] in [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], the first son of [[John Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne|John Fitzmaurice]], who was the second surviving son of the [[Thomas Fitzmaurice, 1st Earl of Kerry|1st Earl of Kerry]]. Lord Kerry had married Anne Petty, the daughter of Sir [[William Petty]], [[Surveyor General of Ireland]], whose elder son had been created Baron Shelburne in 1688 and (on the elder son's death) whose younger son had been created Baron Shelburne in 1699 and Earl of Shelburne in 1719. On the younger son's death the Petty estates passed to the aforementioned John Fitzmaurice, who changed his branch of the family's surname to "Petty" in place of "Fitzmaurice", and was created Viscount Fitzmaurice later in 1751 and Earl of Shelburne in 1753 (after which his elder son John was styled '''Viscount Fitzmaurice'''). His grandfather Lord Kerry died when he was four, but Fitzmaurice grew up with other people's grim memories of a "Tyrant" whose family and sevants lived in permanent fear of him.

Fitzmaurice's brother, the Hon. [[Thomas Fitzmaurice (MP)|Thomas Fitzmaurice]] (1742–1793) of [[Cliveden]], was the direct ancestor of [[Christopher Bullock|Sir Christopher Bullock]] (1891-1972), the [[Permanent Under-Secretary]] at the [[British Air Ministry]]. In 2012, it was reported that Sir Christopher's wife, [[Lupton family|Lady Bullock]], née Barbara Lupton  was the second cousin of [[Lupton family|Olive Middleton]], née Lupton, the great grandmother of [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nikkhah|first1=Roya|title=Duchess of Cambridge discovers blue blood in her own family|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/9747412/Duchess-of-Cambridge-discovers-blue-blood-in-her-own-family.html|publisher=UK Sunday Telegraph - 16 December, 2012|accessdate=October 29, 2014|quote=Mr Reed then spent several weeks tracing the Duchess’ family tree back five generations to the Marquess of Lansdowne and his brother, the Hon Thomas FitzMaurice, also an MP, who during the late 18th century lived at Cliveden, the stately home in Buckinghamshire with his wife, Mary, the 4th Countess of Orkney}}</ref>

Fitzmaurice  spent his  childhood "in the remotest parts of the south of Ireland,"<ref>Childhood in the remotest parts of the south of Ireland probably refers to the family estates in [[County Kerry]].  The Pettys owned the Lansdowne Estates in the [[Kenmare]] area in South Kerry and the Fitzmaurice estates were in the [[Lixnaw]] area in North Kerry.</ref> and, according to his own account, when he entered [[Christ Church, Oxford]], in 1755, he had "both everything to learn and everything to unlearn". From a [[tutor]] whom he describes as "narrow-minded" he received advantageous guidance in his studies, but he attributes his improvement in manners and in knowledge of the world chiefly to the fact that, as was his "fate through life", he fell in "with clever but unpopular connexions".

==Military career and election to Parliament==

[[File:Caton-Woodville Battle of Minden 1759.jpeg|thumb|Shelburne served with distinction during the Seven Years' War participating in engagements such as the [[Battle of Minden]] in 1759.]]
Shortly after leaving the university he served in [[20th Foot]] regiment commanded by [[James Wolfe]] during the [[Seven Years' War]]. He became friends with one of his fellow officers [[Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey|Charles Grey]] whose career he later assisted.<ref>Nelson p.20</ref> In 1757 he took part in the [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] [[Raid on Rochefort]] which withdrew without making any serious attempt on the town. The following year he was sent to serve in Germany and distinguished himself at [[Battle of Minden|Minden]] and [[Battle of Kloster-Kampen|Kloster-Kampen]].

On 2 June 1760, while still abroad, Fitzmaurice had been returned to the [[British House of Commons]] as member for [[Wycombe (UK Parliament constituency)|Wycombe]]. He was re-elected unopposed at the [[British general election, 1761|general election of 1761]],<ref name=HoP>Sir Lewis Namier, [http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/petty-william-1737-1805 PETTY, William, Visct.

==Early political career==
Shelburne's new military role close to the King brought him into communication with [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]], who was the King's closest advisor and a senior minister in the government. In 1761 Shelburne was employed by Bute to negotiate for the support of [[Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland|Henry Fox]]. Fox held the lucrative but unimportant post of [[Paymaster of the Forces]], but commanded large support in the House of Commons and could boost Bute's powerbase. Shelburne was opposed to Pitt, who had resigned from the government in 1761. Under instructions from Shelburne, Barré made a violent attack on Pitt in the House of Commons.

During 1762 negotiations for a peace agreement went on in London and Paris. Eventually a deal was agreed but it was heavily criticised for the perceived leniency of its terms as it handed back a number of captured territories to France and Spain. Defending it in the House of Lords, Shelburne observed "the security of the British colonies in North America was the first cause of the war" asserting that security "has been wisely attended to in the negotiations for peace".<ref>Schweizer p.17</ref> Led by Fox, the government was able to push the peace treaty through parliament despite opposition led by Pitt. Shortly afterwards, Bute chose to resign as Prime Minister and retire from politics and was replaced by [[George Grenville]].

Shelburne joined the [[George Grenville|Grenville]] ministry in 1763 as [[President of the Board of Trade|First Lord of Trade]]. By this stage Shelburne had changed his opinion of Pitt and become an admirer of him. After failing to secure Pitt's inclusion in the Cabinet he resigned office after only a few months. Having moreover on account of his support of Pitt on the question of [[John Wilkes|Wilkes's]] expulsion from the House of Commons incurred the displeasure of the King, he retired for a time to his estate.

===Southern Secretary===
After Pitt's return to power in 1766 he became [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department|Southern Secretary]], but during Pitt's illness his conciliatory policy towards America was completely thwarted by his colleagues and the King, and in 1768 he was dismissed from office. During the [[Corsican Crisis]], sparked by the [[French Conquest of Corsica|French invasion of Corsica]], Shelburne was the major voice in the cabinet who favoured assisting the [[Corsican Republic]]. Although secret aid was given to the Corsicans it was decided not to intervene military and provoke a war with France, a decision made easier by the departure of the hard-line Shelburne from the cabinet.

In June 1768 the General Court incorporated the district of [[Shelburne, Massachusetts]] from the area formerly known as "Deerfield Northeast" and in 1786 the district became a town.  The town was named in honour<!--this article should be written in British English--> of Lord Shelburne, who, in return sent a [[church bell]], which never reached the town.

===Opposition===
Shelburne went into Opposition where he continued to associate with [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]]. They were both critical of the policies of the [[North Ministry|North government]] in the years leading up to the outbreak of the [[American War of Independence]] in 1775. As the war progressed Shelburne co-operated with the [[Rockingham Whigs]] to attack the government of Lord North. After a British army was compelled to surrender at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777, Shelburne joined other leaders of the Opposition to call for a total withdrawal of British troops.

==Prime Minister==
{{Main|Shelburne Ministry}}
[[File:Joshua Reynolds - William Petty.jpg|thumb|right|Lord Shelburne by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]].]]
In March 1782 following the down fall of the [[North Ministry|North Government]] Shelburne agreed to take office under [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]] on condition that the King would recognise the United States. Following the sudden and unexpected death of Lord Rockingham on 1 July 1782 Shelburne succeeded him as Prime Minister. Shelburne's appointment by the King provoked [[Charles James Fox]] and his supporters, including [[Edmund Burke]], to resign their posts on 4 July 1782.<ref>Fleming p.179-180</ref> Burke scathingly compared Shelburne to his predecessor Rockingham. One of the figures brought in as a replacement was the 23-year-old [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], son of Shelburne's former political ally, who became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].

===Peace negotiations===
{{Further2|[[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]]}}
Shelburne's government continued to negotiate for peace in Paris using [[Richard Oswald (merchant)|Richard Oswald]] as the chief negotiator. Shelburne entertained a French peace envoy [[Joseph Matthias Gérard de Rayneval]] at his country estate in Wiltshire, and they discreetly agreed on a number of points which formed a basis for peace. Shelburne's own envoys negotiated a separate peace with American commissioners which eventually led to an agreement on American independence and the borders of the newly created United States. Shelburne agreed to generous borders in the [[Illinois Country]], but rejected demands by [[Benjamin Franklin]] for the cession of Canada and other territories.

===Downfall===
Fox's departure led to the unexpected creation of [[Fox-North Coalition|a coalition]] involving Fox and [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] which dominated the Opposition.  In April 1783 the Opposition forced Shelburne's resignation. The major achievement of Shelburne's time in office was the agreement of peace terms which formed the basis of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] bringing the American War of Independence to an end.

His fall was perhaps hastened by his plans for the reform of the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|public service]]. He had also in contemplation a Bill to promote free trade between Britain and the United States.

==Later life==
When [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] became Prime Minister in 1784, Shelburne, instead of receiving a place in the Cabinet, was created '''Marquess of Lansdowne'''. Though giving a general support to the policy of Pitt, he from this time ceased to take an active part in public affairs. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1803.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter L|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterL.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>
