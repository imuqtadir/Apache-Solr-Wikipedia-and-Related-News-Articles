'''Redbone''' is a term historically used in much of the [[southern United States]] to denote a multi-racial individual or culture.  In [[Louisiana]] it may also refer to a specific geographically and ethnically distinct group.

==Definition==
The term had various meanings according to locality, mostly implying [[multiracial]] people.<ref name="everett">Everett, C.S. "Brass Ankles/Red Bones," Vol. Ed. Celeste Ray, ''6 Encyclopedia of Southern Culture'' (University of North Carolina Press 2007), pp. 102-104</ref>  In Louisiana, the Redbone cultural group consists of the families of migrants to the state from [[South Carolina]] following the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803.<ref name="everett"/>  These individuals may have ancestral ties to the [[Melungeons]].  The term ''Redbone'' became disfavored as it was a pejorative nickname applied by others; however, in the past 30 years the term has begun to be used as the preferred description for some creole groups, including the Louisiana Redbones.

==Louisiana Redbone Cultural Group==
The Louisiana Redbone historically lived in geographically and socially isolated communities in the southwestern [[Louisiana]] parishes, ranging from [[Sabine Parish]] in the northwest and [[Rapides Parish]] near the center of the state down to [[Calcasieu Parish]] in the southwest,<ref name="everett"/> and also including parts of [[Orange County, Texas]] and [[Newton County, Texas]].  This area is roughly coextensive with what was once known as the [[Neutral Ground (Louisiana)|Neutral Ground]] or [[Sabine Free State]], when no US state exercised jurisdiction over the area from the [[Calcasieu River]] on the east to the [[Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)|Sabine River]] on the west.<ref>''See'' [[Adams-Onís Treaty]].</ref>  Families ancestral to the Louisiana Redbones came primarily from [[South Carolina]] (where they were at times classified in some census records as "[[free people of color|other free persons]]").<ref name="everett"/>  A review of newspaper articles, land grants, census records and other documents referring to the Redbones indicates that the main settlements of Redbones to southwestern and south central [[Louisiana]] and southeastern [[Texas]] took place over the course of many years<ref>http://www.ancestry.com/</ref>, although some members of Redbone families are noted as settling in the [[Neutral Ground (Louisiana)|Neutral Ground]] before 1818.<ref>''Claims to Land Between the Rio Hondo and Sabine Rivers in Louisiana.  Communicated to the Senate January 31, 1825''</ref>  

The ambiguity as to the origins of the members of the Redbone community and the prevailing cultural attitudes held by those living in the same region as the Redbone community but who were not part of the community is shown in a letter written in 1893 by Albert Rigmaiden, [[Calcasieu Parish]] Treasurer, to McDonald Furman, a South Carolinian who conducted private ethnological research.<ref>http://library.sc.edu/socar/uscs/1997/furman97.html</ref>  Rigmaiden wrote that he was unable to explain how the name Redbone originated and stated that "they are neither white nor black & as well as I can find out, the oldest ones came from S.C many years ago. . .they are not looked on as being -- Negros -- Indian nor White people. . ."<ref>http://redbone-red-bone.blogspot.com/</ref>

Newspaper references to individuals whose families are considered part of the historical Redbone community are notable mainly for those Redbones who settled along Ten Mile Creek in [[Rapides Parish]] and [[Allen Parish]].  Members of this settlement were referred to as "Ten Milers"<ref name="Baton Rouge Daily Advocate p. 2">The Baton Rouge Daily Advocate, 28 August 1857 p. 2</ref><ref>New Orleans Time Picayune, 9 September 1877</ref> or as "Red Bones" <ref>New Orleans Times Picayune 6 August 1891 p.8</ref><ref>New Orleans Times Picayune 5 August 1891 p.1</ref><ref>The New York Times 5 August 1891</ref><ref>New Orleans Times Picayune 3 July 1897 p.8</ref> in the 19th century. However, the term "Red Bone" was also used to refer to individuals of mixed race with some African American ancestry who were not a part of what is currently considered the "Louisiana Redbone" community.<ref>New Orleans Times 31 July 1874</ref>

In the frontier of Southwestern Louisiana, the settlers successfully resisted classification as non-white.  In 1837 and 1849, several of the members of the Redbone community were indicted for illegal voting on the charge that they were of color rather than white.  The state court found them all not guilty in both instances, thus establishing that the Redbone community would be legally considered white.<ref name="Baton Rouge Daily Advocate p. 2"/>  However, references to the Redbone community and its members in 19th century newspapers tend to be wildly divergent, ranging from making no mention of racial make up,<ref name="Baton Rouge Daily Advocate p. 2"/><ref>New Orleans Times Picayune 3 July 1892</ref> to stating that the members were white,<ref name="Baton Rouge Daily Advocate p. 2"/> to stating that the members were African American<ref>The Springfield Daily Republican 28 August 1857</ref><ref>The New York Times 28 August 1857</ref> to stating that the members were of Indian extraction <ref>New Orleans Times Picayune 6 August 1891</ref> to the assertion that the members were of unspecified mixed race.<ref>New Orleans Times Picayune 5 August 1891</ref>  These newspaper references do have the commonality of all pertaining to violent actions either within the community or perpetrated by members of the community.

Two incidents of violence are particularly notable, one due to the statement of Webster Talma Crawford and one due to amount of newspaper coverage the incident received. The Westport Fight occurred December 24, 1881 in southern [[Rapides Parish]]. As per the Crawford account, friction between the more recent settlers and the Redbones had been simmering for much of the month before exploding into a fight that involved several families in the community and ended in the burning down of a store owned by some of the recent settlers.<ref>http://library.mcneese.edu/depts/archive/FTBooks/redbones.htm</ref>  The Bearhead Creek incident took place in what is now southern [[Beauregard Parish]] on August 2, 1891.  This battle also occurred due to similar tensions between Redbone and more recent, non-Redbone settlers and left six men dead as well as several others wounded.<ref>Dallis Morning News 4 August 1891</ref><ref>Times Picayune 5 August 1891, p.1</ref><ref>Times Picayune August 6, 1891</ref><ref>Baton Rouge Daily Advocate 7 August 1891</ref><ref>Times Picayune August 9, 1891</ref><ref>New Orleans Item 11 August 1891</ref><ref>Dallas Morning News 11 September 1891</ref>  Both incidents illustrate the friction that existed between new, non-Redbone settlers to the region and the existing Redbone population, and it is these incidents in particular that may have cemented the non-Redbone view of this population as being both clannish and violent; however, a close reading of the incidents reveals that the tensions causing the fights arose primarily due to the prejudices of the new, non-Redbone settlers to the community.

During the days of the [[Jim Crow Laws]], the schools located in the geographic location of the Redbones accepted Redbone students as white and a review of [[United States Census]] records in the late 19th and early 20th century shows that families traditionally considered as members of the Redbone community were mainly recorded as white.  Additionally, according to the marriage records and census records, individuals who were from these families married either other members of the Redbone community or individuals who were listed in the census records as white.<ref>http://www.ancestry.com</ref>

Though their descendants now number over 20,000 and are dispersed to other states, especially eastern [[Texas]],<ref>''See'' [[Regulator-Moderator War]]</ref> academically the group has been termed "largely unstudied."<ref name="everett"/>

'''Doubt''', a status between [[belief]] and [[wikt:disbelief|disbelief]], involves [[uncertainty]] or [[distrust]] or lack of sureness of an alleged [[fact]], an action, a motive, or a [[Decision making|decision]].  Doubt brings into question some notion of a perceived "[[reality]]", and may involve delaying or rejecting relevant action out of concerns for mistakes or faults or appropriateness.  Some definitions of doubt emphasize the state in which the mind remains suspended between two contradictory propositions and unable to assent to either of them<ref>

[[File:Mr Pipo Think 03.svg|thumbnail|Doubt]]

The concept of doubt covers a range of phenomena: one can characterise both deliberate questioning of uncertainties and an [[emotion]]al state of indecision as "doubt".

==Impact on society==
Doubt sometimes tends to call on [[reason]]. Doubt may encourage people to [[procrastination|hesitate]] before acting, and/or to apply more [[rigour|rigorous]] methods. Doubt may have particular importance as leading towards disbelief or non-acceptance. Conservative billionaires used a secretive funding route to channel nearly $120m (£77m) to more than 100 groups casting doubt about the science behind climate change. They are attempting to create doubt in order to protect oil company revenues. <ref>http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/14/funding-climate-change-denial-thinktanks-network</ref>

[[Politics]], [[ethics]] and [[law]], with decisions that often determine the course of individual [[personal life|life]], place great importance on doubt, and often foster elaborate [[adversarial process]]es to carefully sort through all available evidence.

Societally, doubt creates an atmosphere of distrust, being accusatory in nature and ''de facto'' alleging either foolishness or deceit on the part of another. Such a stance has been fostered in Western European society since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], in opposition to [[tradition]] and [[authority]].

==Psychology==
[[Psychoanalysts]]{{Who|date=January 2009}} attribute doubt (which they may interpret as a symptom of a [[phobia]] emanating from the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]) to [[childhood]], when the ego develops. Childhood experiences, these traditions maintain, can plant doubt about one's abilities and even about one's very [[Personal identity|identity]].

[[Cognitive]] mental as well as more [[spirituality|spiritual]] approaches abound in response to the wide variety of potential causes for doubt. [[Behavioral therapy]] — in which a person systematically asks his own [[mind]] if the doubt has any real basis — uses rational, [[Socratic method]]s. This method contrasts to those of say, the [[Buddhist]] faith, which involve a more [[esoteric]] approach to doubt and inaction. Buddhism sees doubt as a negative attachment to one's perceived [[past]] and [[future]]. To let go of the personal [[history]] of one's life (affirming this release every day in [[meditation]]) plays a central role in releasing the doubts — developed in and attached to — that history.

Partial or intermittent negative [[reinforcement]] can create an effective [[climate of fear]] and doubt.<ref name=braiker>{{Cite book|title=Whos Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}</ref>

==Philosophy==
[[René Descartes|Descartes]] employed [[Cartesian doubt]] as a pre-eminent methodological tool in his fundamental philosophical investigations.
Branches of philosophy like [[logic]] devote much effort to distinguish the dubious, the [[probability|probable]] and the certain. Much of illogic rests on dubious assumptions, dubious data or dubious conclusions, with [[rhetoric]], [[whitewash (censorship)|whitewashing]], and [[deception]] playing their accustomed roles.

==Theology==
[[File:Caravaggio - The Incredulity of Saint Thomas.jpg|thumb|left|180px|''[[Doubting Thomas|The Incredulity of Saint Thomas]]'' by [[Caravaggio]].]]

Doubt that god(s) exist may form the basis of [[agnosticism]] — the belief that one cannot determine the existence or non-existence of god(s). It may also form other brands of [[skepticism]], such as [[Pyrrhonism]], which do not take a positive stance in regard to the existence of god(s), but remain negative. Alternatively, doubt over the existence of god(s) may lead to acceptance of a particular religion: compare [[Pascal's Wager]]. Doubt of a specific theology, scriptural or deistic, may bring into question the truth of that theology's set of beliefs. On the other hand, doubt as to some doctrines but acceptance of others may lead to the growth of [[heresy]] and/or the splitting off of [[sect]]s or groups of thought. Thus proto-[[Protestanism|Protestants]] doubted [[papal authority]], and substituted alternative methods of governance in their new (but still recognizably similar) churches.

[[Christianity]] often debates doubt in the contexts of [[salvation]] and eventual redemption in an [[afterlife]]. This issue has become particularly important in [[Protestantism]], which requires ''only'' the acceptance of [[Jesus]], though more contemporary versions have arisen within Protestant churches that resemble [[Catholicism]]. The debate appears less important in most other [[theology|theologies]]{{Who|date=October 2008}}, [[religion]]s and [[ethical tradition]]s.
[[File:Rae, Henrietta - Doubts - 1886.jpg|thumb|180px|''Doubts'', by [[Henrietta Rae]], 1886]]

Doubt as a path towards (deeper) [[belief]] lies at the heart of the story of Saint [[Thomas the Apostle]]. Note in this respect the theological views of [[Georg Hermes]]:

<blockquote>
... the starting-point and chief principle of every science, and hence of theology also, is not only methodical doubt, but positive doubt. One can believe only what one has perceived to be true from reasonable grounds, and consequently one must have the courage to continue doubting until one has found reliable grounds to satisfy the reason.<ref>

[[Christian existentialism|Christian existentialists]] such as [[Søren Kierkegaard]] suggest that for one to truly have belief in God, one would also have to doubt one's beliefs about God; the doubt is the rational part of a person's thought involved in weighing evidence, without which the belief would have no real substance. Belief is not a decision based on evidence that, say, certain beliefs about God are true or a certain person is worthy of love. No such evidence could ever be enough to pragmatically justify the kind of total commitment involved in true theological belief or romantic love. Belief involves making that commitment anyway. Kierkegaard thought that to have belief is at the same time to have doubt.<ref>''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'', ed. by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong, v. 1, Princeton University Press, 1992, pp. 21–57</ref><ref>''Soren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers'', trans. Hong and Malantschuk, p.399.</ref>

==Law==
Most [[criminal law|criminal]] cases within an [[adversarial system]] require that the prosecution proves its contentions [[beyond a reasonable doubt]] — a doctrine  also called the "[[Legal burden of proof|Burden of Proof]]". This means that the State must present propositions which preclude "reasonable doubt" in the mind of a [[reasonable person]] as to the guilt of defendant. Some doubt may persist, but only to the extent that it would ''not'' affect a "reasonable person's" belief in the defendant's guilt.  If the doubt raised ''does'' affect a "reasonable person's" belief, the jury is not satisfied beyond a "reasonable doubt".  The [[jurisprudence]] of the applicable jurisdiction usually defines the precise meaning of words such as "reasonable" and "doubt" for such purposes.

==Science==
Many scientific advances have been started by doubt on preceding hypothesis.

Originally from the ''[[World of Greyhawk]]'' [[campaign setting]], Vecna  was described as a powerful wizard who became a [[Lich (Dungeons & Dragons)|lich]].<ref name = "TOR"/> He was eventually destroyed, and his right hand and left eye were the only parts of his body to survive.

''[[Player's Handbook]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2000)</ref>—he is still described as missing both his left eye and left hand. Vecna's holy symbol is an eye in the palm of a left hand.

Vecna's "right hand man" and then ultimately his betrayer, is [[Kas the Bloody-Handed]], a [[Vampire (Dungeons & Dragons)|vampire]], whose sword, the [[Sword of Kas]] is also an artifact.

The Hand and Eye of Vecna were also mentioned in the 1979 ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' of [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons#Advanced Dungeons & Dragons|Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]'s first edition (1977–1988), on page 124.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Gygax | first = Gary  | author-link = Gary Gygax   | title = Dungeon Masters Guide  | place = Lake Geneva WI | publisher = TSR  | year = 1979 | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref> During the "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" years, Vecna was regarded only as a legend or myth, a long-destroyed legendary lich of great power, only able to threaten player characters who dared to use his Hand and Eye.

Ten years later, in [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons#Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition|Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition]]'s ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' (1989), Vecna's history was expanded under the description of his Hand and Eye. This information was further developed in 1993's ''[[Book of Artifacts]]''. With the release of the adventure ''[[Vecna Lives!]]'' in 1990, written in support of ''[[The City of Greyhawk]]'' boxed set, Vecna finally appeared in person, re-imagined as a demigod, and the chief antagonist of the adventure. At the end of the adventure—presuming the players defeat Vecna—he is transported to the ''[[Ravenloft]]'' campaign setting.<ref>[[David "Zeb" Cook|Cook, David]].

[[Wizards of the Coast]] continued the character's theme of ascending godhood in [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons#Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition|Dungeons & Dragons Third Edition]] (2000–2002) with the ''Player's Handbook'' (2000) listing him as a Lesser deity.<ref name = "PHB"/> Third Edition further raised Vecna's profile in the game, making him a member of the game's "core pantheon". Vecna's alignment was changed from Lawful Evil to Neutral Evil in Third Edition, and no in-game explanation has surfaced. Vecna's role in the 3rd edition Greyhawk setting was defined in the ''[[Living Greyhawk Gazetteer]]'' (2000).<ref>[[Holian, Gary]], [[Erik Mona]], [[Sean K Reynolds]], and [[Frederick Weining]].

==Description==
Vecna is usually depicted as a powerful magician resembling a desiccated corpse missing his left [[Hand of Vecna|hand]] and [[Eye of Vecna|eye]]. A constant theme in the adventures in which the character appears is Vecna's never-ending quest for power, ending, should he succeed, with Vecna as the only deity in existence.

==Relationships==
Vecna has few allies, and countless enemies. In 2nd and 3rd Edition, his greatest, and perhaps only true ally is the mysterious entity known as the [[Mok'slyk|Serpent]]. In 4th edition, the Open Grave book introduces Osterneth, the Bronze Lich, as the mightiest servant of Vecna. The famed [[Cambion (Dungeons & Dragons)|cambion]] lich, [[Acererak]], once served Vecna, but the current status of their relationship is unknown. Among Vecna's staunchest foes are [[Kas the Bloody-Handed|Kas]], [[Iuz]], [[Saint Cuthbert (Dungeons & Dragons)|Saint Cuthbert]], the [[Lady of Pain]], [[Pholtus]], the [[Circle of Eight]], and he is also opposed by the [[Old Faith]] and the [[Silent Ones]].

In 4th edition, Vecna's main foes in the realm of death and undeath are [[Kas the Bloody-Handed|Kas]], [[Orcus (Dungeons & Dragons)|Orcus]] and the [[Raven Queen]] (though he would rather she rule the dead than Orcus). Among the gods, [[Ioun]] is something of Vecna's antithesis, for she would share with the world all the knowledge he would keep secret.

==Dogma==

===Scriptures===
Being a secretive cult, there are no real collections of Vecnan teachings. However, copies of the ''[[Book of Vile Darkness]]'' are highly prized by the cult for Vecna's role in that work's development. The ''Open Grave'' book offers the "Scroll of Mauthereign", which offers a twisted version of Vecna's history and tells his followers that committing evil acts is a holy and righteous act.

==Worshippers==
Vecna's cult is very secretive, and cells have been uncovered, at various points in history, in [[Diamond Lake (Greyhawk)|Diamond Lake]], [[Greyhawk City|Greyhawk]], and [[Verbobonc]]. Temples to Vecna have also been reported in the [[Pomarj]] town of [[Highport]] and [[Erelhei-Cinlu]], the debased city at the heart of the [[Vault of the Drow]].

===Hierarchy===
Each position in Vecna's cult is named for a certain body part. At the top is Vecna himself, followed by the Voice of Vecna, which can only be filled by Vecna's manifestation.

Next is the Heart of Vecna, the high priest of the cult. The last known Heart of Vecna was [[Diraq Malcinex]] of [[Ket (Greyhawk)|Ket]], who was slain by adventurers in 581 CY.

Immediately below the Heart of Vecna are two bizarre monsters known as the Hand and the Eye. The [[Hand and Eye of Vecna (monsters)|Eye of Vecna]] creature appears as a slender humanoid with an eyeball for a head, whereas the [[Hand and Eye of Vecna (monsters)|Hand of Vecna]] appears as a stocky humanoid with a huge left hand where its head should be.

Individual congregations are known as organs. Each organ is led by a Thought of Vecna. Lesser priests are known as Memories of Vecna.

Lay members of the cult consist of the Teeth, Fingers, Blood, and Spawn of Vecna. The Teeth of Vecna are made up of [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|wizards]], and specialize in arcane spellcasting and crafting magical items for the cult. The Fingers of Vecna consist mainly of [[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|thieves]], who engage in various forms of subterfuge. The Blood of Vecna are mainly [[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|warriors]] charged with protection and enforcement of the cult and its goals. The Spawn of Vecna are the lowest in the cult hierarchy, and consist of the common people who honor the Lich Lord.

In 4th edition, the ''Open Grave'' book shows the leader of the cult of Vecna is a Lich named Mauthereign. Even when Osterneth, the Bronze Lich, is Vecna's mightiest servant, her position is not revealed among his files.

===Other Vecnan organizations===
Other Vecnan organizations are known to exist outside of the mainstream cult, and some may have similar or identical names. Relations between these groups and the mainstream cult may vary. Known examples are the Eyes of Vecna (a cult of undeath consisting mainly of rogues), the Fingers of Vecna (Vecna's personal guard), and the [[Ebon Triad]] (a heretical cult seeking to merge Vecna, [[Hextor]], and [[Erythnul]] into a single entity).

In 4th edition, a secret group known as the Keepers of the Forbidden Lore is devoted to Vecna. Unlike most Vecna worshippers, the Keepers reject most of the nasty and evil rituals and beliefs associated with the God; they worship Him as the God of Secrets, and believe that there is some knowledge too evil for the world to know. They instead hunt down secrets and information they deem to be too dangerous for the world at large and keep it secret in the name of Vecna. This puts them in opposition to mainstream followers of Vecna who regard the Keepers as heretics, and makes them enemies of Ioun and her followers, who believe all knowledge should be available for everybody and the moral obligations on how to use it rest on the shoulders of the individuals involved.

==Artifacts==
[[Image:VecnaLivesCover.jpg|thumb|The Hand and Eye of Vecna, as shown on the cover of ''[[Vecna Lives!]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1990)]]

===''Hand'' and ''Eye of Vecna''===
Vecna's left hand and eye of Vecna's original "mortal" lich form, which have never been replaced in his later more powerful incarnations, are now high-valued and very dangerous magical [[Magic item (Dungeons & Dragons)#Artifacts|artifacts]].<ref name="GDR"/> To use the powers of the ''[[Hand of Vecna]]'' or the ''[[Eye of Vecna]]'' one is required to cut off one's own corresponding body part and affix Vecna's in its place. The Hand of Vecna is considered a classic artifact in Dungeons & Dragons.<ref name="GDR"/>

===''Sword of Kas''===
Vecna created the ''[[Sword of Kas]]'' for his greatest servant, which contains a "portion of his consciousness."

This interpretation is relatively recent. As per the 1st edition ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', Vecna only procured this most powerful sword for his chief lieutenant. Similarly, depending on edition and source, its appearance has varied, from a short sword to a wavy bladed two hander. However, it is undoubtable that the ''Sword'' is inextricably tied to Vecna's relics.

===Other artifacts===
A number of Vecna's other body parts are presented as minor artifacts in ''Die Vecna Die!'', including the ''First Digit'' (right thumb), ''Second Digit'' (right index finger), ''Third Digit'' (right middle finger), ''Last Digit'' (right pinky finger), ''Incisors'' (a pair of inappropriately named fang-like canines), ''Molar'', ''Scalp'', ''Skin'', ''Heart'', ''Foot'' (left), and ''Right Eye''. These artifacts are collectively known in D&D 3rd Edition as the ''Fragments of Vecna''. The ''Compendium Maleficarum'' is a book of spells, doctrines, and secrets crafted entirely from bone (even the pages) and penned in blood, that is on par with the ''Fragments of Vecna''. The ''Tome of Shared Secrets'' is an illustrated bestiary of relic status, with the ability to impart knowledge of dark and evil creatures at the cost of a portion the user's life force. The ''Rod of the Whispered One'', while not nearly so powerful as the ''Sword of Kas'', is another item Vecna crafted to connect himself with his highest lieutenants. The final issue of Dragon Magazine, issue #359, featured rules for the "Left Ear of Vecna" as a minor artifact. It grants the owner magical bonuses to hearing and resisting sonic attacks, spell-like abilities to inflict deafness, grant clairaudience and create sonic blasts, and enables them to understand any spoken language. A lich known as Osterneth possesses the "Heart of Vecna" according to the ''Open Grave'' sourcebook.

===''Head of Vecna''===
The ''Head of Vecna'' was a hoax that one adventuring party played on another in a campaign run by [[game master]] Mark Steuer.  One of the groups tricked the other into going on a quest for the ''Head of Vecna'', a hoax [[Magic item (Dungeons & Dragons)#Artifacts|artifact]] that was supposedly similar to his ''Hand'' and ''Eye'', but was simply an ordinary severed head.  The hoax takes advantage of the fact that the ''Eye'' and ''Hand'' require a person to remove their own eye or hand and replace it with the artifact to function.  The characters involved in the story reasoned that they needed to decapitate themselves to gain the powers of the Head of Vecna, and several members of the group actually fought over which character would get to have his head cut off and replaced.  After the third character died, the joke was revealed.<ref>[http://www.sjgames.com/ill/1996/ill-dec96.html ''Daily Illuminator'', December 6, 1996]</ref>

The ''Head of Vecna'' was later mentioned by Morte, a floating skull in ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', when discussing his lack of a body, made a [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] appearance in the 2000 AD&D campaign ''[[Die Vecna Die!]]'', and was the subject of a short adventure on the Wizards of the Coast website in 2007.<ref>[http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/oa/20070401a The Head of Vecna: A D&D Adventure for Characters Levels 1–12]</ref>

Familiarity with the ''Head of Vecna'' was cited as an example characteristic of an avid role-playing gamer by writer [[David M. Ewalt]].<ref name=ODaM>{{cite book | first=David M. | last=Ewalt | authorlink= David M. Ewalt | year=2013 | title= Of Dice and Men: The Story of Dungeons & Dragons and the People Who Play It | publisher=Scribner | page=1 | isbn=978-1-4516-4052-6 }}</ref>

==Character History==
Vecna was born as a human, centuries ago as a member of the untouchable caste in the [[Flan (Greyhawk)|Flan]] city of [[Fleeth]] on [[Oerth]]. He was initially trained by his mother, [[Mazzel]], in the art of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], before she was executed by the government of Fleeth for practicing witchcraft. Vowing revenge, Vecna eventually assumed a mastery of the dark arts achieved by no mortal before or since. Some say this achievement was due to direct tutelage by  [[Mok'slyk]] the Serpent, believed to be the personification of arcane magic itself.

Nearly one thousand years after his birth, Vecna, now a [[Lich (Dungeons & Dragons)|lich]] and ruler of a great and terrible empire (in the [[Sheldomar Valley]], centered near the modern-day [[Rushmoors]]), laid siege to the city of Fleeth with an army of arcane spellcasters and undead. Legend has it that Vecna was nearly slain in this battle by clerics channeling the power of [[Pholtus]], the god of light. The clerics unleashed a great burst of light, which hit Vecna primarily on his left side. Vecna was rescued and brought to safety by one of his wizard generals, a cambion named [[Acererak]] (who would one day himself become a mighty [[Demilich (Dungeons & Dragons)|demilich]]).

Vecna eventually recovered. On the verge of conquering Fleeth, the officials of the city came before him to beg for mercy. They offered up the entire city and her wealth if only Vecna would spare the lives of her citizens. When Vecna was not satisfied, the officials offered their own lives. Vecna gave one of their number, Artau, and his family, over to his lieutenant, [[Kas the Bloody-Handed|Kas]], who spent the entire day torturing and murdering them before the other officials. Still unsatisfied, Vecna slaughtered all within the city, and had their heads stacked before the officials, with those of their family members prominent. Vecna then granted his mercy, granting the officials leave to depart, and promising them his protection for the rest of their lives.

At his empire's height, Vecna was betrayed and destroyed by his most trusted lieutenant, a vampire called [[Kas the Bloody-Handed]], using a magical sword that Vecna himself had crafted for him, now known as the [[Sword of Kas]]. Only his left hand and his eye survived the battle, perhaps because of the previous events in Fleeth.

Vecna did not stay gone forever, and rose as a [[demigod]] of magic and secrets in the world of [[Greyhawk]]. In 581 [[Common Year (Greyhawk)|CY]], his cult helped set events in motion that would have granted him the power of a [[greater god]], but the plan was ultimately foiled. After these events, Vecna ended up imprisoned in the demiplane of [[Ravenloft]], but broke free again later, emerging with the power of a greater god, after absorbing the power of [[Iuz]].  He then broke free into the city of [[Planescape|Sigil]], where he came perilously close to rearranging all existence to his whims.  (Vecna's [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] shattering campaign in Sigil is used as an in-universe way to explain the differences between the 2nd and 3rd editions of ''Dungeons & Dragons.'' When Vecna was ejected from Sigil by a party of adventurers, Iuz was freed and Vecna returned to Oerth greatly reduced in power, though still a lesser god.

In the events of the [[Living Greyhawk]] campaign setting, Vecna's machinations allowed him to reappear on the prime material plane and retake his place in the Oerth pantheon.

==Writings==
At some point in his history, Vecna penned a tome known as ''Ordinary Necromancy''. He is also rumored to have made significant additions to the ''[[Book of Vile Darkness]]''.

Although not actually penned by him, ''the Book of Keeping'' (a book of [[Yugoloth]] summoning) is heavily linked with the cult of Vecna, as the cultists have the only known copies that are free of the intentional errors introduced into the book by the fiends that wrote the volume as a trap for would-be summoners.

'''3D Realms''' (legal name '''Apogee Software, Ltd.''') is a current [[video game publisher]] and former [[video game developer]] based in [[Garland, Texas]], United States, established in 1987. It is best known for popularizing the [[shareware]] distribution model and as the creator of franchises on the [[Personal computer|PC]] such as ''[[Duke Nukem (game)|Duke Nukem]]'', and also the publisher of other franchises such as ''[[Commander Keen]]'' and ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]''.

While the company is known as "3D Realms", the legal name of the company is Apogee Software, Ltd. The name "3D Realms" was initially created as a branding label in July 1994 for use by Apogee which would be dedicated to just 3D games (as Apogee was then known for several styles of games). However, shortly after this, 3D games started to dominate the industry, and Apogee decided to direct its focus on this style of game; as such, "Apogee" was abandoned as a [[trade name]] in late 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.3drealms.com/profile.html |title=3D Realms Site: Corporate Profile |accessdate=July 3, 2008 |publisher=3D Realms |quote=3D Realms Entertainment and Pinball Wizards are divisions of Apogee, set up as alias (d/b/a) names.| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080702213306/http://www.3drealms.com/profile.html| archivedate= 2 July 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In July 2008, however, it announced that the brand Apogee Software would be revived with new games, but licensed to an external company, [[Apogee Software|Apogee Software, LLC]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5024833/apogee-return-to-feast-on-the-living-and-duke-nukem|title=Apogee Return To Feast On The Living (And Duke Nukem)|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=July 14, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080715204051/http://kotaku.com/5024833/apogee-return-to-feast-on-the-living-and-duke-nukem| archivedate= 15 July 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Background==
Apogee started in 1987 with the release of [[Scott Miller (programmer)|Scott Miller]]'s ''[[Kingdom of Kroz]]'', which used crude [[extended ASCII]] characters as graphics. Nevertheless, the game sold quite well and Apogee was born. In 1991, [[George Broussard]] joined the company as co-owner, bringing with him several games of his that were previously released under the name Micro F/X.

Apogee published games by other [[Video game developer|developers]] in addition to its own in-house titles. One of these developers, [[id Software]], contributed to Apogee's success with games such as ''[[Commander Keen]]'' and ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', but later severed their ties with Apogee with their release of ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' in 1993 (mostly because id was afraid Apogee could not handle the phone orders to upgrade the [[shareware]] version of ''Doom'').<ref>[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/198783/monsters_from_the_id_the_making_.php?print=1 Monsters from the Id: The Making of Doom]</ref>

==Shareware and the Apogee model==
Unlike traditional larger publishers that sold games in retail outlets, Apogee (like many independent developers) sold their products using the shareware method, depending mostly on [[Bulletin board system|BBSes]], such as [[Software Creations (US)|Software Creations]], for distribution of their software.

Initial Apogee games (''[[Beyond the Titanic]]'' and ''[[Supernova (computer game)|Supernova]]'') were distributed as traditional shareware; that is, giving away the full game for free, and asking the customer to pay for it if he/she liked it. Upon registering, the customer would be able to receive support and help for the game. However, this marketing model did not prove to be profitable enough, so Apogee decided to implement a variation on the shareware model. Starting with ''[[Kingdom of Kroz]]'', Apogee would provide the first installment of a game composed of several episodes (usually three) for free (as shareware), and sell the remaining installments by [[mail order]]. Registering the first episode would also enable the customer to receive support for that game, as well as giving them cheat codes for it. This method became known as the ''Apogee Model''{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}. Initially, each episode of a game was sold separately, with discounts for buying all the episodes together. Later games did not offer the option to buy a specific episode; the customer could play the shareware version (first episode) for free, and buy the full registered version (all episodes) if they liked the game. The former model has some similarities with the [[Episodic game|episodic]] model currently used by some game companies.

Apogee's commercial success led to the widespread adoption of the shareware model (and most of the time, the specific Apogee Model) by other major publishers such as [[Capstone Software|Capstone]], [[Parallax Software]], [[id Software]], [[Activision]] and [[Epic Games|Epic Megagames]], and also led to a growth of Software Creations BBS, which would become the largest BBS in North America. Apogee later moved to the traditional retail model through distributors like [[GT Interactive]]; however, it still offers its earlier titles via shareware.

==Apogee to 3D Realms==
[[File:apogee.png|right|frame|Original corporate logo of Apogee Software]]
With the original intent to create a division for every genre of game Apogee produced, the two brand names 3D Realms (formed in July 1994) and the now disused Pinball Wizards were created. Instead of publishing every game under Apogee as it had been in the past, the goal of this strategy was to create a different brand for each type of game genre, making each new game identifiable based on which brand it belonged to. This enabled Apogee to target different markets.

However, many of those varied genres such as [[Platform game|platform]] or [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooter]] (that were much of Apogee's early releases) were slowly dying out in the late 1990s, which made this strategy unnecessary. In addition, due to the increasingly lengthy development time in producing a game title, video game publishers were no longer releasing titles at the rapid rate at which they once were.

3D Realms was created in 1994 for the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] game ''[[Terminal Velocity (computer game)|Terminal Velocity]]'' and was responsible for the latest installments of the successful ''[[Duke Nukem (character)|Duke Nukem]]'' games and for producing the ''[[Max Payne]]'' series (earlier 3D games like ''[[Rise of the Triad]]'' were released under the Apogee name). The Pinball Wizards name was created for the 1997 [[pinball]] title ''[[Balls of Steel (game)|Balls of Steel]]'' but has not been used since.

The last game to be published under the Apogee name was ''[[Stargunner]]'' in 1996. Since 1998, all the company's games have been using a 3D engine (even if the gameplay is 2D, like in ''[[Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project]]''). As a result, 3D Realms has replaced Apogee as the brand name to publish games under. Also, by the end of the 1990s, Apogee felt their brand name was more associated with old, outdated games and adopted the 3D Realms brand for all future releases.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} When the 3D Realms name was first conceived, the official motto was ''Reality is our Game''. This motto is no longer used.

The Apogee name was spun off as [[Apogee Software|Apogee Software LLC]] in 2008.

==Current state and products==
The latest game released by 3D Realms was ''[[Prey (video game)|Prey]]'', on July 11, 2006 after being in [[development hell|development]] for eleven years. Prey was originally developed internally by 3D Realms, but after several years of delays, the company outsourced the development to [[Human Head Studios]].

The other major project that 3D Realms was working on was ''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]'', the sequel to ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]''. It was announced in 1997, and on May 6, 2009, its [[Development of Duke Nukem Forever|development]] was halted due to the development team being let go.<ref name="pressrelease" /> The official release date of the game was "when it's done."<ref>[http://www.3drealms.com/duke4/ 3D Realms Site: Duke Nukem Forever]. 3D Realms. Retrieved January 13, 2007.</ref> During the years of the development of the game, some outside developers have developed and published ''Duke Nukem'' spinoffs.

On May 6, 2009, due to lack of funding, major staff cuts were initiated with the entire development team being laid off and other employees being given notice of their employment with the company being terminated.<ref name="shutdown">{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58519 | title = Duke Nukem Developer 3D Realms Shuts Down (Updated) | first = Nick | last = Breckon |author2= Faylor, Chris | date = May 6, 2009 | accessdate =May 6, 2009 | publisher=[[Shacknews]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090507234540/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58519| archivedate= 7 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The official company website briefly went offline on that day, but went back up soon afterwards. While there was no official statement at that moment on the closure, apart from messages on the 3D Realms forum, a final message appeared in the front page of the site, showing a group photo of the 3D Realms team, with the caption "Goodbye. Thanks for being fans and for all your support."

It was reported on May 14, 2009 that [[Take-Two]], holders of the publishing rights of ''Duke Nukem Forever'', filed a breach of contract suit against Apogee Software Ltd (3D Realms) over failing to deliver the aforementioned title.<ref name="lawsuit">{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58642 | title = Take-Two Sues 3D Realms for Failing to Deliver Duke Nukem Forever (Updated) | first = Nick | last = Breckon | date = May 14, 2009 | accessdate =May 16, 2009 | publisher=[[Shacknews]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090516154730/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58642| archivedate= 16 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Take-Two has asked for a restraining order and a preliminary injunction, to make 3D Realms keep the ''Duke Nukem Forever'' assets intact during proceedings.<ref name="lawsuit2">{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58651 | title = Take-Two v. 3D Realms Court Documents Materialize, 3DR's Scott Miller Responds | first = Nick | last = Breckon | date = May 15, 2009 | accessdate =May 16, 2009 | publisher=[[Shacknews]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090518092202/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58651| archivedate= 18 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="lawsuit3">{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58664 | title = No $30M Offer for Duke Nukem IP, Says 3D Realms | first = Chris | last = Faylor| date = May 16, 2009 | accessdate =May 16, 2009 | publisher=[[Shacknews]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090518094006/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58664| archivedate= 18 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

On May 18, 2009 3D Realms key executives released the first full official "press release" with their side of the developments.
"... 3D Realms (3DR) has not closed and is not closing. ... Due to lack of funding, however, we are saddened to confirm that we let the Duke Nukem Forever (DNF) development team go on May 6,... While 3DR is a much smaller studio now, we will continue to operate as a company and continue to licence and co-create games based upon the Duke Nukem franchise. ... Take-Two’s proposal was unacceptable to 3DR for many reasons, including no upfront money, no guarantee minimum payment, and no guarantee to complete the DNF game. ...we viewed Take-Two as trying to acquire the Duke Nukem franchise in a “[[fire sale]].” ...we believe Take-Two’s lawsuit is without merit and merely a bully tactic to obtain ownership of the Duke Nukem franchise. We will vigorously defend ourselves against this publisher."<ref name="pressrelease">{{cite web | url = http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/05/3d-realms-were-not-closing-spent-20-million-on-duke-nukem-forever/#more-337797 | title = 3D Realms: We're not closing, Spent $20M on Duke Nukem Forever | date = May 18, 2009 | accessdate =May 19, 2009 | publisher=[[Kotaku]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090522225923/http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/05/3d-realms-were-not-closing-spent-20-million-on-duke-nukem-forever/| archivedate= 22 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

On the September 3, 2010, Take-Two announced that development of ''Duke Nukem Forever'' had been shifted over to [[Gearbox Software]], effectively ending 3D Realms' association with the game after 12 years of stunted development. 3D Realms remained a co-developer on ''Duke Nukem Forever'', due to their involvement in developing most of the game. However, the rights and intellectual property have been sold to Gearbox, who are now the owners of the Duke Nukem franchise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ripten.com/2010/09/05/gearbox-announcement-we-own-duke-nukem-maule|title=Gearbox Announces: "We Own Duke Nukem"|author=Garrett Hartman}}</ref>

3D Realms still retains certain rights to the Duke Nukem franchise including but not limited to the rights to all Duke Nukem games prior to Duke Nukem Forever and the rights to the Duke Nukem Movie.

In an interview conducted with Scott Miller in April 2011 Miller specified that 3D Realms is currently involved with several projects citing, "Yes, we have several projects underway, all fairly small—not any big console games.  Once DNF comes out we'll be definitely looking to invest into other projects, and maybe other up-n-coming teams who are blazing new trails on smaller platforms, like smart phones and XBLA. We have a long history of investing in young, unproven teams, going way back to Id Software, and including other notables like Parallax Software (we were the first studio to invest in Descent), and Remedy Entertainment (Death Rally and Max Payne).  So, we like that model and will keep doing it in the future. We seem to have a good eye for unproven talent waiting for some experienced guidance and hard-to-find funding".<ref>{{cite web| url    = http://duke4.net/news.php?item.449.4| title  = Our Five-Question Interview with 3D Realms CEO Scott Miller| author = Green| date   = 15 April 2011| work   = Duke 4| publisher  = | accessdate = }}</ref>

In June 2013, 3D Realms sued Gearbox for unpaid royalties as well as unpaid money for selling the Duke Nukem IP.<ref>{{cite web|last=Narcisse|first=Evan|title=Duke Nukem Creators 3D Realms Suing Gearbox over Unpaid Royalties|url=http://kotaku.com/duke-nukem-creators-3d-realms-suing-gearbox-over-duke-n-513153451|publisher=Kotaku}}</ref> The lawsuit was dropped in September 2013 with 3D Realms claiming they had resolved any differences they had with Gearbox.

3D Realms has since licensed out rights to some of its older titles, leading to remakes [[Rise of the Triad (2013 video game)|Rise of the Triad]] by [[Interceptor Entertainment]] (developers of the halted [[Duke Nukem 3D: Reloaded]], as well as modern ports of older Apogee/3D Realms titles) and [[Shadow Warrior (2013 video game)|Shadow Warrior]] by [[Flying Wild Hog]] being released in 2013. Rise of the Triad was published by the revived [[Apogee Software]] label.

On March 3, 2014 it was announced that [[Interceptor Entertainment]] has bought the company and Mike Nielsen has been appointed as new CEO of the company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-03-03-interceptor-buys-3d-realms-amid-gearbox-lawsuit|title=Interceptor buys 3D Realms amid Gearbox lawsuit|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|date=3 March 2014|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>

'''Honesty''' refers to a [[facet]] of [[moral character]] and connotes positive and [[virtue|virtuous]] attributes such as [[integrity]], [[truth]]fulness, and straightforwardness, including straightforwardness of conduct, along with the absence of lying, cheating, theft, etc. Furthermore, honesty means being trustworthy, [[Loyalty|loyal]], [[wikt:fair#Adjective|fair]], and [[Sincerity|sincere]].

Honesty is valued in many ethnic and religious cultures.<ref>Rogers, Carl R. (1964.)

'''James Sevier Conway''' (December 9, 1796 – March 3, 1855) was a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[List of Governors of Arkansas|Governor]] of the State of [[Arkansas]] and the first elected governor of the state.

==Biography==
Conway was born in [[Greene County, Tennessee]] and was educated by private tutors and attended public schools. In 1820, he moved to Arkansas where he worked as a surveyor. 

Conway formed a surveying business with two of his brothers. Conway's company took over the land that would later become the city of [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] and he is known as the founder of that city. Conway purchased a large cotton plantation named [[Walnut Hill%2C Arkansas|Walnut Hill]] in what is now [[Lafayette County, Arkansas|Lafayette County]] (then part of [[Hempstead County, Arkansas|Hempstead County]]). 

==Career==
In 1832, Conway became the surveyor-general of the Arkansas Territory and served in that position until 1836.

Conway became the first elected [[Governor of Arkansas]] when it became a state in 1836. His administration focused on developing schools and roads. He established a state military to patrol the western frontier and worked to have a federal arsenal built in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]. He worked to get funding for a state penitentiary. He pushed for the establishment of a state library and university but was unsuccessful.

Conway left office in 1840 and returned to his plantation. He continued to be active in public affairs.

==Family life==
While living in Lafayette County, Arkansas, Conway met Mary Jane Bradley, who had also migrated with her family from Tennessee. They were married December 21, 1825. They had ten children, five of whom died in infancy or early childhood.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=97|title=James Sevier Conway (1796–1855)|publisher=The Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref>

Conway was the brother of Arkansas Governor [[Elias Nelson Conway]], brother of Congressman [[Henry Wharton Conway]], first cousin of Senator [[Ambrose Hundley Sevier]] and Governor [[Henry Massey Rector]]. He was third cousin of Confederate General and Virginia Governor [[James Lawson Kemper]].

==Death and legacy==
Conway died from the complications of [[pneumonia]] on March 3, 1855. He is buried at the [[Conway Cemetery Historic State Park]], at the site of the old Walnut Hill plantation, near [[Bradley, Arkansas]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=18486|title=James Sevier Conway|publisher= Find A Grave|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref>

Conway helped establish Lafayette Academy in Greene County, Tennessee.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=97|title=James Sevier Conway (1796–1855)|publisher=The Central Arkansas Library System|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref>

The city of [[Conway, Arkansas]] is named after him.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=11449|title=Profile for Conway, Arkansas, AR|publisher= ePodunk|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref>

'''Thioridazine''' ('''Mellaril''' <small>([[Germany|DE]], [[Bangladesh|BD]], [[Ethiopia|ET]], [[Indonesia|ID]], [[Brazil|BR]])</small>, '''Melleril''' (withdrawn worldwide in 2005<ref name = NHS/>), '''Sonapax''' <small>([[Russian Federation|RU]])</small>, '''Thioril''' <small>([[India|IN]])</small>) is a [[piperidine]] typical [[antipsychotic]] [[psychoactive drug|drug]] belonging to the [[phenothiazine]] drug group and was previously widely used in the treatment of [[schizophrenia]] and [[psychosis]]. Due to concerns about [[cardiotoxicity]] and [[retinopathy]] at high doses this drug has been withdrawn in many countries (including the UK and Australia) and in other countries it is not commonly prescribed, reserved for patients who have failed to respond to, or have [[contraindication]]s for, more widely used antipsychotics.

In older references, it is sometimes described as [[atypical antipsychotic|atypical]],<ref name="pmid6540455">{{cite journal |author=Robertson A, MacDonald C |title=Atypical neuroleptics clozapine and thioridazine enhance amphetamine-induced stereotypy |journal=Pharmacol.

The atypicality of second generation agents is not clearly defined. Some believe it's low D2 affinity, quick dissociation, 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, or all of the above. Its perceived atypical effects (namely its comparatively low propensity for [[extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal side effects]]) are likely the result of its potent [[anticholinergic]] effects.

==Metabolism==
Thioridazine is a [[racemic]] compound with two [[enantiomer]]s, both of which are metabolized, according to Eap et al., by [[CYP2D6]] into (S)- and (R)-thioridazine 2-sulfoxide, better known as [[mesoridazine]],<ref>[http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?sid=447728 PubChem Substance Summary: Mesoridazine] National Center for Biotechnology Information.</ref> and into (S)- and (R)-thioridazine-5-sulfoxide.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eap CB, Guentert TW, Schaublin-Loidl M, Stabl M, Koeb L, Powell K, Baumann P |date=Mar 1996 | title = Plasma levels of the enantiomers of thioridazine, thioridazine 2-sulfoxide, thioridazine 2-sulfone, and thioridazine 5-sulfoxide in poor and extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan and mephenytoin | url = | journal = Clinical Pharmacology & Therapy | volume = 59 | issue = 3| pages = 322–31 | pmid = 8653995 | doi=10.1016/S0009-9236(96)80010-5}}</ref> Mesoridazine is in turn metabolized into [[sulforidazine]].<ref>[http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?sid=300587&namedisopt=&ncount=12#Synonyms PubChem Substance Summary: Sulforidazine] National Center for Biotechnology Information.</ref> Thioridazine is an inhibitor of [[CYP1A2]] and CYP3A2.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.if-pan.krakow.pl/pjp/pdf/2001/6_615.pdf | pmid = 11985335 | volume=53 | issue=6 | title=Effects of phenothiazine neuroleptics on the rate of caffeine demethylation and hydroxylation in the rat liver | year=2001 | journal=Pol J Pharmacol | pages=615–21 | author=Daniel WA, Syrek M, Ry&#x142;ko Z, Kot M}}</ref>

==History==
The manufacturer [[Novartis]]/Sandoz/Wander of the brands of thioridazine, Mellaril in the USA and Canada and Melleril in Europe, discontinued the drug worldwide in June 2005.

The usual dosage was 10–75&nbsp;mg per day for mild cases to 600–800&nbsp;mg per day for severely disturbed patients.

Thioridazine is still available from other manufacturers as a generic drug with the precaution that it is used only in psychotic patients refractory to other forms of drug treatment. ECG-monitoring and frequent [[white blood cell]] counts are required before initiating therapy and in close intervals afterwards. Low-dose thioridazine (10–50 mg per day) is somewhat popular in Russia for the treatment of [[somatoform disorder]]s, [[panic attack]]s, hyperactive-impulsive type of [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and insomnia associated with [[alcohol withdrawal]].

A multi-year UK study by the Alzheimer's Research Trust suggested that this and other [[neuroleptic]] [[anti-psychotic]] drugs commonly given to Alzheimer's patients with mild behavioural problems often make their condition worse. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}<ref>

The current study helps to inform a clinical management strategy for current practice, but the considerable risks of maintenance therapy highlight the urgency of further work to find, develop, and implement safer and more effective treatment approaches for neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with AD.}}

WARN  - 2014-11-30 14:42:46.820; org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.SolrWriter; Error creating document : SolrInputDocument(fields: [contents=An '''ideal''' is a [[principle]] or [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]] that one actively pursues as a [[goal]], usually in the context of [[ethics]].  Ideals are particularly important in ethics, as the order in which one places them tends to determine the degree to which one reveals them as real and sincere. It is the application, in ethics, of a [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]]. It is roughly similar to the [[Relative value (philosophy)|relative]] [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]s.

Someone who claims to have an ideal of [[honesty]] but is willing to [[lie]] to protect a friend is demonstrating that not only does he hold [[friendship]] as an ideal, but, that it is a more important one than honesty. Thus ideals can be seen to be similar to [[values]].

However, the [[-ism]] of ideals is slightly contrasted with [[idealism]] (which is the doctrine that ideas, or thought, make up either the whole or an indispensable aspect of any full reality, so that a world of material objects containing no thought either could not exist as it is experienced, or would not be fully "real.")

==In applied ethics==
In some theories of [[applied ethics]], such as that of [[Rushworth Kidder]], there is importance given to such orders as a way to [[dispute resolution|resolve disputes]].  In [[law]], for instance, a [[judge]] is sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of fairness.

==In politics==
In [[politics]] ideals play a pivotal role.  During the [[French Revolution]], the principles of "[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood]]" were raised to the status of ideals. The [[Ten Key Values of the Green Party]] are likewise raised to such status today. In fact, most political movements have a certain set of ideals. However, in many cases, one can easily find instances where ideals were "not lived up to" - some of which are cases where one simply proved to outweigh another for some specific decision, or where all were compromised simply to retain the [[power (sociology)|power]] to continue to pursue them.

==Idols and heroes==
A different form of ideal is an [[idolatry|idol]] or [[hero]], who is held up as a [[moral example]].  Since this is an actual person or fictional character, it is too complex and multi-faceted to be considered an ideal in the abstract sense. However, when they are encountered in the form of a story, with only a few traits on display, they are a simplified [[archetype]] from which one can very easily derive [[stereotype]]s or mimicry.  In [[Islam]], for instance, the life of [[Muhammad]] is held up as "ideal", but must be interpreted for believers through the tale of his life, or [[Sirah Rasul Allah|sira]], and his many sayings, the [[hadith]].

==Ideal and virtue==
Given the complexity of putting ideals into practice, and resolving conflicts between them, it is not uncommon to see them reduced to [[dogma]]. One way to avoid this, according to [[Bernard Crick]], is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a process, rather than an outcome.  His [[political virtues]] try to raise the practical habits useful in resolving disputes into ideals of their own.  A [[virtue]], in general, is an ideal that one can make a [[habituation|habit]].

==Relative ideal==
In formal axiology, [[Robert S. Hartman]] contended that being ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class. For example, the ideal student is the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since we can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is. For example, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is not as "good" as a very smooth one drawn with a compass. In the world in general, each particular object ought to become more like its ideal. In [[ethics]], by analogy, each person should attempt to become more of an ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self.

'''Michael Shawn Hickenbottom''' (born July 22, 1965), better known by his [[ring name]], '''Shawn Michaels''', is an American [[professional wrestling]] personality, [[television presenter]], retired [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], and occasional [[referee]]. He has been signed to [[WWE]], as an [[ambassador]] and occasional appears in non-wrestling roles, since December 2010. He wrestled for WWE, formerly the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), from 1988 until his first retirement in 1998. He held non-wrestling roles from 1998 to 2000 and resumed wrestling in 2002 until retiring ceremoniously in 2010.

In the WWF/WWE, Michaels headlined major [[pay-per-view]] events from 1989 to 2010, main-eventing the company's premier annual event, [[WrestleMania]], five times. He was a key player in the successful stable, [[D-Generation X]]. He also wrestled in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), where he founded [[The Rockers|The Midnight Rockers]] with [[Marty Jannetty]] in 1985. After winning the [[AWA Tag Team Championship]] twice, the team continued to the WWF as The Rockers, and had a high-profile breakup in January 1992.

Michaels was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in 2011.

==Professional wrestling career==

===NWA, AWA and WWF (1984&ndash;1988)===
Hickenbottom began to train under Mexican professional wrestler [[Jose Lothario]].<ref name=stopper>{{cite web|url= http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/2004/03/14/381421.html|title=Shawn Michaels, still the show-stopper|first=Jaya|last=Roopansingh|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam!

{{Main|The Rockers}}
[[File:The Rockers - Michaels and Jannetty.jpg|thumb|left|Michaels (left) with [[Marty Jannetty]] during their time as [[The Rockers]].]]

In October 1990, The Rockers were scheduled to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Hart Foundation]] ([[Bret Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart]]), as Neidhart, half of the championship team, was in the process of negotiating his release from the company.<ref name=sm148/> The match was taped with The Rockers winning the belts, but soon after, Neidhart came to an agreement with management and was rehired.<ref name=sm148/> The belts were returned to the Hart Foundation, while the title change was never broadcast or even acknowledged on television.<ref name=sm148/> When news spread, WWF explained that the original result was void due to a collapsed [[turnbuckle]] in the ring during the bout. A buckle had indeed broke, but not to a noticeable or dangerous extent during the match.<ref name="HAT"/> The Rockers continued their partnership, eventually splitting on December 2, 1991 during an incident on [[Edward Leslie|Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake's]] televised ''Barber Shop'' talk show [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promotional segment]].<ref name=sm159>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=157–159}}</ref> Michaels [[superkick]]ed Jannetty and [[Defenestration|threw him]] through a [[Sugar glass|glass]] window on the set of Beefcake's talk show.<ref name=stopper/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/583/583410p1.html|title=IGN: Shawn Michaels Interview| last=Robinson|first=Jon|date=2005-01-28|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|work=[[IGN]] Sports|accessdate=2008-08-06}}</ref> Jannetty returned to the WWF the following year and enjoyed moderate success before leaving the company in 1994, while Michaels became a prominent villain of the early to mid-1990s as "The Boy Toy."<ref name=sm159/>

At the suggestion of [[Curt Hennig|"Mr Perfect" Curt Hennig]], Michaels adopted the nickname "The Heartbreak Kid."<ref name=stopper/> Along with his new name came a new [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] as a vain, cocky [[heel (professional wrestling)|villain]].<ref name=shining>{{cite journal|first=Steve|last=Anderson|title=7 Superstars Shining Brightly|work=Wrestling Digest|date=February 2001}}</ref> He was put together with mirror-carrying [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]], [[Sherri Martel|Sensational Sherri]], who, according to the storyline, had become infatuated with him.<ref name=sm159/> Sherri even sang the first version of his new [[theme music]], "Sexy Boy."<ref name="HAT"/> During that period, after Michaels had wrestled his scheduled match at live events, his departure was announced with "Shawn Michaels has left the building", alluding to the phrase "[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] has left the building".<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=165–166}}</ref>

[[File:Shawn and Diesel tag champs.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] acted as Michaels's on-air bodyguard and tag team partner for two [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|championship reigns]].]]
At [[WrestleMania VIII]], in his first pay-per-view singles match, Michaels defeated [[Tito Santana|El Matador]]: both men had simultaneously eliminated each other from that year's [[Royal Rumble (1992)|Royal Rumble]].<ref>[http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/8/results WrestleMania VIII: Full Event Results].

In September 1993, Michaels left the WWF.

He returned to WWF television in November at the [[Survivor Series (1993)|Survivor Series]] pay-per-view, substituting for [[Jerry Lawler]], who was dealing with legal issues, in a match pitting himself and three of Lawler's "Knights" against the Hart brothers, Bret, [[Bruce Hart (wrestler)|Bruce]], [[Keith Hart (wrestler)|Keith]] and [[Owen Hart|Owen]].<ref name=pwi92>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=91–92}}</ref>

====Kliq, WWF Champion and D-Generation X (1995–1997)====
Michaels returned to the ring, as a fan favorite, in May 1995.

[[Image:Hug MSG Incident.jpg|thumb|left|165px|[[The Kliq#Curtain Call: The MSG Incident|The MSG Incident]].]]
After teasing a retirement, Michaels returned to the WWF at the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|Royal Rumble]] match in 1996, which he wound up winning for a second year in a row, to receive a [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] match in the main event at [[WrestleMania XII]].<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|page=95}}</ref> Around this time, Jose Lothario became Michaels' on-screen manager.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=219}}</ref> At WrestleMania XII, Michaels defeated WWF Champion Bret Hart in the overtime of their sixty minute [[Iron Man match]], which had ended in a scoreless tie.<ref name=stopper/> On May 19, 1996, Michaels and his fellow Kliq members were involved in the incident known as "[[The Kliq#Curtain Call: The MSG Incident|Curtain Call]]". Diesel and Razor Ramon were about to leave WWF to company rival WCW. After Michaels won a match against Diesel, Ramon and [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] came to the ring and joined Michaels and Diesel in a group-hug.<ref name=assael156>{{harv|Assael|Mooneyham|2002|p=156}}</ref> As Diesel and Helmsley were seen as villains at the time, in contrast to Michaels and Ramon, this constituted a breach of "[[kayfabe]]", as acting out of character, which was rare and controversial at the time.<ref name=assael156/> As WCW gained momentum due to the signings of Hall and Nash, Michaels held the championship for most of the year.

It was widely known by fans about the real-life personal issues going on between Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart throughout the spring of 1997. Both men would go out on television and make personal, insulting remarks about one another. Shawn Michaels briefly left the WWF in June 1997 after a real life backstage fight with Bret Hart at a house show, which stemmed from Michaels making an on-air remark alleging that Bret (who was married at the time) was having an affair with then WWF Diva Sunny. Shawn Michaels and Stone Cold Steve Austin were still WWF Tag Team Champions at the time during the ongoing feud with The Hart Foundation and a tournament was made to decide new Tag Champions. Michaels would return later that summer in July. At [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]], Michaels officiated the WWF Championship match between WWF Champion [[The Undertaker]] and Bret Hart.<ref name="takerSS">{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=247–249}}</ref> The match ended in controversial fashion, with Michaels hitting Undertaker with a chair (unintentionally, as he was aiming for Bret after he spat in his face).<ref name="takerSS"/> Michaels was then forced to award the championship to his nemesis, Bret Hart.<ref name="takerSS"/> The next night on Raw, signs of a heel turn started to show as Michaels told the WWF fans what happened at SummerSlam was an accident and that he would deal with the Undertaker when the time came.

In the fall, Michaels joined forces with real-life friend, Hunter Hearst Helmsley (Triple H), Hunter's then-girlfriend, [[Chyna]], and [[Rick Rude]] to form the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]], [[D-Generation X]] (DX).<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=252}}</ref> Moving away from the family-oriented product, this marked the beginning of the [[The Attitude Era|WWF Attitude Era]].<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=255}}</ref> Michaels continued his rivalry with Bret Hart and his reformed [[The Hart Foundation#The (New) Hart Foundation|Hart Foundation]], which was now a pro-Canada stable.

Michaels later claimed the flag desecration was Bret's idea.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=274–275}}</ref> Michaels' feud with the Hart Foundation culminated in a championship match at [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]] in 1997 against Bret Hart.

Michaels was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 2 by Triple H.

He returned on the June 27 ''Raw'', where he was confronted by [[CM Punk]], and superkicked [[David Otunga]] and [[Michael McGillicutty]]. Later that night, when [[Diamond Dallas Page]]'s special appearance was interrupted by [[Drew McIntyre]], he superkicked McIntyre.<ref>{{cite web|first=Dale|last=Plummer|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2011/06/27/18343201.html|title=Punk overshadows Raw Roulette|accessdate=2011-10-30|date=2011-06-27|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam!

August 6 was "Shawn Michaels Appreciation Night". He appeared on ''Raw'', where he was confronted by Brock Lesnar, then again after the broadcast for the Appreciation Night ceremonies. On the January 24 ''[[NXT Wrestling|WWE NXT]]'', he announced a tournament to crown the inaugural [[NXT Tag Team Champions]].

On the April 1, 2013 ''Raw'', Michaels returned to offer to corner Triple H in his match with Lesnar at WrestleMania 29. During that match, Michaels superkicked an interfering Paul Heyman, helping Triple H win and keep his job. He returned on the May 27 ''Raw'' in a backstage segment with John Cena, and again on the [[SummerSlam (2013)|SummerSlam]] pre-show.

In October 2013, Michaels won a fan poll to become special guest referee for the [[Hell in a Cell (2013)|Hell in a Cell]] match between Daniel Bryan and Randy Orton for the vacant [[WWE Championship]]. There, he superkicked Bryan, allowing Orton to pick up the win. The next night on ''Raw'', he explained that he was upset with Bryan for attacking Triple H during the match. He degraded Bryan for not showing him respect, turning heel for the first time since 2005. Bryan put him in his Yes Lock finisher to end the segment. On December 9, he presented Bryan with the award for Superstar of the Year. Later that night, Bryan hit Michaels with a running knee after Michaels had super-kicked [[CM Punk]].

==Personal life==
Hickenbottom's first marriage, to Theresa Wood, soon ended in an amicably settled divorce.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=194}}</ref> He married former WCW [[Nitro Girls|Nitro Girl]] Rebecca Hickenbottom (née Curci) (previously known as Whisper) on March 31, 1999, at the [[Graceland Wedding Chapel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=296}}</ref> Only the couple and an [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] impersonator were present.

Hickenbottom has several tattoos. On his bicep is a heart with a sword through it, and a snake around both in the shape of an "S." On his ring finger is an "R" for his wife Rebecca, and his children's names are on his left wrist, like a bracelet. On his left leg is a picture of his wife, on the right is the state of Texas. On his right hip is a small broken heart with "HBK" above it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/superstarink/articles/hbksuperstardomandsalvationinink|title=Shawn Michaels: Superstardom and salvation in ink|date=2008-03-13|last=Zeigler|first=Zack|accessdate=2008-03-14|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref>

In 1996, Hickenbottom posed for a non-nude layout in ''[[Playgirl]]'' magazine. Only after he posed did he discover ''Playgirl'' has a mostly gay readership, for which some of his fellow wrestlers teased him.<ref name="playgirl">{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=233}}</ref>

He is [[Cross-dominance|ambidextrous]], and had trouble differentiating between right and left, which affected his football games as a boy. He uses his right hand to draw and color and his left hand to write.

'''Ignorance''' is a state of being uninformed (lack of [[knowledge]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=ignorance |title=Ignorance |author=Wordnet |accessdate= 9 March 2011}}</ref> The word ''ignorant'' is an adjective describing a person in the state of being [[awareness|unaware]] and is often used as an insult to describe individuals who deliberately ignore or disregard important information or facts. ''Ignoramus'' is commonly used in the US, the UK, and Ireland as a term for someone who is [[willfully]] ignorant. Ignorance is distinguished from [[stupidity]], although both can lead to "[[Wisdom|unwise]]" acts.

Writer [[Thomas Pynchon]] articulated about the scope and structure of one's ignorance: "Ignorance is not just a blank space on a person's mental map. It has contours and coherence, and for all I know rules of operation as well. So as a corollary to [the advice of] writing about what we know, maybe we should add getting familiar with our ignorance, and the possibilities therein for writing a good story."<ref>[[Thomas Pynchon]] ''[[Slow Learner]]'', Introduction, pp. 15-16</ref>

The legal principle that ''[[ignorantia juris non excusat]]'', literally "ignorance of the law is no excuse", stands for the proposition that the law applies also to those who are unaware of it.

==Consequences of ignorance==
Individuals with superficial knowledge of a topic or subject may be worse off than people who know absolutely nothing. As [[Charles Darwin]] observed, "ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin#The_Descent_of_Man_.281871.29 |title=The Descent of Man |author=Charles Darwin |year=1871 |pages=Introduction, page 4 |format=w |accessdate=2008-07-18}}<br>On  related note, greater knowledge can, if improperly taken account of, work against you. See: {{Cite journal |last1= Hall |first= C. C. |last2= Ariss |first2= L. |last3= Todorov |first3= A |year= 2007 |title= The illusion of knowledge: When more information reduces accuracy and increases con?dence |url= http://courses.washington.edu/pbafhall/514/514%20Readings/Hall-OBHDP.pdf |journal= Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes |volume= 103 |pages= 277–290 |accessdate= 21 January 2014 |doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2007.01.003}}</ref>

Ignorance can stifle learning, especially if the ignorant person believes that they are not ignorant. A person who falsely believes he or she is knowledgeable will not seek out clarification of his or her beliefs, but rather rely on his or her ignorant position. He or she may also reject valid but contrary information, neither realizing its importance nor understanding it. This concept is elucidated in  Justin Kruger's and David Dunning's work, "Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments," otherwise known as the [[Dunning–Kruger effect]].

By the end of his career, Hall had amassed 59 [[United States]] [[patent]]s, and a number of his inventions were also patented in other countries.

==Biography==
Lloyd Hall was born in  [[Elgin, Illinois|Elgin]], [[Illinois]] on June 20, 1894. Hall's grandmother came to Illinois via the "Underground Railroad" at the age of sixteen. His grandfather came to Chicago in 1837 and was one of the founders of the Quinn Chapel A.M.E. Church. He later became the church's first pastor in 1841. Hall’s parents, Augustus and Isabel, were both high school graduates.Although Lloyd was born in Elgin, he moved to [[Aurora, Illinois]]. and was raised there by his parents. He later graduated in 1912 from East Side High School in Aurora.<ref>''Aurora Schools Report'', 1996.33.31a-z, Aurora Historical Society, Aurora IL</ref> After graduating school he went on to study [[Medicinal chemistry|pharmaceutical chemistry]] at [[Northwestern University]], earning a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] there and his [[Master's degree|master's]] at the University of Chicago. It was at Northwestern that Hall met Carroll L. Griffith, who with his father, Enoch L. Griffith, would found [[Griffith Laboratories]]. The Griffith's went on to hire Hall as their chief chemist.

After leaving university Hall was hired by the [[Western Electric|Western Electric Company]] but as the interview had been conducted over the telephone they did not know that he was black and refused to hire him. Hall then went to work as a chemist for the Department of Health in [[Chicago]] followed by a job as chief chemist with the John Morrell Company.

During [[World War I]] Hall served with the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|United States Ordnance Department]] where he was promoted to Chief Inspector of Powder and Explosives.he was born in the north amiacan


Following the war Hall married Myrrhene Newsome and they later moved to Chicago so he could work for the Boyer Chemical Laboratory, again as a chief chemist. Following this Hall became President and Chemical director for Chemical Products Corporation's consulting laboratory. Finally in 1925 Hall was offered a position with Griffith Laboratories where he was to remain for 34 years.<ref>[http://www.griffithlaboratories.com/United_States/en-US/people/Griffith+Family+Heritage/C+L+Griffith.htm C.L. Griffith] at Griffith Laboratories</ref><ref>[http://www.griffithlaboratories.com/United_States/en-US/people/Profiles+In+Excellence/Dr+Lloyd+A+Hall.htm Dr. Lloyd Augustus Hall] at Griffith Laboratories</ref>

==Major contributions==
Lloyd Hall devoted much of his efforts to the technologies behind [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]] [[meat
]], particularly to improving a [[curing salt]] marketed by Griffith Laboratories known as [[flash-drying]]. This product originated with [[Germany|German]] chemist [[Karl Max Seifert]], developer of a process whereby solutions of [[Sodium chloride|sodium chlorine]] and one or more secondary salts were sprayed onto hot metal and rapidly dried, producing crystals of the secondary salts encased inside a shell of sodium chloride. Seifert patented the process in 1934 and sold the rights to Griffith Laboratories.<ref>[http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=01950459&idkey=NONE United States Patent and Trademark Office Publication Number: 01950459]</ref> The adaptation of Seifert's process specifically for meat curing was then patented by company owner Enoch L. Griffith, who proposed [[nitrate]]s and [[nitrite]]s, well-known curing agents, as the secondary salts.<ref>[http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=02054624&idkey=NONE United States Patent and Trademark Office Publication Number: 02054624]</ref>

Lloyd Hall is often falsely credited with the original invention of Seifert's process. However, Hall took a leading role in developing the patent after it was sold to Griffith Laboratories, adding [[Hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] agents such as [[Glucose|corn sugar]] and [[Glycerol|glycerine]] to inhibit caking of the powder. Most of his patents in meat curing dealt with either preventing caking of the curing composition, or remedying undesired effects caused by the [[anticaking agent]]s.

Hall also investigated the role of [[spice]]s in food preservation. It was common knowledge that certain seasonings had [[antimicrobial]] properties, but Hall and co-worker Carroll L. Griffith found that some spices carried many [[bacteria]], as well as [[yeast]] and [[mold]] spores. To counter these problems, they patented in 1938 a means to sterilize spices through exposure to [[ethylene oxide]] gas, a fumigant. This method was all but abandoned upon the discovery that ethylene oxide was a toxic [[carcinogen]]. Hall and Griffith later promoted the use of ethylene oxide for the sterilization of medical equipment,<ref>[http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=02189947&idkey=NONE United States Patent and Trademark Office Publication Number: 02189947]</ref> helping to advance an idea that had been around for several  years.<ref>[http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=02075845&idkey=NONE United States Patent and Trademark Office Publication Number: 02075845]</ref>

Hall also invented new uses of [[antioxidant]]s to prevent food spoilage, especially the onset of [[Rancidification|rancidity]] in [[fat]]s and [[Vegetable fats and oils|oil]]s. Aware that unprocessed vegetable oils frequently contained natural antioxidants such as [[lecithin]] that slowed their spoilage, he developed means of combining these compounds with salts and other materials so that they could be readily introduced to other foods.

After retiring from Griffith in 1959, Hall consulted for the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]]. From 1962 to 1964, he sat on the American [[Food for Peace]] Council. He died in 1971 in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]]. He was awarded several honors during his lifetime, including [[honorary degree]]s from [[Virginia State University]], [[Howard University]], and the [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]] and in 2004 he was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]] for his work.<ref>[http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/205.html National Inventors Hall of Fame]</ref>

He was a member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity.
He was an honor student and was captain of speech and debate team while also competing in baseball, football and track. He had the opportunity to choose between four colleges and he picked Northwestern University.

This common [[Europe]]an plant is generally considered a [[weed]] and is an indicator of light soils. The origin of the ''pimpernel'' name comes from ''pympernele'' [1400–50]; late Middle English, derived from Middle French pimprenelle, Old French piprenelle; Vulgar Latin *piper?nella= Latin piper pepper + -?n- -ine + -ella diminutive suffix.

It is most well known for being the emblem of the [[fictional character|fictional]] hero the [[The Scarlet Pimpernel|Scarlet Pimpernel]].

==Description==
Scarlet pimpernel has weak sprawling [[Plant stem|stems]] growing to about 50&nbsp;cm (20in.) long, which bear bright green ovate sessile [[Leaf|leaves]] in opposite pairs. The small orange, red or blue [[flower]]s are produced in the leaf axils from spring to autumn. The [[petal]] margins are somewhat crenate and have small [[trichome|glandular hairs]]. Blue-flowered plants (''A. arvensis'' Forma ''azurea'') are common in some areas, such as the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] region, and should not be confused with the related Blue pimpernel, ''[[Anagallis foemina]]'', sometimes  ssp. ''foemina''. In 2007, a [[molecular phylogenetic]] study showed that ''Anagallis foemina'' is more closely related to ''[[Anagallis monelli]]'' than to ''Anagallis arvensis'', and should be treated as a separate species.<ref name="manns2007">{{cite journal | last1 = Manns | first1 = Ulrika | last2 = Anderberg | first2 = Arne A. | year = 2007 | title = Relationships of ''Anagallis foemina'' and ''Anagallis arvensis'' (Myrsinaceae): New insights inferred from DNA sequence data | url = | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 971–980 | doi = 10.1016/j.mpev.2007.07.022 | pmid = 17869544 }}</ref>  Scarlet pimpernel flowers are open only when the sun shines.<ref name="ct-botanical-society" />

'''David Francis Dravecky''' (born February 14, 1956) is an American former [[professional baseball]] player, a motivational speaker, and an author. He played in [[Major League Baseball]] for the [[San Diego Padres]] (1982–87) and [[San Francisco Giants]] (1987–89). [[Cancer]] ended his career as his team was reaching the [[1989 World Series]]. He won the [[Hutch Award]] in 1989.

==Life==
=== Early career ===
A left-handed [[pitcher]], Dravecky represented the [[1983 San Diego Padres season|Padres]] at the [[1983 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] game in 1983, his second season, in which he [[win (baseball statistics)|won]] 14 games. Equally proficient as a [[starting pitcher|starter]] or coming out of the [[bullpen]], Dravecky helped the [[1984 San Diego Padres season|Padres]] to their first pennant the following year.

Dravecky became friends with two other Padres pitchers, [[Mark Thurmond]] and [[Eric Show]], who also held strong Christian beliefs. In the spring of 1984, Show recruited the other two to the [[John Birch Society]], a [[right-wing]] US nationalist group, and the three were widely reported on after they distributed Birch literature from a booth at the June 1984 [[Del Mar Fair]].<ref name=ESPN>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/otl/news/story?id=5543839 "The tortured life of Eric Show"], September 11, 2010, by Tom Friend, [[ESPN]].

Retrieved from [[Google News]] May 23, 2013.</ref> Over his first six seasons, Dravecky had a 60-55 [[win–loss record (pitching)|win–loss record]], and the [[Associated Press]] wrote that he was better known for his association with the John Birch Society than his pitching.<ref name=AP1987>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pehVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eeEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3544,3228085 "Giants sending Dravecky to the mound in Series bid"], [[Associated Press]], ''[[Eugene Register-Guard]]'', October 13, 1987. Also published as [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3_McAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rnIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3611,4486721 "Dravecky Has Made Impact"], [[Associated Press]], ''[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]'', October 13, 1987. Both retrieved from [[Google News]] May 23, 2013.</ref>

On July 4, 1987, the [[San Francisco Giants]] acquired Dravecky, pitcher [[Craig Lefferts]], and third baseman [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]] from the San Diego Padres for pitchers [[Mark Grant (baseball)|Mark Grant]] and [[Mark Davis (baseball)|Mark Davis]] and third baseman [[Chris Brown (baseball)|Chris Brown]] for their pennant drive. He went 7–5 during the stretch, and in the [[1987 National League Championship Series|playoffs]] pitched a [[shutout]] in Game 2 against the [[1987 St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Cardinals]] and lost Game 6 by a score of 1–0. The Cards won in seven games.

While with the Giants, Dravecky and teammates [[Scott Garrelts]], [[Atlee Hammaker]], and [[Jeff Brantley]] became known as the "God Squad" because of their strong Christian faith. Disdaining the hard-partying lifestyle of many of their teammates, they preferred to hold Bible studies in their hotel rooms while on the road.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

=== Crisis and comeback ===
The following season, a cancerous [[desmoid tumor]] was found in Dravecky's pitching arm. On October 7, 1988, he underwent surgery, which removed half of the [[deltoid muscle]] in his pitching arm and froze the [[humerus bone]] in an effort to eliminate all of the cancerous cells. Doctors advised Dravecky to wait until 1990 to pitch again, but Dravecky was determined to pitch in 1989.<ref name="nytimes9aug1989">{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Robert|title=Dravecky is Back on Center Stage|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/09/sports/dravecky-is-back-on-center-stage.html|accessdate=June 24, 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 9, 1989}}</ref><ref name="nytimes17Aug1989">{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Robert|title=Dravecky Was Told He Risked Fracture|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/17/sports/dravecky-was-told-he-risked-fracture.html|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=June 24, 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 17, 1989}}</ref> By July 1989, he was pitching in the [[Minor league baseball|minors]], and on August 10, he made a highly publicized return to the major leagues, pitching eight innings and defeating [[1989 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]] 4–3.<ref name="nytimes19June1991">{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=SPORTS PEOPLE: BASEBALL; Dravecky's Left Arm Amputated, Giants Say|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/19/sports/sports-people-baseball-dravecky-s-left-arm-amputated-giants-say.html|accessdate=June 24, 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 19, 1991}}</ref> In his following start, five days later in [[1989 Montreal Expos season|Montreal]], Dravecky pitched three no-hit innings, but in the fifth inning, he felt a tingling sensation in his arm. In the sixth inning, he started off shaky, allowing a [[home run]] to the leadoff batter and then hitting the second batter, [[Andrés Galarraga]]. Then, on his first pitch to [[Tim Raines]], his humerus bone snapped; the sound of it breaking could be heard throughout the stadium. Dravecky collapsed on the mound. He'd suffered a clean break midway between his shoulder and elbow, ending his season.<ref name="nytimes17Aug1989"/>  

The [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|Giants]] won the [[National League]] pennant in [[1989 National League Championship Series|1989]] (defeating the [[1989 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] in the NLCS in five games), and in the post-game celebration, Dravecky's arm was broken a second time when he was running out to the mound to celebrate.<ref name="nytimes10Oct1989">{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Dravecky Hurt Again|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/10/sports/dravecky-hurt-again.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=June 24, 2010|date=October 10, 1989|work=The New York Times}}</ref> A doctor examining Dravecky's [[x-ray]]s noticed a mass in his arm, which turned out to be malignant. Dravecky's cancer had returned, ending his career. Eighteen days later, Dravecky retired from baseball with a 64–57 record with 558 [[strikeout]]s and a 3.13 [[Earned run average|ERA]] in 1,062? innings. He won the 1989 [[Willie Mac Award]] honoring his spirit and leadership.

=== Retirement and later career ===
After two more surgeries, his left arm continued to deteriorate, and on June 18, 1991, less than two years after his comeback with the Giants, Dravecky's left arm and shoulder were amputated. After recovering from the surgery, Dravecky went on to begin a new career as a motivational speaker.

Dravecky wrote two books about his battles with cancer and his comeback attempt: ''Comeback'', published in 1990 and written with Tim Stafford, and ''When You Can't Come Back'', coauthored with wife Jan and Ken Gire and  published in 1992. He has also written a Christian motivational book, "Called Up", published in 2004 by [[Zondervan]]. With the help of Stafford, Dravecky saw ''Comeback'' republished as a self-titled autobiography for children in 1992.

'''Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport''' {{Airport codes|BTR|KBTR|BTR}}, also known as '''Ryan Field''', is a public use [[airport]] located four nautical miles (7&nbsp;km) north of the [[central business district]] of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], a city in [[East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana|East Baton Rouge Parish]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States]].<ref name="FAA" />

The airport was originally '''Harding Army Air Field''' during [[World War II]] and was used by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] Technical Service Command as a maintenance and supply base.  Today other than the runways, virtually no traces remain of the military installation.

==Facilities and aircraft==
The airport covers an area of {{convert|1,250|acre|ha}} at an [[elevation]] of 70&nbsp;feet (21&nbsp;m) above [[mean sea level]]. It has three [[runway]]s: 4L/22R is 7,500 by 150 feet (2,286 × 46&nbsp;m) with a [[concrete]] surface; 4R/22L is 3,799 by 75&nbsp;feet (1,158 × 23&nbsp;m) with an [[asphalt]] surface; 13/31 is 7,004 by 150&nbsp;feet (2,135 × 46&nbsp;m) with an asphalt surface.<ref name="FAA" />

Air Traffic Services are provided by dedicated [[Air Traffic Controllers]] in the tower and the Terminal Radar Approach Control.

For the 12-month period ending November 30, 2008, the airport had 111,257 aircraft operations, an average of 304 per day: 67%&nbsp;[[general aviation]], 20%&nbsp;[[air taxi]], 7%&nbsp;[[military aviation|military]] and 6%&nbsp;[[airline|scheduled commercial]]. At that time there were 148&nbsp;aircraft based at this airport: 61%&nbsp;single-[[aircraft engine|engine]], 21%&nbsp;multi-engine, 11%&nbsp;[[jet aircraft|jet]] and 7%&nbsp;[[helicopter]].<ref name="FAA" />

This airport is also the main airport used by the Louisiana State Police Air Support Unit.

==Passenger airlines and destinations==
[[File:KBTRdestinations14.png|thumb|right|<center>Destinations served from Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport ({{As of|2014|5|lc=on}})</center>]]
Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport has two concourses: '''Concourse A''' (gates A1-A4), and '''Concourse B''' (gates B1-B3).

Historically, Baton Rouge was served by [[American Airlines]], [[Continental Airlines]] (now [[United Airlines]]), [[Eastern Airlines]], [[Northwest Airlines]] (now [[Delta Air Lines]]), [[Southern Airways]], which merged with [[North Central Airlines]] to form [[Republic Airlines]] which in turn then continued to serve the airport, and [[Trans-Texas Airways]] (TTa) which subsequently changed its name to [[Texas International Airlines]].  All of these airlines operated mainline jet service from the airport with the exception of Eastern which flew [[Martin 4-0-4]] and [[Convair 440]] twin prop "Silver Falcon" airliners from Baton Rouge in the 1950s.  Mainline jet aircraft types operated in passenger service from Baton Rouge in the past included [[Boeing 727-100]], [[727-200]], [[737-200]], [[737-300]] and [[737-500]] jetliners as well as [[Douglas DC-9-10]] and [[DC-9-30]] jets and also [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]] jetliners.

Currently, all airline service to and from the airport is primarily operated with either [[Canadair CRJ]] or [[Embraer ERJ (disambiguation)|Embraer ERJ]] regional jets flown by the various regional affiliates of the major airlines that serve Baton Rouge.  The exception is Delta which operates some flights to Atlanta with mainline [[Airbus A319]] jetliners which were previously operated by Northwest Airlines before this air carrier merged with Delta.

==Cargo Terminal==

Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport has a {{convert|33000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} cargo facility. It is currently being expanded to {{convert|68000|sqft|m2}}.

==Struggles==
Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport is slightly smaller than might be expected for a city and metro area of its size due in part to its proximity to New Orleans' [[Armstrong International Airport]]. Despite aggressive advertising campaigns encouraging catchment area residents to utilize the airport, passenger numbers are somewhat low (below 830,000 passengers per year).

In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and the ensuing increase in Baton Rouge's (temporary and permanent) population, BTR saw its destination portfolio expanded dramatically. New services were initiated to [[Cincinnati]], [[New York City]] (both [[Newark, New Jersey]] and [[LaGuardia Airport|LaGuardia]] airports), [[Chicago-O'Hare]], [[Denver]], [[Washington-Reagan]], [[St. Louis]], and [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. The new destinations were discontinued by the end of 2008 as New Orleans air service returned to pre-Katrina levels. After experiencing record fuel prices in 2008 and the subsequent recession, the carriers returned their focus to the most efficient hub options for BTR, resulting in the current service schedule of daily jet flights to four major hubs.  [[Vision Airlines]] also briefly served Baton Rouge with [[Boeing 737]] jetliner service nonstop to Las Vegas (LAS) and Fort Walton Beach/Destin, FL (VPS); however, these flights were suspended and Vision then withdrew all service from the airport.

==Expansion and development==
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Baton rouge airport rotunda.JPG|left|thumb| Outside of airport rotunda ]] -->
Louisiana Aircraft Inc., a [[fixed base operation]] on the south side of the airport has been purchased by a real estate developer.  The developer has plans to build more hangar space and has purchased the old Capitol Jet Center / LuxJet FBO located on the east side of the airport. Future plans include a ramp and hangars on the north side of the airfield.  The increase in hangar space is most noticeable during the College Football season.  This future expansion is causing the [[Army National Guard]] armory of the 769th [[Combat Engineer]] [[Battalion]] to relocate to the other side of Baton Rouge.

On June 24, 2010, [[US Airways]] recommenced operations to Charlotte from BTR.

In March 2012, a project to expand the rotunda area of the terminal began. The purpose of the project is to relieve the traffic jams inside the terminal caused by passengers going through security screening or departing the airport in the same general area that the walkway from the parking garage and waiting area are located. The renovation project is expected to be completed sometime in August 2013.

In September 2013 Baton Rouge Metro Airport announced the August passenger volume hit a 5 year high. The Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport experienced its best August passenger count in five years. A total of 66,860 passengers passed through the airport for the month. The August departing passengers (enplanements) were up 11% at 33,465. Arriving passengers (deplanements) were up 7.08% at 33,395. Delta maintained the top August market share at 42%, followed by United at 25%, American Eagle at 24% and US Airways at 9%. Delta had the biggest passenger increase among the BTR airlines at +13.03% in enplanements and +10.15% in deplanements.

Delta has also begun scheduling larger, dual-class aircraft into BTR, including CRJ 700/900, DC-9 and Airbus A319 aircraft.  All four aircraft types have both first and coach class seating.

In September 2013 Baton Rouge Metro Airport announced Delta's "Red Coat" Service has been implemented at the check in terminal to assist customers.<ref>{{Cite web  |  title = Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport  | url = http://flybtr.com |  quote =  Delta now has the scarlet-jacketed agents working the counters and gates at BTR to provide additional customer service for passengers.  These elite agents work to solve problems and efficiently assist passengers in a variety of situations.| accessdate = 21 June 2014 }}</ref>

The expanded rotunda opened in October 2013 and the TSA checkpoint has been re-located to the new area.  The original rotunda now serves as a spacious arrival court where un-ticketed guests can wait on arriving passengers.  Construction of new restrooms and vending are being completed in the arrival court.

==Accidents and incidents==
On September 2, 2011, [[Atlantic Southeast Airlines]] Flight 5058, operated by [[Canadair CRJ-200]] N875AS landed with the port main undercarriage retracted. There were no injuries amongst the 50 passengers and three crew on board.<ref name=AH44248402>{{cite web |url=http://avherald.com/h?article=44248402&opt=0 |title=Accident: Atlantic Southeast CRJ2 at Baton Rouge on Sep 1st 2011, left main gear up landing |first=Simon |last=Hradecky |publisher=The Aviation Herald |accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref>

On June 7, 2013, a privately owned Beechcraft King Air 200 headed to McComb, Mississippi, crashed 2 minutes after takeoff into a neighborhood in Baker, Louisiana, approximately 13 miles north of Baton Rouge, killing the pilot.

[[File:San Leonardo de Yagüe - Iglesia de San Leonardo Abad - Vista lateral.jpg|thumb|250px|Church of San Leonardo Abad (17th century)]]
'''San Leonardo de Yagüe''' is a [[Spain|Spanish]] town and [[municipality]] located in the [[province of Soria]], in the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Castile and León]]. It is one of the most populated municipalities {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} of the Sorian county of Pinares.

It has primary and secondary schools (I.E.S. San Leonardo), attended by students from surrounding municipalities ([[Navaleno]], Hontoria del Pinar, Casarejos, Espeja, Espejón, La Hinojosa, and others).

The town, which has about 2,500 inhabitants, is home to the Puertas Norma timber products factory, a manufacturer of doors and pre-hung door units. The factory employs about 700 workers.

== History ==
The foundation date of the village is unknown, but it is supposed to be in the 10th or 11th century. The oldest document where the village is mentioned is from 1173, in a privilege card given by [[Alfonso VIII]].

The village is the birthplace of [[Juan Yagüe]] in 1891. Yagüe, a general in [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s army, became notorious for instigating the [[Massacre of Badajoz|massacre at Badajoz]] in 1936. The village was renamed after Yagüe following his death in 1952, becoming San Leonardo de Yagüe.

'''Lafayette Regional Airport''' {{airport codes|LFT|KLFT|LFT}} is a public airport two miles (4&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], in [[Lafayette Parish, Louisiana|Lafayette Parish]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States]]. It is owned by the City & Parish of Lafayette.<ref name=FAA />

The airport is located next to U.S. Highway 90 (future [[Interstate 49]]) on the east side of the city, close to offshore oil and gas activity in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Lafayette Regional is home to one of the largest helicopter companies in the world, PHI, Inc. (formerly Petroleum Helicopters Inc.).  Although the airport does not have international flights, regional jet service is operated nonstop to three hubs: Atlanta (ATL), Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW) and Houston (IAH).  [[Delta Air Lines]] began mainline [[Boeing 717-200]] jet service nonstop to Atlanta effective July 3, 2014 in addition to its regional jet flights operated by [[Delta Connection]].  [[United Airlines]] began expanded service from Lafayette featuring a new daily nonstop flight to Denver which became effective August 19, 2014 and is operated by its regional partner [[United Express]].<ref name="lftairport.com">http://www.lftairport.com</ref> Delta, via Delta Connection, previously provided nonstop service from Lafayette to its hub in Memphis, TN until 2011. [[Allegiant Air]] initiated nonstop service to Las Vegas on November 3, 2011 but then discontinued these flights in February 2012.<ref name="Allegiant Air">http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20120127/BUSINESS/120127022/-1/rss01</ref>  The airport serves the greater Lafayette metropolitan area, which has a population of approximately 530,000 people.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Lafayette Regional Airport (LFT) covers {{convert|746|acre|ha}} at an [[elevation]] of 42 feet (13 m) above [[mean sea level]]. It has three [[asphalt]] [[runway]]s: 4L/22R, 4,099 x 75 feet (1,249 x 23 m), 4R/22L, 7,651 x 150 feet (2,332 x 46 m), and 11/29, 5,400 x 148 feet (1,646 x 45 m). It has one [[helipad]], 50 x 50&nbsp;ft (15 x 15 m).<ref name=FAA />

In the year ended February 28, 2006 the airport had 114,303 aircraft operations, an average of 313 per day: 38% [[general aviation]], 36% [[air taxi]], 24% commuter/cargo, 2% [[military aviation|military]] and 1% [[airline|scheduled commercial]]. At that time there were 159 aircraft based at this airport: 57% single-[[aircraft engine|engine]], 27% multi-engine, 9% [[jet aircraft|jet]] and 7% [[helicopter]].<ref name=FAA />

==Cargo operations==
Lafayette Regional Airport is building a new cargo terminal on the southwest side of the airfield, near the PHI headquarters. It will be approximately 22,500 square feet.<ref>http://www.lftairport.com/PageDisplay.asp?p1=7049</ref> Construction commenced in September 2010. It will provide parking for up to five [[Boeing 757]] aircraft on its apron and will also join to existing taxiways that connect to runways 4R/22L. The relocation of the cargo ramp will give cargo carriers such as [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] and [[FedEx]] direct access to [[U.S. Highway 90]] (future [[Interstate 49]] freeway corridor). Currently, UPS bases a [[Boeing 757-200]] aircraft at the airport.  FedEx previously based two (2) [[Boeing 727-200]] trijets on the airfield until this aircraft type was retired from their fleet on June 21, 2013.<ref>http://news.van.fedex.com</ref>  The FedEx Boeing 727s have now been replaced with a [[Boeing 757-200]] aircraft.  These Boeing 757 jets operated by both FedEx and UPS are currently the largest aircraft to use the airport on a regular basis.  [[DHL Aviation|DHL]] had operated a [[Douglas DC-9]] aircraft configured for freight operations from Lafayette; however, this company subsequently shut down all of their flight operations in the U.S.  The old cargo ramp will create more room for a planned main [[Airport terminal|terminal]] building extension.

==Terminal expansion study==

A preliminary study has begun concerning the existing terminal building in planning for future growth and construction. Adding an extension to the terminal would allow Lafayette Regional Airport to handle more air traffic, which could entice international carriers to use it as a connecting airport. This would require a [[U.S. Customs]] department office stationed at the airport, which would bring Lafayette Regional Airport to an 'international airport' status.  However, international service from Lafayette appears unlikely at this time due to the relatively small population base in the area as well as the presence of large international and domestic passenger hubs located relatively nearby in Atlanta ([[Delta Air Lines]]), Dallas/Fort Worth ([[American Airlines]]) and Houston ([[United Airlines]]).

==History==

===World War II===
The airport opened as Lafayette Municipal Airport on 29 November 1930. On 5 July 1942, during World War II, the airport was commandeered by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and used as a contract primary pilot training airfield under the AAF Gulf Coast Training Center (later Central Flying Training Command). The 384th Army Air Force Base Unit administered the contract to a civilian-operated primary flying school (Lafayette School of Aeronautics) as a sub-base of [[DeRidder Army Airbase]], Louisiana, which also had four (4) auxiliary airfields located nearby for emergency and overflow landings. [[Fairchild PT-19]]s were the primary trainer; several [[PT-17 Stearman]]s and a few [[P-40 Warhawk]]s were assigned.

The airfield was transferred from the DeRidder AAB to [[Esler Army Airfield]] ([[Third Air Force]]) on 24 March 1944. The mission of base became training of replacement combat aircrews.   On 30 September 1945, the airfield was deactivated and returned to civil control.

===Postwar civil use:  airline service===
In 1948 [[Eastern Air Lines]] began the first scheduled passenger service.<ref>http://www.lftairport.com/PageDisplay.asp?p1=4709</ref> During the 1950s Eastern operated up to ten flights a day with [[Martin 4-0-4]] "Silver Falcon" and [[Convair 340]] propliners with up to five flights a day to New Orleans via Baton Rouge and up to five flights a day to Houston [[Hobby Airport]] via Lake Charles, LA and Beaumont/Port Arthur, TX.<ref>http://www.timetableimages.com, Eastern Air Lines December 1, 1958 system timetable</ref>  Some of these Eastern flights featured continuing, no change of plane service on to other destinations such as Atlanta, Charlotte, and San Antonio.  Eastern served Lafayette until the mid 1960s with [[Convair 440]] propliners when it then ceased all service into the airport.<ref>http://www.timetableimages.com, Eastern Air Lines June 1, 1965 system timetable</ref> By this time, [[Trans-Texas Airways]] (TTa) was competing with Eastern with flights to Houston and New Orleans in addition to providing service to other destinations which were operated by [[Convair 600]] turboprops as well as with [[Convair 240]] and [[Douglas DC-3]] propliners.<ref>http://www.timetableimages.con, Trans-Texas Airways Oct. 20, 1966 system timetable</ref>

The first jet service into the airport was operated by [[Texas International Airlines]] (formerly TTa, Trans-Texas Airways) with [[Douglas DC-9-10]] twinjets to Houston, Dallas/Ft. Worth, New Orleans and other cities.  Texas International (TI) introduced jets into Lafayette with the [[DC-9]] in the early 1970s.<ref>http://www.airliners.net, photo section, Texas International Airlines DC-9 in Lafayette, Louisiana, photo #0160646</ref>  TI also served the airport with [[Convair 600]] turboprops.  In February 1976 Texas International operated direct DC-9 service from Los Angeles (LAX) to Lafayette with six intermediate  stops en route.<ref>February 1, 1976 Official Airline Guide (OAG), North American edition</ref> By 1979, Texas International was operating ten jet flights a day from Lafayette with Douglas DC-9-10s and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]]s nonstop to Houston, New Orleans and Lake Charles, LA with direct, no change of plane jet service to Dallas/Ft. Worth, Denver, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Albuquerque and Little Rock.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Texas International March 15, 1979 system timetable</ref>  In 1982 Texas International was operating three DC-9 flights a day from Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW) to Lafayette via Houston  (IAH). A fourth daily DC-9 flight was operated from Houston to Lafayette as well by TI.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, June 1, 1982 Continental Airlines/Texas International Airlines joint system timetable</ref>  Later that year Texas International was merged into [[Continental Airlines]] which in turn continued to serve Lafayette with [[Boeing 727-100]], [[Boeing 727-200]], [[Douglas DC-9-10]] and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]] jet flights to Houston.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Continental Employees February 1, 1987 system timetable</ref> Continental jets were then replaced by [[Continental Express]] [[ATR-42]] and [[Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia]] regional turboprop aircraft.  Continental later reintroduced mainline nonstop jet service to Houston.  In September 1994 Continental operated direct [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]] service from New York [[Newark Airport]] to Lafayette via Baltimore and Houston.<ref>Sept. 15, 1994 Official Airline Guide (OAG), North American edition</ref>

Several independent commuter airlines served Lafayette over the years as well.  [[Royale Airlines]], based in Shreveport, Louisiana, served the airport with [[Beechcraft C99]], [[Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante]] and [[Short 330]] turboprops.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, April 1, 1981 Official Airline Guide (OAG), North American edition</ref>  In November 1984 Royale was flying to [[Houston Intercontinental Airport]] and New Orleans from Lafayette with hourly shuttle service operated to both destinations on weekdays.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Royale Airlines Nov. 1, 1984 system timetable</ref>  Another commuter air carrier, [[Metro Airlines]], served Lafayette with [[Short 330]] turboprops nonstop to Houston Intercontinental.  [[Metroflight Airlines]], a division of Metro Airlines, operated [[Convair 580]] turboprops nonstop to [[Dallas/Fort Worth Airport]] flying as [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] on behalf of [[American Airlines]]<ref>http://www.departedflights.com; July 1, 1983 Official Airline Guide (OAG)</ref>   [[L'Express Airlines]], based in the New Orleans area, operated nonstop to Houston [[Hobby Airport]] and New Orleans with [[Beechcraft]] turboprops.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Dec. 15, 1989 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Houston Hobby and New Orleans flight schedules</ref>  Hammond Air Service flew nonstop to Houston Hobby Airport with [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]] turboprops and [[Piper Aircraft|Piper]] prop aircraft.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, July 1, 1983 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Houston Hobby flight schedules</ref>

Major airline mainline jet service for the airport was previously operated by [[Continental Airlines]] with [[Boeing 737-300]] and [[Boeing 737-500]] jetliners nonstop to Houston until Continental turned over all service into Lafayette to its regional affiliates, [[Continental Express]] operated by [[ExpressJet]] and [[Continental Connection]] operated by [[Colgan Air]]. Following the merger of Continental with [[United Airlines]], ExpressJet and Colgan Air then became [[United Express]] air carriers.  Major airline mainline jet service resumed on July 3, 2014 when [[Delta Air Lines]] began [[Boeing 717]] flights between Lafayette and Atlanta. The airport was also served by [[Northwest Airlink]] with nonstop [[Saab 340]] turboprop and [[Canadair CRJ-200]] regional jet flights to Memphis.  Following the merger of [[Northwest Airlines]] with [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Canadair CRJ-200]] regional jet service operated by [[Delta Connection]] to Memphis was discontinued.  The majority of passenger flights at the airport are now flown with [[Canadair CRJ-200]], [[CRJ-700]] and [[CRJ-900]] regional jets (operated by [[ExpressJet]] as [[Delta Connection]]) to Atlanta or by [[Embraer ERJ-135]], [[ERJ-140]] and [[ERJ-145]] series regional jets (flown by [[Envoy Air]] operating as [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] to Dallas/Ft. Worth on behalf of [[American Airlines]]<ref>aa.com, June 8, 2014 American Airlines system timetable</ref> and also by [[ExpressJet]] to Houston operating as [[United Express]]). Some American Eagle flights to DFW are also currently operated by [[ExpressJet]] with [[Canadair CRJ-200]] regional jets.<ref>aa.com, June 8, 2014 American Airlines system timetable</ref>  [[Colgan Air]], operating as [[United Express]], ceased serving Lafayette during the summer of 2012.  Colgan had flown [[Bombardier Q400]] high speed propjets (which is the largest and fastest member of the [[DHC-8]] [[Bombardier Dash 8|Dash 8]] aircraft family) as well as [[Saab 340]] turboprops operating feeder service for United to Houston.  [[ExpressJet]] replaced the Colgan service with additional [[Embraer ERJ-135]] and [[Embraer ERJ-145]] regional jet frequencies operating as [[United Express]] nonstop to Houston.  [[Vision Airlines]] briefly served Lafayette during the summer of 2011 with [[Dornier 328]] turboprops nonstop to Ft. Walton Beach/Destin, FL via the [[Northwest Florida Regional Airport]] located on [[Eglin Air Force Base]].

===Current airline operations===
The three regional airlines serving Lafayette, [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]], [[Delta Connection]] and [[United Express]], currently use regional jets for their flights.  The exception is [[Delta Air Lines]] which began mainline service nonstop to Atlanta on July 3, 2014 using the [[Boeing 717-200]] jetliner.  At this same time, [[Delta Connection]] also began serving Lafayette with 76-seat [[Canadair CRJ-900]] regional jets which like the B717 feature first class, "Economy Comfort" and standard coach seating.  Previously, the only mainline jet aircraft type serving Lafayette (following the cessation of [[Continental Airlines]] mainline jet service) was the twice weekly [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]] service flown by [[Allegiant Air]] nonstop to Las Vegas. On June 7, 2012 [[Delta Connection]] began daily service to Atlanta on [[Canadair CRJ-700]]s with wi-fi, 9 first class seats and 56 economy class seats including an enhanced "Economy Comfort" section (more legroom). These flights provided the only first class service available at the time from Lafayette. In Delta's November 2012 timetable all CRJ-700 service to Lafayette was replaced with smaller Canadair CRJ-200s.  Delta Connection then resumed dual-class service between Lafayette and Atlanta on June 10, 2013 with a single daily [[Canadair CRJ-700]] regional jet flight featuring wi-fi as well as 9 First Class seats, 8 "Economy Comfort" seats and 48 Economy seats.  Several of the other Delta Connection flights between LFT and ATL continue to use single class [[Canadair CRJ-200]] regional jets.  The CRJ-700 was the largest airliner type to serve Lafayette.  However, that changed when Delta began 110-seat [[Boeing 717]] service nonstop to Atlanta on July 3, 2014. The B717, featuring first class, "Economy Comfort" and standard coach seating, has now become the largest aircraft type to serve Lafayette with scheduled passenger flights and marks the return of mainline jet aircraft service.  This distinction was previously held by [[Allegiant Air]] with [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]] jetliner service operated nonstop to Las Vegas before this airline ceased all flights from the airport.<ref>http://www.shreveporttimes.com/article/20120228/NEWS05/120228001/1064</ref>

===Nonstop Denver service===

[[United Airlines]] began daily nonstop service to Denver from the airport effective on August 19, 2014.  These new flights are operated by United regional affiliate and code sharing partner [[United Express]] with [[Embraer ERJ-145]] regional jets.  This service marks the first time Lafayette has had nonstop flights to the United hub in Denver.<ref name="lftairport.com"/>

===Notable past operations===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
In March 2001, [[Air Force One]] landed in Lafayette transporting President [[George W. Bush]], the 43rd President of the United States.  This [[Boeing 747-200B]] (USAF aircraft designation [[VC-25A]]) flight into Lafayette with President Bush onboard appears to have been the largest aircraft ever to land at the airport.  More recently, [[U.S. Air Force]] [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|C-17]] "[[Globemaster III]]" aircraft have flown into Lafayette. These large, four engine, military transport jets were supporting air show activities at the airfield.  In addition, [[United Airlines]] uses Lafayette Regional as a diversion airport when inclement weather disrupts flight operations at the airline's major connecting hub located at [[Houston Intercontinental Airport]] (IAH) in Texas.  Up to five (5) [[Boeing 737]] jetliners operated by United have been observed on the airport ramp at one time due to weather diversions.

WARN  - 2014-11-30 14:42:46.964; org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.SolrWriter; Error creating document : SolrInputDocument(fields: [contents=In [[mathematics]], for a given complex [[Hermitian matrix]] ''M'' and nonzero [[vector (geometry)|vector]] ''x'', the '''Rayleigh quotient'''<ref>Also known as the '''Rayleigh–Ritz ratio'''; named after [[Walther Ritz]] and [[Lord Rayleigh]].</ref> <math>R(M, x)</math>, is defined as:<ref>Horn, R. A. and C. A. Johnson. 1985. ''Matrix Analysis''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 176&ndash;180.</ref><ref>Parlet B. N. ''The symmetric eigenvalue problem'', SIAM, Classics in Applied Mathematics,1998</ref>

:<math>R(M,x) := {x^{*} M x \over x^{*} x}.</math>

For real matrices and vectors, the condition of being Hermitian reduces to that of being [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]], and the [[conjugate transpose]] <math>x^{*}</math> to the usual [[transpose]] <math>x'</math>. Note that <math>R(M, c x) = R(M,x)</math> for any non-zero [[Real number|real]] scalar ''c''. Recall that a Hermitian (or real symmetric) matrix has real [[eigenvalue]]s. It can be shown that, for a given matrix, the Rayleigh quotient reaches its minimum value <math>\lambda_\min</math> (the smallest [[eigenvalue]] of ''M'') when ''x'' is <math>v_\min</math> (the corresponding [[eigenvector]]). Similarly, <math>R(M, x) \leq \lambda_\max</math> and <math>R(M, v_\max) = \lambda_\max</math>.

The Rayleigh quotient is used in the [[min-max theorem]] to get exact values of all eigenvalues. It is also used in [[eigenvalue algorithm]]s to obtain an eigenvalue approximation from an eigenvector approximation. Specifically, this is the basis for [[Rayleigh quotient iteration]].

The range of the Rayleigh quotient (for matrix that is not necessarily Hermitian) is called a [[numerical range]], (or [[spectrum]] in functional analysis). When the matrix is Hermitian, the
numerical range is equal to the spectral norm. Still in functional analysis, <math>\lambda_\max</math> is known as the [[spectral radius]]. In the context of C*-algebras or algebraic quantum mechanics, the function that to ''M'' associates the Rayleigh-Ritz quotient  ''R(M,x)'' for a fixed ''x'' and ''M'' varying through the algebra would be referred to as "vector state" of the algebra.

==Bounds==
As stated in introduction <math>R(M,x) \in \left[\lambda_\min, \lambda_\max \right]</math>.  This is immediate after observing that the Rayleigh quotient is a weighted average of eigenvalues of ''M'':

:<math>R(M,x) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i x_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}</math>

where <math>(\lambda_i, v_i)</math> is the ith eigenpair after orthonormalization and <math>x_i = v_i^* x</math> is the ith coordinate of ''x'' in the eigenbasis.  It is easy to verify that the bounds are attained at the corresponding eigenvectors <math>v_\min, v_\max</math>.

==Special case of covariance matrices==
An empirical [[covariance matrix]] ''M'' can be represented as the product ''A''&apos; ''A'' of the [[data matrix (multivariate statistics)|data matrix]] ''A'' pre-multiplied by its transpose ''A''&apos;. Being a symmetrical real matrix, ''M'' has non-negative eigenvalues, and orthogonal (or othogonalisable) eigenvectors, which can be demonstrated as follows.

Firstly, that the eigenvalues <math>\lambda_i</math> are non-negative:

:<math>M v_i = A' A v_i = \lambda_i v_i</math>

:<math>\Rightarrow v_i' A' A v_i = v_i' \lambda_i v_i</math>

:<math>\Rightarrow \left\| A v_i \right\|^2 = \lambda_i \left\| v_i \right\|^2</math>

:<math>\Rightarrow \lambda_i = \frac{\left\| A v_i \right\|^2}{\left\| v_i \right\|^2} \geq 0.</math>

Secondly, that the eigenvectors ''v<sub>i</sub>'' are orthogonal to one another:

:<math>\begin{align}
&\qquad \qquad M v_i = \lambda _i v_i \\
&\Rightarrow v_j' M v_i = \lambda _i v_j' v_i \\
&\Rightarrow \left (M v_j \right )' v_i = \lambda _i v_j' v_i \\
&\Rightarrow \lambda_j v_j ' v_i = \lambda _i v_j' v_i \\
&\Rightarrow \left (\lambda_j - \lambda_i \right ) v_j ' v_i = 0 \\
&\Rightarrow v_j ' v_i = 0
\end{align}</math> 

If the eigenvalues are different – in the case of multiplicity, the basis can be orthogonalized.

To now establish that the Rayleigh quotient is maximised by the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue, consider decomposing an arbitrary vector ''x'' on the basis of the eigenvectors ''v<sub>i</sub>'':

:<math>x = \sum _{i=1} ^n \alpha _i v_i,</math>  

where  

:<math>\alpha_i = \frac{x'v_i}{v_i'v_i} = \frac{\langle x,v_i\rangle}{\left\| v_i \right\| ^2}</math> 

is the coordinate of x orthogonally projected onto ''v<sub>i</sub>''. Therefore we have:

:<math>R(M,x) = \frac{x' A' A x}{x' x} = \frac{ \left (\sum _{j=1} ^n \alpha _j v_j \right )' \left ( A' A \right ) \left (\sum _{i=1} ^n \alpha _i v_i \right )}{ \left (\sum _{j=1} ^n \alpha _j v_j \right )' \left (\sum _{i=1} ^n \alpha _i v_i \right )}</math>

which, by orthogonality of the eigenvectors, becomes:

:<math>R(M,x) = \frac{\sum _{i=1} ^n \alpha_i^2 \lambda _i}{\sum _{i=1} ^n \alpha_i^2} = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i \frac{(x'v_i)^2}{ (x'x)( v_i' v_i)}</math>

The last representation establishes that the Rayleigh quotient is the sum of the squared cosines of the angles formed by the vector ''x'' and each eigenvector ''v<sub>i</sub>'', weighted by corresponding eigenvalues.

If a vector ''x'' maximizes <math>R(M,x)</math>, then any non-zero scalar multiple ''kx'' also maximizes ''R'', so the problem can be reduced to the [[Lagrange multipliers|Lagrange problem]] of maximizing <math>\sum _{i=1}^n \alpha_i^2 \lambda _i</math> under the constraint that <math>\sum _{i=1} ^n \alpha _i ^2 = 1</math>.

Define: {{math|''?<sub>i</sub>'' {{=}} ''?''{{su|b=''i''|p=2}}}}. This then becomes a [[linear program]], which always attains its maximum at one of the corners of the domain. A maximum point will have <math>\alpha_1 = \pm 1</math> and <math>\alpha _i = 0</math> for all ''i'' > 1 (when the eigenvalues are ordered by decreasing magnitude).

Thus, as advertised, the Rayleigh quotient is maximised by the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue.

=== Formulation using Lagrange multipliers ===
Alternatively, this result can be arrived at by the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]]. The problem is to find the [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of the function

:<math>R(M,x) = x^T M x </math>, 
subject to the constraint <math>\|x\|^2 = x^Tx = 1.</math> I.e. to find the critical points of 
:<math>\mathcal{L}(x) = x^T M x  -\lambda \left (x^Tx - 1 \right), </math>
where ''?'' is a Lagrange multiplier. The stationary points of <math>\mathcal{L}(x)</math> occur at

:<math>\frac{d\mathcal{L}(x)}{dx} = 0 </math>
:<math>\therefore 2x^T M^T  - 2\lambda x^T = 0 </math>
:<math>\therefore M x = \lambda x </math>
and 
:<math> R(M,x) = \frac{x^T M x}{x^T x} = \lambda \frac{x^Tx}{x^T x} = \lambda.</math>

Therefore, the eigenvectors <math>x_1, \cdots, x_n</math> of ''M'' are the critical points of the Rayleigh Quotient and their corresponding eigenvalues <math>\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_n</math> are the stationary values of ''R''.

This property is the basis for [[principal components analysis]] and [[canonical correlation]].

==Use in Sturm&ndash;Liouville theory==
[[Sturm&ndash;Liouville theory]] concerns the action of the [[linear operator]]

:<math>L(y) = \frac{1}{w(x)}\left(-\frac{d}{dx}\left[p(x)\frac{dy}{dx}\right] + q(x)y\right)</math>

on the [[inner product space]] defined by

:<math>\langle{y_1,y_2}\rangle = \int_a^b w(x)y_1(x)y_2(x) \, dx</math>

of functions satisfying some specified [[boundary conditions]] at ''a'' and ''b''. In this case the Rayleigh quotient is

:<math>\frac{\langle{y,Ly}\rangle}{\langle{y,y}\rangle} = \frac{\int_a^b y(x)\left(-\frac{d}{dx}\left[p(x)\frac{dy}{dx}\right] + q(x)y(x)\right)dx}{\int_a^b{w(x)y(x)^2}dx}.</math>

This is sometimes presented in an equivalent form, obtained by separating the integral in the numerator and using [[integration by parts]]:

:<math>\begin{align}
\frac{\langle{y,Ly}\rangle}{\langle{y,y}\rangle} &= \frac{ \left \{ \int_a^b y(x)\left(-\frac{d}{dx}\left[p(x)y'(x)\right]\right) dx \right \}+ \left \{\int_a^b{q(x)y(x)^2} \, dx \right \}}{\int_a^b{w(x)y(x)^2} \, dx} \\
&= \frac{ \left \{\left. -y(x)\left[p(x)y'(x)\right] \right |_a^b \right \} + \left \{\int_a^b y'(x)\left[p(x)y'(x)\right] \, dx \right \} + \left \{\int_a^b{q(x)y(x)^2} \, dx \right \}}{\int_a^b w(x)y(x)^2 \, dx}\\
&= \frac{ \left \{ \left. -p(x)y(x)y'(x) \right |_a^b \right \} + \left \{ \int_a^b \left [p(x)y'(x)^2 + q(x)y(x)^2 \right] \, dx \right \} } {\int_a^b{w(x)y(x)^2} \, dx}.
\end{align}</math>

==Generalization==
For a given pair (''A'', ''B'') of matrices, and a given non-zero vector ''x'', the '''generalized Rayleigh quotient''' is defined as:

:<math>R(A,B; x) := \frac{x^* A x}{x^* B x}.</math>

The Generalized Rayleigh Quotient can be reduced to the Rayleigh Quotient <math>R(D, C^*x)</math> through the transformation <math>D = C^{-1} A {C^*}^{-1}</math> where <math>CC^*</math> is the [[Cholesky decomposition]] of the Hermitian positive-definite matrix ''B''.

The novel features Belgian detective [[Hercule Poirot]] and the mystery novelist [[Ariadne Oliver]]. The novel focuses on child murder, the irresponsibility of teenagers and the crisis in [[crime and punishment]]. This book was dedicated to [[P.G. Wodehouse]].

==Plot introduction==
During the preparation of a [[Hallowe'en]] party in Woodleigh Common, thirteen-year old Joyce Reynolds tells everyone, including Ariadne Oliver, that she saw a murder once, but only recently realised that it was a murder that she had seen. At the end of the party, Joyce is found drowned in an [[apple bobbing|apple-bobbing]] tub. Mrs Oliver is visiting her friend Judith Butler, whose daughter Miranda (age 12) is too ill to attend the party. With Mrs Oliver's help, Poirot must unmask the real evil of the night.

==Plot summary==

Mrs Oliver seeks Hercule Poirot's help. She is shaken by this death. She relates Joyce's claim, and now wonders if Joyce might have been telling the truth, which would provide someone with a motive for murdering her. Poirot investigates. He finds no one who admits to believing Joyce's story. Her older sister Ann and younger brother Leopold consider that Joyce told stories to gain attention.

Retired [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]] Spence provides Poirot with a list of murders or disappearances in the last few years that Joyce might have witnessed. Mrs Llewellyn-Smythe, the aunt of Rowena Drake and her late husband, died about two years earlier. A [[Codicil (will)|codicil]] to her will was found to be forged, and her [[au pair]] girl, Olga Seminoff, disappeared soon after, raising questions never fully answered. Other candidate murders involve Charlotte Benfield, a sixteen-year-old shop assistant found dead of multiple head injuries, with two young men under suspicion; Lesley Ferrier, a [[Clerk|lawyer's clerk]] who was stabbed in the back; and Janet White, a teacher at Elms School who was strangled.

At The Elms School, Poirot speaks first with the headmistress, Miss Emlyn, who sends in the mathematics teacher, Elizabeth Whittaker. While the party-goers were playing [[Snap-dragon (game)|snapdragon]], she saw Rowena Drake on the first floor landing. Rowena looked startled by what she saw in the open door of the library, and then dropped the glass flower vase she had filled with water. Other suggestive pieces of evidence include Lesley Ferrier's history as a forger. Many thought Lesley and Olga worked together to secure Mrs Llewellyn-Smythe's inheritance.

Poirot visits the lovely sunken garden built for Mrs Llewellyn-Smythe in an abandoned [[quarry]] by Michael Garfield. Poirot meets Garfield there, and then meets Miranda Butler. Mr Goby sends Poirot information about Olga. A one-time cleaner for Mrs. Llewellyn-Smythe tells Mrs Oliver about the codicil she witnessed. Rowena Drake seeks Poirot to tell him that Leopold Reynolds, Joyce's younger brother, has been drowned. Mrs Drake, unusually upset by Leopold's death, admits that she saw Leopold in the library, which led her to think he knew who killed his sister. Poirot shares that the boy had been flush of money, which would soon be explained.

Poirot knows what happened, and fears more murders. The police dig up an abandoned well where they find a knife and the remains of Olga, who had been stabbed like Ferrier. Mrs Oliver takes Judith and Miranda Butler safely away from the village; when they stop for lunch, Miranda rides away with Michael Garfield, who takes her to a [[pagan]] [[Human sacrifice|sacrificial altar]] and is set to kill her. He is stopped by Nicholas Ransom and Desmond Holland, two young men trailing Miranda at Poirot's request. Garfield swallows the poison he had intended for Miranda. Miranda tells the police that she saw a murder, and told her close friend Joyce the story. Hidden in a tree watching wildlife, Miranda saw Michael Garfield and Rowena Drake carrying Olga's dead body in the sunken garden years earlier. Joyce made the story her own at the party; Miranda was not there to contradict her. Rowena Drake did believe Joyce's story and acted immediately to kill the witness. Rowena Drake broke the vase of flowers in front of Miss Whittaker as a pretext for being wet after having drowned Joyce. Subsequently, Leopold had used what he knew to blackmail Rowena Drake, leading to his murder.

Garfield played the role of lover to Olga to help Rowena Drake secure Mrs Llewellyn-Smythe's inheritance. The real codicil, written by Mrs Llewellyn-Smythe and leaving her fortune to Olga, had been replaced with a clumsy forgery, produced by Lesley Ferrier, to halt investigation for the real one, left in the pages of a large book. In earlier wills, Rowena Drake would inherit the bulk of the large estate. Lesley Ferrier and Olga Seminoff were murdered to conceal the deceit. Garfield's motivation was his [[narcissistic]] desire to construct another perfect garden with Mrs Drake's money on a Greek island that she has secretly purchased. Poirot muses that Rowena Drake might have met a similar fate to Olga as Garfield would have no use for her once he secured her money. Poirot [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuits]] the link between Miranda and Garfield: Judith Butler is not a widow but a single mother, and, unknown to Miranda, Michael Garfield was her father. It was by chance Judith met him again in Woodleigh Common.

Questions left unanswered include whether Mr Drake's death was an accident, and if the police took Mrs Drake to trial.

==Literary significance and reception==
The novel is dedicated: "To [[P. G. Wodehouse]] — whose books and stories have brightened my life for many years. Also, to show my pleasure in his having been kind enough to tell me he enjoyed my books."

Robert Weaver in the ''[[Toronto Star|Toronto Daily Star]]'' of 13 December 1969 said, "''Hallowe'en Party''...is a disappointment, but with all her accomplishments Miss Christie can be forgiven some disappointments...Poirot seems weary and so does the book."<ref>''Toronto Daily Star'', 13 December 1969 (p. 58)</ref>

[[Robert Barnard]]: "Bobbing for apples turns serious when ghastly child is extinguished in the bucket. The plot of this late one is not too bad, but the telling is very poor: it is littered with loose ends, unrealised characters, and maintains only a marginal hold on the reader's interest. Much of it reads as if spoken into a tape-recorder and never read through afterward."<ref>Barnard, Robert. ''A Talent to Deceive – an appreciation of Agatha Christie – Revised edition'' (p. 194). Fontana Books, 1990. ISBN 0-00-637474-3</ref>

==References and Allusions==

===References to other works===
* Superintendent Spence brought to Poirot the case solved in ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' and which they discuss in Chapter 5. The case is also recollected by Poirot in Chapter 3, when Poirot recalls Mrs. Oliver getting out of a car and "a bag of apples breaking". This is a reference to her second appearance in ''Mrs McGinty's Dead'', Chapter 10.

* Miss Emlyn mentions in Chapter 10 that she knows of Poirot from Miss Bulstrode, who previously appeared as a character in ''[[Cat Among the Pigeons]]''.

* A letter was sent to Hercule Poirot from Mr Goby, who appeared in ''[[The Mystery of the Blue Train]]'', ''[[After the Funeral]]'', and ''[[Third Girl]]''.

* Mrs Rowena Drake is compared to [[Lady Macbeth]] by Poirot, while Michael Garfield titles his sketch of Miranda as [[Iphigenia]], reflecting his plan.

* Mrs Goodbody, a rich source of local insight, uses a well-known children's rhyme to express her view of the likely fate of Olga, when Poirot asks her in Chapter 16: [[Ding Dong Bell|Ding dong dell, pussy's in the well]].

===References to actual history, geography and current science===
* The first half of the novel contains several discussions in which anxiety is voiced about the Criminal Justice System in Great Britain. This in part reflects the abolition in 1965 of [[Hanging|capital punishment]] for murder.

* The novel reflects in many respects its time of publication at the end of the permissive sixties, but nowhere more so than when a character uses the word "lesbian" in Chapter 15.

* Mrs Llewellyn-Smythe placed her codicil in a book title [[Enquire Within upon Everything]], a real book of domestic tips published from 1856 to 1976.

==Adaptations==

===Graphic novel===
''Hallowe-en Party'' was released by [[HarperCollins]] as a [[graphic novel]] adaptation on 3 November 2008, adapted and illustrated by "Chandre" (ISBN 0-00-728054-8).

===Television===

The novel was adapted as part of the twelfth series of ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot]]'' with [[David Suchet]], with [[Zoë Wanamaker]] reprising her role as Ariadne Oliver. Guest stars include [[Deborah Findlay]] as Rowena Drake, [[Julian Rhind-Tutt]] as Michael Garfield, [[Amelia Bullmore]] as Judith Butler, and [[Fenella Woolgar]] as Elizabeth Whittaker. [[Charles Palmer (director)|Charles Palmer]] (who also directed ''[[The Clocks (novel)|The Clocks]]'' for the series) directs this instalment, with the screenplay written by [[Mark Gatiss]] (who wrote the screenplay for ''[[Cat Among the Pigeons]]''; he also appeared as a guest star in the adaptation of ''[[Appointment with Death]]'').

The [[List of Agatha Christie's Poirot episodes#Series 12 (2010-11)|television adaptation]] sets the late 1960s novel thirty years earlier, in 1936, as with nearly all shows in this series. The same characters are involved, with the same relationships among them. An anachronism arises from that move back in time. One character dismissively refers to Olga as "Olga Molotov or whatever". The name Molotov (as the Russian politician [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] or the improvised weapon named for him, the [[Molotov cocktail]] in 1939-40 <ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail |title=Etymology of Molotov cocktail |accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref>) would have been familiar in the original setting of the novel in the late 1960s. Before 1940, Molotov was not a well-known name in the UK. <!-- Is the television plot otherwise the same as the novel, relationships, motives? -->

===Radio===
''Hallowe'en Party'' was adapted for radio by BBC Radio 4, featuring [[John Moffatt (actor)|John Moffatt]] as Poirot.

'''Alfred Willi Rudi Dutschke''' (March 7, 1940 – December 24, 1979) was the most prominent spokesperson of the [[German student movement]] of the 1960s. He advocated a long march through the institutions of power to create radical change from within government and society by becoming an integral part of the machinery.<ref name="Satya">{{Citation | first = Richard | last = Huffmann | url = http://www.baader-meinhof.com/essays/SatyaEssay.html | publisher = Baader Meinhof | contribution = The Limits of Violence | title = Satya | date = March 2004}}.</ref> This was an idea he took up from his interpretation of [[Antonio Gramsci]] and the [[Frankfurt school]] of [[cultural Marxism]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Dietrich | last = Schwanitz | url = http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/booksabout/genlreviews/98RevKraushaarFkftSchStudentFAZ.htm | title = Frankfurter Schule und Studentenbewegung | newspaper = Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung | date = 29 June 1998 | publisher = Marcuse | language = German}}.</ref>  In the 1970s he followed through on this idea by joining the nascent Green movement.

[[File:Dutschke-tomb.JPG|thumb|180px|His grave in Berlin-Dahlem]]
In 1968, he survived an [[assassination]] attempt committed by [[Josef Bachmann]], living for another 12 years until health related problems caused his death. Radical students blamed an anti-student campaign in the papers of the [[Axel Springer]] publishing empire for  the assassination attempt. This led to attempts to blockade the distribution of Springer newspapers all over Germany, which in turn led to major street battles in many German cities.<ref>{{Citation | first = Paul | last = Hockenos | url = http://www.thenation.com/article/taz-year-thirty | first = ''Taz'' Year Thirty | newspaper = [[The Nation]] | date = 19 May 2008}}.</ref>

==Early life==
Dutschke was born in [[Schönefeld]], ([[Dahme-Spreewald]], [[Brandenburg]]), in the [[Third Reich]].  He attended school in  and graduated from the ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' there, but because he refused to join the army of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic (East Germany)]] and convinced many of his fellow students to refuse as well, he was prevented from attending university in the GDR. He fled to [[West Berlin]] in August 1961, just one day before the [[Berlin Wall]] was built. He studied [[sociology]] at the [[Free University of Berlin|Freie Universität Berlin]] under [[Richard Löwenthal]] and [[Klaus Meschkat]] where he became acquainted with alternative views of [[Marxism]].{{fact|date=October 2014}}

Dutschke joined the German SDS ''[[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund]]'' (which was not the same as the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|SDS]] in the USA, but quite similar in goals) in 1965 and from that time on the SDS became the center of the student movement, growing very rapidly and organizing demonstrations against the war in [[Vietnam]].{{fact|date=October 2014}}

He married the American Gretchen Klotz ([[:de:Gretchen Dutschke-Klotz|de]]) in 1966. They had three children. Dutschke's third child, 1980-born Rudi-Marek Dutschke (often known as just ''Marek Dutschke'') was born after his father's death. He is a politician of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|German Green Party]]<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.kandidatenwatch.de/rudi_marek_dutschke-323-8572.html | title = Kandidatenwatch | place = DE | contribution = Rudi Marek Dutschke}}.</ref> as well as Dean's Office staffer of the [[Hertie School of Governance]]<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.hertie-school.org/team.php?nav_id=453 | title = Hertie-school}}.</ref> today. His older siblings are Hosea-Che Dutschke (named after the [[Old Testament]] [[minor prophet]] [[Hosea]] and [[Che Guevara]]) and their sister Polly-Nicole, both born in 1968.

==Political views==
Influenced by critical theory, [[Rosa Luxemburg]], and critical Marxists and informed through his collaboration with fellow students from Africa and Latin America, Dutschke developed a theory and code of practice of social change via the practice of developing [[democracy]] in the process of revolutionizing society, collaborating with foreign students.<ref>{{Citation | first = Quinn | last = Slobodian | url = http://www.dukeupress.edu/Catalog/ViewProduct.php?productid=47580&viewby=subject&categoryid=100&sort=newest | first = Foreign Front: Third World Politics in Sixties West Germany | publisher = Duke University Press | chapter = 2}}.</ref>

Dutschke also advocated that the transformation of Western societies should go hand in hand with [[Third World]] liberation movements and with democratization in communist countries of [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. His [[socialism]] had strongly [[Christianity|Christian]] roots; he called [[Jesus Christ]] the "greatest revolutionary", and in [[Easter]] 1963, he wrote that "Jesus is risen. The decisive revolution in world history has happened — a revolution of all-conquering love. If people would fully receive this revealed love into their own existence, into the reality of the 'now', then the logic of insanity could no longer continue."<ref>{{Citation | first = Helmut | last = Frank | place = Bayern, DE | url = http://www.sonntagsblatt-bayern.de/03/2003_16_21_01.php?PHPSESSID=4c911... | contribution = Ich liebte diesen naiven Christen | title = Sonntagsblatt | date = 16–20 April 2003 | language = German}}.</ref>

[[Benno Ohnesorg]]'s death in 1967 at the hands of German police pushed some in the student movement toward increasingly [[extremism|extremist]] violence and the formation of the [[Red Army Faction]]. The violence against Dutschke further [[radicalisation|radicalised]] parts of the student movement into committing several bombings and murders. Dutschke rejected this direction and feared that it would harm or cause the dissolution of the student movement. Instead he advocated a 'long march through the institutions' of power to create radical change from within government and society by becoming an integral part of the machinery.<ref name ="Satya" /> The meaning of Dutschke's idea of a 'long march through the institutions' is in fact highly contested: most historians<ref>{{Citation | editor1-first = Belinda | editor1-last = Davis | editor2-first = Wilfried | editor2-last = Mausbach | editor3-first = Martin | editor3-last = Klimke | title = Changing the World, Changing Oneself: Political Protest and Collective Identities in West Germany and the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s}}.</ref> of '68 in West Germany understand it to mean advocating setting up an alternative society and recreating the institutions which were seen by Dutschke as beyond reform in their current state. It is highly unlikely Dutschke would have promoted change from within the parliamentary and judicial system, which were populated by former Nazis and political conservatives. This is made clear in the SDS reaction to the [[Kiesinger]]-led [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]-[[SPD]] grand coalition and the authoritarian Emergency Laws they passed.

==Shooting and later life==
On April 11, 1968, Dutschke was shot in the head by a young anti-communist, [[Josef Bachmann]].<ref name=Burleigh230>{{Cite book |title=Blood and Rage: History of Terrorism |last=Burleigh |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Burleigh |year=2011 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn= 9780062047175 |page=230 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6rlYvLTXcPAC&pg=PA230#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate= }}</ref> Dutschke survived the assassination attempt, and he and his family went to the United Kingdom in the hope that he could recuperate there. He was accepted at [[Clare Hall, Cambridge|Clare Hall]] a graduate college at the [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] to finish his degree in 1969, but in 1971 the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government under [[Edward Heath]] expelled him and his family as an "undesirable alien" who had engaged in "subversive activity", causing a political storm in London. They then moved to [[Aarhus|Århus]], [[Denmark]], after professor [[Johannes Sløk]] had offered him a job at the [[University of Aarhus]] which made it possible for Dutschke to gain a Danish residence permit.

Dutschke reentered the German political scene after protests against the building of [[nuclear power]] plants activated a new movement in the mid-1970s. He also began working with dissidents opposing the [[Communism|Communist]] governments in East Germany, Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, including [[Robert Havemann]], [[Wolf Biermann]], [[Mihailo Petkovic]], [[Milan Horá?ek]], [[Adam Michnik]], [[Ota Šik]] and more.

Because of brain damage sustained in the assassination attempt, Dutschke continued to suffer health problems. He died on 24 December 1979 in [[Aarhus|Århus]], Denmark. He had an [[epileptic seizure]] while in the bathtub and drowned.<ref name=Burleigh230/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/a-667960.html |title=Erinnerungen: Hosea Dutschke über den Tod seines Vaters vor 30 Jahren |last=Wendland |first=Johannes |year=2009 |work=Spiegel Online |publisher=''[[Der Spiegel]]'' |language=German |trans_title=Memories: Hosea Dutschke On His Father's Death 30 Years Ago |accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref>

==References in literature and music==
The song "Rot" by Markus Henrik features a mention of Dutschke, who can also be seen in the music video of the same. The song uses Dutschke as a reminder of political activism in [[Germany]] in the 60s and 70s.

There's also a Finnish song<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.aanitearkisto.fi/firs2/kappale.php?Id=Kolme+luotia+rudi+dutschkeen | publisher = Aanitearkisto | title = Kolme luotia Rudi Dutschkeen | language = Finnish | place = FI}}.</ref>  about Rudi Dutschke, by Eero Ojanen. It is based on the lyrics of the song ''Drei Kugeln auf Rudi Dutschke'' by [[Wolf Biermann]].

Dutschke appears as Prussian nobleman-turned anarchist Count Rudolf von Dutschke in the novel ''[[Warlord of the Air]]'', the first part of [[Michael Moorcock]]'s [[alternate history]]/[[steampunk]] trilogy ''[[A Nomad of the Time Streams]]''. Revolutionary socialist Count von Dutschke is close friends with a very aged [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov]] (whom he fondly relates to as ''"Uncle Vladimir"'') in Moorcock's alternate 1973 where [[World War I]] and the [[October Revolution]] never took place. In [[Harry Mulisch]]'s novel ''[[The Discovery of Heaven]]'' Dutschke makes a cameo appearance at a "political and musical happening" in a chapter titled "The Demons."

Dutschke was portrayed by [[Sebastian Blomberg]] in the 2008 film ''[[Der Baader Meinhof Komplex]]''.

'''Ariadne Oliver''' is a fictional character in the novels of [[Agatha Christie]]. She is a [[crime fiction|mystery]] novelist and a friend of [[Hercule Poirot]].

==Profile==
Mrs Oliver often assists Poirot in his cases through her knowledge of the criminal mind. She often claims to be endowed with particular "feminine intuition", but it usually leads her astray. She is particularly fond of apples, which becomes a plot point in the novel ''[[Hallowe'en Party]]''.

In the books, Oliver's most famous works are those featuring her vegetarian Finnish detective Sven Hjerson. Since she knows nothing of Finland, Oliver frequently laments Hjerson's existence. In many of her appearances, Oliver – and her feelings toward Hjerson – reflect Agatha Christie's own frustrations as an author, particularly with the Belgian Hercule Poirot (an example of [[self-insertion]]). The self-caricature has also been used to discuss Christie's own follies in her earlier novels. For instance, in ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'', Mrs Oliver talks of having made the blowpipe a foot long (30 cm) in one of her novels, whereas the actual length is something like four-and-a-half feet ({{convert|1+1/2|yd|cm}}) – the same mistake Christie made in ''[[Death in the Clouds]]''.

In ''[[The Pale Horse (novel)|The Pale Horse]]'', Mrs Oliver becomes acquainted with the Rev and Mrs Dane Calthrop, who are friends of [[Miss Marple]] (''[[The Moving Finger]]''), thus establishing that Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot exist in the same world. In ''[[Cards on the Table]]'', there is a reference to Mrs Oliver's book ''[[The Body in the Library]]''; this title was used by Christie six years later, for a novel featuring Miss Marple. Books by Ariadne Oliver and by a number of other fictitious mystery writers are discussed by characters in  ''[[The Clocks (novel)|The Clocks]]'' (1963). Like Christie, she is a member of the [[Detection Club]]. Christie even thought of placing a murder at the Club with Oliver being one of the suspects as well as the detective, but it came to nothing.<ref>''Agatha Christie's Secret Notebooks'', edited by John Curran.</ref>{Although in  ''[[Cards on the Table]]'', Mrs Oliver is both a suspect and a detective in a Poirot mystery of a murder during a bridge game}. A family crisis for Oliver’s goddaughter Celia provides the plot in ''[[Elephants Can Remember]]''.

In a short piece in ''[[John Bull (magazine)|John Bull Magazine]]'' in 1956, Christie was quoted as saying: "I never take my stories from real life, but the character of Ariadne Oliver does have a strong dash of myself." The author of the article went on to state: "It is perfectly true that sometimes she works at her stories in a large old-fashioned bath, eating apples and depositing the cores on the wide mahogany surround."<ref>''John Bull Magazine'', 11 August 1956. Volume 100, Number 2615 (p. 3)</ref>

==Literary function==
Even in the one novel in which she appears without Poirot (''[[The Pale Horse]]''), Mrs Oliver does not function as a detective, in that she rarely participates in the investigation and contributes only tangentially to the solution. In ''[[Cards on the Table]]'', she does interview some of the suspects, which in turn allows her to discover a hidden motive that even the police were unable to find; in ''[[Elephants Can Remember]]'', she again interviews witnesses, but none of the essential ones. She is more usually used for [[comic relief]] or to provide a [[deus ex machina]] through her intuitive or sudden insights, a function that is especially apparent in ''[[Third Girl]]'', in which she furnishes Poirot with virtually every important clue, or in ''The Pale Horse'', where she inadvertently helps the investigators to determine the type of poison used to kill the murder victims, saving the life of another character.

Further functions of Mrs Oliver are to enable Christie to discuss overtly the techniques of detective fiction, to contrast the more fanciful apparatuses employed by mystery authors with the apparent [[Literary realism|realism]] of her own plots, and to [[Satire|satirise]] Christie's own experiences and instincts as a writer. Mrs Oliver therefore serves a range of literary purposes for Christie.

==Literary appearances==
The true first appearance of Mrs Oliver was a brief appearance in the short story ''[[Parker Pyne Investigates#The Case of the Discontented Soldier|The Case of the Discontented Soldier]]'' which was first published, along with four other stories in the August 1932 issue of the U.S. version of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine (issue number 554) under the sub-heading of ''Are You Happy? If Not Consult Mr. Parker Pyne''. The story first appeared in the UK in issue 614 of ''Woman's Pictorial'' on 15 October 1932, and was later published in book form in 1934 as ''[[Parker Pyne Investigates]]'' (titled ''Mr. Parker Pyne, Detective'' in the USA). Within this story she appeared as part of Pyne's unorthodox team of freelance assistants. Within the same book, she also briefly appears in ''The Case of the Rich Woman''.

All her subsequent appearances (save ''The Pale Horse'') were in Poirot novels:

* ''[[Cards on the Table]]'' (1936)
* ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' (1952)
* ''[[Dead Man's Folly]]'' (1956)
* ''[[The Pale Horse (novel)|The Pale Horse]]'' (1961) — Oliver's only appearance in a Christie novel without Poirot
* ''[[Third Girl]]'' (1966)
* ''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'' (1969)
* ''[[Elephants Can Remember]]'' (1972)
* ''[[Hercule Poirot and the Greenshore Folly]] (2014) - a novella that was later expanded and published as Dead Man's Folly.

An advert for Ariadne Oliver's ''With Vinegar and Brown Paper'' (as with Agatha Christie using nursery rhyme references) appears in the Frontispiece of the [[Mark Gatiss]] book ''The Devil in Amber'' along with other adverts for made-up books.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/jun/24/fiction.features Interview: Mark Gatiss | Books | The Observer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Representations in film, television, and radio adaptations==
The first appearance of Ariadne Oliver on television was in an episode of ''The Agatha Christie Hour'' (1982). In an adaptation of the Parker Pyne story ''The Case of the Discontented Soldier'', she was portrayed by [[Lally Bowers]].

A 1986 adaptation of ''Dead Man's Folly'' starred [[Jean Stapleton]] as Ariadne Oliver, opposite [[Peter Ustinov]] as Poirot.

[[Zoë Wanamaker]] has played Ariadne Oliver in six television episodes of the series ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot]]'', starring [[David Suchet]] as [[Hercule Poirot]]. In the last episode of the series, Mrs Oliver-a combination of Agatha Christie/Miss Marple- is helpful to Poirot in an adaption of ''[[Dead Man's Folly]] which was filmed on the Christie Estate.

In the BBC Radio 4 plays, Ariadne Oliver has been played by [[Stephanie Cole]] (''[[Cards on the Table]]'' and ''[[The Pale Horse]]''), and by [[Julia McKenzie]] (''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'', ''[[Dead Man's Folly]]'', and ''[[Elephants Can Remember]]''). {{When|date=January 2012}}

Born and raised in [[New York City]],<ref name=filmrefdiane /> Lane made her screen debut in [[George Roy Hill]]'s 1979 film ''[[A Little Romance]]'', starring opposite Sir [[Laurence Olivier]]. Soon after, she was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine and dubbed "the new [[Grace Kelly]]". She has since appeared in several notable films, including the 2002 film ''[[Unfaithful (2002 film)|Unfaithful]]'', which earned her nominations for an [[Academy Award]], a [[Golden Globe]] and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]. Lane has also starred in ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'', ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]'', ''[[Under the Tuscan Sun (film)|Under the Tuscan Sun]]'', ''[[Cinema Verite]]'', ''[[Jack (1996 film)| Jack]]'', and in 2013, ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''.

==Early life==
Lane was born in New York City to [[Colleen Farrington|Colleen Leigh Farrington]], a nightclub singer and ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' centerfold (Miss October 1957), who was also known as "Colleen Price" and Burton Eugene Lane, a Manhattan drama coach who ran an acting workshop with [[John Cassavetes]], worked as a cab driver, and later taught humanities at [[City College of New York|City College]].<ref name="Sager">{{cite news |last=Sager |first=Mike |title=The Happy Life of Diane Lane |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |date=2000-06-01 |url=http://www.esquire.com/happy-life-diane-lane-0600 |accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref> When Lane was thirteen days old, her parents separated. Lane's mother went to [[Mexico]] and [[Mexican divorce|obtained a divorce]] while retaining custody of Lane until she was six years old.<ref name="Sager"/> Lane's father got custody of her after Lane's mother moved to Georgia. Lane and her father lived in a number of residential hotels in New York City and she would ride with him in his taxi.<ref name="Dougherty">{{cite news |last=Dougherty |first=Margot |author2=David Hutchings |title=Diane Lane, with a New Husband and No Fear of Flying, Takes Wing Again in ''Lonesome Dove'' |date=1989-02-13 |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20119558,00.html |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref>

When Lane was fifteen years old, she declared her independence from her father and flew to [[Los Angeles]] for a week with actor and friend [[Christopher Atkins]]. Lane later remarked, "It was reckless behavior that comes from having too much independence too young."<ref name="Dougherty"/> She returned to New York and moved in with a friend's family, paying them rent.

Lane's grandmother, Eleanor Scott was a [[Pentecostal]] [[preacher]] of the [[Apostolic Church (denomination)|Apostolic]] denomination, and Lane was influenced theatrically by the demonstrative quality of her grandmother's sermons.<ref name="bravo">{{cite episode |title = Diane Lane |series=Inside the Actors Studio |serieslink=Inside the Actors Studio |network=[[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0611217/|airdate=2004-02-06|season=10|number=9}}</ref><ref name="Cagle">{{cite news |last=Cagle |first=Jess |title=Diane Lane Gets Lucky |work=[[Time magazine|Time]] |date=2002-05-19 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,238601,00.html |accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref> Lane began acting professionally at the age of six at the La MaMa Experimental Theater Club in New York, where she appeared in a production of ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]''. When Lane was twelve years old, she had a role in [[Joseph Papp]]'s production of ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' with [[Meryl Streep]].<ref name="Sager"/> Also at this time, Lane was enrolled in an accelerated program at [[Hunter College High School]] and was put on notice when her grades suffered from her busy schedule.<ref name="Sager"/> When Lane was thirteen years old, she turned down a role in ''Runaways'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] to make her feature film debut opposite [[Laurence Olivier]] in ''[[A Little Romance]]''.<ref name="Dougherty"/> Lane won high praise from Olivier who declared her 'The New [[Grace Kelly]]'.<ref name="Bhattacharya">{{cite news |last=Bhattacharya |first=Sanjiv |title=Memory Lane |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2002-05-26 |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,722253,00.html |accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref> At the same time Lane was featured on the cover of ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'', which declared her one of [[Hollywood]]'s "Whiz Kids."<ref name="tim001">{{cite news |title=Cover of ''Time'' Magazine |work=[[Time magazine|Time]] |date=1979-08-13 |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19790813,00.html |accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref><ref name="Skow">{{cite news |last=Skow |first=John |title=Hollywood's Whiz Kids |work=[[Time magazine|Time]] |date=1979-08-13 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948564,00.html |accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref>

In the early 1980s, Lane made a successful transition from child actor to adult roles. She was cast as the teenaged female [[outlaw]] [[Little Britches (outlaw)|Little Britches]] in the 1981 [[Lamont Johnson]] film, ''[[Cattle Annie and Little Britches]]'', with [[Amanda Plummer]] in her own debut role as [[Cattle Annie]]. Lane's breakout performances came with back-to-back adaptations of young adult novels by [[S. E. Hinton]], adapted and directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]]: ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'' and ''[[Rumble Fish]]'', both in 1983. Both films also featured memorable performances from a number of young male actors who would go on to become leading men in the next decade (as well as members of the so-called "[[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]]"), including [[Tom Cruise]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[C. Thomas Howell]], [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Nicolas Cage]], and [[Matt Dillon]].<ref name="Sager"/> Lane's distinction among these heavily male casts advanced her career while affiliating her with this young generation of male actors.

[[File:Diane Lane at the 1989 Emmy Awards crop.jpg|right|170px|thumb|Lane at the 41st [[Emmy Award]]s in September 1989.]]
Lane returned to acting to appear in ''[[The Big Town (1987 film)|The Big Town]]'' and ''[[Lady Beware]]'', but it was not until 1989's popular and critically acclaimed [[miniseries|TV miniseries]] ''[[Lonesome Dove (TV miniseries)|Lonesome Dove]]'' that Lane made another big impression on a sizable audience,<ref name="Wolk"/> and was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/diane-lane |title=Diane Lane Emmy Award Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-29}}</ref> for her role. She was given positive reviews for her performance in the independent film ''My New Gun'', which was well received at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. She went on to appear as actress [[Paulette Goddard]] in Sir [[Richard Attenborough]]'s big-budget biopic of [[Charlie Chaplin|Charles Chaplin]], 1992's ''[[Chaplin (film)|Chaplin]]''.<ref name="Williamson"/> Lane won further praise for her role in 1999's ''[[A Walk on the Moon]]'', opposite [[Viggo Mortensen]].

===Recent work===
In 2000, Lane had a supporting role as Mark Wahlberg's love interest in ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]].'' In 2002, she starred in ''[[Unfaithful (2002 film)|Unfaithful]],'' a [[drama film]] directed by [[Adrian Lyne]] and adapted from the [[Cinema of France|French]] film ''[[La Femme infidèle|The Unfaithful Wife]].'' Lane played a housewife who indulges in an adulterous fling with a mysterious book dealer. The film featured several sex scenes. Lyne's repeated takes for these scenes were very demanding for the actors involved, especially for Lane, who had to be emotionally and physically fit for the duration.<ref name="Kobel">{{cite news |last=Kobel |first=Peter |title=Smoke to Go With the Steam |work=[[New York Times]] |date=2002-05-05 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04EFD91731F936A35756C0A9649C8B63&scp=1&sq=%22Smoke+to+Go+With+the+Steam%22&st=nyt |accessdate=2008-06-19 }}</ref> ''Unfaithful'' received mostly mixed to negative reviews, though Lane earned widespread praise for her performance. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' critic [[Owen Gleiberman]] stated that "Lane, in the most urgent performance of her career, is a revelation. The play of lust, romance, degradation, and guilt on her face is the movie's real story."<ref name="Gleiberman">{{cite news |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |title=''Unfaithful'' |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2002-05-05 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,237208,00.html |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> She followed that film up with ''[[Under the Tuscan Sun (film)|Under the Tuscan Sun]],'' based on the best-selling book by [[Frances Mayes]].

In 2008, Lane reunited with [[Richard Gere]] for the romantic drama ''[[Nights in Rodanthe (film)|Nights in Rodanthe]].'' It is the third film Gere and Lane filmed together. The film was based on the novel of the same title by [[Nicholas Sparks (author)|Nicholas Sparks]]. Lane also co-starred in ''[[Jumper (film)|Jumper]],'' and ''[[Untraceable]]'' in the same year. She then appeared in ''[[Killshot (film)|Killshot]]'' with [[Mickey Rourke]], which was given a limited theatrical release before being released on DVD in 2009. While promoting ''Nights in Rodanthe,'' she expressed frustration with being typecast and stated that she was "gunning for something that's not so sympathetic. I need to be a bitch, and I need to be in a comedy. I've decided. No more Miss Nice Guy."<ref name="Showbiz">{{cite news |title=Lane Contemplates Quitting Acting |work=Showbiz Spy |date=2008-09-23 |url=http://www.showbizspy.com/article/Lane-Contemplates-Quitting-Acting/172998 |accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref> The actress has even contemplated quitting acting and spending more time with her family if she is unable to get these kinds of roles. She said in an interview, "I can't do anything official. My agents won't let me. Between you and me, I don't have anything else coming out."<ref name="Showbiz"/>

In 2010, Lane starred in ''[[Secretariat (film)|Secretariat]],'' a [[Disney]] film about the relationship between the 1973 [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]]-winning [[Secretariat (horse)|racehorse]] and his owner, [[Penny Chenery]], whom Lane portrayed.<ref name="Fleming">{{cite news |last=Fleming |first=Michael |title=Diane Lane takes reins of ''Secretariat'' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2009-06-10 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118004795.html?categoryId=13&cs=1 |accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref>

Following ''[[Secretariat (film)|Secretariat]],'' Lane starred in ''[[Cinema Verite]]'', an HBO movie about the making of the first reality television show ''[[An American Family]]''. Lane earned Emmy, Screen Actors Guild, Satellite, and Golden Globe award nominations for her portrayal of [[Pat Loud]].

In 2012, Lane returned to her theater roots and headlined a production of ''[[Sweet Bird of Youth]]'', the [[Tennessee Williams]] play, at the [[Goodman Theatre]]. She played Princess Kosmonopolis, a fading Hollywood movie star, opposite [[Finn Wittrock]], who portrayed Chance, her attractive gigolo. This was the first time she had done a stage play since 1989, when she played Olivia in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' at the [[American Repertory Theatre]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].<ref name="Weiss">{{cite news |last=Weiss |first=Hedy |title=Diane Lane headed to Goodman in ''Sweet Bird of Youth'' |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=2012-07-12 |url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/stage/13720233-421/diane-lane-headed-to-goodman-in-sweet-bird-of-youth.html |accessdate=2012-07-12 }}</ref> That same year Lane was featured in the documentary ''Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide'', premiering on PBS October 1 and 2.<ref name="halfthesky">http://www.halftheskymovement.org/pages/diane-lane</ref> The series introduces women and girls living under very difficult circumstances and bravely fighting to challenge them.

===Charity work===
Lane is also involved in several charities, including [[Heifer International]], which focuses on world hunger, and Artists for Peace and Justice, a Hollywood organization that supports [[Haiti]] relief. However, she tries not to draw attention to her humanitarian efforts: "Sometimes I give with my heart. Sometimes I give financially, but there's something about [helping others] that I think ought to be anonymous. I don't want it to be a boastful thing."<ref name="Spines2">{{cite news |last=Spines |first=Christine |title=Diane Lane |url=http://www.lhj.com/style/covers/diane-lane/ |work=[[Ladies' Home Journal]]|date=October 2010 | accessdate =2010-09-09 }}</ref>

Lane was featured heavily in the documentary ''Half The Sky'', based on the book ''[[Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide]]''. The documentary saw Lane and several other A-list actresses/celebrities visit Africa and other areas where women are oppressed. Lane has become very much an ambassador for this kind of work and charity work in general.

On August 22, 2014, Diane Lane was honored for her work with Heifer International at Heifer’s third annual Beyond Hunger: A Place at the Table gala at the Montage Beverly Hills. Lane says working with Heifer has not only her touched her life, but has enriched her relationship with her daughter. <ref>http://variety.com/2014/scene/lifestyle/heifer-intl-honors-diane-lane-1201285721/</ref>

The '''Plymouth Road Runner''' was a performance car built by the [[Plymouth automobile|Plymouth]] division of the [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]] in the [[United States]] between 1968 and 1980. In 1968, the first muscle cars were, in the opinion of many, moving away from their roots as relatively cheap, fast cars as they gained options. Although Plymouth already had a performance car in the [[Plymouth GTX|GTX]], designers decided to go back to the drawing board and reincarnate the original muscle car concept. Plymouth wanted a car able to run 14-second times in the [[quarter mile]] (402&nbsp;m) and sell for less than [[United States dollar|US$]]3000. Both goals were met, and the low-cost muscle car hit the street. The success of the Road Runner would far outpace the upscale and lower volume [[Plymouth GTX|GTX]], with which it was often confused.

===1968===
Paying $50,000 to [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] to use the name and likeness of their [[Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner|Road Runner]] cartoon character (as well as a "[[beep, beep (sound)|beep, beep]]" horn, which Plymouth paid $10,000 to develop), and using the [[Chrysler B platform]] as a base (the same as the Belvedere), Plymouth set out to build a back-to-basics muscle car. Everything essential to performance and handling was beefed-up and improved; everything nonessential was left out. The interior was spartan with a basic vinyl bench seat, lacking even carpets in early models with an automatic transmission, and few options were available - just the basics such as power steering and front disc brakes, AM radio, air conditioning (except with the 426 Hemi) and automatic transmission. A floor-mounted shifter (for the four-speed) featured only a rubber boot and no console so that a bench seat could be used. The earliest of the 1968 models were available only as 2-door pillared coupes (with a [[Pillar (car)|B-pillar]] between the front and rear windows), but later in the model year a 2-door "[[hardtop]]" model (sans pillar) was offered. The Road Runner of 1968-1970 was based on the Belvedere, while the GTX was based on the Sport Satellite, a car with higher level trim and slight differences in the grilles and taillights.

The standard engine was an exclusive-to-the-Road Runner [[Chrysler B engine#383|383 CID (6.3&nbsp;L) Roadrunner]] [[V8 engine|V8]] rated at {{convert|335|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|425|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]]. Its extra {{convert|5|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} rating was the result of using the radical cam from the 440 Super Commando and a .25 raise in compression to  10.5:1 (vs. 10.25:1 with the {{convert|330|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 383). When air conditioning was ordered, the cars received the {{convert|330|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version, as the radical cam specs of the {{convert|335|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version didn't create enough vacuum to accommodate a/c; and there were concerns of overrevving which would grenade the RV-2 York compressor. For an extra $714, Plymouth would install a [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Hemi design reintroduced|426 CID Hemi]] rated at {{convert|425|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|490|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Combined with low weight, the 6-passenger Road Runner could run the 1/4 mile in 13.5&nbsp;seconds at 105&nbsp;mph (169&nbsp;km/h). It would prove to be one of the best engines of the muscle car era, and the Road Runner one of the best platforms to utilize it.

The standard equipment transmission was a four-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] with floor shifter and Chrysler's three-speed TorqueFlite [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] was optional. Early four-speed '68 Road Runners featured Inland shifters, which were replaced by the more precise Hurst shifters during the course of the model year.

Plymouth expected to sell about 20,000 units in 1968; actual sales numbered around 45,000. This placed the Road Runner third in sales among muscle cars with only the Pontiac GTO and Chevy's SS-396 Chevelle outselling it. Dodge debuted the Road Runner's cousin, the [[Dodge Super Bee|Super Bee]], as a mid-1968 offering after seeing Plymouth's success with the Road Runner, along with demands from Dodge dealers for their own low-priced muscle car as the Dodge Boys started the model year with the higher-priced Charger R/T and Coronet R/T - both of which were priced similar or higher than the Plymouth GTX.

===1969===
The 1969 model kept the same basic look but with some slight changes such as tail lights and grille, side marker lights, optional bucket seats, and new Road Runner decals. The Road Runner added a convertible option for 1969 with 2128 droptop models produced that year. All were 383 engine cars, except for ten 426ci Hemi convertible cars. Six of those Hemi convertibles were automatics and four were four-speed manual transmissions. Six are known to exist. No 440 6-bbl convertibles were made in 1969.

An ''Air Grabber'' option (N96 code) was introduced this year; it consisted of a fiberglass air duct assembly bolted to the underside of the hood that connected to twin rectangular upward-facing vents in the hood with orange vent screens. The fiberglass hood box had an "Air Grabber" sticker on the front. When the hood was closed, a rubber seal fit over the large-oval unsilenced air cleaner. A decal with Wile E. Coyote saying "Coyote Duster" was on the air cleaner lid. The assembly ducted air directly into the engine.  The vents in the hood could be opened and closed via a lever under the dashboard labeled "Carb Air." <ref name="autogenerated1946"/>

In 1969 the 383ci engine was the standard powerplant, and the 426 cubic inch Hemi was the only engine option available for the Road Runner until mid year production. The standard 383ci V8 had 335 horsepower, and was marketed as the "383 Roadrunner" engine, which is also what the air cleaner read. The 383 Roadrunner had 5 more horsepower than the usual 383 Commando or Super Commando, thanks to a more radical cam. In addition to its higher horsepower rating, the 383 also had an astonishing 425 pound-feet of torque, which was the second-largest torque rating offered by Plymouth. However, if you were to order your Roadrunner with optional A/C, your standard 383 would be bumped down to the ordinary 330 horsepower. This is because the radical cam in the 335 hp version did not provide enough vacuum. 

The (A12) 440 cubic inch engine option with three Holley 2 barrel carburetors was added to the lineup at mid-year. Several of the cars were ran in Super Stock Eliminator drag race competitions. As denoted on its fiberglass hood, Dodge marketed its three two-barrel setup as the "440 Six Pack" for the 1969 Super Bee. 440 6-bbl Road Runners had no wheel covers or hubcaps, sporting only the 15x6" "H" stamped steel black wheels with chrome lug nuts.  It featured an organosol black fiberglass lift-off hood with 4 hood pins and a large functional hood scoop with a red sticker on each side saying "440 6BBL". The scoop sealed to the large air breather.  All cars had a [[Dana 60]] rear axle with a 4.10 gear ratio. Production of the 440 6-bbl A12 option Road Runner was approximately 1432.  The A12 option had an "M" as the fifth character in the VIN.  The 440 engine was rated at {{convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 4700 rpm, and 490 pound-feet of torque @ 3200 rpm, the same torque as the Hemi but at a lower engine speed. This meant the stock 440 6bbl was about as fast as the stock 426 Hemi in the 1/4 mile, with its lighter engine and hood.  This option, along with the standard 383 and the Hemi made Plymouth and Dodge fierce competitors at the dragstrip. The Plymouth Road Runner was named Motor Trend "Car of the Year" for 1969. Sales topped 84,000 that year.

===1970===

1970 brought new front and rear end looks to the basic 1968 body, and it would prove to be another success. Updates included a new grille, a cloth & vinyl bench seat, hood, front fenders, quarter panels, single-piston Kelsey-Hayes disc brakes (improved from the rather small-rotor Bendix 4 piston calipers of '68 - '69 ), and even non-functional scoops in the rear quarters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autotraderclassics.com/car-article/1970+Plymouth+Road+Runner+-66634.xhtml |title=1970 Plymouth Road Runner Buyer's Guide |publisher=Autotraderclassics.com |date= ;]|accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref> The design and functionality of the Air Grabber option was changed this year to increase both efficiency and the "intimidation factor". A switch below the dash actuated a vacuum servo to slowly raise the forward-facing scoop, exposing shark-like teeth on either side.  "High Impact" colors, with names like In-Violet, Moulin Rouge, and Vitamin C, were options available for that year. The 1970 Road Runner and GTX continued to be attractive and popular cars. The engine lineup was left unchanged although a heavy-duty three-speed manual became the standard transmission, relegating the four-speed to the option list along with the TorqueFlite automatic. This was to be the second and last year of the Road Runner convertible, with only 834 made. These cars are considered more valuable than the 1969 version due to a better dash, high impact colors and more options including the new high-back bucket seats shared with other Chrysler products which featured built-in headrests.

The relatively popular 440 Six Barrel was relegated to option status for 1970. The 1969 "M" Code Edelbrock aluminum intake was replaced by a factory-produced cast iron piece; however there were some early cars built prior to January 1, 1970 that were equipped with the left over aluminum Edelbrock intake from the year prior.

Sales of the '70 Road Runner dropped by more than 50 percent over the previous year to around 41,000 units (about 1,000 ahead of Pontiac's GTO but still about 13,000 units behind Chevy's Chevelle SS-396/454). This would also be the last year of the Road Runner convertible with 834 total production. Only 3 Hemi (R) code Road Runner convertibles were built (plus 1 to CANADA). The declining sales of Road Runner and other muscle cars were the result of a move by insurance companies to add surcharges for muscle car policies - making insurance premiums for high-performance vehicles a very expensive proposition. Also, Plymouth introduced another bargain-basement muscle car for 1970, the compact [[Plymouth Duster|Duster 340]] which was powered by a {{convert|275|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 340 4BBL V8 which in the lighter-weight compact A-body could perform as well if not better than a 383 Road Runner. Furthermore, the Duster 340 was priced even lower than the Road Runner and its smaller engine qualified it for much lower insurance rates.

===Plymouth Duster I===
The '''Plymouth Duster I''' was a high-performance concept car version of the Road Runner produced in the late 1960s. It featured the usual low-curved racing-type of windshield and had airplane-type flaps on the top and sides. A set of adjustable spoilers on the side of the rear fender (near the gas tank filler cap) helped prevent side-to-side yaw when slipstreaming in a race, with two more of them on top behind the driver, plus spoilers in the front as rock shields to reduce frontal lift.
It was powered by a 383 4BBL V-8.<ref>'Cars Detroit Never Built: Fifty Years of Experimental Cars' by Edward Janicki P. 113 ISBN 0-8069-7424-9</ref>

== 1970 Superbird ==

[[File:Plymouth Superbird.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Plymouth Superbird]]

{{main|Plymouth Superbird}}

In the tough competition of the 1969 NASCAR "aero wars", Chrysler first fielded the Dodge Charger 500 that featured aerodynamic improvements to a standard 1969 Charger. Later in the season Chrysler and Dodge debuted the [[Dodge Charger Daytona]]. The Daytona featured an elevated spoiler raised 23 inches off of the trunk deck by upright pylons and an aerodynamic nose cone. The Charger 500, especially, and the Daytona to a lesser degree struggled to equal the fastback [[Ford Torino Talladega]] and [[Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II]] in 1969. Dissatisfied with the performance of the 1968 Road Runner, [[Petty Engineering]] had asked the Chrysler managers for 1969 Dodge Charger 500s and Charger Daytonas for the 1969 season. Unfortunately, the Chrysler managers told the Pettys that they were "a Plymouth team." The Pettys signed with Ford in days and [[Richard Petty]] and Petty Engineering won 10 races in 1969 and finished second in the [[NASCAR]] points championship.

To meet NASCAR [[homologation]] rules and also to bring Petty Engineering back to Chrysler, it was decided that Plymouth would get its own version of Dodge's winged wonder for the 1970 NASCAR season. While spectacular on the track, consumer response was luke-warm, leading a few dealers to remove the wing and nose, making them appear more like normal Road Runners. Significantly all public sold Superbirds had vinyl tops, while the Charger Daytonas did not. Production was 1,935 for the US market.  135 Hemi's (58 4Spd and 77 Automatics), 1,084 - 440 4BBL Super Commando's (458 4Spd and 626 Automatics) and 716 - 440 Six Barrel's (308 4Spd and 408 Automatics).  

According to Road Test magazine, performance was around 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 5.5&nbsp;seconds, 1/4&nbsp;mile in 14.3&nbsp;seconds at 104&nbsp;mph with the Hemi.<ref name="aerowarriors">{{cite web  | url=http://www.aerowarriors.com/sss.html  | title=Street Superbird Specifications | accessdate=2008-05-21 }}</ref> Although similar in appearance, the Superbird was actually quite different from the Daytona. The Superbird was based on the Plymouth Road Runner and the nose, airfoil, and basic sheet metal was different between the Daytona and Superbird. The Superbird actually used the front fenders and a modified hood from the '70 Dodge Coronet that lent themselves better to the nose design. It was an easy fix due to the fact that the mounting points for fenders on both cars were identical. The special nose added 19-inches (483&nbsp;mm) to the overall length (the Daytona's was 18-inches or 457&nbsp;mm), and the trunk spoiler was more angled and higher than the Daytonas. On both models, the spoiler was two feet high. Although it created quite an impression on the street, the wing was not needed at normal highway speeds; it was designed for speedways, to keep the rear wheels to the ground at {{convert|150|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and higher speeds.

[[NASCAR]] only required 500 copies to be built in 1969, but in 1970, NASCAR required a manufacturer to build one unit per dealer. In the end, Plymouth built a total of 1,935 Super Birds. Super Birds were available with three different engines. The most popular was the basic Super Commando 440&nbsp;V8 with a single four barrel [[carburetor]] rated at {{convert|375|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Next up was the 440 Six Barrel rated at {{convert|390|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. At the top, and ordered by just 135 buyers, was the mighty 426&nbsp;Hemi, rated at {{convert|425|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Despite the success of the Super Bird on the tracks, 1970 would be the only year it was made.

The reason for using such a tall spoiler was so on the production version the trunk could open. In test the spoiler didn't need to be so tall. The tallest the spoiler had to be was the same height as the roof.

=== 1971 ===

In 1971, the coupe bodywork was completely changed to a more rounded "fuselage" design in keeping with then-current Chrysler styling trends, including a steeply raked windshield, hidden cowl, and deeply inset grille and headlights. In a departure from previous thinking, the B-Body two-door bodies shared little if any sheet metal, glass, or trim with the four-door bodies. The convertible was canceled. 1971 was a high-water year for ride and handling for the Road Runner. The overall length was increased, but the wheelbase was shortened an inch. It also saw the introduction of the 340-4bbl option, and a detuned 383 "Road Runner" engine with 8.7 compression, hardened exhaust valve seats, and power dropping to {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. In return, Road Runners with the 340 and 383 engine received a standard insurance rating without the costly premiums normally tacked onto muscle cars. The 383 would now run on regular gas. Aerodynamics were much improved over the first generation Road Runners, resulting in much-improved high-speed handling.

=== 1972 ===

1972 saw new emission regulations drive power down and 1/4&nbsp;mile times up.[[File:'72 Plymouth Road Runner (Les chauds vendredis '10).jpg|thumb|left|1972 Plymouth Road Runner]]The 1972 model was nearly identical to the 1971 with a few minor changes. The grille design was cleaned up, and the tail lights were changed to match the new aerodynamic look of the grille. Side marker lights changed from the flush mounted side markers to the surface-mounted units that were adopted across the entire Chrysler line-up for the 1972 model year. The optional bumper guards for 1972 included a rubber strip surrounding the tail lights and a rubber strip below the grille.  The big differences came in the cutting back of performance options for the car.  The suspension, rear axle ratios (a 3:55 ratio was the tallest available), and most noticeably the engines changed, with the big-block 383 being replaced by a larger-bore (and lower performance) 400 CID version as the standard engine.  The small-block 340 CID as well as the performance version of the 440&nbsp;CID engine (with a 4-barrel carburetor, performance camshaft, and dual exhausts) were also available, and for the last time a 4-speed manual transmission could be paired with any of the three engines.  All of the engines suffered a drop in compression ratios to allow use of low-lead/no-lead gas and to meet the first round of [[emissions regulations]].  The {{convert|280|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 440 engine was the basis for the "GTX" package (the GTX was no longer a separate model) available on Road Runners from 1972 to 1974.  The 1971-72 Road Runner sheetmetal was used by several [[NASCAR]] racing teams for their racecars and ran well on the circuit during the 1971-74 seasons.  [[Richard Petty]] won the championship both in 1971 and 1972 using the Road Runner based cars, winning 30 races over the two seasons.

For 1972 power ratings on all engines looked much lower on paper due to the new [[Horsepower#SAE net power|SAE net]] measurement system.  The famed 426&nbsp;Hemi was discontinued for 1972, and only five 440 Six Barrel equipped cars were produced before this engine option was dropped (it was determined the 440 six-pack could not meet the stricter 1972 emissions regulations) in the fall of 1971.

=== 1973-74 ===

The 1973-74 models received completely new sheet metal and had more conventional squared-up front-end styling and changes to the rear that more closely resembled the four-door models than the 71-72s.  The restyling helped sales which were up 40% over the 1972 models.  In testing 1/4 mile times were getting close to the 16s, top speeds had dropped to barely over {{convert|125|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and the car moved further away from "musclecar" status. The base engine for the 1973-74 models had dropped down to Chrysler's workaday 318 CID [[V8 engine|V8]] but equipped with dual exhausts which bumped the power up to {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. After 1972, no 440 with [[Manual transmission|four-speed manual]] cars were built. The 400 was the biggest engine Plymouth offered with the four-speed, which could also be had with the 340 (1973), and 360 (1974) engines. The 318 was equipped with a three speed manual transmission as standard (though very few were built), and the TorqueFlite as an option. The 440 was still available for 1973 and 1974, but only mated to the 727 [[TorqueFlite]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]].

From the Lynch Road plant in Detroit, Michigan came a few rare errors. Road Runners with the 318ci engine were destined to have a 3-speed manual transmission or the 727 TorqueFlite only. The 440ci-equipped cars were to only receive the 727 TorqueFlite, with documentation showing only 117 having been built, though rumors continue that a few were built specially ordered with the [[Hurst]] 4-speed. In addition, there was at least one 1973 Road Runner that came with a 318 and a column-shifted 3-speed manual transmission. This car was supposedly Spinnaker White with black stripes and black vinyl interior.  Another 318ci equipped car was built with the 4-speed [[Hurst]] ''pistol-grip'' transmission. It was Pewter Gray with black stripes, black bench-seat interior, and black rubber floor covering instead of carpeting. It is unknown what happened to these cars, but they would likely be very valuable today, even with compromised originality.

=== 1975 ===

The 1975 model was based on the newly restyled, more formal-looking B-body which was now called the [[Plymouth Fury|Fury]] (the former full-sized Fury being called "[[Plymouth Gran Fury|Gran Fury]]").  The Road Runner came with a blacked out grille and a special stripe treatment to distinguish it from the Fury.  As before the 318 was the standard engine, but it was now just with a single exhaust.  The 360 ({{convert|220|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}) and the 400 (though still with a four barrel and dual exhausts, the power was down to 230 hp {172kW}) were also available. In ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine testing of a 1975 car with the 400 engine; 0-60 happened in 8.1 seconds and quarter-mile times were solidly in the 16-second range.  While just a shadow of the 1970 figures, this performance was at least respectable for the times.  Plymouth's most powerful engine; the 440, was restricted to police models, though it has been rumored that a few 1975 Road Runners were built (via special factory order) with the {{convert|240|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}  police spec 440, along with the police spec suspension and wider (7") rims.  Only 7,183 Road Runners were built in 1975, and most (just over 50%) had just the 318 engine.

Though the name of the car the Road Runner was based on changed from Belvedere to Satellite to Fury, the Road Runner remained a B-body through 1975.  While the Road Runner name was planned to be on a B-body in Plymouth's published literature for the 1976 model year, the name was transferred to an optional appearance package for the all-new [[Plymouth Volare|Volare]].

==1976–1980: F-body Trim Package==

In 1976 the Road Runner name was switched to the 2-door model of the replacement for the [[compact car|compact]] [[Chrysler A platform|A-body]] [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant]]/[[Plymouth Duster|Duster]] series. This car, based on the new [[Chrysler F platform|F platform]], would be known as "Volaré". The new Road Runner was little more than a trim and graphics package; however, many suspension parts were borrowed from the police packages. A 360&nbsp;CID engine was offered as an option (but only with a two barrel carb for 1976-'77 and single exhaust) to the standard 318&nbsp;V8, but only paired with the 3-speed automatic transmission. Rated at {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, the F platform's best 1/4&nbsp;mile times would be just inside 16-seconds at {{convert|88|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.  Although no comparison to the earlier stormers, the 360 powered models were respectable performers in their time.  By 1978 and thru to 1980 the 360 was offered with a four-barrel carb and, for 1980, dual exhaust, bringing power up to {{convert|195|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.  However, performance continued to suffer, and by 1979 the 225&nbsp;CID "[[Chrysler Slant 6 engine|Slant 6]]" [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] became standard.  The Road Runner continued as part of the Volaré line until its discontinuation in 1980.

==Concepts==

The now-defunct Mopar Enthusiast magazine released a concept rendering of a potential 2010 Road Runner, with design cues based on the 1971-72 model.<ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp; Drew Phillips RSS feed |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/07/13/rendered-speculation-2010-plymouth-road-runner-concept/ |title=Rendered Speculation: 2010 Plymouth Road Runner Concept |publisher=Autoblog.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>

'''Doris Angleton''' (April 11, 1951 – April 16, 1997) was a [[Texas]] [[socialite]] and murder victim. Doris Angleton's husband, Robert Angleton, had been accused of planning the crime. Roger Nicholas Angleton, Robert Angleton's brother, admitted to directly killing her, before killing himself.

==Early years==
Doris McGown was the first child born to Randy McGown, a [[Dow Chemical]] engineer, and his wife, Ann. She grew up in [[Lake Jackson, Texas]], and had one sibling, a younger brother, Steven McGown. She graduated from the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] with a degree in [[speech pathology]].  After graduation, she began a career as a schoolteacher, and later became a sales representative for a pharmaceutical firm.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Carlton |title=Death in Texas|publisher=Macmillan|year=1999|pages=56–57|isbn=0-312-97075-7}}</ref>

==Marriages==
In 1976, McGown met William "Bill" Beck, a representative for an office products company. They married and moved to [[Clear Lake City, Houston|Clear Lake City]].

She met Robert Angleton, a successful [[bookmaker]], at a bar in the Houston [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|West Loop]] when she was 28 years old. According to Robert Angleton, he and Doris met because William Beck, Doris's husband, was a client of his bookmaking business. Both Robert Angleton and Doris Beck, although already married, were attracted to each other, eventually divorcing their spouses. They married in 1982.<ref name="DeathInTexas">Smith, Carlton. ''Death in Texas''</ref> On August 1, 1984, Doris Angleton gave birth to twins, Nicole and Alessandra.

Robert Angleton earned an estimated $2 million a year by running a sports-betting scheme. He managed to do this by becoming a police informant and reporting his rivals to the [[Houston Police Department]].<ref name=cbsnews>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/22/48hours/mysteries/main589859.shtml|title=The Bookie's Wife|date=2002-06-10|publisher=cbsnews.com|accessdate=2009-05-16}}</ref> He moved his family to the wealthy [[River Oaks, Houston, Texas|River Oaks area]] of [[Houston, Texas]].

Although her friends believed that she was happy,<ref name="DeathInTexas"/> Doris Angleton said she wanted out of her marriage when she grew tired of bookmaking. In February 1997, she went ahead with the [[divorce]] process, wanting 50% of their joint assets.

==Murder==
On April 16, 1997, Robert Angleton expressed concern when Doris failed to show up for their twin daughters' softball game. After the game, Angleton drove the girls home and finding the door ajar, called police.  An officer discovered Doris's body. She sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the face and chest.<ref name=cbsnews/>

Around the time of her murder, Doris' brother in-law, Roger Angleton, had been arrested in California on unrelated charges. He missed his court date in that case (which was April 16, 1997).  He was stopped at the DFW Airport 5 days later with 2 guns in his luggage, but fled before being arrested.  Police searched the abandoned suitcase that revealed him to be her killer.  Roger was found by police in the Las Vegas city jail, having been arrested for providing a false identification to police. He died after cutting himself in a Houston prison cell<ref name="DeathInTexas"/><ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/01/10/48hours/main323937.shtml "The Bookie's Wife"; [[CBS News]]; June 10, 2002]</ref> more than fifty times with a disposable razor. Roger Angleton also left behind a suicide note that cleared his brother of the murder of Doris.<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopelprint082701.html Kopel, Dave Kopel "Redefining Justice" ''[[National Review]]''; August 27, 2001]</ref> Robert Angleton was later found not guilty in his wife's death.

Due to the investigation, Robert Angleton's income was investigated. As they were earned in relation to an illegal sports betting scheme, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] indicted and jailed Robert Angleton. While awaiting trial, Robert fled to the [[Netherlands]], where he was apprehended by the Dutch government. A Dutch court ruled that he could not be extradited on a charge related to the murder of his wife because he had already been found not guilty. However, they ruled, he could be extradited on the tax evasion charges.<ref>[http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=local&id=3155720 abc13.com: Houston News, Weather, Traffic, and Sports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He was subsequently convicted of tax evasion and passport fraud, and was sentenced to twelve years in prison. He was incarcerated in the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island]] in [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]], [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. He was released on January 27, 2012.<ref>"[http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&needingMoreList=false&FirstName=Robert&Middle=&LastName=Angleton&Race=U&Sex=U&Age=&x=64&y=11 Robert Nicholas Angleton]."

'''Liquid nitrogen''' is [[nitrogen]] in a liquid state at an extremely low temperature. It is produced industrially by [[fractional distillation]] of [[liquid air]]. Liquid nitrogen is a colorless clear liquid with density of 0.807 g/ml at its [[boiling point]] and a [[Relative permittivity|dielectric constant]] of 1.43.<ref>{{cite web|title = The Dielectric Properties of Insulating Materials|url = http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol16-1937/articles/bstj16-4-493.pdf| first= E. J. | last = Murphy | first2 = S. O. | last2 = Morgan | accessdate = October 2, 2012}}</ref> Liquid nitrogen is often referred to by the abbreviation, '''LN<sub>2</sub>''' or "LIN"  or "LN" and has the [[UN number]] 1977. Liquid nitrogen is a diatomic liquid meaning the diatomic character of the covalent N bonding in N<sub>2</sub> gas is retained even after [[liquefaction]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=D. G. Henshaw, D. G. Hurst, and N. K. Pope |year=1953|title= Structure of Liquid Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Argon by Neutron Diffraction|journal= Physical Review|volume=92|pages= 1229|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.92.1229}}</ref>

At [[atmospheric pressure]], liquid nitrogen boils at {{Convert|-196|C|K F|0|link=on}} and is a [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] fluid that can cause rapid [[freezing]] on contact with living tissue. When appropriately [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] from ambient [[heat]], liquid nitrogen can be stored and transported, for example in [[vacuum flasks]]. Here, the very low temperature is held constant at 77&nbsp;K by slow boiling of the liquid, resulting in the evolution of nitrogen gas. Depending on the size and design, the holding time of vacuum flasks  ([[Cryogenic storage dewar|Dewars]]) ranges from a few hours to a few weeks. The development of pressurised super-insulated vacuum vessels have enabled liquefied nitrogen to be stored and transported over longer time periods with losses reduced to 2% per day or less.<ref>http://www.aspenycap.org/files/CryogenicGases.pdf</ref>

Liquid nitrogen can easily be converted to a solid by placing it in a vacuum chamber pumped by a rotary vacuum pump.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Umrath, W. |year=1974|title= Cooling bath for rapid freezing in electron microscopy|journal= Journal of Microscopy |volume=101|pages= 103–105|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.1974.tb03871.x}}</ref> Liquid nitrogen freezes at {{convert|63|K|C F|0}}. Despite its reputation, liquid nitrogen's efficiency as a coolant is limited by the fact that it boils immediately on contact with a warmer object, enveloping the object in insulating nitrogen gas. This effect, known as the [[Leidenfrost effect]], applies to any liquid in contact with an object significantly hotter than its boiling point. More rapid cooling may be obtained by plunging an object into a slush of liquid and solid nitrogen rather than liquid nitrogen alone.

Nitrogen was first liquefied at the [[Jagiellonian University]] on 15 April 1883 by Polish physicists, [[Zygmunt Wróblewski]] and [[Karol Olszewski]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8SKrWdFLEd4C&pg=PA249|page=249|title=A Short History of the Progress of Scientific Chemistry in Our Own Times|author=Tilden, William Augustus |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC|year=2009|isbn=1-103-35842-1}}</ref>

==Uses==
Liquid nitrogen  is a compact and readily transported source of nitrogen gas without pressurization. Further, its ability to maintain temperatures far below the [[freezing point]] of water makes it extremely useful in a wide range of applications, primarily as an open-cycle [[refrigerant]], including:
*in [[cryotherapy]] for removing unsightly or potentially [[skin cancer|malignant]] skin lesions such as [[wart]]s and [[actinic keratosis]]
*to store cells at low temperature for laboratory work
*in [[cryogenics]]
*in a [[Cryophorus]] to demonstrate rapid [[freezing]] by [[evaporation]] 
*as a backup nitrogen source in [[hypoxic air fire prevention system]]s
*as a source of very dry [[nitrogen]] gas

*for the [[cryopreservation]] of [[blood]], reproductive cells ([[sperm]] and [[Ovum|egg]]), and other [[biology|biological]] samples and materials
**to preserve tissue samples from surgical excisions for future studies
*as a method of freezing water and oil pipes in order to work on them in situations where a valve is not available to block fluid flow to the work area, method known as "ice plug" – nowadays replaced by electrical heat pumps (for small pipe diameters)
*in the process of [[promession]], a way to dispose of the dead
*for [[cryonics|cryonic preservation]] in hopes of future reanimation.
*to shrink-weld machinery parts together
*as a coolant

==Safety==
[[File:Liquid Nitrogen Tank.JPG|thumb|Filling a liquid nitrogen [[Dewar flask|Dewar]] from a storage tank]]
Because the liquid-to-gas [[expansion ratio]] of nitrogen is 1:694 at {{Convert|20|C|F|0}}, a tremendous amount of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporized. In an incident in 2006 at [[Texas A&M University]], the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed. As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it, shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it, and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1 -0.2m off their foundations.<ref>{{cite web|title = Investigative Report on Chemistry 301A Cylinder Explosion|author = Mattox, Brent S.|publisher = Texas A&M University|format = reprint|url = http://ucih.ucdavis.edu/docs/chemistry_301a.pdf}}</ref>

Because of its extremely low temperature, careless handling of liquid nitrogen may result in [[cold burn]]s.

As liquid nitrogen evaporates it reduces the [[oxygen]] concentration in the [[air]] and can act as an [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiant]], especially in [[confined space]]s. Nitrogen is odorless, colorless, and tasteless and may produce [[asphyxia]] without any sensation or prior warning.<ref name=BCGACOPCP30>British Compressed Gases Association (2000) BCGA Code of Practice CP30. [http://www.bcga.co.uk/preview/products.php?g1=3ff921&n=2 The Safe Use of Liquid nitrogen Dewars up to 50 litres.] ISSN 0260-4809.</ref>
A laboratory assistant died in Scotland in 1999, apparently from asphyxiation caused by liquid nitrogen spilled in a basement storage room.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/484813.stm Inquiry after man dies in chemical leak], BBC News, {{#dateformat:October 25, 1999}}.</ref>

[[Oxygen sensor]]s are sometimes used as a safety precaution when working with liquid nitrogen to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space.<ref name="usn">{{Cite book|title=Liquid Nitrogen – Code of practice for handling|year=2007 |publisher=Birkbeck, University of London |location=United Kingdom |url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/so/policies/liqn2 |accessdate=2012-02-08}}</ref>

Vessels containing liquid nitrogen can [[liquid oxygen|condense oxygen]] from air. The liquid in such a vessel becomes increasingly enriched in oxygen (boiling point {{Convert|90|K|C F|sigfig=3|disp=x|; }}) as the nitrogen evaporates, and can cause violent oxidation of organic material.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Liquid Nitrogen Safety|author = Levey, Christopher G.|publisher = Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth|url = http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/microeng/ln2.html}}</ref>

==Production==
{{main|Air separation}}
Liquid nitrogen is produced commercially from the [[cryogenic]] [[distillation]] of [[liquid air|liquified air]] or from the liquefication of pure nitrogen derived from air using [[pressure swing adsorption]]. An [[air compressor]] is used to compress filtered air to high pressure; the high-pressure gas is cooled back to ambient temperature, and allowed to expand to a low pressure. The expanding air cools greatly (the [[Joule–Thomson effect]]), and oxygen, nitrogen, and argon are separated by further stages of expansion and distillation.  Small-scale production of liquid nitrogen is easily achieved using this principle. Liquid nitrogen may be produced for direct sale, or as a byproduct of manufacture of liquid oxygen used for industrial processes such as [[steelmaking]]. Liquid-air plants producing on the order of tons per day of product started to be built in the 1930s but became very common after the Second World War; a large modern plant may produce 3000 tons/day of liquid air products.<ref>Almqvist, Ebbe (2003) ''History of Industrial Gases'', Springer, ISBN 0306472775 p. 163</ref>

'''Katherine Young''' (??; [[Pinyin]]: '''Zhèng Xún''') (May 10, 1901 – October 24, 2005) was an American [[centenarian]] who, at the age of 102 in 2003, gained publicity when she was described as the oldest known living user of the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-101318963.html |title=California Woman Still Web-Surfing at 102. |publisher=Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News |date=2003-05-07 |accessdate=2010-07-03}}</ref>

Born in a small [[Hakka people|Hakka]] village in the [[Fujian]] province during the final years of [[Late Imperial China]], she attended [[Yenching University]] in the capital, then referenced as [[Peking]].  Raising four daughters with her husband, Paul T. J. Young, she lived through the tumultuous 1920s, along with the death and destruction of the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Sino-Japanese War]] and World War II during the 1930s and 1940s.  At war's end, with [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Communist armies]] poised to take over, the family escaped to Hong Kong, then [[Taiwan]], and, in 1958, when Katherine Young was 57 years old, immigrated to the United States, settling in the California [[charter city]] of [[Palo Alto]], along the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

In 1998, aged 97, and having served as president of the Rose Club in Palo Alto's Lytton Gardens Senior Communities, she decided to try something new and signed up for the retirement community's 12-week computer class which aimed to teach seniors how to use [[WebTV]].  By the conclusion of these sessions, she was logging on and became an activist for the cause of encouraging elders to use the Internet. A [[Pew Research Center|Pew Internet and American Life Project]] study showed that only 18% of Americans 65 and older get online, as opposed to 58% of the American population as a whole.

Five years later, on her 102nd birthday, she became a celebrity for being the oldest person to surf the Internet. She was feted with numerous birthday emails and an emailed [[obstetric ultrasonography|sonogram]] of her great-grandson, who was born in August 2003.  She studied Chinese [[genealogy]] on [[Google]] and, having been Rose Club president for 16 years, researched roses. She used email to communicate with her ten grandchildren and told reporters she checks for new messages as many as six times a day.  From her apartment, she accessed the Internet via MSN TV (formerly WebTV) Internet service provider. Microsoft recognized her achievement and gave her a golden lifetime subscription.

Katherine Young died in Palo Alto almost six months past her 104th birthday.  It has been noted that although she was considered the oldest known living user of the Internet, [[Audrey Stubbart]] who, until very shortly before her death five years earlier, in 2000, at age 105, was a columnist, copyeditor and proofreader for the [[Missouri]] newspaper ''[[Independence Examiner]]'', used the then-early Internet at a slightly more-advanced age.

The following examples of questions that might be considered in each field illustrate the differences between the fields:
:Descriptive ethics: What do people think is right?
:Meta-ethics: What does "right" even mean?
:Normative (prescriptive) ethics: How should people act?
:Applied ethics: How do we take moral knowledge and put it into practice?

==What is descriptive ethics?==
Descriptive ethics is a form of [[empirical]] research into the attitudes of individuals or groups of people. Those working on descriptive ethics aim to uncover people's beliefs about such things as values, which actions are right and wrong, and which characteristics of moral agents are virtuous. Research into descriptive ethics may also investigate people's [[ideal (ethics)|ethical ideal]]s or what actions societies reward or punish in [[law]] or [[politics]]. What ought to be noted is that culture is generational and not static. Therefore a new generation will come with its own set of morals and that qualifies to be their ethics. Descriptive ethics will hence try to oversee whether ethics still holds its place.

Because descriptive ethics involves empirical investigation, it is a field that is usually investigated by those working in the fields of [[evolutionary biology]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]] or [[anthropology]]. Information that comes from descriptive ethics is, however, also used in philosophical arguments.

[[Value theory]] can be either normative or descriptive but is usually descriptive.

==Lawrence Kohlberg: An example of descriptive ethics==
[[Lawrence Kohlberg]] is one example of a psychologist working on descriptive ethics. In one study, for example, Kohlberg questioned a group of boys about what would be a right or wrong action for a man facing a moral dilemma: should he steal a drug to save his wife, or refrain from theft even though that would lead to his wife's death?<ref>Kohlberg, Lawrence, (1971). "Stages in Moral Development as a Basis for Moral Education." In C.M. Beck, B.S. Crittenden, and E.V. Sullivan, Eds. ''Moral Education: Interdisciplinary Approaches''. Toronto: Toronto University Press.</ref>
Kohlberg's concern was not which choice the boys made, but the moral reasoning that lay behind their decisions. After carrying out a number of related studies, Kohlberg devised a theory about the development of human moral reasoning that was intended to reflect the moral reasoning actually carried out by the participants in his research. Kohlberg's research can be classed as descriptive ethics to the extent that he describes human beings' actual moral development. If, in contrast, he had aimed to describe how humans ought to develop morally, his theory would have involved prescriptive ethics.

==Descriptive ethics and relativism==
Descriptive ethics does not explicitly discern between good and bad ethical theories. This can be interpreted in two ways. 

* Descriptive ethics claims, implicitly or explicitly, that [[amorality]] (not to be confused with [[immorality]]) is moral. Descriptive ethics thus embraces [[moral relativism]]. '''Or,'''
* Descriptive ethics makes no claim that amorality is moral. Its innate amorality is solely due to a practical [[division of labour]] between descriptive ethics and [[normative ethics]].

The first position holds descriptive ethics to be in [[competition]] with normative ethics, whereas the second holds it as [[yin and yang|complementary]] to normative ethics.

==Early life and education==
Robert Crittenden was born near [[Versailles, Kentucky]], in the [[Bluegrass Region]], into a political family. He was the son of [[John Crittenden, Sr.|John Crittenden]], a [[plantation|planter]] who was a Major in the [[United States Army|Continental Army]] and a member of the [[Virginia]] [[House of Burgesses]]. His brother [[John Jordan Crittenden]] later served as [[United States Senate|United States Senator]]. His great-nephew [[Thomas T. Crittenden, Jr.]] became Mayor of [[Kansas City, Missouri]].

==Political career==
Crittenden was appointed as Secretary of Arkansas Territory from 1819 to 1829. He served as Governor of Arkansas while [[James Miller (general)|James Miller]] was delayed for an extended period en route to Arkansas. 

Although never officially appointed as governor, Crittenden called the first territorial legislature into session and took responsibility for organizing the new territory. He amassed considerable political power. Crittenden was a primary leader in preparing the territory for statehood.

He was appointed as United States Commissioner for negotiating the 1824 Treaty with the [[Quapaw]] Indians.

By 1827 Crittenden and his former friend, [[Henry Wharton Conway]], a Territorial Representative, had come into conflict on political issues and finally had a duel. He mortally wounded Conway near [[Napoleon, Arkansas]] on October 29, 1827, who died several days later.

==List of neighborhoods by historical town==

The original Dutch settlement of what is now Brooklyn consisted of six towns with clearly defined borders. These later became English settlements, and were consolidated over time until the entirety of Kings County was the unified City of Brooklyn.  The towns were, clockwise from the north: Bushwick, Brooklyn, Flatlands, Gravesend, New Utrecht, with Flatbush in the middle. The modern neighborhoods bearing these names are located roughly in the center of each of these original towns.  Certain portions of the original six towns were also independent municipalities for a time, before being reabsorbed.

Following an 1894 referendum, the entire consolidated City of Brooklyn became a borough of [[New York City]] in 1898.

'''Yenching University''' ({{zh|s=????|t=????|p=Y?nj?ng Dàxué}}), also known as '''Peking University''',<ref>[http://english.pku.edu.cn/News_Events/News/Campus/10219.htm &#91;Anniversary 2013&#93; Yenching University 1921: A "Peking" perspective]</ref> was a [[university]] in [[Beijing]], China. It integrated three Christian colleges in the city in 1919. Yenching is an alternative name of old Beijing derived from its status as capital of [[Yan (state)|Yan state]], one of the seven [[Warring States]] that existed until the 3rd century BC.

==History==
The university was originally founded under the name Huiwen University. In its early years, it was in a chaotic situation, due to its financing by several churches:
<!--Translation from zh-wiki. English official name needed.-->
* Huiwen University (????) was founded by the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] (????) in 1889. Its precursor was (??????) founded in 1870. [[Hiram Harrison Lowry]] was its principal.
*North China Harmony Women's University (????????). Its precursor (????) was founded in 1864.
*Tongzhou Harmony University (??????). Its precursor (???????) was founded by the [[Congregational Church]]. Devello Z. Sheffield was the school's principal.

[[John Leighton Stuart]] was appointed as the principal of the university in January 1919 when he taught [[Greek language|Greek]] in Nanking Theological Seminary (?????), a [[seminary]] in [[Nanjing]]. Being short of capital at the beginning, he turned to fundraising worldwide and received support from the estate of [[Charles Martin Hall]], an American executive of Alcoa Aluminum. He bought the royal gardens of a [[Qing Dynasty]] prince to build a scenic campus and employed gardeners from the Imperial gardens. In 1926 the campus was completed. Theology, Law and Medical were the main schools in the university, with Arts and Science studies.

Stuart attracted major Chinese and Western scholars to teach. Religion was not a qualification, although Stuart gave major support to the School of Theology. In 1928 the [[Harvard-Yenching Institute]], was jointly founded by Yenching University and [[Harvard University]] for the teaching of the humanities and social sciences in [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. This independent institute continues to exist on the Harvard campus in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Also in 1928, American journalist and educator [[Walter Williams (journalist)|Walter Williams]] established a department of journalism.<ref>[http://journalism.missouri.edu/2008/walter-williams.html "Walter Williams" 2008 Missouri School of Journalism Centennial and Dedication], retrieved March 25, 2011.</ref> By 1930, the school was among the top universities in China, its teaching distinguished itself by a considerable academic freedom.

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Peiping was occupied by Japan and the university was moved to [[Chengdu]] in [[Sichuan]]. After the [[People's Republic of China]] was established in 1949, Yenching University with its Christian background was closed. In 1952 its some arts and science teachers were shifted into [[Peking University]] and other institutions, its [[engineering]] section was merged with [[Tsinghua University]], and Peking University obtained the Yenching campus. In 1952 Peking University moved from central downtown Beijing to the previous Yenching campus in the city's [[Haidian District]].

Among the scholars who taught at Yenching University were [[Bing Xin]] (Xie Wanying), writer; [[John Stuart Burgess]] (sociologist); [[Kenneth K.S. Chen]] (historian of Buddhism); [[Zhang Dongsun]] (Philosopher); [[K. C. Hsiao]] (political scientist); [[Lu Zhiwei]] (theologian); [[Wu Wenzao]](sociologist); [[Qian Mu]] (historian); [[Wu Leichuan]] (theology); [[Hu Shih]] (scholar); [[Zhao Zichen]] (theology); [[Edgar Snow]] (journalism); [[Louis Rhys Oxley Bevan]] (Law).

Prominent alumni include: [[Fei Xiaotong]] (anthropologist); [[Han Suyin]] (author); [[Huang Hua (politician)|Huang Hua]] (diplomat); [[Teng Ssu-yu]] (historian).

The first edition appeared on April 14, 1883, bearing the subtitle, “An Independent Family Paper to Promote Health and Morals.”  Instructive articles and verified reports of Christian healing give the reader a working understanding of the Principle and practice of Christian Science.  Each issue also contains questions and answers about Christian Science, book reviews, artwork, interviews, poems, and a worldwide directory of Christian Science practitioners, teachers, churches, Reading Rooms, organizations at universities and colleges, nurses and Committees on Publication.  Eddy described the publication in its early years as "...designed to bear aloft the standard of genuine Christian Science".

'''George Izard''' (October 21, 1776 – November 22, 1828) was a General in the [[United States Army]] during the [[War of 1812]] and the second [[List of Governors of Arkansas|Governor]] of [[Arkansas Territory]].

==Biography==
Izard was born in [[Paris]] as the son of [[Ralph Izard]] who was a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] and [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[South Carolina]], and Alice DeLancey, niece of [[New York Governor]] [[James DeLancey]]. He graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania|College of Philadelphia]] (now the [[University of Pennsylvania]]) in 1792. He attended military academies in England and Germany and received military engineering instruction in France.

==Military career==
Izard returned to the United States in November 1797, and received a commission as [[Lieutenant]] in the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]]. He was ordered by Secretary of War [[James McHenry]] to oversee the construction of [[Castle Pinckney]] in [[South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://governor.arkansas.gov/newsroom/index.php?do:newsDetail=1&news_id=3132|title=Governor George Izard Day|publisher=State of Arkansas|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref>

In January 1800, Izard became [[aide-de-camp]] to Army commander [[Alexander Hamilton]]. A few months later he was invited by [[William Loughton Smith]], [[United States Ambassador to Portugal|Minister Plenipotentiary to Portugal]], to serve as his secretary, a position he accepted. He left Portugal the next year and returned to the United States. He officially resigned his army commission in June 1803.

In March 1812, Izard was appointed as [[Colonel]] of the newly organised [[2nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment (United States)|2nd Artillery Regiment]]. He was promoted to [[Brigadier General]] a year later, and served as [[Wade Hampton I|Wade Hampton]]'s second in command until his resignation, when Izard succeeded him. Promoted to [[Major General]] in January 1814, he was in charge of the Northern Army protecting [[Lake Champlain]], until ordered to reinforce the Army of Niagara. He was discharged in June 1815.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historicalregist01heitrich#page/566/mode/2up Historical Register and Dictionary of the US Army]</ref>

==Political career==
Izard was appointed Governor of Arkansas Territory in March 1825, and served until his death in 1828.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://governor.arkansas.gov/newsroom/index.php?do:newsDetail=1&news_id=3132|title=Governor George Izard Day|publisher= State of Arkansas |accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref>

==Death==
Izard died of complications of [[gout]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]. Izard was originally buried near the Peabody School in Little Rock. After the historic [[Mount Holly Cemetery]] was established, Izard's remains were moved to the Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock in 1843.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=10399|title=George Izard|publisher=Find A Grave |accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=3662|title=George Izard (1776–1828)|publisher= The Central Arkansas Library System|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref>

'''''Ed, Edd n Eddy''''' is a Canadian-American [[Cartoon series|animated]] [[Television comedy|comedy]] television series created by [[Danny Antonucci]] and produced by Canada-based [[Danny Antonucci#International Rocketship and MTV work|a.k.a. Cartoon]]. It premiered on [[Cartoon Network]] on January 4, 1999. The series was designed to resemble classic cartoons from the 1940s to the 1970s, and revolves around three adolescent boys, Ed (voiced by [[Matt Hill]]), Edd "Double Dee" (voiced by [[Samuel Vincent]]), and Eddy (voiced by [[Tony Sampson]]), collectively known as "the Eds", who live in a suburban [[cul-de-sac]]. Under the unofficial leadership of Eddy, the trio constantly invent schemes to make money from their peers to purchase their favorite confectionery, [[Gobstopper|jawbreakers]]. Their plans usually fail though, leaving them in various, often humiliating, predicaments.

Adult [[cartoonist]] Antonucci was dared to create a children's cartoon; while designing a commercial, he conceived ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'', and approached Cartoon Network and [[Nickelodeon]] with the series, but both channels demanded creative control, to which Antonucci did not agree. A deal was ultimately made for Cartoon Network to commission ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'', after they agreed to let Antonucci have control of the show. During the show's run, several specials and shorts were produced in addition to the regular television series. Two books, as well as several comic books and video games, either based on the series or featuring the series' characters have also been produced. The series' TV movie finale, ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show]]'' aired on November 8, 2009, officially ending the series.

''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' received generally positive reviews from critics and became one of Cartoon Network's most successful original series. It won a [[National Cartoonists Society#Reuben Award|Reuben Award]], two [[Leo Awards]] and a [[Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada|SOCAN Award]], and was also nominated for another four Leo Awards, an [[Annie Award]] and two [[Kids' Choice Awards]]. The show attracted an audience of 31 million households, was broadcast in 120 countries, and proved to be popular among not only children, but teenagers and even adults as well. With a 10-year run, ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' remains the longest-running [[Cartoon Network original series and movies|original Cartoon Network series]] and Canadian-made animated series to date, and is also one of the [[List of longest-running United States television series|longest-running United States animated series]].

==Series overview==
{{see also|List of Ed, Edd n Eddy episodes}}
''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' follows the lives of three adolescent boys who all share variations of the name Ed, but differ greatly in their personalities. In the pursuit of buying jawbreakers, dimwitted Ed and intellectual Double Dee aid the self-appointed leader, Eddy, in his plans to scam the other cul-de-sac children out of their money; however problems always ensue. The other children mostly dislike or show indifference toward the Eds, though they all share a common fear of the Kanker Sisters, a group of teenage girls who live in a nearby trailer park. The series takes place mostly within the fictional town of Peach Creek, and new locations were rarely introduced. The first four seasons of the show are set during a perpetual summer vacation, though from the fifth season onwards, the characters were shown going to school in fall and winter.

===Characters===
{{see also|List of Ed, Edd n Eddy characters}}
Ed is the strong, dimwitted workhorse of the group. Edd, better known as Double Dee, is an inventor, neat freak, and the most intelligent of the Eds. Eddy is a greedy, ill-tempered con artist, loudmouth, and self-appointed leader of the Eds. Jonny 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;4 is a loner whom his peers consider to be a nuisance; he spends most of his time with his imaginary friend, a wooden board named Plank. Jimmy is a weak, effeminate, and insecure child, who is most often seen spending his time with Sarah, Ed's bossy, spoiled, and short-tempered younger sister. Rolf is an immigrant, who often participates in odd customs and eats strange food. Kevin is a stereotypical, cynical, and sarcastic jock who hates the Eds (especially Eddy) and can be cruel at times. Nazz, usually seen with Kevin, is a stereotypical and unattainable love interest. May, Marie, and Lee Kanker, better known as the "Kanker Sisters", are the main antagonists of the series and are in love with the three Eds.

Aside from the Eds, the other characters in the cul-de-sac, and the Kanker Sisters, no other characters appeared in the series until the fifth season, when the silhouettes of other people were occasionally shown, and in one episode the arms of Eddy's father and Ed's mother were seen. In the series finale, ''Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show'', Eddy's adult brother was seen for the first time, making him the only non-main character, and the only adult character to ever fully appear on the show.

==History==

===Production===
Although [[cartoonist]] [[Danny Antonucci]] began his career by working as an animator on various children's series for [[Hanna-Barbera]], his later solo works were edgy and aimed at adult audiences. He gained notoriety with the 1987 short film ''[[Lupo the Butcher]]'' and then, after founding his own production studio, [[a.k.a. Cartoon]] in 1994, created the series ''[[The Brothers Grunt]]'' for [[MTV]]. It was quickly cancelled however, upon being met with poor reviews.<ref name="Season1DVD">{{cite video|people=[[Danny Antonucci]]|date=October 10, 2006|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete First Season—''Interview with the Creator''|time=0:22–2:34|type=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=North of Everything|first1=William|last1=Beard|first2=Jerry|last2=White|date=June 1, 2002|publisher=[[University of Alberta Press]]|isbn=978-0-88864-390-2|page=63}}</ref> On a dare, Antonucci then decided that he would try producing a children's animated series of his own. While designing a commercial, he ended up drawing three characters that he felt particularly pleased with. Growing excited over their potential, he named them Ed, Edd, and Eddy, and spent the following months developing a show around them.<ref name="Season2DVD">{{cite video|people=[[Danny Antonucci]]|date=April 24, 2007|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete Second Season—''Behind the Eds''|type=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]}}</ref> He faxed a one-page [[Model sheet|concept sheet]] to [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Nickelodeon]] in 1996.<ref name="Season2DVD" /><ref name="TakeOne">{{cite journal|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ed,+Edd+'n'+Eddy%3A+three+guys,+one+'toon.-a030234569|journal=[[Take One (Canadian magazine)|Take One]]|title=Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy: Three Guys, One 'Toon|date=June 22, 1999|first=Linda|last=Simensky}}</ref> Both studios quickly responded, Cartoon Network in only 20 minutes, and were enthusiastic and wanted to see more; however they each demanded creative control and Antonucci refused.<ref name="Season1DVD" /> After Cartoon Network agreed to let Antonucci have control of the show, conversations between Antonucci and the studio continued.<ref name="Season1DVD" />

Vice president of programming and production of Cartoon Network, [[Mike Lazzo]], showed high interest in the series and requested a [[bible (writing)|show bible]], which came through by fax, a few pages at a time, over a period of the next few months.<ref name="TakeOne"/> After an affirmative response from Cartoon Network president Betty Cohen, the legal paperwork and deal-making began, followed by a start-up meeting at the [[Chateau Marmont Hotel]] in [[Los Angeles]]. A deal was made that Antonucci's studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'', the first Cartoon Network original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Cartoon Network's [[Hanna-Barbera]]. The series also entered production and by-passed a seven-minute short; this marked the first time that one of the studio's original series had ever done this.<ref name=TakeOne/>
[[File:Danny Antonucci.png|thumb|left|upright|Danny Antonucci, creator, director and co-writer of ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'', produced the series on a dare.|alt=Cool-looking animator, Danny Antonucci]]
Antonucci, an advocate of hand-drawn animation, wanted to ensure ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' was produced in a way similar to the cartoons from the 1940s to the 1970s. As a result, the series was the last to use [[Traditional animation#Cels|cel animation]]; the cels were shipped to Korea for creating the initial animation, and then later edited back at Antonucci's a.k.a. Cartoon studio.<ref name="Season1DVD" /> To give the impression of movement, ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' used "boiling lines", shimmering character outlines which have been compared to [[Squigglevision]].<ref name="IGN-Scam" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/04/09/ed-edd-n-eddy-jawbreakers|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: Jawbreakers|first=Craig|last=Harris|work=|publisher=News Corporation|date=April 3, 2003|accessdate=January 17, 2012}}</ref> The boiling lines are not as noticeable as those in ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]'', but are still visible,<ref name="AnimationWorldMagazine2" /> and Antonucci likens it to cartoons of the 1930s.<ref name="Season1DVD" /> The boiling line is created by tracing off a drawing three times through sheets of paper.<ref name="Season2DVD" /> Antonucci explained that he felt it "helps keep the characters alive" and that he wanted to depart from other Cartoon Network series and pay homage to the classic cartoon era.<ref name="Season1DVD" /><ref name="Season2DVD" /> 

According to Antonucci, he based the characters on real people in his life. The personalities of Ed, Double Dee, and Eddy are based on his own traits, and the activities of his two sons while the cul-de-sac children and the Kanker sisters were all based on children he grew up with.<ref name="Season1DVD-1">{{cite video|people =[[Danny Antonucci]]|date=October 10, 2006|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete First Season—''Interview with the Creator''|time=2:15–4:39|type=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]}}</ref> Rolf is based on Antonucci and his cousins, since he was part of an immigrant family, and grew up in a first generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living, compared to those born in Canada.<ref name="Season1DVD-1" /><ref name=BestDayEdder>{{cite episode|title=The Best Day Edder|series=Ed, Edd n Eddy|network=Cartoon Network|date=April 27–28, 2007}}</ref> Jimmy is based on one of his cousins, who was rather feminine and spent most of his time playing with girls rather than with boys.<ref name="Season2DVD" /> Jonny and Plank are inspired by one of Antonucci's childhood friends, a loner who spent most of his time outside with his blanket.<ref name="Season2DVD" /> He stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, and that he "thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own" and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do.<ref name="Season1DVD-1" /> Some wanted Plank to be able to talk, smile and blink as if he was alive, but Antonucci insisted that it should be treated as a piece of wood, brought to life by Jonny's imagination.<ref name="Season2DVD" />

All the children have multicolored tongues; Antonucci said that the idea came after he saw his son and his friends with different-colored tongues because of eating different candy while he was working on a storyboard.<ref name="Season2DVD" /> The characters went through a number of "walking cycles", a process used to determine how each character should walk or run, turn around, blink, etc. before the crew came up with the final product.<ref name="Season2DVD" />

===Casting===
[[Matt Hill]], [[Samuel Vincent]], and [[Tony Sampson]] were respectively cast as Ed, Double Dee, and Eddy. [[David Paul Grove]] and [[Keenan Christenson]] played the parts of Jonny 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;4 and Jimmy, respectively, while Sarah was voiced by [[Janyse Jaud]]. [[Peter Kelamis]] voiced Rolf, while [[Kathleen Barr]] was cast as Kevin. Nazz was voiced by [[Tabitha St. Germain]] in season 1, [[Jenn Forgie]] in season 3 and [[Erin Fitzgerald]] in seasons 2, 4, 5 and 6.

''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' received generally positive reviews from critics.

Due to an increasing demand for Christian Science Literature from other countries, the ''Herald'' grew to include twelve different languages.  Until the 90’s the magazine was [[bilingual]], with [[English language|English]] and translated texts side by side.  Currently the ''Herald'' is available in fourteen languages, giving readers around the world an understanding of Christian Science practice.  Along with articles and accounts of [[Faith healing|healing]], each issue includes a directory of Christian Science churches, practitioners and other listings applicable to each language.

Van Dam is best known for his appearances with [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) in the late 1990s, with the World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment in the early to mid-2000s and with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) in the early 2010s.

Between ECW, WWF/E and TNA Van Dam has won 21 total championships (including being a three-time [[World heavyweight championship (professional wrestling)|World Champion]]) and is the only wrestler in history to have held the [[WWE Championship]], the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]] and the [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]] (including holding the WWE and ECW titles simultaneously within WWE). Van Dam is also the [[WrestleMania 22|2006 Money in the Bank winner]], and a WWE [[Triple Crown Championship|Triple Crown Champion]]. Van Dam gained his mainstream popularity by 1998 when he won the [[ECW World Television Championship]], which he held for a [[List of ECW World Television Champions|record 700 days]]. Van Dam was called by the fans as ''Mr. Pay-Per-View'' and ''The Whole Fucking/F'n/Dam Show''. Between ECW, WWF/WWE, and TNA, Van Dam headlined major [[pay-per-view]] events in three decades between the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, closing the ECW's premier annual event [[November to Remember#1998|November to Remember 1998]].

In 2002, Van Dam was ranked the [[Pro Wrestling Illustrated#PWI 500|number one wrestler in the world]] by ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]''. He was voted "[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated awards#Most Popular Wrestler of the Year|Most Popular Wrestler]]" by readers of the magazine in 2001 and again in 2002.

==Early life==
Szatkowski grew up in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]] and graduated from [[Pennfield Senior High School]].

Szatkowski made his first appearance on WWF television in 1987 in a skit with [[Ted DiBiase|"The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase]]. At the time, DiBiase was selecting [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#P|plants]] from the audience and offering to pay them to perform degrading acts and offered the 16 year old Szatkowski [[United States dollar|$]]100 to enter the ring and kiss his foot, which he did.<ref>Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man, p.1, Ted DiBiase with Tom Caiazzo, Pocket Books, New York, NY, 2008, ISBN 978-1-4165-5890-3</ref> This early appearance was later included as a bonus feature on WWE's ''Before They Were Superstars'' DVD and on WWE's ''Rob Van Dam: One of a Kind'' DVD.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/12/30/300559.html|title=DiBiase's money bought a young RVD|first=Greg|last=Oliver| accessdate=2008-11-01|work=Wrestling|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer|SLAM!

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1989&ndash;1995)===
The name Rob Van Dam was given to Rob in 1991 by [[Ron Slinker]], a promoter in Florida, possibly because of his martial arts experience and his resemblance to actor [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]].<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.wrestlingnewsdesk.com/WND/the_news/wrestling/rob_van_dam_speaks_out_200804141120.htm|title=Rob Van Dam Speaks Out|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080419073527/http://www.wrestlingnewsdesk.com/WND/the_news/wrestling/rob_van_dam_speaks_out_200804141120.htm|publisher=Wrestling News Desk|author=Matthew Cooper|archivedate=2008-04-19|date=2008-04-14|accessdate=2008-08-11}}</ref> He wrestled in many independent promotions across [[Michigan]], including the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (USWA) and South Atlantic Pro Wrestling (SAPW). In SAPW, he won his first wrestling [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championship]], the SAPW Tag Team Championship, in July 1992 with Chaz Rocco.<ref name="biouswa">[http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/vandam.html#uswa RVD's Career At USWA/SAPW (1992)]</ref> He signed with [[World Championship Wrestling]] in late 1992 and was dubbed '''Robbie V''' by Ron Slinker upon his arrival since [[Bill Watts]] didn't like the name Rob Van Dam. His WCW run was uneventful and largely unnoticed.<ref name="biowcw">[http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/vandam.html#wcw RVD's Career At WCW (1992)]</ref> He also wrestled in several independent promotions across America, and in [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]], where he challenged for the [[World Junior Heavyweight Championship (AJPW)|World Junior Heavyweight Championship]] on several occasions.<ref name="rvdindies">[http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/vandam.html#indy RVD's Independent Career (1993-1995)]</ref>

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996-2001)===

====Debut (1996)====
In January 1996, Van Dam signed with promoter [[Paul Heyman]]'s Philadelphia-based promotion [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), defeating [[Axl Rotten]] in his debut match at ''House Party''.<ref>[http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996a.html#010596 House Party 1996 results]</ref> Van Dam's mannerisms were those of a [[Drug subculture|stoner]], and he became a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] due to his laid-back attitude and unorthodox style. On March 30, he faced [[2 Cold Scorpio]] in a match for the [[ECW World Television Championship]]. The match ended in a draw with 2 Cold Scorpio retaining the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996a.html#033096|title=ECW results - March 30, 1996|date= 1996-03-30|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref><ref name="bioecw">{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/vandam.html#ecw|title=Rob Van Dam's ECW Career (1996)|publisher=Accelerator's Wrestling Rollercoaster}}</ref>

Van Dam gained attention following a series of matches with long-time rival [[Terry Brunk|Sabu]], which began with a match at ''Hostile City Showdown'', won by Sabu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996b.html#042096| title=Hostile City Showdown 1996 results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> After the match, Van Dam declined to show proper respect for his opponent, leading to a rematch at [[ECW A Matter of Respect#1996|A Matter of Respect]], which was won by Van Dam.<ref name="bioecw"/> Per the pre-match stipulation, Sabu then offered Van Dam a handshake, but was again ignored. Instead, Van Dam left the ring and [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|turned]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] under the management of [[Bill Alfonso]].<ref name="bioecw"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996b.html#051196|title=A Matter of Respect results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> At [[Hardcore Heaven#1996|Hardcore Heaven]], Van Dam faced his rival Sabu once again, in a match to prove who was the better man. Sabu won the match.<ref name="bioecw"/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996b.html#062296|title=Hardcore Heaven 1996 results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> The two faced each other yet again in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|stretcher match]] at [[The Doctor Is In (ECW)|The Doctor Is In]]. Van Dam lost the match after missing a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Plancha|Plancha]] to the outside, hitting the railing and falling onto the stretcher.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996c.html#080396|title=The Doctor is In results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> He was quickly rolled out.<ref name="bioecw"/>

====Teaming with Sabu (1996&ndash;1998)====
{{Main|Sabu and Rob Van Dam}}
At ''Natural Born Killaz'', Van Dam defeated [[Doug Furnas]] in a match. Post-match, Van Dam offered Furnas a handshake, but Furnas instead hit Van Dam with a short-arm clothesline, starting a rivalry between the two.<ref name="bioecw"/> After his rivalry with Furnas expanded to also include [[Philip Lafond|Dan Kroffat]], Van Dam wanted a [[tag team]] partner of his own. After losing to long-time rival Sabu once again at ''Unluckily Lottery'', the two united and formed what was to become one of the most successful tag teams in ECW history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996c.html#091396|title=Unlucky Lottery results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> They feuded with Furnas and Kroffat defeating them at ''When Worlds Collide II'' and ''High Incident''.<ref name="bioecw"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996c.html#091496|title=When Worlds Collide II results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996d.html#102696|title=High Incident results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref>

Van Dam and Sabu next feuded with [[The Eliminators]], [[John Kronus]] and [[Perry Saturn]]. On November 1, the two teams fought to a draw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996d.html#110196|title=ECW results - November 1, 1996|date=1996-11-01|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Van Dam then feuded with [[Tazz|Taz]], to whom he lost at ''Holiday Hell'' via knockout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1996d.html#120796|title=Holiday Hell results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Sabu and Van Dam continued to feud with The Eliminators for the ECW World Tag Team Championship into 1997. At ''Crossing the Line Again'' and [[ECW CyberSlam#1997|Cyberslam]], the teams faced off for the ECW World Tag Team Championship in a pair of matches, both of which were won by The Eliminators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1997a.html#020197|title=Crossing the Line Again results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1997a.html#022197|title=Cyberslam 1997 (February 21, 1997) results|date=1997-02-21|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref><ref name="ECW97">{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/vandam.html#97|title=RVD's ECW Career (1997)|publisher=Accelerator's Wrestling Rollercoaster}}</ref> At CyberSlam, the two teams faced each other for the title in a [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match]], in which The Eliminators again retained their title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1997a.html#022297|title=Cyberslam 1997 (February 22, 1997) results|date=1997-02-22|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref>

At ECW's first pay-per-view event [[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]], Van Dam defeated [[Lance Storm]] as a last-minute replacement for the injured [[Chris Candido]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1997b.html#041397|title=Barely Legal results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Immediately following the match, Van Dam expressed his distaste for being chosen as a back-up for "some guy who couldn't even lace his boots". Van Dam delivered a speech directed towards Paul Heyman, and not being originally booked on the show was a point of contention between Van Dam and Heyman for a time.<ref name="ECW97"/>

In May 1997, ECW "invaded" the World Wrestling Federation's ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' television show, drawing the ire of color commentator [[Jerry Lawler]]. Lawler then promised he would show up at an ECW show in order to gain revenge, and when he did show up, he had ECW mainstays Van Dam (who turned heel) and Sabu with him. Van Dam made [[List of professional wrestling terms#P|speeches]] about how he was too good for ECW and deserved to be in one of the "Big Two" (WWF or WCW) on one of their Monday Night programs (''Monday Night Raw'' or ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]''). Lawler began to call Van Dam Mr. Monday Night on an episode of ''Raw'' which became a moniker that would stay with Van Dam, changing to suit the day of the week of whichever program was being broadcast. Despite his arrogance and "betrayal" of ECW, over time Van Dam became applauded by fans recognizing his athleticism and unique maneuvers.<ref name="rvdwwf">{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/vandam.html#wwf|title=RVD: Mr. Monday Night|publisher=Accelerator's Wrestling Rollercoaster}}</ref>

Van Dam continued to team up with Sabu upon his return to ECW on June 13.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1997b.html#061397|title=ECW results - June 13, 1997|date=1997-06-13|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Taz's manager Bill Alfonso betrayed Taz and joined Sabu and Van Dam.

====Reviving ECW: WWE Champion & ECW Champion (2005–2007)====
[[File:Rob Van Dam RVD thumbs.jpg|thumb|right|Van Dam during his ring entrance at WrestleMania 23]]
While recuperating, Van Dam made an appearance at the ECW reunion pay-per-view [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]]. Accompanied by his former manager Bill Alfonso and sporting a knee brace, Van Dam delivered a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)#Worked shoots|worked shoot]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#P|promo]], standing up for ECW and criticizing the way he had been [[List of professional wrestling terms#B|booked]] in WWE, until he was attacked by [[Terry Gerin|Rhyno]]. He was saved by Sabu, who defeated Rhyno in an impromptu match. Despite his injury, Van Dam got physically involved in the match, hitting Rhyno with a chairshot and giving him a [[#In wrestling|Chair Surf]].<ref name="raw05">{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/vandam.html#raw3|title=RVD's Raw Career (2005)|publisher=Accelerator's Wrestling Rollercoaster|accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref> Van Dam, while still healing, was drafted back to the Raw brand in the [[2005 WWE Draft Lottery|2005 Draft Lottery]]. He was introduced to ''Raw'' by [[Carly Colón|Carlito]], who insulted Van Dam before attacking him and assaulting his knee. Van Dam made his return to the ring over six months later at the [[Royal Rumble (2006)|Royal Rumble]]. He gained revenge on Carlito by eliminating him, but was in turn inadvertently eliminated by Rey Mysterio in the final moments. On the February 6 episode of ''Raw'', Van Dam defeated Carlito in the first round of the 2006 Road to WrestleMania Tournament, but lost in the final round to Triple H, in a triple threat match, which also featured Big Show. Later, Van Dam defeated [[William Mueller|Trevor Murdoch]] to qualify for the [[Money in the Bank ladder match]]. Van Dam went on to win the match, thus earning himself a guaranteed shot at either the WWE Championship or World Heavyweight Championship at any time within the subsequent year.<ref name= MitB>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wrestlemania22/matches/2220322/results/|date=2006-02-04|title=RVD wins the "Money in the Bank" Ladder Match|publisher=WWE}}</ref> Following the ladder match, [[Shelton Benjamin]] challenged Van Dam to put his Money in the Bank opportunity on the line in a match. Van Dam countered by requesting a match for Benjamin's Intercontinental Championship. One week later, both Van Dam and Benjamin picked mystery opponents for one another, with the loser placing their respective prize on the line in a bout at [[Backlash (2006)|Backlash]] on April 30. Benjamin lost to the returning [[Charlie Haas]], while Van Dam was defeated by all five members of the [[Spirit Squad]]. As a result, both the Intercontinental Championship and the Money in the Bank title shot were contested at [[Backlash (2006)|Backlash]]. Van Dam went on to win both prizes, before dropping the Intercontinental title back to Benjamin on the May 15 episode of ''Raw''.
[[File:RobVD5.jpg|thumb|left|Van Dam facing Hardcore Holly in the [[Elimination Chamber#Variations|Extreme Elimination Chamber]] at [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]].]]
On May 29, Van Dam was selected by Paul Heyman to be [[WWE Brand Extension#Superstar selections 2|drafted]] from ''Raw'' to WWE's new [[ECW (WWE)|ECW]] brand. At [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|One Night Stand]], Van Dam cashed in his Money in the Bank Contract, and defeated John Cena to win the WWE Championship. After two referees were knocked out, [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] appeared from underneath the ring to attack Cena, [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spearing]] him through a table. Van Dam then hit a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frog splash|Five Star Frog Splash]] and the pinfall was counted by Paul Heyman, who suddenly ran down the aisle. On the following episode of ''Raw'', [[Vince McMahon]] confirmed that the title change was official, due to the match being held under "extreme rules". For the past few weeks, Heyman had hinted that the WWE Championship would be "rechristened" the ECW World Heavyweight Championship when Van Dam won. On the debut of ''[[ECW on Sci Fi]]'', Van Dam was awarded the reinstated [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW World Championship]] by Heyman. Van Dam, however, decided to defend the WWE Championship separately and simultaneously, joking that "this one spins". Thus, Van Dam became the first wrestler in history to hold both the WWE Championship and the ECW World Championship, and the only one to hold them at the same time, making him a Double World Champion. At [[Vengeance (2006)|Vengeance]] Van Dam defeated Edge to retain the WWE Championship (ECW World Championship was not on the line in that match). Van Dam continued to defend both titles at ''Raw and ''ECW'' respectively. On the July 3 episode of ''Raw'', Van Dam lost the WWE Championship to Edge in a triple threat match that also featured John Cena. The next night, on the July 4 episode of ''ECW'', he lost the ECW World Championship to The Big Show after Heyman [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|turned]] on him. Later on WWE.com, Heyman suspended Van Dam for 30 days without giving a reason; ([[Legit (professional wrestling)|in reality]], WWE suspended Van Dam for 30 days as a result of [[#2006 arrest|his recent drug possession arrest]]).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/news/rvdsuspended|title=WWE suspending Rob Van Dam for 30 days|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2006-07-04}}</ref>

He returned to television on August 8, attacking both Sabu and [[Kurt Angle]] during a match. His return to the ring came a week later, in a losing effort to Sabu in a [[ladder match]] for number one contendership to the ECW World Championship. Van Dam slowly worked his way back into the championship picture. In October, Van Dam defeated The Big Show in a non-title match to regain the number one contendership. Having the option to pick a date, Van Dam announced the title match would occur at [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]]. Heyman, however, had the option of picking the match type and announced that the main event would be a six-man [[Elimination Chamber#Variations|Extreme Elimination Chamber]] match. At the event, Van Dam was the third participant eliminated. Later in December, Van Dam once again earned the number one contendership to the ECW World Championship, but this time by a fan poll. Van Dam got three matches against ECW World Champion [[Bobby Lashley]], coming up short each time.[[Image:ECW originals313.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Terry Brunk|Sabu]], [[Tommy Dreamer]], Van Dam and [[Jim Fullington|The Sandman]] ([[ECW Originals]]) performing their signature poses.]]
Rob Van Dam later joined the [[ECW Originals]] along with Sabu, Tommy Dreamer, and [[Jim Fullington|The Sandman]]. The ECW Originals began a feud with the [[New Breed (ECW)|New Breed]] ([[Elijah Burke]], [[Kevin Fertig|Kevin Thorn]], [[Monty Brown|Marcus Cor Von]], and [[Matthew Kaye|Matt Striker]]). The two teams faced off at [[WrestleMania 23]] in a match which the ECW Originals won. After Vince McMahon won the ECW World Championship at [[Backlash (2007)|Backlash]], RVD and the other ECW Originals made statements on WWE.com about McMahon killing ECW. The ECW Originals all competed in a four way dance to decide who would take on McMahon the next week on ECW in a title match, which Van Dam won after a five-star frog splash on Sandman. Van Dam, however, had to face McMahon, [[Shane McMahon]], and [[Eddie Fatu|Umaga]] in a 3 on 1 handicap match, which Van Dam was unable to win.

Van Dam received a concussion during a match with [[Randy Orton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/articles/3960574/rvdupdate|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070531083102/http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/articles/3960574/rvdupdate|archivedate=2007-05-31|title=RVD gets concussed}}</ref> Orton further attacked Van Dam after the match due to the comments Van Dam made on WWE.com about the lack of respect Orton displayed towards [[Shawn Michaels]], who also suffered a concussion at the hands of Orton. Van Dam once again faced Orton at [[One Night Stand (2007)|One Night Stand]], this time in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Stretcher match]]. Although it looked as if Orton was going to win again, Van Dam gave him a [[roundhouse kick]] to the head and was able to push the stretcher across the line for the win. Despite winning the match, Orton continued to attack Van Dam, ending with an [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Elevated DDT|elevated DDT]] off the barricade and onto the concrete floor. After the match, Van Dam left WWE due to being burnt out and needing time away.

===Independent circuit (2007&ndash;2010)===
The day after Van Dam's WWE contract expired, he was in the United Kingdom on a promotional tour and to record scenes for the wrestling documentary, ''[[Bloodstained Memoirs]]''. He also took part in interviews for the [[BBC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestling.com/article/news/8474|title=prowrestling.com|author=pw}}</ref}</ref><ref name="sunboth">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/2727319/Rob-Van-Dam-says-he-is-speaking-to-WWE-and-TNA-in-the-second-part-of-his-exclusive-UK-Sun-interview.html|title=RVD: I'm speaking to both sides|last=Rothstein|first=Simon|date=14 November 2009|work=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Rob Van Dam AWR 2009.JPG|upright|thumb|left|Van Dam as No Limits Wrestling (NLW) Champion at ''American Wrestling Rampage''.]]
In an interview with the ''Baltimore Sun'', Van Dam stated that while WWE would be the first choice and that he would definitely talk to them, he would definitely consider [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) if he returned full-time to pro wrestling. He also spoke his thoughts regarding his choice between both companies.

{{cquote|I definitely would consider them. I would weigh out everything and decide what really is the best thing to do. When I knew that I was not going to re-sign with WWE, which was around [[WrestleMania]] time when I knew for sure that I was going to stick to that plan, my first thoughts were, “OK, well there’s this TNA.” I think that’s pretty funny even imagining Vince giving in to something like that for that reason. One thing that’s for sure is that WWE and I do have a good-faith understanding that if and when I’m ready to return that I’ll be talking to them. They look forward and hope that we’ll be doing business again. They hope it’s real soon. Honestly, I’m free as can be. I would also consider the lighter schedule from another company. But, honestly, giving up the prestige of the WWE would be something that I would look at as a downward move. I don’t fit with the formula – I never have. I’ve never tried to be like anybody else. I’m a [[non-conformist]] in every way, and when it comes to wrestling, that’s certainly true, too. If I won on my way out and you’re not supposed to do that, that’s just another example of how I’m one of a kind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080127100933/http://www.tnawrestlingnews.com/headlines/203136810.shtml|title=TNA News: RVD On TNA: 'I Definitely Would Consider Them', More|publisher=TNAWrestlingNews|date=2008-01-23}}</ref>}}

On March 9, 2009, it was announced that RVD would be competing in American Wrestling Rampage (AWR) on their European Tour, during which he won the promotion's No Limits Wrestling (NLW) Championship in a three way bout versus Sabu and former champion Shawn Maxer.<ref name="wrestlezone.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/article/rob-van-dam-wins-a-world-title-in-paris-france-60083|title=Rob Van Dam Wins A World Title In Paris, France|date=March 20, 2009|author=Wz Bill Behrens}}</ref> He lost the title to [[René Goguen|René Duprée]] after three successful defences.

Szatkowski had been stopped for speeding by an [[Ohio State Highway Patrol]] trooper, who discovered that he was in possession of 18&nbsp;grams of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and five [[Vicodin]] pills, while Brunk was in possession of [[drug paraphernalia]] and nine tablets of [[Testolactone]].<ref name="Almanac">{{cite news|first=Hicks|last=Brady|title=2006: The year in wrestling|work=PWI Presents: 2007 Wrestling Almanak and book of facts|publisher=Kappa Publications|id=2007 Edition|page=23}}</ref> Both Szatkowski and Brunk were released after posting [[bail]], and were scheduled to appear in [[Ironton, Ohio|Ironton]] Municipal Court on July 6, 2006.<ref name=arrest>{{cite web|title=Wrestling stars busted in Hanging Rock|publisher=The Ironton Tribune|url=http://www.irontontribune.com/news/2006/jul/03/wrestling-stars-busted-in-hanging-rock/|accessdate=2006-07-03}}</ref> On July 6, 2006, ''The Ironton Tribune'' reported that the court date for Szatkowski and Brunk was in limbo, as their attorneys had asked for and were granted continuances.<ref name=arrest2>{{cite web|url=http://www.irontontribune.com/news/2006/jul/14/wrestlers8217-court-date-canceled/|title=Wrestlers' court date canceled|publisher=The Ironton Tribune|accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref>

According to the [[WWE#Wellness Program|WWE's wellness policy]], a drug-related arrest can lead to that talent's immediate dismissal from the company. WWE Vice President of Talent Relations [[John Laurinaitis]] released a statement on WWE.com reporting that Szatkowski and Brunk were still eligible to compete on the ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' and ''[[ECW on Sci Fi|ECW]]'' tapings in the following days while an investigation conducted by WWE was being undertaken. This resulted in Szatkowski dropping the WWE Championship at the live ''Raw'' one night and the ECW Championship the next night at the ''ECW'' taping. Van Dam was subsequently suspended without pay for 30 days, and an on-air segment on ''ECW'' was scripted to relay this suspension to the fans.<ref name="Almanac"/><ref name=rvdsabucharges>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/rvdsabucharges|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061127051453/http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/rvdsabucharges|archivedate=2006-11-27|title=WWE investigating Rob Van Dam and Sabu charges|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2006-07-03}}</ref>

'''''The Destiny of The Mother Church''''', by [[Bliss Knapp]] is a controversial book published by [[Christian Science Publishing Society]] in 1991. Knapp and his parents, Ira O. and Flavia Stickney Knapp, all knew [[Mary Baker Eddy]]. His parents were students of hers and his father was one of the original members of the Board of Directors of [[The Mother Church]]. Until 1991, the book was repeatedly rejected for publication by the [[Christian Science]] Board of Directors because of the depiction of Eddy as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy and equating her with [[Christ Jesus]], a position which Eddy considered blasphemous. Eddy identified the woman in the [[Book of Revelation]] not as a person, but as "generic man". ''Destiny's'' publication caused divisions within the church, including several resignations of prominent church employees. Critics claimed that the failure of the church's then-recent television venture, which had cost the church several hundred million dollars, had motivated the Board's reversal on publishing Knapp's book. Knapp, his wife and her sister left wills that granted bequests totalling over $100 million (in 1990s dollars) promised to the church if the book were to be published. The wills set a time limit of 20 years for the book to be published, otherwise the bequests were to be divided between [[Stanford University]] and the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], and the church would receive nothing. The 1973 death of Knapp's wife set the date of the time limit to May 1993.

== Controversy ==
Both of Bliss Knapp's parents were students of Eddy and Ira O. Knapp was one of her students who believed her to be the "woman of prophecy",<ref>Peel, Robert. ''Mary Baker Eddy: Years of Authority''. Holt, Rinehart and Winston 1977, pp.&nbsp;32 and 432, fn92</ref> a view also held by his son. In 1925, the younger Knapp wrote a book about his parents, which he later expanded to include chapters on his view of Eddy's identity as the "woman clothed with the sun" described in [[s:Bible (King James)/Revelation#12:1|Revelation 12:1]]. Eddy herself taught that the woman "symbolizes generic man, the spiritual idea of God".<ref>Gottschalk, Stephen. ''Rolling Away The Stone''. Indiana University Press, 2006, p.&nbsp;275</ref><ref group=n>Eddy uses the word "man" in the older sense of "species" or "human being", it does not refer to gender.</ref> She strongly rejected any comparison to Jesus.<ref>Peel, Robert. 1977, p. 169</ref> Nonetheless, her own difficulties establishing a new religion did make her identify with the apocalyptic woman's "travailing in birth", the dragon's persecution of the woman and other symbolism in the chapter.<ref>Peel, Robert. 1977, p. 164</ref>

Knapp published ''Destiny'' privately in 1947<ref name="nyt">[http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/14/us/christian-science-church-settles-claim-to-bequest.html "Christian Science Church Settles Claim to Bequest"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 14, 1993. Retrieved August 9, 2013</ref> and sent a book draft of ''Destiny'' to the [[Christian Science Board of Directors]] requesting that the church publish it as authorized literature. In a six-page reply in February 1948, they cited numerous points they regarded as departures from Eddy's teaching and said they could not publish the book without those points being corrected. Knapp did not revise the book as they proposed, but left a trust with approximately $100 million in 1990s dollars to revert to the [[Church of Christ, Scientist|Christian Science church]] if it published his work as "authorized literature", an official designation that identifies a work as being in consonance with Christian Science teaching. The trust set up a 20-year time limitation; with the death of Knapp's wife in 1973, that date became May 1993.<ref name="stanu">[http://news.stanford.edu/pr/92/920923Arc2100.html "Court rejects Christian Science motion on bequests"] Stanford University. Press release, September 23, 1992. Retrieved August 9, 2013</ref>

In September 1991, the Christian Science Board of Directors decided to publish ''The Destiny of The Mother Church'', despite charges of blasphemy and protests that doing so violated the ''[[Manual of The Mother Church]]'', which governs the church, including its publishing arm.<ref name="anker">Anker, Roy M. [http://books.google.de/books?id=QDrbBzrMCCwC&pg=PA82&lpg=PA82#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Self-help and Popular Religion in Modern American Culture''] Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group. 1999, p.&nbsp;82. ISBN 0-313-22249-5. Retrieved August 9, 2013</ref> It created a 15-book series of biographies of Eddy, the first time the church had published anything new about her in years.<ref name="stanu" />

A church spokesman defended the decision to publish saying that since Knapp had known Eddy personally, his book was historically valuable and the decision had nothing to do with the bequest.<ref name="nyt" /> The church treasurer, however, told the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' that the church's Board of Directors would have been "fiscally irresponsible" not to have discussed publishing ''Destiny''.<ref name="cri" /> The church had lost substantial sums of money in its television venture, begun in 1986, reallocating funds from its newspaper, ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' to the extent that its editor, [[Kay Fanning]] and others resigned in protest, then borrowing $41.5 million from its pension fund, $20 million from a restricted endowment fund and another $5 million from money left to the church by Eddy.<ref name="anker2">Anker, Roy M. 1999, [http://books.google.de/books?id=QDrbBzrMCCwC&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 82.] Retrieved August 9, 2013</ref> In 1992, the church estimated it had lost $327.5 million.<ref name="nyt" /> In addition, membership had been in decline,<ref name="cri" /> reducing income.

The third printing of the book was marked "authorized literature". In 1992, at the annual meeting of church members held in Boston, Al M. Carnesciali, manager of the Publishing Society, spoke of "Christian Science literature" as opposed to "authorized literature", a term which signified that which the church endorsed as being consonant with official church teachings.<ref name="anker" /> Carnesciali made a distinction between "Christian Science literature" consonant with official church teachings and "authorized literature", which did not have to be doctrinally "correct".<ref name="nyt2">Steinfels, Peter, [http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/09/us/troubled-church-discloses-its-financial-records.html "Troubled Church Discloses Its Financial Records"] ''The New York Times'', June 9, 1992. Retrieved August 9, 2013</ref>

In order to fulfill the terms of the trust, the book was to be designated "authorized literature" and prominently displayed in "substantially all" [[Christian Science reading room]]s.<ref name="cri">[http://www.equip.org/articles/christian-scientists-charge-their-church-with-violating-its-principles/ "Christian Scientists Charge Their Church with Violating Its Principles"] Christian Research Institute, April 9, 2009.

March 22, 1992. Retrieved August 9, 2013</ref> The Knapp estate reached a compromise with the church in October 1993, allowing the church to publish the book without declaring it "authorized literature" and split the bequest with the other two beneficiaries.<ref name="anker" /> This was challenged by a Knapp family member who said Bliss Knapp had stipulated there be full compliance with the trust. In addition, a group of church members sought the court to prevent distribution based on the ''Manual'' by-law prohibiting the church from publishing "incorrect literature."<ref name="nyt" /><ref name="anker" /> In addition, many reading rooms refused to carry the book,<ref name="cri" /> though precise figures are difficult to establish. 

The court challenges failed and the money was eventually distributed three ways, with the church getting 53% and Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Art Museum splitting the rest.<ref name="nyt" />

'''James Miller''' (April 25, 1776 – July 7, 1851) was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[New Hampshire]], the first [[List of Governors of Arkansas|Governor]] of [[Arkansas Territory]], and a [[Brigadier General]] in the [[United States Army]] during the [[War of 1812]]. It was during his term as governor, and partly due to his influence, that the territory's capital was moved from Arkansas Post to Little Rock.

==Biography==
James Miller was born in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]] to James Miller and Catharine Gregg Miller. He attended an academy at Amherst, Massachusetts and then [[Williams College]]. He married Martha Ferguson and they had one son, James Ferguson Miller, who became a noted naval officer. After Martha's death, he married Ruth Flint.He had a law practice in [[Greenfield, New Hampshire]] from 1803 to 1808.<ref>{{cite web|title=James Miller|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2872|publisher=Encyclopedia of Arkansas|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref>

==Military career==
Miller joined the [[New Hampshire Militia|New Hampshire state militia]] and commanded an artillery unit, until General [[Benjamin Pierce (governor)|Benjamin Pierce]] noticed him and recommended that he be commissioned as a Major in the regular army. Miller joined with the 4th United States Infantry in 1808. In 1811, Miller's unit went to fight Indians in [[Vincennes, Indiana]], where he was promoted to Colonel.<ref>{{cite web|title=James Miller|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2872|publisher=Encyclopedia of Arkansas|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref>

In May 1812, his regiment moved to [[Detroit, Michigan]]. He was the commander during the Battle of Maguaga. Shortly afterwards, Miller was taken [[prisoner of war|prisoner]] in 1813 and was later exchanged.<ref>{{cite web|title=James Miller|url=http://arkapedia.tripod.com/pedia/James_Miller/|publisher=Arkansas Encyclopedia|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref>

In 1814, Miller was Colonel of the [[21st Infantry Regiment (United States)|21st Infantry Regiment]] and led his men in the capture of the British artillery at the [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]]. His "I will try sir!" quote became famous and he earned the name of "Hero of Lundy's Lane". He was awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in November 1814. Miller was made a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] Brigadier General by the U.S. Congress after the battle.<ref>{{cite web|title=James Miller|url=http://arkapedia.tripod.com/pedia/James_Miller/|publisher=Arkansas Encyclopedia|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref>

==Political career==
Appointed [[Governor]] of the [[Arkansas Territory]] on March 3, 1819, Miller resigned from the army, but did not leave New England for his governorship until September 1819. He traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] first, where he learned that he would also serve as the superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Arkansas Territory. He traveled to [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and acquired armaments for the territorial militia. He then traveled down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers with the armaments in tow, arriving at Arkansas Post on December 26, 1819, on a vessel flying flags reading “Arkansaw” and “I will try, sir!” Due to Miller’s tardiness, [[Robert Crittenden]], the secretary of the territory, had been running the state and filling necessary appointments which were validated by the U.S. Congress. Miller focused his attentions on finding a suitable location for a territorial capital. A number of influential men, including Miller, in the territorial legislature had purchased lots in the Little Rock area, the bill moving the capital from [[Arkansas Post]] to [[Little Rock]] passed the territorial legislature.

As [[Superintendent of Indian Affairs]] for the territory, Miller dealt with the considerable debate over Quapaw, Cherokee, and Choctaw land claims and the desire for American whites to take the land for themselves. To make matters more confusing for Miller, warfare between the Cherokee and the Osage erupted within the territory in 1821. From the beginning of his term, it was clear that he did not plan to stay in Arkansas, as his wife remained in [[New Hampshire]]. Miller left the torrid Arkansas summer for cooler New Hampshire in April 1821, returning the following November. In his absences, Crittenden ran Arkansas and made decisions regarding the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] problems. Finally, in June 1823, Miller left Arkansas and did not return at all that year. He held the post as Governor of the [[Arkansas Territory]] from 1819 to 1824.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=miller&GSfn=james&GSbyrel=all&GSdy=1851&GSdyrel=in&GSob=n&GRid=13605093&df=all&|title= James Miller|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref>

In the fall of 1824, he was elected to the House of Representatives in New Hampshire but never took office. Instead he was appointed [[U.S. Customs District of Salem and Beverly|Collector of Customs]] in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], a post he served in until 1849. It is in this role that he is portrayed as the General in [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''The Custom-House, an Introductory to [[The Scarlet Letter]]''.

==Death and legacy==
Miller retired to his home in [[Temple, New Hampshire]], where he died of a [[cerebrovascular accident|stroke]]. He was buried in [[Harmony Grove Cemetery]] in [[Salem, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=miller&GSfn=james&GSbyrel=all&GSdy=1851&GSdyrel=in&GSob=n&GRid=13605093&df=all&|title=James Miller|publisher=Find A Grave |accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref>

'''Chicago soul''' is a style of [[soul music]] that arose during the 1960s in [[Chicago]].  Along with [[Detroit]], the home of [[Motown]], and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], with its hard-edged, gritty performers (see [[Memphis soul]]), Chicago and the Chicago soul style helped spur the album-oriented soul revolution of the early 1970s.

The sound of Chicago soul, like [[southern soul]] with its rich influence of black [[gospel music]], also exhibited an unmistakable gospel sound, but was somewhat lighter and more delicate in its approach. Chicago [[vocal group]]s tended to feature laid-back sweet harmonies, while solo artists exhibited a highly melodic and somewhat [[pop music|pop]] approach to their songs. 

Accompaniment usually featured highly [[orchestra]]ted arrangements, with horns and strings, by such notable arrangers as [[Johnny Pate]] (who largely worked with horns) and [[Riley Hampton]] (who specialized in strings). This kind of soul music is sometimes called “soft soul”, to distinguish it from the more harsh and gospelly “hard soul” style.

==Notable labels==
A variety of labels in the city during the 1960s and 1970s contributed to the Chicago soul sound, most notably [[Vee-Jay]], [[Constellation Records (Chicago)|Constellation Records]], [[Chess Records]], [[Mercury Records]], [[OKeh]], ABC-Paramount, [[One-derful]], [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] and its [[Dakar Records]] subsidiary, and Curtis Mayfield's [[Curtom]] label.

===Vee-Jay===
[[Vee-Jay Records]] was Chicago's pioneer soul label. In 1958 it produced the first recognized soul hit in Chicago, [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]] and [[The Impressions]]' "[[For Your Precious Love]]." The company, before it went [[insolvency|bankrupt]] in 1966, produced under [[A&R]] director [[Calvin Carter]], many notable soul acts in the Chicago soft soul idiom, notably Butler (best known for “[[He Will Break Your Heart]]”), [[Betty Everett]] ("[[The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)]]"), Dee Clark ("[[Raindrops (Dee Clark song)|Raindrops]]"), and [[Gene Chandler]] ("[[Duke of Earl]]"). Vee Jay was also the first American record label to sign and record The Beatles in the U.S in 1962. The label released several singles but were unsuccessful in scoring a major hit. In 1964 Vee-Jay released [[The Beatles]]' first U.S. album titled ''[[Introducing... The Beatles]]''. After having management issues at the label and a shortage of funds, the label could not promote the record and give it the push that was needed. So the label was forced to release the group.

===Chess Records===
[[Chess Records]], under A&R director and producer [[Roquel Billy Davis]], featured such Chicago soul style acts as the vocal harmony groups [[The Dells]] ("[[Stay in My Corner]]") and the Radiants ("Voice Your Choice"), female singers [[Jan Bradley]] ("Mama Didn’t Lie"), [[Fontella Bass]] ("[[Rescue Me (Fontella Bass song)|Rescue Me]]"), and [[Jackie Ross]] (“Selfish One”), and male vocalists such as [[Bo Diddley]]'s protégé [[Billy Stewart]] (“I Do Love You”). Chess’ biggest female soul artist, [[Etta James]], performed both in the soft style ("[[At Last]]") and the hard style (“[[Tell Mama]]”).

===OKeh===
[[OKeh Records]] was a subsidiary of [[Columbia Records]], but it produced a number of hits by Chicago artists, produced by A&R director Carl Davis in the company's Chicago office. Most of the songs performed by OKeh artists came from the pen of [[Curtis Mayfield]], and OKeh recordings best typified the distinctive sound of Chicago soul. Best known Chicago artists on OKeh were [[Major Lance]] ("The Monkey Time"), Walter Jackson ("It’s All Over"), Billy Butler ("Right Track"), and the Artistics ("Get My Hands on Some Lovin'").

===ABC-Paramount===
[[ABC-Paramount]] was based in [[New York City|New York]], but it recorded a number of Chicago soul acts through its Chicago offices, most notably [[The Impressions]], led by guitarist and songwriter Curtis Mayfield. The Impressions were best known for such hits as "Gypsy Woman" and "[[People Get Ready (song)|People Get Ready]]."  Another Chicago soul act that recorded for ABC-Paramount was [[The Marvelows]] ("I Do").

===Constellation Records===
[[Constellation Records (Chicago)|Constellation Records]] was formed in August 1963 by [[Ewart Abner]], Bill "Bunky" Sheppard, and Art Sheridan. Abner was ousted from Vee-Jay, and took with him from Vee-Jay producer Bill "Bunky" Sheppard, and two Vee-Jay artists that were personally under contract to Abner, namely Gene Chandler and Dee Clark. Art Sheridan had run [[Chance Records]] in the early 1950s, and had been an investor in Vee-Jay.  Chandler prospered at Constellation, getting huge national hits for the next three years, notably "Just Be True" and "Nothing Can Stop Me," while Dee Clark got only local hits, notably "Warm Summer Breezes" and "Heartbreak."  Another Constellation artist was [[Holle Thee Maxwell|Holly Maxwell]] who had regional hits such as "Only When Your Lonely", "One Thin Dime", and "Suffer".

===One-derful===
The One-derful label complex (One-derful, M-Pac, Mar-V-lus, Midas) represented mostly the harder gospelly style of Chicago soul music. Its most notable artists were [[Otis Clay]] ("That’s How It Is"), [[Harold Burrage]] ("Got to Find A Way"), [[McKinley Mitchell]] ("The Town I Live In"), and [[The Five Du-Tones]] ("[[Shake a Tail Feather]]"). The company also had dance hits with [[Alvin Cash]] and the Crawlers ("Twine Time").

===Brunswick===
[[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] was a New York-based label, but under the aegis of producer and A&R man Carl Davis in Chicago, the company produced a large body of Chicago style soul, beginning in 1966, when [[Jackie Wilson]] started recording in Chicago. Wilson's biggest hit with Davis was "[[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher]]." Other Brunswick artists included [[The Chi-Lites]] ("[[Oh Girl]]"), [[The Artistics]] ("I'm Gonna Miss You"), [[Barbara Acklin]] ("Love Makes A Woman"), [[Tyrone Davis]] ("[[Turn Back the Hands of Time]]"), and [[Gene Chandler]] ("The Girl Don't Care"). Brunswick was eventually acquired by Carl Davis, and the offices moved to the Record Row (South [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago) | Michigan Avenue]]).

===Curtom===
[[Curtom Records|Curtom]] was owned by [[Curtis Mayfield]], and the label began recording Chicago soul talent in 1968. The label better represents the post-soul era in Chicago black music, as it specialized in [[funk]] and [[disco]] recordings, and became a notable producer of soundtracks for black films. Mayfield became a solo artist while at Curtom, and his ''[[Super Fly (soundtrack)|Super Fly]]'' soundtrack (1972), with its funk style, represents the label's biggest seller. Other Curtom artists were disco singer Linda Clifford ("Runaway Love"), the Natural Four ("Can This Be Real"), and the [[Staple Singers]] ("[[Let's Do It Again (song)|Let's Do It Again]]").  Predating Curtom, Mayfield ran the labels Windy C (Five Stairsteps, Holly Maxwell, June Conquest), and Mayfield (Fascinations, The Mayfield Singers) (which featured two future soul stars: [[Donny Hathaway]] and [[Leroy Hutson]], and Holly Maxwell).

In 1980, Mayfield closed the Curtom office and moved to Atlanta, and not long afterwards Brunswick closed its office, which had by then moved to Chicago, as well. With these closings, and with disco and funk replacing traditional soul in popular appeal, Chicago soul music had effectively come to an end.

===Chi-Sound===
Another label active in Chicago in the mid-to-late 1970s was Chi-Sound Records, under the production aegis of Carl Davis. Chi-Sound, besides recording the Chi-Lites, Dells, and Gene Chandler, had a number of disco-soul acts between 1976 and 1982, including [[Windy City Orchestra]],  [[Ebony Rhythm Funk Campaign]], Magnum Force, Sidney Joe Qualls (previously signed to the [[Brunswick Records]] subsidiary, Dakar, in the early 1970s), Manchild and the Chi-Sound Orchestra.

'''Jangle pop''' is a genre of [[alternative rock]] from the mid-1980s that "marked a return to the chiming or jangly guitars and pop melodies of the '60s", as exemplified by [[The Byrds]], with [[electric guitar|electric]] [[twelve-string guitar]]s and [[power pop]] song structures. Mid-1980s jangle pop was a non-mainstream "pop-based format" with "some folk-rock overtones". Between 1983 and 1987, the description "jangle pop" was, in the US, used to describe bands like [[R.E.M.]], [[Let's Active]] and [[Tom Petty]], and a subgenre called "[[Paisley Underground]]", which incorporated psychedelic influences.<ref name="autogenerated1">[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d2692|pure_url=yes}} Jangle Pop]. Allmusic.com. Retrieved August 2011</ref> In the UK, the term was applied to the new wave of raw and immediate sounding melodic guitar-bands collected on the [[NME|''NME'']]'s ''[[C86 (album)|C86]]'' (and later ''[[CD86 (album)|CD86]]'') compilations.

==History==

===Origins===
In 1964, [[The Beatles]]' use of the jangle sound in the songs "[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]", "[[What You're Doing]]", "[[Ticket to Ride]]" and their cover of [[Buddy Holly]]'s "[[Words of Love]]" encouraged many artists to use the jangle sound or purchase a [[Rickenbacker]] [[twelve-string guitar]]. [[The Byrds]] began using similar guitars after seeing them played in the film ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''. Other groups such as [[The Who]] (in their early "[[Mod (subculture)|Mod]]" years), [[The Beach Boys]], [[The Hollies]] and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] continued the use of twelve-string Rickenbackers. The Byrds, whose style was also referred to as [[folk rock]], prominently featured [[Roger McGuinn]]'s Rickenbacker electric twelve-string guitar in many of their recordings.

The etymological derivation of the term "jangle" is uncertain. The term may be derived from the lyric "In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come following you" from The Byrds' cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s song "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]", or it may be an [[onomatopoeia]] that refers to the chiming sound of a twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar's upper-register strings. Jangle pop is related to the [[power pop]] genre that developed in the 1960s, including bands like [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]] and [[Big Star (band)|Big Star]], who blurred the line between the two styles.

===1980s===
"Jangle pop" began as "an American [[post-punk]] movement of the mid-'80s that marked a return to the chiming guitars and pop melodies of the '60s." In 1979, the [[Athens, Georgia]] group [[Pylon (band)|Pylon]] debuted with an "angular, propulsive jangle pop sound" that would influence fellow members of the Athens, Georgia music scene,<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5202/biography|pure_url=yes}} Pylon bio], Allmusic.com. Retrieved August 2011</ref> including R.E.M.

In New York City during this period, "jangle pop" could reasonably be used to describe the more conventionally folk-rock [[Willie Nile]], [[The Smithereens]], and popular but unsigned four-piece band The Floor Models,<ref>[http://powerpop.blogspot.com/search?q=The+Floor+Models The Floor Models], Powerpop.blogspot.com. Retrieved August 2011</ref> all of whom had origins in Greenwich Village clubs such as [[The Bitter End]], [[Folk City]] and Kenny's Castaways, as did many significant East Coast 1960s folk-rock acts. The Smithereens and Floor Models in particular made extensive use of various models of the [[Rickenbacker]] twelve-string electric guitar as well as the much rarer [[Hagström]] twelve-string electric guitar.<ref>[http://www.hagstrom.org.uk/hagstwelve.htm Hagstrom 12-string electric guitar], hagstrom.org.uk. Retrieved August 2011</ref>

The sound of jangle pop was "essentially a pop-based format" with "some folk-rock overtones." ''[[AllMusic]]'' claims that it was non-mainstream music with "deliberately cryptic" lyrics and "raw and amateurish" [[DIY]] production. Between 1983 and 1987, "Southern-pop bands like [[R.E.M.]] and [[Let's Active]]" and a subgenre called "[[Paisley Underground]]" incorporated psychedelic influences.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> An article in ''Blogcritics'' magazine claims that besides R.E.M., the "... only other jangle-pop band to enjoy large sales in America were [[the Bangles]], from Los Angeles. While better known for their glossy hits like 'Manic Monday', their first album and EP were organic, real jangle-pop efforts in a Byrds/Big Star vein, spiced with a dash of psychedelia on their debut."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2005/07/24/175801.php |title=Sunday Morning Playlist: Jangle Pop - Blogcritics Music |publisher=Blogcritics.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref>

Jangle pop influenced [[college rock]] during the early 1980s,<ref>[http://www.radiosparx.com/rsc/display/sounds.cfm/sound_group_iid.3964 Jangle Pop] radiosparx.com. Retrieved December 2011</ref> as demonstrated on early albums by [[R.E.M.]], [[10,000 Maniacs]], [[Let's Active]],
[[The dB's]], [[The Feelies]], [[Guadalcanal Diary (band)|Guadalcanal Diary]], [[Game Theory (band)|Game Theory]], [[The Connells]], [[Marshall Crenshaw]] and the [[Beat Farmers]]. In [[Austin, Texas]], the term "[[New Sincerity]]" was loosely used for a similar group of bands, led by [[The Reivers (band)|The Reivers]], Wild Seeds and True Believers.

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[The Smiths]], [[Felt (band)|Felt]], and [[Aztec Camera]] can be considered part of jangle pop, as can the raw and immediate sounding melodic guitar-bands of the ''[[C86 (album)|C86]]''/''[[CD86 (album)|CD86]]'' scene.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/jangle-pop-t730 |title=Jangle-Pop |author=Sullivan, Denise |date= |work=[[Allmusic]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate=July 28, 2011}}</ref> [[Australia]]n band [[The Church (band)|The Church]] can likewise be considered an example of the genre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rhapsody.com/#/genre/alt-punk/indie-alternative/jangle-pop |title=Jangle Pop |author= |date= |work=[[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] |publisher=Rhapsody International |accessdate=July 28, 2011}}</ref> <ref>[http://www.highbias.com/reviews/20011014_live.html "Stagestruck"] (''High Bias'' review of Wild Seeds, October 1, 2001), [http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090116075636/http://www.highbias.com/reviews/20011014_live.html archive copy] at [[Internet Archive]].</ref> In [[Canada]], around this time of more so the late '80s, bands like [[The Tragically Hip]] and [[Barenaked Ladies]] had elements of jangle in their earlier material.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

'''Bodrum''' ({{IPA-tr|?bod?um}})  is a [[List of districts of Turkey|district]] and a port city in [[Mu?la Province]], in the southwestern [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean Region]] of [[Turkey]]. It is located on the southern coast of Bodrum Peninsula, at a point that checks the entry into the [[Gulf of Gökova]], and is also the center of the eponymous district. The city was called [[Halicarnassus]] of [[Caria]] in ancient times and was famous for housing the [[Mausoleum of Mausolus]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. [[Bodrum Castle]], built by the [[Knights Hospitaller]] in the 15th century, overlooks the harbour and the marina. The castle grounds include a [[Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology|Museum of Underwater Archaeology]] and hosts several cultural festivals throughout the year. The city had a population of 136,317 in 2012.

==Geography==

===Etymology===
The name Bodrum derives from Petronium, named from the [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitaller]] [[Bodrum Castle|Castle of St. Peter]] (see [[Bodrum#History|history]]). The site was formerly known as [[Halicarnassus]] ([[Ancient Greek]]: ????????????,<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%28alikarnasso%2Fs ????????????], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus project</ref>  {{lang-tr|Halikarnas}}.)

===Climate===
Bodrum has a [[Mediterranean climate]]. A winter average high of {{convert|15|°C|°F}} and in the summer {{convert|34|°C|°F}}, with very sunny spells. Summers are hot and mostly sunny and winters are mild and humid.

==History==
[[File:Halicarnassus Theatre.jpg|thumb|right|Theatre of [[Halicarnassus]] in Bodrum, with the [[Bodrum Castle]] seen in the background.]]
{{See also|Halicarnassus}}
The first recorded settlers in Bodrum region were the [[Carians]] and the harbor area was colonized by [[Dorians|Dorian]] Greeks as of the 7th century BC. The city later fell under Persian rule. Under the Persians, it was the capital city of the [[satrapy]] of [[Caria]], the region that had since long constituted its hinterland and of which it was the principal port. Its strategic location ensured that the city enjoyed considerable autonomy. Archaeological evidence from the period such as the recently discovered Salmakis (''Kaplankalesi'') Inscription, now in [[Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology]], attest to the particular pride its inhabitants had developed.<ref>{{cite web|url=
http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/1998/123pdf/123001.pdf Study:|title = The Pride of Halicarnassus|author=Signe Isager|publisher=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 123 p. 1-23|year=1998}}</ref> 

[[Alexander the Great]] laid [[Siege of Halicarnassus|siege to the city]] after his arrival in Carian lands and, together with his ally, the queen [[Ada of Caria]], captured it after  fighting in 334 BCE.

===Mausolus===
[[File:Halicarnassus Mausoleum.jpg|thumb|Surviving substructures and ruins of the [[Mausoleum of Mausolus]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], in [[Halicarnassus]] (modern Bodrum.)]]
[[Mausolus]] ruled Caria from here, nominally on behalf of the Persians and independently in practical terms, for much of his reign from 377 to 353 BC. When he died in 353 BC, [[Artemisia II of Caria]], who was both his sister and his widow, employed the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Architecture|architects]] [[Satyros]] and [[Pythis]], and the four [[Sculpture|sculptors]] [[Bryaxis]], [[Scopas]], [[Leochares]] and [[Timotheus (sculptor)|Timotheus]] to build a monument, as well as a tomb, for him. The word "[[mausoleum]]" derives from the structure of this tomb. It was a temple-like structure decorated with reliefs and statuary on a massive base. Today only the foundations and a few pieces of sculpture remain.
 
===Petronium===
[[File:Bodrum castle 3.JPG|thumb|350px|The [[Bodrum Castle|Castle of St. Peter]] was built by the [[Knights Hospitaller]].]]
Crusader Knights arrived in 1402 and used the remains of the Mausoleum as a quarry to build the still impressively standing [[Bodrum Castle]] (''Castle of Saint Peter''), which is a well-preserved example of the late Crusader architecture in the east Mediterranean. The [[Knights Hospitaller]] (''Knights of St. John'') were given permission to build it by the Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed I]], after [[Tamerlane]] had destroyed their previous fortress located in [[?zmir]]'s inner bay. The castle and its town became known as Petronium, whence the modern name Bodrum derives.

In 1522, [[Suleiman I|Suleiman the Magnificent]] [[Siege of Rhodes (1522)|conquered the base of the Crusader knights]] on the island of [[Rhodes]], who then relocated first briefly to [[Sicily]] and later permanently to [[Malta]], leaving the Castle of Saint Peter and Bodrum to the [[Ottoman Empire]].

===20th century===
[[File:Bodrummarina.jpg|thumb|Marina of Bodrum]]

Bodrum was a quiet town of fishermen and sponge divers until the mid-20th century; although, as Mansur points out, the presence of a large community of bilingual [[Cretan Turks]], coupled with the conditions of free trade and access with the islands of the Southern [[Dodecanese]] until 1935 saved it from utter provincialism.<ref>{{cite book | title = Bodrum ISBN 90-04-03424-2|author= Fatma Mansur|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]| year= 1972}}</ref> The fact that traditional agriculture was not a very rewarding activity in the rather dry peninsula also prevented the formation of a class of large landowners. Bodrum has no notable history of political or religious extremism either. A first nucleus of intellectuals started to form after the 1950s around the writer [[Cevat ?akir Kabaa?açl?]], who had first come here in exile two decades before and was charmed by the town to the point of adopting the [[pen name]] ''Halikarnas Bal?kç?s?'' ('The Fisherman of Halicarnassus').<ref>''Bodream'', [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]], Anagramme Ed., 2010, pp.62-66</ref>

==Demographics==
The population for the town of Bodrum was 35,795 in the 2012 census. The surrounding towns & villages had an additional 100,522, for a total for the province of 136,317.<ref>[http://rapor.tuik.gov.tr/reports/rwservlet?adnksdb2&ENVID=adnksdb2Env&report=wa_turkiye_ilce_koy_sehir.RDF&p_il1=48&p_kod=1&p_yil=2012&p_dil=2&desformat=html Population of province/district centers and towns/villages by districts - 2012]/</ref>

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], the term '''Markov property''' refers to the [[memoryless]] property of a [[stochastic process]]. It is named after the [[Russia]]n [[mathematician]]  [[Andrey Markov]].<ref>Markov, A. A. (1954). ''Theory of Algorithms''. [Translated by Jacques J. Schorr-Kon and PST staff] Imprint Moscow, Academy of Sciences of the USSR, 1954 [Jerusalem, Israel Program for Scientific Translations, 1961; available from Office of Technical Services, [[United States Department of Commerce]]]  Added t.p. in Russian Translation of Works of the Mathematical Institute, Academy of Sciences of the USSR, v. 42.

A stochastic process has the Markov property if the [[conditional probability distribution]] of future states of the process (conditional on both past and present values) depends only upon the present state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. A process with this property is called a ''[[Markov process]]''. The term '''strong Markov property''' is similar to the Markov property, except that the meaning of "present" is defined in terms of a random variable known as a [[stopping time]]. Both the terms "Markov property" and "strong Markov property" have been used in connection with a particular "memoryless" property of the [[exponential distribution#Memorylessness|exponential distribution]].<ref>[[William Feller|Feller, W.]] (1971) ''Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications, Vol II'' (2nd edition),Wiley.  ISBN 0-471-25709-5 (pages 9 and 20)</ref>

The term '''Markov assumption''' is used to describe a model where the Markov property is assumed to hold, such as a [[hidden Markov model]].

A [[Markov random field]]<ref>Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'' OUP. ISBN 0-19-850994-4</ref> extends this property to two or more dimensions or to random variables defined for an interconnected network of items. An example of a model for such a field is the [[Ising model]].

A discrete-time stochastic process satisfying the Markov property is known as a [[Markov chain]].

==Introduction==

A stochastic process has the Markov property if the [[conditional probability distribution]] of future states of the process (conditional on both past and present values) depends only upon the present state; that is, given the present, the future does not depend on the past. A process with this property is said to be '''Markovian''' or a '''[[Markov process]]'''. The most famous Markov process is a [[Markov chain]]. [[Brownian motion]] is another well-known Markov process.

==History==

{{Main|Markov chain#History}}

==Definition==

Let <math>(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})</math> be a [[probability space]] with a [[Filtration (mathematics)#Measure theory|filtration]] <math>(\mathcal{F}_s,\ s \in I)</math>, for some ([[totally ordered]]) index set <math>I</math>; and let <math>(S,\mathcal{S})</math> be a [[measurable space]]. A <math>(S,\mathcal{S})</math>-valued stochastic process <math>X=(X_t,\ t\in I)</math> adapted to the filtration is said to possess the ''Markov property'' if, for each <math>A \in \mathcal{S}</math>  and each <math>s,t\in I</math> with <math>s<t</math>,

:<math>\mathbb{P}(X_t \in A |\mathcal{F}_s) = \mathbb{P}(X_t \in A| X_s).</math><ref>Durrett, Rick. ''Probability: Theory and Examples''. Fourth Edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010.</ref>

In the case where <math>S</math> is a discrete set with the [[Sigma-algebra#Examples|discrete sigma algebra]] and <math>I = \mathbb{N}</math>, this can be reformulated as follows:

:<math>\mathbb{P}(X_n=x_n|X_{n-1}=x_{n-1}, \dots, X_0=x_0)=\mathbb{P}(X_n=x_n|X_{n-1}=x_{n-1})</math>.

==Alternative formulations==

Alternatively, the Markov property can be formulated as follows.

:<math>\mathbb{E}[f(X_t)|\mathcal{F}_s]=\mathbb{E}[f(X_t)|\sigma(X_s)]</math>

for all <math>t\geq s\geq 0</math> and <math>f:S\rightarrow \mathbb{R}</math> bounded and measurable.

==Strong Markov property==

Let <math>\mathcal{F}_{\tau^+}=\{A \in \mathcal{F}: \{\tau=t\} \cap A \in \mathcal{F}_{t+} ,\, \forall t \geq 0\}</math>.

Suppose that <math>X=(X_t:t\geq 0)</math> is a [[stochastic process]] on a [[probability space]] <math>(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})</math> with natural [[filtration (mathematics)|filtration]] <math>\{\mathcal{F}_t\}_{t\geq 0}</math>. Then <math>X</math> is said to have the strong Markov property if, for each [[stopping time]] <math>\tau</math>, conditioned on the event <math>\{\tau < \infty\}</math>, we have that for each <math>t\ge 0</math>, <math>X_{\tau + t}</math> is independent of <math>\mathcal{F}_{\tau^+}</math> given <math>X_\tau</math>.

The strong Markov property implies the ordinary Markov property, since by taking the stopping time <math>\tau=t</math>, the ordinary Markov property can be deduced.

<!-- Hide for now  ... name '''Markov-type property''' seems doubtful
==Markov Type Property==
A stochastic process has a '''Markov-type property''' if the process's [[random variable]]s determine a set of probabilities can be factored in a way that yields the '''Markov property'''. Useful in applied research, members of such classes{{Clarify|October 2009|date=October 2009}} defined by their mathematics or area of application{{Clarify|October 2009|date=October 2009}} are referred to as '''[[Markov random field]]s'''., and occur in many situations. The [[Ising model]] is a prototypical example. -->

==Examples==
Assume that an urn contains two red balls and one green ball. One ball was drawn yesterday, one ball was drawn today, and the final ball will be drawn tomorrow. All of the draws are "without replacement".

Suppose you know that today's ball was red, but you have no information about yesterday's ball. The chance that tomorrow's ball will be red is 1/2. That's because the only two remaining outcomes for this random experiment are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! align="center" | Day !! align="center" | Outcome 1 !! align="center" | Outcome 2
|-
| align="center" | Yesterday || align="center" | Red || align="center" | Green
|-
| align="center" | Today || align="center" | Red || align="center" | Red
|-
| align="center"| Tomorrow || align="center" | Green || align="center" | Red

On the other hand, if you know that both today and yesterday's balls were red, then you are guaranteed to get a green ball tomorrow.

This discrepancy shows that the probability distribution for tomorrow's color depends not only on the present value, but is also affected by information about the past. This stochastic process of observed colors doesn't have the Markov property. Using the same experiment above, if sampling "without replacement" is changed to sampling "with replacement," the process of observed colors will have the Markov property.<ref>http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/89394/example-of-a-stochastic-process-which-does-not-have-the-markov-property</ref>

An application of the Markov property in a generalized form is in [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] computations in the context of [[Bayesian statistics]].

A '''tragic hero''' (or '''tragic heroine''', if a woman) is the [[protagonist]] of a [[tragedy]].
==Aristotle's tragic hero==
[[Aristotle]] shared his view of what makes a tragic hero in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. Aristotle suggests that a hero of a tragedy must evoke in the audience a sense of pity or fear, saying, “the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."<ref>S.H. Butcher, The Poetics of Aristotle, (1902), pp. 45-47</ref> In other words, the focus of the tragic hero should not be in the loss of his prosperity. He establishes the concept that the emotion of pity stems not from a person becoming better but when a person receives undeserved misfortune and fear comes when the misfortune befalls a man like us. This is why Aristotle points out the simple fact that, “The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.” According to Aristotle a tragic hero ought to be a man whose misfortune comes to him, not through vice or depravity but by some error of judgment. For example King [[Oedipus]] kills his father from impulse and marries his mother out of ignorance.

Aristotle contests that the tragic hero has to be a man “who is not eminently good and just, whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error or frailty.” He is not making the hero entirely good in which he can do no wrong but rather has the hero committing an injury or a great wrong leading to his misfortune. Aristotle is not contradicting himself saying that the hero has to be virtuous and yet not eminently good. Being eminently good is a moral specification to the fact that he is virtuous.<ref>Charles H. Reeves, The Aristotelian Concept of The Tragic Hero, Vol. 73, No. 2 (1952), Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/291812 pp. 172-188</ref> He still has to be - to some degree - good.  Aristotle adds another qualification to that of being virtuous but not entirely good when he says, “He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous.” He goes on to give examples such as [[Oedipus]] and [[Thyestes]].”

'''Thomas Johnson''' (November 4, 1732 – October 26, 1819) was an [[United States|American]] jurist with a distinguished political career. He was the [[List of Governors of Maryland|first]] [[Governor of Maryland]], a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] and an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]].

==Background==
Johnson was born in [[Calvert County, Maryland]], on November 4, 1732<!-- probably Gregorian Calendar, but found no reliable source giving Oct 24 or Nov 15 — all sources agree on Nov 4 --> to Thomas and Dorcas Sedgwick Johnson. His grandfather, also named Thomas, was a lawyer in [[London]] who had emigrated to Maryland sometime before 1700. He was the fourth of ten children, some of whom also had large families. His niece (daughter of his brother Joshua ), [[Louisa Adams|Louisa Johnson]], married [[John Quincy Adams]].

The family, including Thomas, were educated at home. As a young man he was attracted to the law, studied it, and was admitted to the Maryland bar in 1753. By 1760, he had moved his practice to [[Frederick County, Maryland]], and in 1761 he was elected to the provincial assembly for the first time. Johnson married Ann Jennings, the daughter of a judge from [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] on February 16, 1766.

The couple had eight children: Thomas Jennings, Ann Jennings, Rebecca (who died in infancy), Elizabeth, Rebecca Jennings, James, Joshua, and Dorcas.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Revolutionary years==
In 1774 and 1775 the Maryland assembly sent him as a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]]. In the Congress he was firmly in the camp of those who favored separation from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. In November 1775, Congress created a [[Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War#Committee of (Secret) Correspondence|Committee of [Secret] Correspondence]] that was to seek foreign support for the war. Thomas Johnson, along with [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Benjamin Harrison V]] were initially named to the committee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/ar/91718.htm |title=Secret Committee of Correspondence/Committee for Foreign Affairs, 1775–1777 |publisher=U. S. Department of State |accessdate=2007-11-21}}</ref>

He then returned to Maryland and continued his work in the state's Assembly when the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] was signed. In 1775 he drafted the declaration of rights adopted by the Maryland assembly and later included as the first part of the [[Maryland Constitution of 1776|state's first constitution]], which was adopted for Maryland by the state's constitutional convention at Annapolis in 1776. He also served as brigadier general in the [[Maryland Military Department|Maryland militia]]. Thomas Johnson and his brothers supported the revolution by manufacturing ammunition and possibly cannon.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>
Their former factory, [[Catoctin Furnace]], is now part of a state park near [[Camp David]], just north of [[Frederick, Maryland]].

The state legislature elected Johnson as the new state's first Governor in 1777. He served in that capacity until 1779. In the 1780s he held a number of judicial posts in Maryland, as well as served in the assembly in 1780, 1786, and 1787. He pushed a bill through the Maryland Assembly naming commissioners to meet with Virginia's commissioners to "…frame such liberal and equitable regulations concerning [the Potomac] river as may be mutually advantageous to the two states and that they make report thereon to the General assembly." While not a commissioner himself,<ref>John Clifford, [http://www.nps.gov/thst/historyculture/upload/Mount%20Vernon%20Conference-2.doc Mount Vernon Conference]</ref> the [[Mount Vernon Conference|resulting conference]] agreed to regulate and settle the jurisdiction and navigation on their mutual border, and served as a predecessor to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] of 1787.<ref>[http://www.virginiaplaces.org/pdf/mdvaapp1.pdf Compact of 1785 (1786 Md. Laws c. 1)]</ref> Johnson attended the Maryland Convention in 1788, where he successfully urged the state's ratification of the [[United States Constitution]].

== Federal years ==
In September 1789, [[Presidency of George Washington|President George Washington]] nominated Johnson to be the first federal judge for the District of Maryland, but he declined the appointment. In 1790 and 1791, Johnson was the senior justice in the Maryland General Court system. In January 1791, President Washington appointed Johnson, with [[David Stuart (Virginia politician)|David Stuart]] and [[Daniel Carroll]], to the commission that would lay out the federal capital in accordance with the [[Residence Act]] of 1790. In September 1791 the commissioners named the federal city "The City of Washington" and the federal district "The Territory of [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]".<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=5Q81AAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#PPR1,M1 Crew, Harvey W., Webb, William Bensing, Wooldridge, John (1892), ''Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.C.'', United Brethren Publishing House, Dayton, Ohio], [http://books.google.com/books?id=5Q81AAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#PPA87,M1 Chapter IV. "Permanent Capital Site Selected", pp. 87–88, 101] ''in'' [http://books.google.com/books Google Books]</ref>

On August 5, 1791, Johnson received a [[recess appointment]] from Washington to the seat on the U.S. Supreme Court that became available after [[John Rutledge]] resigned. Formally nominated on October 31, 1791, Johnson was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on November 7, 1791. Though he received his commission that day, he was not sworn in until August 6, 1792.<ref name=scotus>{{cite web|url={{SCOTUS URL|about/members.pdf}} |title=Members of the Supreme Court from the Supreme Court of the United States|format=PDF|work=Official website of the Supreme Court of the United States|accessdate=July 21, 2013}}</ref> Johnson was the author of the Court's first written opinion, ''[[Georgia v. Brailsford (1792)|Georgia v. Brailsford]]'', in 1792. He served on the court until January 16, 1793, when he resigned, citing his poor health and the difficulties of circuit-riding. He thus had the shortest tenure (to date) on the Court.<ref>{{cite web
   |url=http://www.oyez.org/justices/thomas_johnson/ 
   |title=Oyez: Thomas Johnson
   |publisher=Oyez: U. S. Supreme Court Media
}}</ref>

Johnson suffered very poor health for many years, and cited it in declining Washington's 1795 offer to nominate him for [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], as [[Thomas Jefferson]] had recommended. He also managed to deliver a eulogy for his friend George Washington at a birthday memorial service on February 22, 1800. Furthermore, on February 28, 1801, President [[John Adams]] named Johnson chief judge for the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]] when first constituting that body.

==Later years, death and legacy==
His daughter Ann had married John Colin Grahame in 1788, and in his later years Johnson lived with them in a home they had built in [[Frederick, Maryland]]. The home, called [[Rose Hill Manor]], is now a county park and open to the public. [[Governor Thomas Johnson High School]]  is on half of the Rose Hill property.

He died at Rose Hill on October 26, 1819, and was originally buried in All Saints churchyard. His remains were removed and re-interred at [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Frederick)|Mount Olivet Cemetery]] 515 South Market Street in Frederick.<ref>{{Find a Grave|2197}}.</ref><ref>{{Wayback |date=20050903032026 |url=http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c20_e.html |title=Christensen, George A.

Johnson was one of the first investors in the [[Illinois-Wabash Company]], which acquired a vast swath of land in Illinois directly from several Indian tribes. Soon after his death in 1819 his son Joshua Johnson and grandson Thomas Graham sued [[William M'Intosh (fur trader)|William M'Intosh]] in the landmark Supreme Court case [[Johnson v. M'Intosh]]. The case, which remains one of the most important [[property (law)|property]] decisions in American history, determined that only the federal government could acquire Indian land, so Johnson's descendants did not have [[good title]] to the property.<ref>Eric Kades, The Dark Side of Efficiency: Johnson v. M'Intosh and the Expropriation of American Indian Lands, 148 U. Penn. L. Rev. 1065 (2000)</ref>

Other schools named after Thomas Johnson include Governor Thomas Johnson Middle School in Frederick, Maryland, Thomas Johnson Middle School in [[Lanham, Maryland]] and Thomas Johnson Elementary School in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].

In 1978, the [[Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge]] was opened to traffic. The bridge crosses the [[Patuxent River]] and connects [[Calvert County, Maryland]] with [[St. Mary's County, Maryland]].

As commander of the ''[[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]'', more commonly referred to as the ''Makhnovshchina'', Makhno led a [[guerrilla]] campaign during the [[Russian Civil War]].<ref>''Makhnovshchina'' can be loosely translated as "Makhno movement".  The term encompasses not only the army but the whole of the movement's activities and overall spirit.  The suffix -''shchina'' can be employed in a slightly derogatory manner, but this is not the intention in this case given that the movement's adherents including Makhno himself frequently used the term to describe themselves.</ref>  Makhno fought all factions that sought to impose any external authority over southern Ukraine, battling in succession the [[Ukrainian National Republic|Ukrainian Nationalists]], the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Imperial German and Austro-Hungarian occupation]], the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate Republic]], the [[Volunteer Army|White Army]], the [[Red Army]], and other smaller forces led by Ukrainian [[ataman]]s. Makhno and his movement repeatedly attempted to reorganize life in the Gulai-Polye region along anarchist-communist lines, however, the disruptions of the civil war precluded any long term [[social experiment]]s. Although Makhno considered the [[Bolsheviks]] a threat to the development of an anarchist [[Free Territory]] within Ukraine, he twice entered into military alliances with them to defeat the White Army. In the aftermath of the White Army's final defeat in November 1920, the Bolsheviks initiated a military campaign against Makhno, which concluded with his escape across the Romanian border in August 1921. After a series of imprisonments and escapes, Makhno finally settled in Paris with his wife Galina and daughter Yelena. In exile Makhno wrote three volumes of memoirs.<ref>Nestor Makhno, [1927] ''The Russian Revolution in Ukraine'', Edmonton: Black Cat Press, 2007; [1936] ''Under the Blows of the Counterrevolution'', Edmonton: Black Cat Press, 2009; [1937] ''The Ukrainian Revolution'', Edmonton: Black Cat Press, 2011.</ref> Makhno died in exile at the age of 45 from tuberculosis-related causes.

==Early life==
[[File:NestorMakhno.jpeg|thumb|left|Nestor Makhno in 1909]]
Nestor Makhno was born into a poor peasant family in [[Huliaipole]], [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]] in the [[Novorossiya]] region of the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Zaporizhia Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]).<ref name="AP112" /><ref name="NMAC17">{{cite book

== Organizing the peasants' movement ==
{{Anarcho-communism sidebar |People}}
[[File:Makhno en 1918.JPG|left|thumb|Makhno in 1918]]
After liberation from prison, Makhno organized a peasants' union.<ref name="RN173"/> It gave him a "[[Robin Hood]]" image and he [[expropriate]]d large estates from landowners and distributed the land among the peasants.<ref name="RN173"/>

In March 1918 the new [[Bolshevik]] government in Russia signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] concluding peace with the [[Central Powers]], but ceding large amounts of territory, including Ukraine. As the [[Central Rada]] of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR) proved unable to maintain order, a coup by former [[Tsarist]] general [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]] in April 1918 resulted in the establishment of the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]]. Already dissatisfied by the UNR's failure to resolve the question of land ownership, much of the peasantry refused to support a conservative government administered by former imperial officials and supported by the Austro-Hungarian and German occupiers.<ref>Magocsi 1996, p 499.</ref>  Peasant bands under various self-appointed ''[[otaman]]y'' which had been counted on the rolls of the UNR's army now attacked the Germans, later going over to the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directory]] in summer 1918 or to the Bolsheviks in late 1918–19, or home to protect local interests, in many cases changing allegiances, plundering so-called class enemies, and venting age-old resentments.<ref name="ReferenceA">Magocsi 1996, p 498–9, Subtelny 1988, p 360.</ref> They finally dominated the countryside in mid-1919; the largest portion would follow either Socialist Revolutionary [[Matviy Hryhoriyiv]] or the anarchist flag of Makhno.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In [[Yekaterinoslav]] province the rebellion soon took on anarchist political overtones. Nestor Makhno joined an anarchist group (headed by sailor-deserter [[Fedir Shchus]]) and eventually became its commander. Due in part to the impressive personality and charisma of Makhno, all Ukrainian anarchist detachments and peasant guerrilla bands in the region subsequently became known as ''Makhnovists'' ({{lang-ru|????????}}). These eventually came together in the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] (RIAU), also called the [[Black Guards|Black Army]] (because they fought under the [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[Anarchist symbolism#Black flag|black flag]]). The RIAU battled against the [[White movement|Whites]] ([[counter-revolution]]aries) forces, Ukrainian nationalists, and various independent paramilitary formations that conducted [[Anti-Semitism|anti-semitic]] [[pogrom]]s. The anarchist movement in Ukraine came to be referred to as the ''Black Army'', ''Makhnovism'' or pejoratively ''Makhnovshchina''.

In areas where they drove out opposing armies, villagers (and workers) sought to abolish [[capitalism]] and the state by organizing themselves into village [[Deliberative assembly|assemblies]], [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and free councils. The land and factories were expropriated and put under nominal peasant and worker control by means of self-governing committees; however, town mayors and many officials were drawn directly from the ranks of Makhno's military and political leadership.

==The Makhnovists and formation of the anarchist Black Army==
{{Main|Free Territory (Ukraine)}}
{{Anarchism sidebar |People}}
{{Libertarian socialism |People}}
[[Hetman]] [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]], head of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukrainian State]], (considered by most historians{{Who|date=December 2009}} as a [[Puppet state|puppet]] regime) lost the support of the Central Powers (Germany and Austro-Hungary, which had armed his forces and installed him in power) after the collapse of the German western front. Unpopular among most southern Ukrainians, the Hetman saw his best forces evaporate, and was driven out of [[Kiev]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directory]]. In March 1918, Makhno's forces and allied anarchist and guerrilla groups won victories against German, Austrian, and Ukrainian nationalist (the army of [[Symon Petlura]]) forces, and units of the [[White Movement|White Army]], capturing a lot of German and Austro-Hungarian arms. These victories over much larger enemy forces established Makhno's reputation as a military tactician; he became known as ''Batko'' (‘Father’) to his admirers.<ref name="RN173"/>

At this point, the emphasis on military campaigns that Makhno had adopted in the previous year shifted to political concerns. The first ''Congress of the Confederation of Anarchists Groups''<!-- date and place? -->, under the name of ''[[Nabat]]'' ("the Alarm Drum"), issued five main principles: rejection of all political parties, rejection of all forms of dictatorships (including the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], viewed by Makhnovists and many anarchists of the day as a term synonymous with the dictatorship of the Bolshevik communist party), negation of any concept of a central state, rejection of a so-called "transitional period" necessitating a temporary dictatorship of the proletariat, and self-management of all workers through free local workers' councils (soviets). While the Bolsheviks argued that their concept of dictatorship of the proletariat meant precisely "rule by workers' councils," the Makhnovist platform opposed the "temporary" Bolshevik measure of "party dictatorship."  The ''Nabat'' was by no means a puppet of Mahkno and his supporters, from time to time criticizing the Black Army and its conduct in the war.

In 1918, after recruiting large numbers of Ukrainian peasants, as well as numbers of Jews, anarchists, ''naletchki'', and recruits arriving from other countries, Makhno formed the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]], otherwise known as the Anarchist Black Army. At its formation, the Black Army consisted of about 15,000 armed troops, including infantry and cavalry (both regular and irregular) brigades; artillery detachments were incorporated into each regiment. From November 1918 to June 1919, using the Black Army to secure its hold on power, the Makhnovists attempted to create an anarchist society in Ukraine, administered at the local level by autonomous peasants' and workers' councils.

New relationships and values were generated by this new social paradigm, which led Makhnovists to formalize the policy of free communities as the highest form of [[social justice]]. Education was organized on [[Francisco Ferrer]]'s principles, and the economy was based upon free exchange between rural and urban communities, from crop and cattle to manufactured products, according to the science proposed by [[Peter Kropotkin]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Makhno called the Bolsheviks dictators and opposed the "Cheka [secret police]... and similar compulsory authoritative and disciplinary institutions" and called for "[f]reedom of speech, press, assembly, unions and the like".<ref name="RIAdeclaration">[http://www.ditext.com/arshinov/appendix.html Declaration Of The Revolutionary Insurgent Army Of The Ukraine (Makhnovist)]. Peter Arshinov, [http://www.ditext.com/arshinov/makhno.html History of the Makhnovist Movement (1918-1921), 1923.] Black & Red, 1974</ref> The Bolsheviks, in turn, accused the Makhnovists of imposing a formal government over the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|area they controlled]], and also said that Makhnovists used forced conscription, committed summary executions, and had two military and counter-intelligence forces: the [[Kontrrazvedka]], with punitive functions transferred in 1920 to the
[[Kommissiya Protivmakhnovskikh Del]] (Commission for Anti-Makhnovist Activities).<ref>V. Azarov, ''Konttrazvedka: The Story of the Makhnovist Intelligence Service,'' (Edmonton: Black Cat Press, 2008).</ref>

The Bolsheviks claimed that it would be impossible for a small, agricultural society to organize into an anarchist society so quickly. However, [[Eastern Ukraine]] had a large amount of coal mines, and was one of the most industrialised parts of the [[Russian Empire]].

===Relations between the Makhnovists and Mennonite colonists===
As a revolutionary peasant leader Makhno has been called a "colourful personality"<ref>Yekelchyk 2007, p 80</ref> and his career "legendary".<ref>Subtelny 1988, p 360.</ref>  However, in the view of the German and [[Russian Mennonite|Mennonite]] communities in Ukraine, he was considered as an instigator of military ravages against innocent farmers and an "inhuman monster whose path is literally drenched with blood."<ref>Dietrich Neufeld, ''Russian Dance of Death'', translated by Al Reimer, Winnipeg: [[Hyperion Press]], 1977, pp. 18-19.</ref>  He is consistently referred to as a terrorist or bandit in Mennonite literature. At the age of 11 Makhno began working as an ox drover on the Janzen estate in Silberfeld. Here he began to develop a hatred for the ruling classes. In his memoirs he writes: "At this time I began to experience anger, envy and even hatred towards the landowner [Janzen] and especially towards his children - those young slackers who often strolled past me sleek and healthy, well-dressed, well-groomed and scented; while I was filthy, dressed in rags, barefoot, and reeked of manure from cleaning the calves' barn."<ref>Nestor Makhno, ''The Ukrainian Revolution'', trans. Malcolm Archibald and [[Will Firth]], Edmonton: Black Cat Press, 2011, pp. xvi</ref>  Makhno also worked at the Mennonite owned Kroeger plant in [[Gulyai-Polye]].

Throughout the civil war, Mahkno and his troops raided many German and Mennonite colonies and estates in the [[Katerynoslav Oblast]]. The larger rural landholdings of [[Mennonites]] were prominent targets due to their wealth and proximity to Gulyai-Polye.<ref name="HU508–10">{{cite book

}}</ref>  The Schönfeld colony, located adjacent to the [[Huliaipole]] area, was unique in that it consisted predominantly of Mennonite estate settlements across an expansive area. Mennonite colonies were targeted by Makhno because, as owners of prosperous farms and estates, they were considered ''[[kulak]]s'' - wealthy farmers that exploited the labour of the surrounding, mostly Ukrainian, peasantry. Ukrainians were traditionally hired by wealthy Mennonites as house servants and farmhands.

While prohibited by their religion from serving in the [[Tsar's army]], many Mennonites had assisted the Russian war effort by performing national service in non-fighting roles, notably forestry and medical units. The Mennonites' Germanic background also served to inflame negative sentiment during the period of revolution, as many Makhnovists had families who had suffered under the German-Austro-Hungarian occupation in 1918. Makhno's own brother, Emelian - a disabled war veteran - was murdered and his mother's home burned to the ground by the occupation.<ref>[[Alexandre Skirda]], ''Nestor Makhno-Anarchy's Cossack'', Oakland: [[AK Press]], pp. 55</ref>  The Mennonites themselves, having been stripped of their wealth and property during the revolution, embraced the occupation who promised to reestablish them as landowners. Some Mennonites accompanied punitive detachments against the peasantry, which greatly contributed to the growing bitterness between Mennonites and Ukrainians. In October 1918, [[Austro-Hungarian forces]] and "German colonists" burned down the pro-Makhnovist village of Bolshe-Mikholaivka and murdered many of its inhabitants. Makhno responded with a sustained campaign of retribution against German/Mennonite colonies and estates. At the same time Makhno voiced his opposition to the indiscriminate slaughter of the colonists and established "ground rules" for occupying the colonies.<ref>Nestor Makhno, ''The Ukrainian Revolution'', trans. Malcolm Archibald and Will Firth, Edmonton: Black Cat Press, pp. 107-136</ref>  Throughout 1918 a total of 96 Mennonites were killed in the Schönfeld-Brasol area.<ref name="old.mbconf.ca">Peter Letkemann, "Mennonite Victims of Revolution, Anarchy, Civil War, Disease and Famine, 1917-1923" http://old.mbconf.ca/old/historian/98-06/feature-2.html</ref>  By the winter 1918-1919 most residents of the Schönfeld colony had fled to the relative safety of the Molotschna colony.

While under German occupation, the Mennonites had been encouraged to form self-defence (''[[Selbstschutz]]'') units. Mennonite youth were trained and armed under the supervision of German officers. Breaking with nearly four centuries of [[pacifism]], tacit approval of the ''Selbstschutz'' was given by the Mennonite leadership at the Lichtenau Conference [June 30- July 2, 1918].<ref>J. B. Toews, ed., ''The Mennonites in Russia From 1917 to 1930: Selected Documents'' [[Winnipeg]], MB: Christian Press, pp. 395-448</ref>  Intended exclusively for the defence of the colony, with the arrival of General [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]]'s [[White movement|White]] [[Volunteer Army]] the ''Selbstschutz'' was gradually drawn into offensive operations against Makhno. Later in the civil war some Mennonites also formed ethnic battalions within the White Army. The ''Selbstschutz'' was initially successful in protecting their communities against Makhno's partisans but was overwhelmed once the anarchists aligned themselves with the Red Army, which had entered Ukraine in February 1919.<ref name="nbuv.gov.ua">Lawrence Klippenstein, [www.nbuv.gov.ua/portal/Soc_Gum/Pni/2007/07lktvao.pdf "The Selbstschutz: A Mennonite Army in Ukraine, 1918-1919"],</ref> The Mennonites of the Molotschna colony were under joint Makhnovist-Red occupation until the Whites broke through the southern front in May 1919.

Following Makhno's devastating attack on Denikin's rearguard in September–October 1919, the Mennonite colonies found themselves once more under Makhnovist occupation. The year 1919 saw the greatest number of Mennonites killed - some 827 or 67% of all Mennonite civil war deaths. The great majority of these occurred between October and December. During this period major massacres occurred in Eichenfeld (Yazykovo), Blumenort ([[Molotschna]]), Steinfeld and Ebenfeld (Borozenko) and Münsterberg (Zagradovka) while under the administrative control of the Makhnovists. The [[Chortitza]] colony also suffered a great degree of death and robbery.<ref name="old.mbconf.ca"/> Despite ongoing debate and investigation into Makhno's personal culpability for the massacres, there is currently no evidence he was present at or sanctioned these actions. According to the research of Peter Letkemann 3,336 Russian Mennonites, or three percent of their total population, died between 1914 and 1923.<ref name="old.mbconf.ca"/> Ninety-six percent of these deaths occurred in Ukraine.<ref name="nbuv.gov.ua"/>

=== Allegations of antisemitism ===
Like the [[White army]], the [[Ukrainian National Republic]] and forces loyal to the Bolsheviks, Makhno's forces were accused of conducting [[pogrom]]s against Jews in Ukraine during the civil war, based on the Bolshevik accounts of the war.<ref name="HU506-7">{{cite book

}}</ref>  However, these claims have never been proven. [[Paul Avrich]] writes, "Maknno's alleged anti-Semitism...Charges of Jew-baiting and of anti-Jewish pogroms have come from every quarter, left, right, and center. Without exception, however, they are based on hearsay, rumor, or intentional slander, and remain undocumented and unproved."<ref name="AP112">p. 122</ref>  Avrich notes that a considerable number of Jews took part in the Makhnovist anarchist movement. Some, like Vsevolod Mikhailovich Eikhenbaum, also known as "[[Voline]]",<ref name="Voline, 1947">Voline, ''The Unknown Revolution, 1917-1921'', (1947)</ref><ref name="Arshinov, Peter 1923">Arshinov, Peter, ''History of the Makhnovist Movement (1918-1921),'' (1923)</ref> and [[Baron Aron]] were intellectuals who served on the Cultural-Educational Commission, wrote his manifestos, and edited his journals, but the great majority fought in the ranks of the Anarchist Black Army, either in special detachments of Jewish artillery and infantry, or else within the regular anarchist army brigades alongside peasants and workers of Ukrainian, Russian, and other ethnic origins. Together they formed a significant part of Makhno's anarchist army.<ref name="Voline, 1947"/><ref name="Arshinov, Peter 1923"/>  Significantly, during the Russian civil war, the ''Merkaz'' or ''Central Committee of the Zionist Organization in Russia'' regularly reported on many armed groups committing ''pogroms'' against Jews in Russia, including the Whites, the Russian Ukrainian 'Green' nationalist [[Nikifor Grigoriev]] (later shot by Black Army troops on Makhno's orders) as well as Red Army forces, but did not accuse Makhno or the anarchist Black Army of directing pogroms or other attacks against Russian Jews.<ref>Tcherikover, M. (quoted by Voline), ''The Unknown Revolution'', New York: Free Life Editions (1975), p. 699: The Russian historian M. Tcherikover, himself a Jew, rejected all accusations that Makhno or forces under his direct command engaged in pogroms.</ref> According to Peter Kenez, “He was a self-educated man, committed to the teachings of Bakunin and Kropotkin, and he could not fairly be described as an anti-Semite. Makhno had Jewish comrades and friends; and like [[Symon Petliura]], he issued a proclamation forbidding pogroms.” Kenez goes on to claim that "the anarchist leader could not or did not impose discipline on his soldiers. In the name of ‘class struggle’ his troops with particular enthusiasm robbed Jews of whatever they had.”<ref>''Pogroms: Anti-Jewish Violence in Modern Russian History''. New York: Cambridge UP, 2004.</ref> This would be in the spirit of standards of behaviour which Makhno promoted for his troops, which called for war against "the rich bourgeoisie of all nationalities" be they Russian, Ukrainian or Jewish, as well as his explicit order not to beat or rob "peaceful Jews".<ref>David Footman, "Civil War in Russia". p. 275</ref>

=== National issues ===
While the bulk of Makhno's forces consisted of ethnic [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] peasants, he did not consider himself to be a Ukrainian nationalist, but rather an anarchist. His movement did put out a Ukrainian-language version of their newspaper and his wife Halyna Kuzmenko was a nationally-conscious Ukrainian. In emigration, Makhno came to believe that anarchists would only have a future in Ukraine if they Ukrainianized and he stated that he regretted that he was writing his memoirs in Russian and not in Ukrainian.<ref>Frank E. Sysyn, "Nestor Makhno and the Ukrainian Revolution," in Taras Hunczak, ed. ''The Ukraine 1917-1921: A Study in Revolution'' (Cambridge, Ma., 1977),pp.271-304</ref> Makhno viewed the revolution as an opportunity for ordinary Russians - particularly rural peasants  - to rid themselves of the overweening power of the central state through self-governing and autonomous peasant committees, protected by a people's army dedicated to anarchist principles of self-rule.

===White and Red Army attacks===
[[File:???????? ????????????? ??????? ?. ??????? ? ??????? ?. ?????.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Red Army commander Pavel Dybenko and Nestor Makhno, 1919]]
Bolshevik hostility to Makhno and his anarchist army increased after the defection of 40,000 [[Red Army]] troops in [[Crimea]] to the Black Army in July 1918. The ''Nabat'' confederation was banned and the Third Congress (specifically [[Pavel Dybenko]]) declared the "Makhnovschina" (Ukrainian anarchists) outlaws and counter-revolutionaries. In response, the Anarchist Congress publicly questioned, "[M]ight laws exist as made by few persons so-called revolutionaries, allowing these to declare the outlawing of an entire people which is more revolutionary than them?" (Archinoff, The Makhnovist Movement). Relying largely on a September 1920 report from V. Ivanov, a Bolshevik delegate to Makhno's camp, Moscow justified its hostility to Makhno and the anarchists by claiming that:
# Makhno's anarchist army and state had no free elections to the general command staff, with all commanders up to company commander appointed by Makhno and the Anarchist Revolutionary War Council;
# Makhno had refused to provide food for Soviet railwaymen and telegraph operators (an attempt to capitalize on Makhno's view of railroads as capitalist frivolities);
# there was a ‘special section’ in the Anarchist Revolutionary Military Council constitution that dealt with disobedience and desertion "secretly and without mercy” (this objection was made in spite of the fact that ''Special Punitive Brigades'' of the Bolshevist Red Army had already been shooting deserters and members of their families since 1918);
# that Makhno's forces had raided Red Army convoys for supplies, and had failed to pay for an armored car seized from Briansk;
# that the ''Nabat'' was responsible for [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks|deadly acts of terrorism]] in Russian cities (a reference to attempts on the lives of Bolshevik officials by independent anarchists and other dissident leftist groups unrelated to either Makhno or the ''Nabat'').
The Bolshevik press was not only silent on the subject of Moscow's continued refusal to send arms to the Black Army, but also failed to credit the Ukrainian anarchists' continued willingness to ship food supplies to the hungry urban residents of Bolshevik-held cities.

[[Vladimir Lenin]] soon sent [[Lev Kamenev]] to Ukraine, who conducted a cordial interview with Makhno. After Kamenev's departure, Makhno claimed to have intercepted two Bolshevik messages, the first an order to the Red Army to attack the Makhnovists, the second ordering Makhno's assassination. Soon after the Fourth Congress, Trotsky sent an order to arrest every ''Nabat'' congress member. Pursued by White Army forces, Makhno and the Black Army responded by withdrawing further into the interior of Ukraine. In 1919, the Black Army suddenly turned eastwards in a full-scale offensive, surprising General Denikin's White forces and causing them to fall back. Within two weeks, Makhno and the Black Army had recaptured all of the southern Ukraine.

When nearly half<ref>{{Wayback |date=20091027112236 |url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Congress/1346/MAKHNO1.htm |title=The Makhnovist Movement }}</ref> of Makhno's troops were struck by a typhus epidemic, Trotsky resumed hostilities; the [[Cheka]] sent two agents to assassinate Makhno in 1920, but were captured and after confessing, were executed. All through February 1920 the [[Free Territory]] - [[Makhnovist]] region - was inundated with Red troops, including the 42nd Rifle Division and the [[Latvian Riflemen|Latvian]] & [[Estonian Red Riflemen|Estonian]] Division – in total at least 20,000 soldiers.<ref>[[V. N. Litvinov]], An Unsolved Mystery - The "Diary of Makhno's Wife".</ref> [[Viktor Belash]] noted that even in the worst time for the revolutionary army, namely at the beginning of 1920, "In the majority of cases rank-and-file [[Red Army]] soldiers were set free". Of course Belash, as a colleague of Makhno's, was likely to idealize the punishment policies of the Batko. However, the facts bear witness that Makhno really did release "in all four directions" captured Red Army soldiers. This is what happened at the beginning of February 1920, when the insurgents disarmed the 10,000-strong Estonian Division in [[Huliaipole]].<ref>[[A. Buysky]], "The Red Army on the Internal Front", Gosizdat (1927), p. 52.</ref> To this it must be added that the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine included a choir of Estonian musicians.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1920/military/ch73.htm How Is Makhno’s Troop Organised?]</ref> The problem was further compounded by the alienation of the [[Estonians]] by [[Anton Denikin]]'s inflexible Russian [[chauvinism]] and their refusal to fight with [[Nikolai Yudenich]].<ref>[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-866753/Why-did-the-Bolsheviks-win.html Why did the Bolsheviks win the Russian Civil War? [[Peter Anderson (historian)|Peter Anderson]] compares the tactics and resources of the two sides.]</ref>

There was a new truce between Makhnovist forces and the Red Army in October 1920 in the face of a new advance by [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|Wrangel]]'s White army. While Makhno and the anarchists were willing to assist in ejecting Wrangel and White Army troops from southern Ukraine and [[Crimea]], they distrusted the Bolshevist government in Moscow and its motives. However, after the Bolshevik government agreed to a pardon of all anarchist prisoners throughout Russia, a formal treaty of alliance was signed.

By late 1920, Makhno had successfully halted General Wrangel's White Army advance into Ukraine from the southwest, capturing 4,000 prisoners and stores of munitions, and preventing the White Army from gaining control of the all-important Ukrainian grain harvest. Eventually, after shifting forces from the Polish-Soviet campaign, [[Red Army]] units also participated in the southern campaign that pursued Wrangel and the remainder of his forces down the Crimean peninsula. To the end, Makhno and the anarchists maintained their main political structures, refusing demands to join the Red Army, to hold Bolshevik-supervised elections, or accept Bolshevik-appointed political commissars.<ref>[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/Makhno/MakhnoFromBleed.htm NESTOR MAKHNO Ukrainian anarchist general, fought both Reds & Whites (tyranny left to right).]</ref> The Red Army temporarily accepted these conditions, but within a few days ceased to provide the Makhnovists with basic supplies, such as cereals and coal.

When General Wrangel's White Army forces were decisively defeated in November 1920, the Communists immediately turned on Makhno and the anarchists once again. After refusing a direct order by the Bolshevik government to disband his anarchist army, Makhno intercepted three messages from Lenin to [[Christian Rakovsky]], the head of the Bolshevik Ukrainian Soviet based in Kharkiv. Lenin's orders were to arrest all members of Makhno's organization and to try them as common criminals. On November 26, 1920, less than two weeks after assisting Red Army forces to defeat Wrangel, Makhno's headquarters staff and many of his subordinate commanders were arrested at a Red Army planning conference to which they had been invited by Moscow, and executed. Makhno escaped, but was soon forced into retreat as the full weight of the Red Army and the Cheka's ''Special Punitive Brigades'' was brought to bear against not only the Makhnovists, but all anarchists, even their admirers and sympathizers.<ref>Voline, ''The Unknown Revolution'', pp. 693-697: Anyone in Ukraine who professed anarchist sympathies was marked for retribution. Voline recounts the example of M. Bogush, a Russian-born anarchist who had emigrated to America. He returned to Russia in 1921 after being expelled from the United States. Having heard a great deal about Makhno and the Ukrainian anarchists, he left Kharkiv to see Makhno's birthplace at [[Huliaipole]]. After only a few hours, he returned to Kharkiv, where he was arrested by the order of the Cheka, and was shot in March 1921.</ref>

== Exile ==
{{Platformism sidebar |people}}
[[File:Makhno 1925.jpg|left|thumb|Nestor Makhno circa 1925]]
In August 1921, an exhausted Makhno was finally driven by [[Mikhail Frunze]]'s Ukrainian Red forces into exile with the remainder of his anarchist army, fleeing to [[Romania]], then [[Poland]], [[Danzig]], [[Berlin]] and finally to [[Paris]]. In 1926, he joined other [[Anarchism in France|Russian exiles in Paris]] as part of the Group of Russian Anarchists Abroad (?????? ??????? ?????????? ??????????) who produced the monthly journal ''[[Dielo Truda]]'' (???? ?????, The Cause of Labour). Makhno co-wrote and co-published the ''Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists'' (often referred to as the ''Organizational Platform of the [[Libertarian Communist]]s''), which put forward ideas on how anarchists should organize, based on the experiences of revolutionary Ukraine and the defeat by the Bolsheviks. The document was initially rejected by many anarchists, but today has a wide following. It remains controversial to this day, continuing to inspire some anarchists (notably the [[platformism]] tendency) because of the clarity and functionality of the structures it proposes, while drawing criticism from others (including, at the time of publication, Voline and [[Errico Malatesta|Malatesta]]) who viewed its implications as too rigid and hierarchical.

At the end of his life Makhno lived in Paris and worked as a [[carpenter]] and stage-hand at the Paris Opera, at film-studios, and at the [[Renault]] factory. He died in Paris on July 6, 1934, from [[tuberculosis]]. He was cremated three days after his death, with five hundred people attending his funeral at the [[cimetière du Père-Lachaise]] in Paris. Makhno's widow and his daughter Yelena, were deported to Germany for forced labor during [[World War II]]. After the end of the war they were arrested by the [[NKVD]]. They were taken to [[Kiev]] for trial in 1946 and sentenced to eight years of hard labor. They lived in [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] after their release in 1953.

==Personal life==
In 1919, Nestor Makhno married Agafya (aka Halyna) Kuzmenko, a former elementary schoolteacher (1892–1978), who became his aide. They had one daughter, Yelena. Halyna Kuzmenko personally carried out a death sentence of ataman [[Nikifor Grigoriev]], a subordinate commander who committed a series of anti-semitic [[pogrom]]s (according to other accounts, Grigoriev was killed by Chubenko, a member of Makhno's staff or Makhno himself).

Two of Makhno's brothers were his active supporters and aides before being captured in battle by the German occupation forces and executed by [[firing squad]].

According to Paul Avrich, Makhno was a thoroughgoing anarchist and down-to-earth peasant.<ref name="AP112"/> He rejected [[metaphysics|metaphysical systems]] and abstract social theorizing.<ref name="AP112"/>

Voline, one of his biggest supporters who was active for several months in the movement, reports that Makhno and his associates engaged in sexual mistreatment of women: "Makhno and of many of his intimates &ndash; both commanders and others... let themselves indulge in shameful and even odious activities, going as far as orgies in which certain women were forced to participate."<ref>[http://www.ditext.com/voline/687.html Voline, The Unknown Revolution, 1917-1921, part II chapter 7]</ref> However, Voline's allegations against Makhno in regards to sexual violations of women has been disputed by some on the grounds that the allegations are unsubstantiated, do not stand up to eyewitness accounts of the punishment meted out to rapists by the Makhnovists, and were originally made by Voline in his book ''The Unknown Revolution'' which was first published in 1947, long after Makhno's death and following a bitter falling-out between Makhno and Voline.<ref>A. Skirda in ''Nestor Makhno—Anarchy's Cossack: The Struggle for Free Soviets in the Ukraine 1917–1921'', Pages 305 -306</ref>

Makhno was also accused of [[alcoholism]]. Voline wrote that "[Makhno's] greatest fault was certainly the abuse of alcohol...Under [its influence], Makhno became irresponsible in his actions; he lost control of himself."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Makhno Myth|url=http://www.isreview.org/issues/53/makhno.shtml|publisher=[[International Socialist Review (1997)|International Socialist Review]]}}</ref> This charge by Voline, like the aforementioned accusations, was not made until years after Makhno's death. [[Alexandre Skirda]] notes that Bulgarian comrades who knew him throughout his life categorically deny this charge.<ref name="skirda">{{cite book|last=Skirda|first=Alexandre|authorlink=Alexandre Skirda|title=Nestor Makhno: Anarchy's Cossack|publisher=[[AK Press]]|year=2004|page=302|ISBN=1-902593-68-5}}</ref> Skirda further notes that he was unable to unearth any first-hand evidence of Makhno's alcoholism.<ref name="skirda"/>

==Biography==

===Early life===
Case, born in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], is the daughter of Diana Mary Dubbs and James Bamford Case.<ref name=Shaddy-familytree>{{cite web|title=Neko Richelle CASE (b. 8 Sep 1970)|url=http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/s/h/a/Robert-E-Shaddy-Sutherlin/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0126.html|work=Robert E Shaddy Family History|accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Case's paternal family surname was originally [[Shevchenko]].<ref name=EW-Amazing>{{cite journal|last=Berick|first=Michael|title=Department of Amazing Coincidences: Neko's Gripping Tale|journal=Entertainment Weekly|date=February 7, 2005|issue=806|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1024590,00.html|accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref>

Case's father, a [[Vietnam]] vet serving in the [[United States Air Force]]<ref name=Furious-Thrice>{{cite web|last=Matos|first=Michaelangelo|title=Neko Case: Thrice All American|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/nekocase.html|work=Perfect Sound Forever|accessdate=November 7, 2013|format=Online music magazine}}</ref> was based in Virginia. Her parents, teenagers when they had her, were of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] ancestry.<ref name=ExclaimTimeline /> Her parents divorced when Case began school.<ref name=ExclaimTimeline />

Case had a nomadic childhood with her mother and stepfather, an archaeologist. She lived in Western Massachusetts, Vermont, Oregon and Washington.<ref name=ExclaimTimeline /> Her family traveled around while she was young before settling in [[Tacoma, Washington]], the city she considers her hometown. She now lives in Vermont.

Case left home at 15. At 18 years of age, Case was living in Tacoma, becoming a drummer for Northwest area punk bands, the Del Logs and the Propanes. Case worked at a Tacoma punk club, the Community World Theater.

She attended the [[Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design]] in Vancouver, graduating with a BFA in 1998.<ref name=Furious-Thrice />

=== Music career ===

==== Vancouver ====
In 1994, Case moved to [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, to attend the [[Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design]]. While attending school she played drums in several local bands, including the Del Logs, the Propanes, the Weasels, [[Cub (band)|Cub]] (which featured [[I Am Spoonbender]]'s Robynn Iwata), and [[Maow]]. All of these bands were local [[Punk rock|punk]] groups except for Cub and The Weasels, which Case described as a "[[country music]] [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]]".{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

"A lot of women wanted to play music because they were inspired, because it was an incredibly good time for music in the Northwest. There was a lot of clubs, a lot of bands, a lot of people coming through, a lot of all-ages stuff—it was a very exciting time to live there."<ref name=Furious-Thrice />

In 1998, Case graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree, which meant the loss of her student [[visa (document)|visa]] eligibility. She left Canada for [[Seattle, Washington]]. Before leaving, Case recorded vocals for a few songs that ended up on ''[[Mass Romantic]]'', [[The New Pornographers]]' first album. Her lead vocals on songs like "Letter from an Occupant" are straightforward, full-volume [[power-pop]] performances, entirely shedding any country elements. Released on November 28, 2000, ''Mass Romantic'' became a surprise success. Although the band was originally conceived as a side project for its members, The New Pornographers remain a prominent presence in the indie rock world, having released its sixth album ''[[Brill Bruisers]]'' on August 25, 2014.

In addition to recording with The New Pornographers, Case frequently collaborates with other Canadian musicians, including [[The Sadies]] and [[Carolyn Mark]], and has recorded material by several noted Canadian songwriters, in particular on her 2001 [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Canadian Amp]]''. As a result, she is also considered a significant figure in Canadian music—both [[CBC Radio 3]] and the [[Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada]] have referred to Case as an "honourary Canadian".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20030119234628/http://www.socan.ca/jsp/en/news_events/feature_stories/Neko.jsp |title=Neko Case: Honourary Canadian, Proud SOCAN Member By Jim Kelly, for www.socan.ca |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2003-01-19 |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref>

{{blockquote|"I hope I can comfort people a bit—maybe show people that making music is fun and accessible to them as well. I'm not out to become [[Faith Hill]], I never want to play an arena, and I never want to be on the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], much less make a video with me in it. I would like to reach a larger audience and see the state of music change in favor of musicians and music fans in my lifetime. I care very much about that."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=12437 |title=Neko Noir by Julianne Shepherd - Seattle Music - The Stranger, Seattle's Only Newspaper |publisher=Thestranger.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref>}}

==== Seattle ====
Case fully embraced country music on her 1997 album, ''[[The Virginian (album)|The Virginian]]''. The album contained original compositions as well as covers of songs by [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Loretta Lynn]] and even the 1974 [[Queen (band)|Queen]] song "[[Misfire (song)|Misfire]]". When the album was released, critics compared Case to [[honky tonk|honky-tonk]] singers like Lynn and [[Patsy Cline]], and to [[rockabilly]] pioneer [[Wanda Jackson]], particularly in her vocal timbre.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

On February 22, 2000, Case released her second solo album, ''[[Furnace Room Lullaby]]''. The album introduced the "country noir" elements that have defined Case's subsequent solo career. That tone was evident even from the cover photo, featuring Case sprawled out corpse-like on a concrete floor. On the album itself, her vocal style moves away from outright honky-tonk but retains her twang, garnering comparisons to musicians such as Cline, Lynn, [[Hazel Dickens]], [[Tanya Tucker]], and [[Dolly Parton]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} The title track was included on the soundtrack to [[Sam Raimi]]'s film ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]'', and "Porchlight" was featured on the soundtrack to ''[[The Slaughter Rule]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Case sometimes tours with Canadian singer and songwriter Carolyn Mark as [[The Corn Sisters]].<ref name=holliston>Tom Holliston, [http://music.cbc.ca/#/artists/The-Corn-Sisters "The Corn Sisters"]. [[CBC Music]]. Retrieved 10 April 2013.</ref> One of their performances, at Seattle's Hattie's Hat restaurant in [[Ballard, Seattle, Washington|Ballard]], was recorded and released as an album, ''[[The Other Women]]'', on November 28, 2000.<ref name=holliston />

==== Chicago ====
In October 1999, around the time ''Furnace Room Lullaby'' was released, Case left Seattle<ref name=Furious-Thrice /> for Chicago because she felt that Seattle was no longer hospitable to its local artists.<ref>{{cite web|last=Scanlon |first=Tom |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000615&slug=4026820 |title=Living &#124; Country singer Neko Case is movin' on &#124; Seattle Times Newspaper |publisher=Community.seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=2000-06-15 |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref>

Case's first work in Chicago was an eight-song [[Extended play|EP]] that she recorded in her kitchen. ''[[Canadian Amp]]'', her first recording without Her Boyfriends, was released on her own Lady Pilot label in 2001. She wrote two of the tracks, with the remaining six being covers, including [[Neil Young]]'s "Dreaming Man" and Hank Williams' "Alone and Forsaken". Four of the covers were written by Canadian artists. The EP was initially available only at Case's live shows and directly from Mint Records' website, but it eventually saw wider release.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Case recorded her third full-length album, ''[[Blacklisted (album)|Blacklisted]]'', in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. Her first album credited to Case alone, without Her Boyfriends, it was released on August 20, 2002. Some believe the title ''Blacklisted'' alludes to Case being banned for life from the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' because she took her shirt off during a performance on August 4, 2001 at one of their outdoors "Opry Plaza" concerts,<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1446518/08092001/clark_terri.jhtml ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref><ref name=guardian13Mar2009>{{cite news|last=Cooper|first=Leonie|title=The banned played on|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/mar/13/neko-case-middle-cyclone-interview|accessdate=February 2, 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 13, 2009}}</ref> though Case herself has denied this.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090129144048/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nekocase/articles/story/5934106/neko_cases_country_lust |title=Neko Case's Country Lust: Neko Case : Rolling Stone |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2002-10-15 |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref> Asked about the incident in 2004, Case said "I had [[heatstroke]]. People would love it to be a 'fuck you' punk thing. But it was actually a physical ailment thing."<ref>[http://www.richmond.com/music/6962 ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>

Most of the album's fourteen songs are originals; the exceptions being covers of "Running Out of Fools", previously a hit for [[Aretha Franklin]], and "Look for Me (I'll Be Around)" previously performed by [[Sarah Vaughan]]. ''Blacklisted'' finds Case even deeper in a "country noir" mood, and was described by critics as lush, bleak, and atmospheric. Case cited filmmaker [[David Lynch]], composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]], and Neil Young's soundtrack to the film ''[[Dead Man]]'' as influences. One track, "Deep Red Bells", was inspired by Case's memories of being a vulnerable young woman in the [[Seattle]] area while the [[Gary Ridgway|Green River Killer]] was at large.<ref name=nekocaseinterview>{{cite web|last=Matos|first=Michaelangelo|title=Neko Case: Thrice All American| url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/nekocase.html|work=Perfect Sound Forever | date= October 14, 2002 |accessdate=2011-08-14}}</ref>

In April 2003, Case was voted the "Sexiest Babe of Indie Rock" in a Playboy.com internet poll, receiving 32% of the vote. ''[[Playboy]]'' asked her to pose nude for the magazine, but she declined their offer. She told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that "I didn't want to be the girl who posed in ''Playboy'' and then—by the way—made some music. I would be really fucking irritated if after a show somebody came up to me and handed me some naked picture of myself and wanted me to sign it instead of my CD."<ref>{{cite web|last=Valby |first=Karen |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,455377,00.html |title=Gloves Off |publisher=EW.com |date=2003-06-06 |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref> In later interviews, she declined to discuss the survey at all.

Following the death of his older brother [[Ptolemy XIII of Egypt]] on January 13, 47 BC, he was proclaimed [[Pharaoh]] and co-ruler by their older sister and remaining [[Pharaoh]], [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt]]. He and Cleopatra were married, but Cleopatra continued to act as lover of [[Roman dictator]] [[Julius Caesar]]. Ptolemy is considered to have reigned in name only, with Cleopatra keeping actual authority to herself. On March 15, 44 BC Caesar was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|murdered]] in [[Rome]] by a group of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspirators]] whose most notable members were [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]]. Ptolemy soon followed him in death. An inscription mentioning him as alive was dated at July 26, 44 BC. It has been  assumed but remains uncertain that Cleopatra poisoned her co-ruler to replace him with his nephew Ptolemy XV [[Caesarion]], her son by Caesar who was proclaimed co-ruler on September 2, 44 BC and whom his mother intended to support as successor of his father.

'''Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton,  [[Sisters of Charity Federation in the Vincentian-Setonian Tradition|S.C.]]''', (August 28, 1774 &ndash; January 4, 1821) was the first native-born citizen<ref name=PaulVI/> of the United States to be [[canonization|canonized]] by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] (September 14, 1975).<ref>[[Frances Xavier Cabrini]] was the first American citizen to be canonized; she was born in [[Sant'Angelo Lodigiano]], in the [[Lombardy|Lombard]] [[Province of Lodi]], [[Italy]] (then part of the [[Austrian Empire]]).</ref> She established the first Catholic school in the nation, at [[Emmitsburg, Maryland]], where she founded the first American [[congregation (Catholic)|congregation]] of [[nun#Religious Sisters|religious sisters]], the [[Sisters of Charity Federation in the Vincentian-Setonian Tradition|Sisters of Charity]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Elizabeth Ann Bayley was born on August 28, 1774, the second child of a socially prominent couple, Dr. [[Richard Bayley]] and Catherine Charlton of [[New York City]].<ref name=shrine>{{cite web|url=http://www.setonshrine.org/bio/bio7.htm/|title=The National Shrine of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton|date=2010-09-15|work=The Seton Legacy|publisher=The National Shrine of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton}}</ref> The Bayley and Charlton families were among the earliest of the York area. Her father's parents were prominent [[France|French]] [[Huguenot]]s living in [[New Rochelle, New York]]. He later served as the first professor of anatomy at Columbia College.<ref name=randolph/> As Chief [[health Officers|Health Officer]] for the [[Port of New York and New Jersey|Port of New York]], he attended to immigrants as they disembarked from ships onto Staten Island, and cared for New Yorkers when yellow fever swept through the city, killing 700 in four months in 1795.<ref name=Barkley>[http://www.americancatholic.org/messenger/jul2009/feature1.asp Barkley, Elizabeth Bookser. "Elizabeth Ann Seton: A Profoundly Human Saint", ''St. Anthony Messenger'', Francscan Media]</ref>  Her mother was the daughter of an Episcopal [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] who served as [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church on [[Staten Island]] for 30 years; Elizabeth was raised in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].

Her mother, Catherine, died in 1777 when Elizabeth was three years old. This was possibly a result of [[childbirth]], as their youngest child, also Catherine, died early the following year. Bayley then married Charlotte Amelia Barclay, a member of the Jacobus James [[Roosevelt family]],<ref name=shrine/> to provide a mother for his two surviving daughters. The new Mrs. Bayley became active in the social action of the Church and would visit the poor in their homes to distribute food and needed items. She would take the young Elizabeth with her on her rounds of charity.

The couple had five children, but the marriage ended in separation as a result of marital conflict. Elizabeth and her older sister, Mary Magdalene, were rejected by their stepmother in this breakup. Their father then traveled to [[London]] for further medical studies at that time, so the girls lived temporarily in New Rochelle with their paternal uncle, William Bayley, and his wife, Sarah Pell Bayley. Losing a mother for the second time, Elizabeth experienced a period of darkness during this time, which she reflected about later in her journals. In these journals, Elizabeth shows a natural bent toward contemplation, she loved nature, poetry, and music, especially the piano. She was fluent in French, a fine musician, and an accomplished horsewoman.<ref name=crystal>[http://www.elizabethannseton.org/biography-elizabeth-ann-seton "Biography of Elizabeth Ann Seton", St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Roman Catholic Church, Crystal Lake, Illinois]</ref> She was given to introspection and frequently made entries in her journal expressing her sentiments, religious aspirations, and favorite passages from her reading.

=== Marriage and motherhood ===
On January 25, 1794, at age 19, Elizabeth married William Magee Seton, aged 25, a wealthy businessman in the [[import]] trade. [[Samuel Provoost]], the first Episcopalian [[bishop]] of New York, witnessed the wedding vows of the couple.<ref>[http://www.emmitsburg.net/setonshrine/ Emmitsburgh Area Historical Society]</ref> Her husband's father, William Seton (1746-1798), belonged to an impoverished noble Scottish family, which had emigrated to New York in 1758, and became superintendent and part owner of the iron-works of [[Ringwood, New Jersey]]. He was a loyalist, and the last royal public notary for the city and province of New York during the war. Five children were born to the marriage: Anna Maria (Annina) (1795–1812), William II, [[Richard Seton|Richard]] (1798–1823), [[Catherine Seton|Catherine]] (1800–1891) (who was to become the first American to join the [[Sisters of Mercy]]) and Rebecca Mary (1802–1816).

William, along with his father William and brother James, was a founding partner in the import-export mercantile firm, the William Seton Company, which had become Seton, Maitland and Company in 1793. He had visited important [[counting house]]s in Europe in 1788 and was a friend of Filippo Filicchi, a renowned merchant in [[Livorno|Leghorn]], Italy, with whom his firm was a major trading partner. William Seton brought the first [[Stradivarius]] violin to America.<ref name=Barkley/> 

Socially prominent in New York, the Setons belonged to the fashionable Trinity Episcopal Church, located on Broadway. Elizabeth was a devout communicant there under the influence of the Rev. John Henry Hobart (1775-1830, later bishop), who was her spiritual director.  Elizabeth, along with her sister-in-law Rebecca Mary Seton (1780-1804), her soul-friend and dearest confidante, nursed the sick and dying among family, friends, and needy neighbors. Elizabeth was among the founders and charter members of The Society for the Relief of Poor Widows with Small Children (1797) and also served as treasurer of the organization.<ref name=archb>[http://www.archbalt.org/about-us/the-archdiocese/our-history/people/seton.cfm?renderForPrint=1&renderForPrint=1 St. Elizabeth Ann Seton biography, Archdiocese of Baltimore]</ref> With the death of his father, the Seton family fortunes began to decline. The couple took in William's six younger siblings, ages seven to seventeen. William was tormented by visions of debtors' prison.<ref name=crystal/>

===Widowhood and conversion===
[[Image:Jwatsonhouse.JPG|thumb|The Seton home in [[New York City]] was located at the site on which a [[Our Lady of the Holy Rosary Church (New York City)|church]] now stands in her honor, with the formerly matching building to the right ([[James Watson House|7 State Street]]) forming part of the shrine.]]

By 1802, the effects of the [[United Kingdom]]'s blockade of [[Napoleonic France]] and the loss of several of her husband's ships at sea led to William Seton's bankruptcy. Elizabeth spent that Christmas watching the front door to keep the seizure officer out of their [[Wall Street|Wall St.]] home. The following summer she and the children stayed with her father, who was health officer for the Port of New York on Staten Island.<ref name=crystal/> Through most of their married life, William Seton suffered from tuberculosis. He fell ill and his doctors sent him to Italy for the warmer climate, with Elizabeth and their eldest daughter accompanying him. They landed at the port of Leghorn, where the authorities feared yellow fever, then prevalent in New York. They were held in [[quarantine]] for a month, after which time William died on 27 December 1803<ref name=randolph>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13739a.htm Randolph, Bartholomew. "St. Elizabeth Ann Seton." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 2 Jul. 2013]</ref> and was buried in the [[Old English Cemetery, Livorno|Old English Cemetery]]. Elizabeth and Anna Maria were received by the families of her late husband's Italian business partners. While staying with them, she was introduced to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].
[[File:Old Saint Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Manhattan, New York.jpg|thumb|left|St. Peter's, Barclay Street, 1785]]
After her return to the United States, she converted to the Catholic Church, into which she was received on March 14, 1805 by [[the Rev.]] Matthew O'Brien, [[pastor]] of [[St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, New York]],<ref name=archb/> the only Catholic church in the city then. (Anti-Catholic laws had been lifted just a few years before.) A year later, she received the [[sacrament]] of [[Confirmation]] from the [[Archdiocese of Baltimore|Bishop of Baltimore]], [[the Right Reverend]] [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]], the only Catholic bishop in the nation.

In order to support herself and her children, Seton had started an [[academy]] for young ladies, as was common for widows of social standing in that period. After news of her conversion to Catholicism spread, however, most of the parents withdrew their daughters from her tutelage, due to the anti-Catholic sentiment of the day. She was about to remove to Canada when she made the acquaintance of a visiting priest, the [[Abbé]] [[Louis William Valentine Dubourg]], [[Society of St. Sulpice|S.S.]], who was a member of the French [[emigré]] community of [[Society of St. Sulpice|Sulpician Fathers]] and then president of St. Mary's college. The Sulpicians had taken refuge in the United States from the religious persecution of the [[Reign of Terror]] in France and were in the process of establishing the first Catholic [[seminary]] for the United States, in keeping with the goals of their society. For several years, Dubourg had envisioned a religious school to meet the educational needs of the small Catholic community in the nation.<ref name=archb/>

===Foundress===
After struggling through some trying and difficult years, in 1809 Elizabeth accepted the invitation of the Sulpicians and moved to Emmitsburg, Maryland. A year later she established the Saint Joseph's Academy and Free School, a school dedicated to the education of Catholic girls. This was possible due to the financial support of Samuel Sutherland Cooper,<ref name=randolph/> a wealthy convert and seminarian at the newly established [[Mount Saint Mary's University]], begun by [[John Dubois]], S.S., and the Sulpicians.

On 31 July, Elizabeth established a religious community in Emmitsburg dedicated to the care of the children of the poor. This was the first congregation of religious sisters to be founded in the United States, and its school was the first free Catholic school in America. This modest beginning marked the start of the Catholic parochial school system in the United States.<ref name=healthcare>[http://www.seton.net/about_Seton/Setons_history_and_heritage/st_elizabeth_ann_Seton"St. Elizabeth Ann Seton (1774 – 1821)", Seton Healthcare Family]</ref> The congregation was initially called the Sisters of Charity of St. Joseph's. From that point on, she became known as "Mother Seton". In 1810, the sisters adopted the rules written by St. Vincent de Paul for the Daughters of Charity in France.<ref name=healthcare/>

===Later life and death===
The remainder of her life was spent in leading and developing the new congregation. Mother Seton was described as a charming and cultured lady. Her connections to New York society and the accompanying social pressures to leave the new life she had created for herself did not deter her from embracing her religious vocation and charitable mission. The greatest difficulties she faced were actually internal, stemming from misunderstandings, interpersonal conflicts and the deaths of two daughters, other loved ones, and young sisters in the community.

She died of [[tuberculosis]] on January 4, 1821, at the age of 46. Today, her remains are entombed in the [[National Shrine of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton]] in Emmitsburg, Maryland.

By 1830, the Sisters were running orphanages and schools as far west as Cincinnati and New Orleans and had established the first hospital west of the Mississippi in St. Louis.<ref name=healthcare/>

==Legacy==
[[Image:Elizabeth Ann Seton Sign.JPG|thumb|left|Sign of the shrine]]

Elizabeth Ann Seton had a deep devotion to the [[Eucharist]], [[Sacred Scripture]] and the [[Virgin Mary]]. The [[23rd Psalm]] was her favorite prayer throughout her life. She was a woman of prayer and service who embraced the spirituality of [[Louise de Marillac]] and Vincent de Paul. It had been her original intention to join the [[Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul]], but the [[embargo]] of [[France]] due to the [[Napoleonic Wars]] prevented this connection. It was only decades later, in 1850, that the Emmitsburg community took the steps to merge with the Daughters, and to become their American branch, as their foundress had envisioned.

[[Image:Seton Raymond cem jeh.JPG|thumb|Statue in [[Saint Raymond's Cemetery, Bronx|St. Raymond's Cemetery]]<br>[[Bronx, New York]]]]

Today, six separate religious congregations trace their roots to the beginnings of the Sisters of Charity in Emmitsburg. In addition to the original community of Sisters at Emmitsburg (now part of the Vincentian order), they are based in [[New York City]]; [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; [[Halifax Regional Municipality]]; [[Convent Station, New Jersey]]; and [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania]].

Mother Seton School in Emmitsburg, Maryland, is a direct descendant of the Saint Joseph's Academy and Free School. It is located less than a mile from the site of the original school and is sponsored by the Daughters of Charity.<ref>[http://www.mothersetonschool.org/history.html Mother Seton School, Emmitsburg, Maryland]</ref>

[[Seton Home Study School]], a [[Roman Catholic]] homeschooling program based in [[Front Royal]], [[Virginia]], received its name from St. Elizabeth Ann Seton.

Seton Hall College (now known as [[Seton Hall University]]) was formally founded on September 1, 1856, by Archdiocese of Newark Bishop James Roosevelt Bayley, a cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt. Bishop Bayley named the institution after his aunt, St. Elizabeth Ann Seton.

A number of Roman Catholic churches are named for Mother Seton. These include St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Parish in Crofton, Maryland, established in 1975<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.seaseton.org/history.html | title = History | publisher = St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Parish | accessdate = 26 December 2013}}</ref> in the [[Archdiocese of Baltimore]], the same diocese in which she had founded Saint Joseph's Academy and Free School.

==Canonization==
Elizabeth Ann Seton was [[Beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope John XXIII]] on March 17, 1963. The pope said on the occasion, “In a house that was very small, but with ample space for charity, she sowed a seed in America which by Divine Grace grew into a large tree.”<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.parishesonline.com/scripts/HostedSites/org.asp?p=21&ID=6239 | title = History: A Historical Perspective | publisher = St Elizabeth Ann Seton Parish | location = Three Bridges, New Jersey | accessdate = 26 December 2013}}</ref>

[[Pope Paul VI]] [[Canonization|canonized]] her on September 14, 1975, in a ceremony in St. Peter’s Square.<ref name=PaulVI/> In his words, “Elizabeth Ann Seton is a saint. St. Elizabeth Ann Seton is an American. All of us say this with special joy, and with the intention of honoring the land and the nation from which she sprang forth as the first flower in the calendar of the saints. Elizabeth Ann Seton was wholly American! Rejoice for your glorious daughter. Be proud of her. And know how to preserve her fruitful heritage.”<ref name=PaulVI>{{cite web | url = http://www.setonshrine.org/learn-and-explore/resources/mother-seton-bio/ | title = Biography of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton | publisher = National Shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton | accessdate = 26 December 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Battle Los Angeles cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|From left to right, Rodriguez, Jonathan Liebesman and Aaron Eckhart at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International]]
In 2010, Rodriguez appeared in [[Robert Rodriguez]]'s ''[[Machete (film)|Machete]]''. The film received mostly positive reviews and earned $44&nbsp;million at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20844|title=Get Your Grindhouse Fix With a New Poster from Robert Rodriguez's Machete|publisher=BloodyDisgusting}} {{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> In 2011, she appeared with [[Aaron Eckhart]] in the science fiction film ''[[Battle: Los Angeles]]'' which grossed over $200&nbsp;million in the worldwide box office. In 2012, she returned to play the good clone and bad clone of Rain Ocampo in ''[[Resident Evil: Retribution]]''. In 2013, she reprised her role as Letty Ortiz in ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]''. In the same year, Rodriguez appeared in Robert Rodriguez's film ''[[Machete Kills]]''.

====Typecast====
After her film debut, ''Girlfight'', Rodriguez has consistently portrayed tough and tomboyish characters who operate in traditional male fields such as the police force or armed forces. Rodriguez says that she does not mind the typecasting, and in fact, is somewhat responsible for it:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodnews.com/2010/07/26/michelle-rodriguez-responds-to-being-typecast-as-the-tough-chick/|publisher=Hollywoodnews.com|date=July 26, 2010|title=Michelle Rodriquez Responds}}</ref>

"Oh man, I was typecast the minute I did a film called ''Girlfight'' years ago. You allow yourself to be typecast. If I decided I didn't want to be typecast tomorrow, I'd just do an indie film where I play some poor girl who goes through some excruciating experience and win myself an award for crying or being raped. But at the end of the day, I'm not in it for the acting. I only wanna be someone I respect or someone that I consider interesting or fun. I'm here to entertain people and make a statement about female empowerment and strength, and that's what I've done for the last 10 years. I pigeonholed myself and I put myself in that box by saying no to everything else that came on my plate. Saying no to this, no to that, and eventually I just got left with the strong chick that's always being killed, and there's nothing wrong with that."

===Screenwriting===
During the promotional tour of ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'' Rodriguez has stated that she originally joined the [[Hollywood]] business to become a screenwriter. She has also stated that she has two screenplays under development and plans to take a break from acting to pursue her writing. One is a family film based on a concept which she describes as "a 2012 story about purity and animals and children",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0569059/ |title=Michelle Rodriguez Writing Kids Film |date=September 18, 2008 |publisher=Internet Movie Database}}</ref> and the other is a revision of an American remake of the 1997 German film ''Bandits'' which she describes as a film "about four girls who break out of jail and get chased across the country by the feds and by this MTV-like representative".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameculture.com/2009/12/14/gameculture-exclusive-quotavatarquot-vet-michelle-rodriguez-talks-modern-warfare-and-dodg |title=GameCulture Exclusive: 'Avatar' Vet Michelle Rodriguez Talks Modern Warfare and Dodging Earthquakes |date=December 14, 2009 |publisher=Gameculture.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091217033258/http://www.gameculture.com/2009/12/14/gameculture-exclusive-quotavatarquot-vet-michelle-rodriguez-talks-modern-warfare-and-dodg |archivedate=December 17, 2009}}</ref>

I like to mix it up, it's pretty eclectic."

===Notable rankings===
Several times over the course of her career, she has been ranked in ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]'' magazine's "102 Sexiest Women In The World", ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]''{{'s}} "100 Sexiest Women", and ''[[People en Español]]''{{'s}} "50 Más Bellos", and was ranked No. 74 in [[FHM]]'s "100 Sexiest Women in the World 2009".{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

'''Maria Mies''' (born 1931, [[Steffeln]]) is a professor of [[sociology]] and author of several feminist books, including ''Indian Women and Patriarchy'' (1980), ''Patriarchy and Accumulation on a World Scale'' (1986), and (with Bennholdt-Thomsen and von Werlhof) ''Women: The Last Colony'' (1988).

She is Professor of Sociology at the Cologne University of Applied Sciences,<ref>Cologne University of Applied Sciences: http://www.international-office.fh-koeln.de/english/</ref> which is a [[Fachhochschule]] in [[Cologne]], Germany. She worked for many years in India. In 1979 she established the Women and Development programme at the Institute of Social Studies in [[The Hague]], Netherlands. She has been active in the women's movement and in [[women's studies]] since the late 1960s. She has published several books and many articles on feminist, ecological and developing-world issues. One of her main concerns is the development of an alternative approach in methodology and in economics. Having retired from teaching in 1993, she continues to be active in the women's and other social movements; she is a member of feministAttac, a women network of [[Attac]].<ref>{{internetquelle|autor=Ilona Plattner u.&nbsp;a.|url=http://www.attac.de/feministattac/fna.php|titel=feministAttac|werk=Attac Deutschland|datum=15 April 2005|zugriff=12 March 2008}}</ref> She has published a book on the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] and, with Veronika Bannholdt, has written a book on the subsistence perspective (from ''Patriarchy and Accumulation on a World Scale'').

'''''River City Ransom''''', originally released as {{nihongo|'''''Downtown Nekketsu Story'''''|??????????|Dauntaun Nekketsu Monogatari|lit. "Downtown Hot-Blooded story"}} in Japan and later as '''''Street Gangs''''' in [[PAL regions]], is a [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer/NES]]. It was developed by [[Techn?s Japan]] and originally released in Japan on April 25, 1989. It is the third game in Technos' ''[[Kunio-kun]]'' series released for the console, preceded by ''[[Renegade (video game)|Renegade]]'' and ''[[Super Dodge Ball]]''. Like its predecessors, ''River City Ransom'' underwent great changes in its storyline and graphical presentation during its localization in order to make the game more palatable in the Western market. It was one of the first console games published by North American subsidiary American Technos.

[[Video game remake|Remakes]] of the game have been released for the [[Sharp X68000]], [[TurboGrafx-16#TurboGrafx-CD|PC-Engine Super CD-ROM²]], and [[Game Boy Advance]] (GBA). The NES version was re-released on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in 2007. It was also released on the 3DS Virtual Console in the PAL Regions in July 25, 2013 and in North America in November 14, 2013.

==Gameplay==

==Development==
[[Image:Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari game cover.jpg|thumb|left|The Famicom cover artwork of ''Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari''.]]''River City Ransom'' is an [[English language|English]] [[Internationalization and localization|localization]] of the Family Computer video game ''Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari'', which is the third title starring Techn?s Japan's mascot character [[Kunio-kun|Kunio]], who previously appeared in ''Nekketsu K?ha Kunio-kun'' and ''Nekketsu K?k? Dodgeball Bu'' (the Japanese versions of ''[[Renegade (video game)|Renegade]]'' and ''[[Super Dodge Ball]]'' respectively). This is the first game in the series where Kunio teams up with his rival Riki, who fought against Kunio in the previous games. The gangs the players fight in the Famicom version are all students from different high schools and many of the characters introduced in this game would reappear in subsequent ''Kunio-kun'' games (particularly those that were directed by Sekimoto and Yoshida).

In addition to anglicizing all of the characters' and locations' names, as well as the game's dialog in the English translation, the characters' sprites were also redrawn, replacing their [[Japanese school uniform#Gakuran|Japanese school uniforms]] with [[t-shirts]] and [[jeans]].

The number of difficulty settings was reduced from three to two (the easiest difficulty setting was removed and the Medium setting in the Famicom version became the Novice setting in the NES version) and an alternate 2-player mode (2P Play B) which disables player-against-player damage was removed too. In addition to a Password feature, the Japanese version also features support for the [[List of Nintendo Entertainment System accessories|Turbo File]], a peripheral released only in Japan that allows the player to save and load game data.

''River City Ransom'' was the first console game localized by Techn?s Japan's U.S. subsidiary, American Technos Inc. Although most of Techn?s Japan's previous games (such as ''Renegade'' and ''Double Dragon'') were released in North America as well, they were licensed out to other publishers. The second and final NES game released by American Technos was ''[[Crash 'n the Boys: Street Challenge]]'', which was also a ''Kunio-kun'' game.

==Ports==

===X68000===
''Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari'' was ported to the [[Sharp X68000]], a Japanese computer platform, and released in April [[1990 in video gaming|1990]]. This version of the game, which was developed by SPS and published by [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]],<ref name="sps"/> features several enhancements to the Famicom original, such as displaying three enemy characters on-screen instead of just two, slightly more colorful graphics, an expanded game world, and new items and special techniques for the player (including some that were only used by certain enemy characters in the Famicom version, such as the headbutt and the whirlwind kick). The new locations includes several new shops (such as a dojo) and the schools of each enemy gang, each featuring two new bosses. In addition to the player's regular stats, the player also has individual stats for all the special techniques their character has acquired. The more frequently a special move is used to finish off enemies, the stronger that particular move becomes. Unlike the Famicom version, the X68000 does not feature adjustable difficulty settings. The player can save and load their progress in one of ten save files provided by the game itself.

===PC Engine===
The [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine Super CD-ROM²]] version of ''Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari'', released on December 24, 1993, was published by Naxat Soft and developed by [[KID]], the same team that did the PC Engine versions of ''Nekketsu K?k? Dodgeball'' (''[[Super Dodge Ball]]''), ''[[Double Dragon II: The Revenge]]'', and ''Downtown Nekketsu K?shinkyoku''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~mx-5/kid/kidlistpce.htm|title=????????????????|language=Japanese}}</ref> This version features enhanced graphics, an arranged redbook soundtrack and fully voiced characters, with the voices of Kunio and Riki performed by [[Ry? Horikawa]] and [[Nobutoshi Canna]] respectively. The player's progress is saved in this version on the PC Engine's backup memory. The rest of the game is almost identical to the Famicom version.

===Game Boy Advance===
[[File:River City Ransom EX cover.jpg|thumb|North American cover of ''River City Ransom EX'' for the Game Boy Advance]]

A [[Game Boy Advance|GBA]] version of the game, titled {{nihongo|''River City Ransom EX''|??????????ex|Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari ex}} was released in Japan on March 5, 2004 and in North America on May 26, 2004.<ref name="jpgbarelease"/><ref name="nagbarelease"/> This remake was developed by Million and published by [[Atlus]]. The most notable change from the original version is the loss of a true cooperative mode. Instead, the game can be played with an [[AI]]-controlled partner, and players may exchange the data of their own characters to fight alongside each other. The GBA version also includes a vast amount of configurable options that can adjust game play on the fly, such as changing AI behaviour, the amount of enemies in one map area, and shop item reshuffling frequency. The password system is replaced by battery backup, which allows saving up to 12 characters. Character's appearances, keystrokes for learned techniques, even enemy characters can be customized and saved using secret shop items. A saved game does not store story progress or reputation, but it does store the player's statistics, techniques, current items and money, player's name, and customized appearances. The player can gain additional computer-controlled allies and form a "posse" who helps the player on his adventure. Some of these are boss characters from the original NES version, while others are taken from later ''Downtown Nekketsu'' games. The player can be accompanied by up to three AI-controlled partners.

===Wii===
The original NES version of ''River City Ransom'' was re-released on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service in Japan on October 23, 2007, in PAL regions  on February 21, 2008, and in North America on April 21, 2008.<ref name="jpvcrelease"/><ref name="palvcrelease"/><ref name="navcrelease"/> The western NES titles, graphics, and storylines for the latter two releases were left intact.

==Reception and legacy==
The Japanese version, ''Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari'', was considered highly successful and would be followed by several spinoffs (including seven subsequent Famicom installments) until Technos Japan's closure in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. Of these seven games, ''Downtown Special: Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki dayo Zen'in Shugo'' features the same gameplay system as ''Monogatari'', with the main difference being that the characters are re-enacting a [[jidaigeki]] play.

Outside Japan, ''River City Ransom'' was not highly successful when initially released. However, due to its unique gameplay and sense of humor, it is today considered a [[Cult following|cult classic]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This cult following, combined with the game's character and humor, inspired parallel works.

The UK television programme ''[[Games Master]]'' generally panned the game (under its localised title of ''Street Gangs'') with one reviewer saying they "would rather sit in a vat of horse manure than play this game, give it to your worse enemies" with an overall score of 32%.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huo90uhLsfg#t=6m45s</ref>

[[GamesRadar]] ranked it the seventh best NES game ever made. The staff felt that it was more memorable than ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'', ''[[Legend of Kage]]'', and ''[[Double Dragon]]'' and is still influential.<ref>{{cite web |title=Best NES Games of all time |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/best-nes-games-all-time/ |work=[[GamesRadar]] |date=2012-04-16 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref>

In 2002, an aspiring game designer, tester for [[Atari]], and longtime fan of the game obtained the title's trademark and began work on a sequel aptly titled ''River City Ransom 2''. The project was halted when it was announced at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in 2003 that ''River City Ransom EX'' was to be released the following year.<ref>{{cite web | first=Frank | last=Cifaldi | year=2004 | title=Realize Games' River City Ransom 2 | url=http://www.lostlevels.org/200402/200402-rcr.shtml | work=[http://www.lostlevels.org/ Lost Levels Online] | accessdate=June 21, 2006}}</ref> However, a true sequel to the game was announced on March 18, 2011. {{nihongo|''Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari 2''|??????????2}} is being developed by Miracle Kidz for a Japanese release on [[WiiWare]] in 2011.

On April 22, 2013, the Canadian independent developer, Conatus Creative, announced development on an officially licensed follow-up game, named ''River City Ransom: Underground'', scheduled for Windows in August 2014.<ref>{{cite web | title=River City Ransom announced | url=http://conatuscreative.com/2013/04/river-city-ransom-announced/ |publisher=Conatus Creative | accessdate=April 22, 2012|date=April 22, 2012}}</ref> On September 9, 2013 Conatus Creative launched a campaign on the [[crowdfunding]] site, [[Kickstarter]], seeking [[Canadian dollar|CA$]]180,000 in funding for the game. On October 6, 2013, they successfully reached their funding goal. The campaign ended on October 9, 2013, having collected $217,643, approximately 120% of the original goal.

'''Kununurra''' is a town in far northern [[Western Australia]] located at the eastern extremity of the [[Kimberley Region, Western Australia|Kimberley Region]] approximately {{convert|37|km|mi|0}} from the border with the [[Northern Territory]]. Kununurra was initiated to service the [[Ord River Irrigation Scheme]].

Kununurra is the largest town in Western Australia north of [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]], with the closest town being [[Wyndham, Western Australia|Wyndham]], {{convert|100|km|mi|0}} away. Kununurra is {{convert|3040|km|mi|0}} from [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] via the [[Great Northern Highway]].

The town is situated in among the scenic hills and ranges of the far north-east Kimberley Region, having an abundance of fresh water, conserved by the Ord River Diversion dam and the main Ord River Dam.

The tropical agriculture crops grown in the Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA) have changed over the years. Tourism and mining have also become important to the local economy.

== Characteristics ==
The 2011 census population includes only people in the townsite area who called the Kununurra town site their "usual place of residence." Kununurra has a transient population; if itinerant residents, the outlying farm areas and communities were included in these population figures, numbers would have exceeded 7,000 for 2006.<ref name="kununurra1">{{cite web|url=http://www.kununurra.org.au/research/transient-population |title=Transient Population of Kununurra - Kimberley History |publisher=Kununurra.org.au |date=2011-02-12 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref> An influx in the dry season (From April to September), of tourists and itinerant farm workers can push up the population to around 10,000 during the dry season.<ref name="kununurra1"/>

Kununurra District High School comprises a primary school and high school teaching up to year 10, and up to year 12 via distance education. It also has a number of additional smaller schools including St Joseph's primary school and a [[Technical and further education]] (TAFE) college. Kununurra has a local hospital, dentist and leisure centre including a 25 metre pool.

[[File:Sandelholzplantagen Kununurra.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Indian Sandalwood]] plantations at Kununurra]]
Key farm activities including the growing of [[melons]], [[mangoes]] and until recently, [[sugar cane]]. Farmers are now turning to a more lucrative (though longer term) crop of [[Indian Sandalwood]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/property/scent-of-success-in-sandalwood-farms/story-e6frg9gx-1111114867714 | title=Scent of success in sandalwood farms | date=17 November 2007 | work=The Australian}}</ref> Other crops that have been grown in the Ord are [[cotton]], [[safflower]] and [[rice]], which is being trialled once again, having been the first crop planted on the Pilot Farm in 1960. The town has a melon picking season, which attracts migratory farm workers to the area. There is also a thriving tourism industry with most tourist operators capitalising on the scenery of the [[Ord River]], [[Lake Argyle]], Diversion Dam and other local locations, including the relatively nearby [[Bungle Bungle]].

== History ==
[[File:Ord River 1961 EW Digby-10.jpg|thumb|Ord river crossing prior to building of the Diversion Dam in 1961-63]]
[[File:Ord River EW Digby-12.jpg|thumb|Bandicoot Bar, Ord river before construction of dam started]]
[[File:Ord River 1962 EW Digby-13.jpg|thumb|construction of the Ord river diversion dam]]
The history of the idea of agriculture on the Ord River dates from the 19th Century. On the first pastoral lease map (held by WA State Records Office) for the area dated 1887, it shows the northern bank between Wyndham and Kununurra, near House Roof Hill was held as a "Concession for Sugar Cane Planting," although it was never taken up. The idea of tropical agriculture on the Ord was discussed much from the earliest dates, but the land remained under pastoral lease until 1960.
Kununurra was built on land resumed from [[Ivanhoe Station]] pastoral lease before 1961,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kununurra.org.au/khs/research/1961-townsite-proclamation |title=1961 Townsite Proclamation - Kimberley History |publisher=Kununurra.org.au |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref> as the town for the Ord River Irrigation Area which started as the Ord River Project or Ord Scheme, with survey work starting in 1959.  [[Lake Kununurra]], is the flooded section of the [[Ord River]] valley that was formerly known as Carlton Reach, which was at times a ten kilometre long waterhole held back by the natural rock barrier, known as Bandicoot Bar. At this site in 1959 drilling and blasting marked the start of construction of the Ord River Diversion Dam, which is anchored down onto the Bandicoot Bar. This dam with twenty radial flood gates was almost completed when visited by the Queen and Prince Phillip in March 1963, then later completed and officially opened by then Prime Minister, (Sir) [[Robert Menzies]] on 20 July 1963 when he said that Kununurra and the Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA) is "..the most exciting place in Australia."

As well as the town site some ORIA farmers live on their farms, however the initial idea of the Ord Scheme was for "closer settlement" to allow farmers the convenience of living in the town and since the start of the first Pilot Farm in 1960 most farmers in the valley had lived in the town, however many people now live on their irrigation farms. Other agricultural and residential localites exist within a 50&nbsp;km radius of the town, including various Aboriginal Communities, Crossing Falls, the Riverfarm Road and Packsaddle farm areas, and the Frank Wise Institute of Tropical Agriculture, formerly known as the Kimberley Research Station (KRS). KRS started in 1945 from the original Carlton Reach Research Station, set up by Kimberley Michael Durack with help from his brother William Aiden Durack in 1941, and support from the [[WA Department of Agriculture]] and the [[WA Public Works Department]], being the first serious attempt at tropical agriculture on the banks of the Ord River. It was also in 1941 that (later Sir) [[Russell Dumas]] inspected the Ord gorges for dam sites on behalf of the Public Works Department.

The scheme involved damming the Ord River by building the Ord River [[diversion dam]] so that the waters could be conserved and directed to irrigate about {{convert|750|km2}} of land. By 1966, there were 31 farms on the Ord River plains. In 1968 the second stage of the scheme was started with the building of the Ord River Dam (or Ord River Main Dam), known locally as "Top Dam," which holds back the waters of Lake Argyle.

Flooding of the Ord River continued until completion of the Main Ord River Dam situated 55&nbsp;km upstream from Kununurra, which was started in 1968, and officially opened on 30 June 1972, with support from [[WA Premier]] [[John Tonkin]], by then Prime Minister [[William McMahon]], when he said "This marks the beginning of Ord Stage II (Two)." The Ord River Dam flooded the land of the Argyle Downs station, the home station of the pioneering [[Durack family]], to form what has become known as [[Lake Argyle]]. Stone work from the original Argyle Downs homestead, was removed before Lake Argyle filled and was re-erected near the dam site to become the Argyle Downs Homestead Museum. The Museum had been run by [[Tourism WA]] but was taken on by the Kununurra Visitor Centre during 2010.

The second stage of the Ord Project still has not been fully developed but new work is underway. In May 2010, with major funding from the Federal Government, the extension of the main channel construction got underway under the Moonamang Joint Venture and images of this as well as historic archive images of the Ord Scheme can be seen on the Kununurra Historical Society website from the external link below.

==Etymology==
Kununurra comes from the English pronunciation of ''Gunanurang'' in the [[Miriwoong language]] with a general meaning of "Big Waters" having become the popular definition or "Big River"<ref>{{cite web |title = Gunanurang: (Kununurra) big river. |url = http://portal.environment.wa.gov.au/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/DOE_ADMIN/TECH_REPORTS_REPOSITORY/TAB1019688/ABORIGINAL_VALUES.PDF |publisher  = East Perth, W.A.:  Waters and Rivers Commission |work= Department
of Environment and Conservation |accessdate = 2008-04-08
}}</ref> Other accounts of the name of Kununurra state that it was the Miriwoong name for this part of the Ord River, which makes sense in that the Ord River runs for hundreds of kilometres coming from the south near [[Halls Creek, Western Australia|Hall's Creek]]. It is likely that other parts of the Ord River were known by other Aboriginal language names, by the various tribal language group areas, over which the river traverses.

A 1943 soil classification had named the volcanic clay known locally as "blacksoil", being the predominant soil type of the irrigation area, as "Cununurra Clay" and "Cununurra" was put forward as a possible name, among others in 1960. The General Post Office (GPO) representative from WA on the Nomenclature Committee, objected saying that Cununurra was too close in name to the town of [[Cunnamulla, Queensland|Cunnamulla]] and that could cause postal confusion. A compromise was reached and "K" was used with an argument having been put forward that this would bring it into line with other East Kimberley placenames, such as Kalumburu, and Karunjie. The name was only finally decided just days before the newest town of the [[Kimberley Region, Western Australia|Kimberley Region]], being gazetted on 10 February 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kununurra.org.au/khs/research/1959-naming-kununurra |title=1959 Naming Kununurra - Kimberley History |publisher=Kununurra.org.au |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref>

==Geography==
The landscape surrounding Kununurra includes features such as Valentine Spring, Black Rock Creek and Middle Springs along with many other [[waterfalls]] and swimming holes. Popular fishing spots include [[Ivanhoe Crossing]], The Diversion Dam, Buttons Crossing, and various locations along the Dunham and [[Ord River|Ord]] Rivers.

The town is located close to the confluence of the [[Ord River|Ord]] and the [[Dunham River]]. [[Lake Argyle]], Australia's largest artificial lake, over {{convert|100|km2}} in size, is 72&nbsp;km by road from the town, being held back by the main Ord River Dam.

The town lies within the [[Ord Irrigation Area Important Bird Area|Ord Irrigation Area]] [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA), so identified by [[BirdLife International]] because of its importance for wild birds, especially [[estrildid finch]]es.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Ord Irrigation Area |accessdate=2011-09-11 |work= Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= }}</ref>

===Climate===
Like other areas in the tropics of [[Western Australia]], Kununurra paradoxically experiences a [[steppe climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSh'') with distinct wet and dry seasons,
The average annual rainfall for Kununurra is around 800mm.

The dry season period from April to September is generally regarded as the most popular time to visit, when heat and humidity levels are lower and road & park accessibility is at its best. In the towns 53 years of weather records, rainfall of over 5mm has never been recorded in the month of August, with most Augusts being completely rainless.

The build-up season from October to December is characterised by high heat and humidity levels. The oppressive conditions of the build-up often give way to spectacular [[Thunderstorm|electrical storms]] along with dramatic [[lightning]] displays which crack in to the night over the rugged Kimberley landscape. Such storms however bring little rainfall and lightning will often start [[bushfires]] in the surrounding scrub.

The summer [[monsoon]] period between January and March can often cause accessibility issues and total closures with many roads and national parks due to heavy rainfall events. Days are overcast, but still hot and heavy downpours of rain are a frequent occurrence.

== Popular culture ==
Kununurra has a Celebrity Tree Park with many trees planted by famous people including [[Rolf Harris]], and more recently [[Baz Luhrmann]], after the majority of the filming for his film ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'' was conducted just outside of Kununurra. The town has many local attractions, including waterfalls, gorges and ranges. It was voted the second best town to live in Australia for outdoor adventure by ''Outdoor Australia'' magazine in the March/April 2007 edition.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

[[Nicole Kidman]] feels that area water helped her get pregnant while filming in this town stating, "Seven babies were conceived out of this film and only one was a boy. There is something up there in the Kununurra water because we all went swimming in the waterfalls, so we can call it the fertility waters now."<ref>{{cite news |title = Kidman hails fertile waterfalls |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7633455.stm |publisher  = BBC NEWS |accessdate = 2008-09-24 | date=24 September 2008}}</ref>

'''''Secret of Mana''''', originally released in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Seiken Densetsu 2'''''|????2|extra=lit. "Legend of the Sacred Sword 2"}}, is a 1993 [[action role-playing game]] developed and published by [[Square (company)|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]) for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It is the sequel to the 1991 game ''Seiken Densetsu'', released in North America as ''[[Final Fantasy Adventure]]'' and in Europe as ''Mystic Quest'', and it was the first ''Seiken Densetsu'' title to be marketed as part of the [[Mana (series)|''Mana'' series]] rather than the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Set in a [[high fantasy]] universe, the game follows three heroes as they attempt to prevent an empire from conquering the world with the power of an ancient flying warship.

Rather than using a [[turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] battle system like contemporary role-playing games, ''Secret of Mana'' features [[turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Real-time|real-time]] battles. The game has a unique Ring Command menu system, which [[turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Pausable real-time|pauses]] the action and allows the player to make decisions in the middle of battle. An innovative [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] system allows a second or third player to drop in and out of the game at any time. ''Secret of Mana'' was directed and designed by [[Koichi Ishii]], programmed primarily by [[Nasir Gebelli]], and produced by veteran Square designer [[Hiromichi Tanaka]].

The game received considerable acclaim for its brightly colored graphics, expansive plot, Ring Command menu system, and innovative real-time battle system. Critics also praised the soundtrack by [[Hiroki Kikuta]] and the customizable [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] (AI) settings for computer-controlled allies. The original version was re-released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in 2008, an additional release for mobile phones in Japan was produced in 2009, and an enhanced [[iOS]] port of the game was released in 2010.

== Gameplay ==

[[File:Smana.PNG|thumb|left|The standard overhead view. The party's attack strength and remaining [[Health (gaming)|health]] is shown in the gauges at the bottom.]]

Like many other role-playing games of the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit era]], ''Secret of Mana'' displays a [[top-down perspective]], in which the [[player characters]] navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The game features three such characters: the hero, the girl, and the [[Sprite (creature)|sprite]], named Randi, Primm, and Popoi outside the initial North American release. The player can choose to control each of the characters at any time; whichever character is currently selected, the other two companions are controlled via [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]]. The game may be played simultaneously by up to three players,<ref name="RPGFan" /><ref name="RPGamer" /> made possible by the [[SNES Multitap|Super Multitap]] accessory for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES) console.<ref name="NPower_1" /> The [[Virtual Console]] version of the game supports three-player gameplay via additional [[Nintendo GameCube controller|GameCube controllers]] or [[Classic Controller]]s.<ref name="vc_ign" />

Each character possesses individual strengths and weaknesses. The hero, while unable to use magic, masters weapons at a quicker rate; the girl is a [[healer (gaming)|healer]], able to cast restorative and support spells; and the sprite casts offensive magic to damage and impair enemies.<ref name="vc_ign" /> Upon collecting enough [[experience point]]s in battle, each character increases in level and improves in areas such as strength and evasion. The trio can rest in towns, where they can regain [[Health (gaming)|hit points]] or purchase restorative items and equipment. Options such as changing equipment, casting [[Magic (gaming)|spells]], or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands, a circular menu which hovers over the currently controlled party member.<ref name="RPGamer" /><ref name="NPower_1" /><ref name="vc_ign" /> The game is momentarily paused whenever the Ring Commands appear.<ref name="RPGFan2" />

[[Image:Flammie Flying.gif|thumb|right|Flammie flying and demonstrating [[Mode 7]]]]

Combat takes place in real-time.<ref name="RPGamer" /> Located at the bottom of the screen is a gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy when attacking. Swinging a weapon causes the gauge to empty and then quickly recharge, allowing that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a weapon increases its skill level to a maximum of eight, unlocking a new special attack with each level. Weapons are upgraded with Weapon Orbs, which are found in [[dungeon crawl|dungeons]] or earned by defeating certain [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]].<ref name="RPGamer" /> The player takes each Orb to a [[blacksmith]], located in most towns, who uses it to reforge one weapon.<ref name="RPGFan" /><ref name="NPower_2" />

In order to learn magic, the party must rescue spirits known as [[Mana (series)#Common elements|Elementals]]. The eight Elementals represent different elements—such as water, earth, and life—and each provides the player with specific spells. Magic has skill levels similar to weapons, but each magic spell costs [[magic point]]s to cast.<ref name="RPGFan" />

At the start of the game, to reach a destination players must traverse an enemy-infested countryside. Travel may be expedited with Cannon Travel Centers, where the party may be launched to faraway destinations via a giant [[cannon]]. Cannon Travel usually requires a fee, but is mandatory to visit other continents later on.<ref name="NPower_1" /> Later, the party is given access to Flammie, a miniature dragon which is controlled by the player and able to fly freely across the world, represented by an [[overworld]] map.<ref name="NPower_3" /> These sequences make use of the SNES's [[Mode 7]] capability to create a rotatable background, giving the illusion that the ground beneath Flammie is rendered in [[3D computer graphics|three dimensions]]. While riding Flammie, the player may access either the "rotated map", which presents the world as a globe, or the "world map", a two-dimensional view of the overworld.<ref name="NWRflammie"/>

==Plot==

===Setting and characters===
The story takes place in a [[high fantasy]] world, which contains an ethereal energy source named "[[Mana#Games and fiction|mana]]". An ancient, technologically-advanced civilization exploited mana to construct the "Mana Fortress", a flying warship. This angered the world's gods, who sent giant beasts to war with the civilization. The conflict was globally destructive and nearly exhausted all signs of mana in the world, until a hero used the power of the Mana Sword to destroy the fortress and the civilization. The world began to recover in peace. As the game opens, an empire seeks eight Mana Seeds, which when "unsealed" will restore mana to the world and allow the empire to restore the Mana Fortress.<ref name="backstory"/>

The three main characters do not have names in the original SNES release, though their names appear in the manual of the Japanese release; and their names were added into the game in the iOS port worldwide. In all versions, the player can choose to name the characters whatever they wish. The {{nihongo|hero|????|Randi}},<ref name="chara"/> a young boy, is adopted by the Elder of Potos before the start of the game, after the boy's mother disappears. The {{nihongo|girl|???|Primm}}<ref name="chara"/> is in love with a warrior named Dyluck, who was ordered by the king to attack Elinee's Castle. Angered by the king's actions and by her father's attempt to [[arranged marriage|arrange]] her marriage to a local nobleman, she leaves the castle to save Dyluck and to accompany the hero as well.<ref name="quoteprimm"/> The hero and the girl meet the {{nihongo|sprite child|???|Popoi}}<ref name="chara"/> at the Dwarf Village. The sprite makes a living by scamming people at a [[freak show]] held by dwarves. He does not remember anything about his past, so he joins the team to try to recover his memories.<ref name="quotesprite"/>

===Story===
The game begins as three boys from the small Potos village disobey their Elder's instructions and trespass into a local waterfall, where a treasure is said to be kept. One of the boys stumbles and falls into the lake, where he finds a rusty sword embedded in a stone. Guided by a disembodied voice, he pulls the sword free, inadvertently unleashing monsters in the surrounding countryside of the village. The villagers interpret the sword's removal as a bad omen and banish the boy from Potos forever.<ref name="quotepotos"/> A traveling knight named Jema recognizes the blade as the legendary Mana Sword and encourages the hero to re-energize it by visiting the eight Mana Temples.<ref name="quotesword"/>

During his journey, the hero is joined by the girl and the sprite. Throughout their travels, the trio is pursued by the empire. The Emperor and his subordinates are being manipulated by Thanatos, an ancient sorcerer who hopes to create a "new, peaceful world".<ref name="quote1"/> Due to his own body's deterioration, Thanatos is in need of a suitable body to [[Spirit possession|possess]]. After placing the entire kingdom of Pandora under a trance, he abducts two candidates: Dyluck, now enslaved, and a young Pandoran girl named Phanna; he eventually chooses to possess Dyluck.<ref name="quote2"/>

The Empire succeeds in unsealing all eight Mana Seeds. However, Thanatos betrays the Emperor and his henchmen, killing them and seizing control of the Mana Fortress for himself. The hero and his party journey to locate the Mana Tree, the focal point of the world's life energy. Anticipating their arrival, Thanatos positions the Mana Fortress over the Tree and destroys it. The charred remains of the Tree speak to the heroes, explaining that a giant dragon called the Mana Beast will soon be summoned to combat the Fortress. However, the Beast has little control over its rage and will likely destroy the world as well.<ref name="quote3"/> The Mana Tree also reveals that it was once the human wife of Serin, the original Mana Knight and the hero's father. The voice heard at Potos' waterfall was that of Serin's ghost.<ref name="quote4"/>

The trio flies to the Mana Fortress and confronts Thanatos, who is preparing to transfer his mind into Dyluck. With the last of his strength, Dyluck warns that Thanatos has sold his soul to the [[underworld]] and must not be allowed to have the Fortress.<ref name="quote5"/> Dyluck kills himself, forcing Thanatos to revert to a skeletal [[lich]] form, which the party defeats. The Mana Beast finally flies in and attacks the Fortress. The hero expresses reluctance to kill the Beast, fearing that with the dispersal of Mana from the world, the sprite will vanish.<ref name="quote6"/> With the sprite's encouragement, he uses the fully energized Mana Sword to slay the Beast, causing it to explode and transform into snow.<ref name="quoteend"/> At the conclusion of the game, the hero is seen returning the Mana Sword to its place beneath the Potos waterfall.

==Development==
[[File:HiromichiTanaka20070131.jpg|thumb|150px|''Secret of Mana'' producer Hiromichi Tanaka]]
''Secret of Mana'' was directed and designed by [[Koichi Ishii]], the creator of the game's [[Game Boy]] predecessor, ''[[Final Fantasy Adventure]]''. He has stated that he feels ''Secret of Mana'' is more "his game" than other projects he has worked on, such as the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series.<ref name="LEVELint"/> The game was programmed primarily by [[Nasir Gebelli]] and produced by veteran Square designer [[Hiromichi Tanaka]]. The team hoped to build on the foundation of ''Final Fantasy Adventure'', and they included several modified elements from that game and from other popular [[Square (company)|Square]] titles in ''Secret of Mana''. In addition to having better graphics and sound quality than its predecessor, the attack power gauge was changed to be more engaging, and the weapon leveling system replaced ''Final Fantasy Adventure''{{'}}s system of leveling up the speed of the attack gauge.<ref name="RGseries"/> The party system also received an upgrade from the first ''Mana'' game: instead of temporary companions who could not be upgraded, party members became permanent protagonists and could be controlled by other players.<ref name="RGseries"/> The multiplayer component was not a part of the original design, but was added when the developers realized that they could easily make all three characters human-controlled.<ref name="LEVELint"/>

The real-time battle system used in ''Secret of Mana'' has been described by its creators as an extension of the battle system used in the first three flagship ''Final Fantasy'' titles. The system for experience points and leveling up was taken from ''[[Final Fantasy III]]''.<ref name="tables"/> According to Tanaka, the game's battle system features mechanics that had first been considered for ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. Similarly, unused features in ''Secret of Mana'' were appropriated by the ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' team, which like ''Final Fantasy IV'' was in production at the time.<ref name="LEVELint"/>

''Secret of Mana'' was originally planned to be a launch title for the [[PlayStation (console)|SNES CD]] add-on. After the deal between [[Nintendo]] and [[Sony]] to produce the add-on fell through, and Sony decided to develop the SNES CD into the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] console, Square Enix chose to continue to develop the game for the SNES. The game had to be altered to fit onto a standard [[ROM cartridge|game cartridge]], which had less storage space than the SNES CD add-on would have allowed.<ref name="1up"/> The developers initially resisted continuing the project without the CD add-on, feeling that too much of the game would have to be cut, but they were overruled by company management. As a result of the hardware change, several features had to be cut from the game, and some completed work needed to be redone.<ref name="LEVELint"/> Most major of these removals was the option to take [[nonlinear gameplay|multiple routes]] through the game that led to several [[alternate ending|possible endings]], in contrast to the linear journey in the final product.<ref name="RGseries"/> The plot that remained was different than the original conception, and Tanaka has said that the original story had a much darker tone.<ref name="LEVELint"/> Ishii has estimated that up to forty percent of the planned game was dropped to meet the space limitations, and critics have suggested that the hardware change led to technical problems when too much happens at once in the game.<ref name="LEVELint"/><ref name="EDGEretro"/> In 2006, ''Level'' magazine claimed that ''Secret of Mana''{{'}}s rocky development was Square's main inspiration to move their games, such as the ''Final Fantasy'' series, from Nintendo consoles to Sony consoles in 1996.<ref name="LEVELint"/>

The English translation for ''Secret of Mana'' was completed in only 30 days, mere weeks after the Japanese release,<ref name="Release"/> and the North American [[game localization|localization]] was initially advertised as ''Final Fantasy Adventure 2''.<ref name="FFA2"/> Critics have suggested that the translation was done hastily so that the game could be released in North America for the 1993 holiday season.<ref name="1up"/> According to translator [[Ted Woolsey]], a large portion of the game's script was cut out in the English localization due to space limitations.<ref name="McGrath"/> To display text on the main gameplay screen, the English translation uses a [[monospaced font|fixed-width font]], which limits the amount of space available to display text. Woolsey was unhappy that he had to trim conversations to their bare essentials and that he had so little time for translation, commenting that it "nearly killed me".<ref name="HC101"/> The script was difficult to translate as it was presented to Woolsey in disordered groups of text, like "shuffling a novel".<ref name="McGrath"/> Other localizations were done in German and French. The Japanese release only named the three protagonists in the manual,<ref name="man28"/> while Western versions omitted the characters' names until the enhanced port on the iOS.<ref name="man35"/><ref name="charnames"/>

The score for ''Secret of Mana'' was composed by [[Hiroki Kikuta]]. [[Kenji Ito]], who had composed the soundtrack for ''Final Fantasy Adventure'', was originally slated for the project. He was replaced with Kikuta when Ito was forced to drop ''Secret of Mana'' due to other demands on his time, such as the soundtrack to ''[[Romancing SaGa]]''. It was Kikuta's first video game score.<ref name="SHint2"/> Despite difficulties in dealing with the hardware limitations of the SNES, Kikuta tried to express in the music two "contrasting styles" to create an original score which would be neither [[pop music]] nor standard [[video game music|game music]].<ref name="SD2liner"/> Kikuta worked on the music mostly by himself, spending nearly 24&nbsp;hours a day in his office, alternating between composing and editing to create a soundtrack that would be, according to him, "immersive" and "three-dimensional".<ref name="kikutaint"/> Rather than using pre-made [[MIDI]] samples of instruments like most game music composers of the time, Kikuta made his own MIDI samples that matched the hardware capabilities of the SNES. These custom samples allowed him to know exactly how each piece would sound on the system's hardware, so he did not have to worry about differences between the original MIDI sampler and the SNES.<ref name="KikShimInt"/> Kikuta said in 2001 that he considered the score for ''Secret of Mana'' his favorite creation.<ref name="KIKUTARBint"/>

The soundtrack's music includes both "ominous" and "light-hearted" tracks, and is noted for its use of bells and "dark, solemn pianos".<ref name="RPGFSM"/> Kikuta's compositions for the game were partly inspired by natural landscapes, as well as music from [[Bali]].<ref name="KIKUTASMint"/><ref name="1UPKikutaint"/> Hardware limitations made the title screen to the game slowly fade in, and Kikuta designed the title track to the game, "Fear of the Heavens", to sync up with the screen. At that time, composers rarely tried to match a game's music to its visuals. Kikuta also started the track off with a "whale noise", rather than a traditional "ping", in order to try to "more deeply connect" the player with the game from the moment it started up. Getting the sound to work with the memory limitations of the SNES was a difficult technical challenge.<ref name="KikShimInt"/>

The 1993 soundtrack album ''Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack'', first released as ''Seiken Densetsu 2 Original Sound Version'' in Japan, collects 44 tracks of music from ''Secret of Mana''. Aside from its packaging and localized song titles, the English release is identical to the Japanese original. ''Secret of Mana'' was one of the first Japanese games to inspire a localized soundtrack release in North America.<ref name="RPGFSM"/> An album of arranged music from ''Secret of Mana'' and its sequel ''[[Seiken Densetsu 3]]'' was produced in 1993 as ''Secret of Mana+''. The music in the album was all composed and arranged by Kikuta. ''Secret of Mana+'' contains a single track, titled "Secret of Mana", that incorporates themes from the music of both ''Secret of Mana'' and ''Seiken Densetsu 3'', which was still under development at the time.<ref name="SEMOSMP"/> The style of the album has been described by critics as "experimental", using "strange sounds" such as waterfalls, bird calls, cell phone sounds, and "typing" sounds.<ref name="RPGFSMP"/> The music has also been described by critics as covering many different musical styles, such as "Debussian impressionist styles, his own heavy electronic and synth ideas, and even ideas of popular musicians".<ref name="SEMOSMP"/> The latest album of music from the game is a 2012 arranged album titled ''Secret of Mana Genesis / Seiken Densetsu 2 Arrange Album''. The 16 tracks are upgraded versions of the original SNES tracks, and Kikuta said in the liner notes for the album that they are "how he wanted the music to sound when he wrote it", without the limitations of the SNES hardware. Critics such as Patrick Gann of RPGFan, however, have noted that the differences are minor.<ref name="RPGFgen"/>

===Re-releases===
In 1999 Square announced they would be porting ''Secret of Mana'' to [[Bandai]]'s handheld system [[WonderSwan|WonderSwan Color]] as one of nine planned games for the system.<ref name="Wonderswan"/> No such port was ever released. A mobile phone port of ''Secret of Mana'' was released on October 26, 2009.<ref name="mobile"/> A port of the game for [[iOS]] was revealed at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2010, and released on Apple's App Store on December 21, 2010.<ref name="iphone"/> The port fixed several bugs, and the English script was both edited and retranslated from the original Japanese.<ref name="StP"/>

As of February 2004, ''Secret of Mana'' had shipped 1.83 million copies worldwide, with 1.5 million of those copies being shipped in Japan and 330,000 abroad.<ref name="SEsales04"/> The initial shipment of games in Japan sold out within days of the release date.<ref name="EDGEpreview"/> ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' noted in November 1993 that the game was "the most widely covered game of the year in Japan", with a high number of sales, but was released in North America "completely un-hyped and mostly unheard of".<ref name="edge_mana"/>

''Secret of Mana'' was awarded Game of the Month in December 1993 and Best Role-Playing Game of 1993 by ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''.<ref name="egm"/><ref name="egmbuyersguide1994"/> The magazine's reviewers heavily praised the graphics, music, and multiplayer gameplay, saying that it had "some of the best music I've ever heard from a cartridge". They hoped that other companies would take the game's lead in adding multiplayer modes to role-playing games.<ref name="egm"/> ''[[GameFan|Diehard GameFan]]''{{'}}s review of the game named the multiplayer as the game's best component, with reviewer Kelly Rickards saying that while the graphics were nice, the multiplayer "made the game".<ref name="DGFreview"/> ''[[GamePro]]''{{'}}s review, however, praised the graphics and plot, while stating that the gameplay and multiplayer were "rough around the edges".<ref name="GPreview"/>

A reviewer for ''Edge'' magazine said that ''Secret of Mana'' was better than contemporary role-playing games ''[[Ys I & II]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'', and ''[[Landstalker: The Treasures of King Nole]]''. The reviewer stated that ''Secret of Mana'' "includes some of the best game design and features ever seen: simultaneous threeplayer action, the best combat system ever designed, the best player interface ever designed, a superb control system, and yes, some of the most engrossing and rewarding gameplay yet". They concluded that the game was one of the best action RPGs or adventure games.<ref name="edge_mana"/> Game designer [[Sandy Petersen]] reviewed the game in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'', and described the game as much like ''[[The Legend of Zelda|Zelda]]'' but with conventional role-playing game features. He predicted that the game would be regarded as a classic. Peterson concluded that ''Secret of Mana'' was one of the best SNES role-playing games and that it was "a much larger game than ''Zelda'', with many more types of monsters, character options, and fortresses to explore".<ref name="Dragon208"/>

In 2008, Lucas Thomas of [[IGN]] reviewed the [[Virtual Console]] port of ''Secret of Mana'' and stated that it was considered one of the best video games ever made.<ref name="IGN"/> [[Eurogamer]]'s Dan Whitehead also recommended the port, describing it as "essential" and as the formative game of the ''Mana'' series.<ref name="EUROG"/> The [[iOS]] port of the game was praised by Nadia Oxford of Slide to Play for its improved graphics and computer-controlled characters. She also praised the quality of the touch controls relative to other role-playing game phone versions, though she disliked that the multiplayer mode had been removed.<ref name="StP"/>

In 2014, ''Edge'' magazine described ''Secret of Mana'' as "one of the high points of the 16bit era". A writer for the magazine noted that, 20 years after ''Secret of Mana''{{'}}s release, its reputation as a SNES action RPG had been surpassed only by that of ''The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past''.<ref name="EDGEretro"/> Review aggregator site [[GameRankings]] lists the game as the 13th-highest rated SNES game.<ref name=GameRankings/> In 1996, ''[[Super Play]]'' ranked ''Secret of Mana'' eighth on its list of the best 100 SNES games of all time.<ref name="superplay"/> It took 42nd place on ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine's 2006 "Top 200 Nintendo Games of All Time" list, and the magazine called it the 86th best game on a Nintendo system.<ref name="NP Top 200"/> IGN's "Top 100 Games" list ranked the game at number 48 in 2005,<ref name="IGNtop05"/> number 49 in 2006,<ref name="IGNtop06"/> and number 79 in 2007.<ref name="IGNtop07"/> ''Secret of Mana'' was an influential game in its time, and its influence continued into the 2010s. Elements such as its ring menu system, described by ''Edge'' as "oft-mimicked", were borrowed by later games such as ''[[The Temple of Elemental Evil (video game)|The Temple of Elemental Evil]]''.<ref name="EDGEretro"/><ref name="DDbook"/> Its cooperative multiplayer gameplay has been mentioned as an influence on ''[[Dungeon Siege III]]''.<ref name="NowGamer"/> The [[Mana (series)#Common elements|Rabite]] enemy introduced in ''Secret of Mana'' became a mascot character for the ''[[Mana (series)|''Mana'' series]].<ref name="EDGEretro"/>

The {{nihongo|'''shamisen''' or '''samisen'''|???||literally "three strings"}}, also called {{nihongo|'''sangen'''|??||literally "three strings"}}, is a three-stringed, Japanese [[musical instrument]] played with a [[plectrum]] called a ''[[bachi]]''. 

The [[Japanese pronunciation]] is usually "shamisen" but sometimes "jamisen" [[rendaku|when used as a suffix]] (e.g., [[Tsugaru-jamisen]]).<ref>[http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/ The Stringed Instrument Database]</ref> (In western Japan, and often in Edo-period sources, it is sometimes "samisen.")

The construction of the shamisen varies in shape and size, depending on the genre in which it is used.  The instrument used to accompany [[kabuki]] has a thin neck, facilitating the agile and virtuosic requirements of that genre. The instrument used to accompany [[Bunraku|puppet plays]] and [[Min'yo|folk songs]] has a longer and thicker neck to match the more robust music of those genres. 

==Construction==
The ''shamisen'' is a plucked stringed instrument. Its construction follows a model similar to that of a [[guitar]] or a [[banjo]], with a neck and strings stretched across a resonating body. The neck of the ''shamisen'' is [[fret]]less and slimmer than that of a guitar or banjo. The body, called the {{nihongo|'''d?'''|?}}, resembles a drum, having a hollow body that is taut front and back with skin, in the manner of a [[banjo]]. The skin used depends on the genre of music and the skill of the player. Student ''shamisen'' often use dog skin, and sometimes plastic, as they are cheaper to replace, and more durable. The ''shamisen'' of professional players are often taut in cat skin, as it is more delicate and expensive. It is said that the best sound quality is produced from a ''shamisen'' bound in cat skin. In the past a special type of paper was used and recently various types of plastics are being tried. On the skin of some of the best ''shamisen'', the position of the cat's nipples can still be seen.<ref>{{ cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204024229/http://www.itchu.com/e/e_parts_shamisen.html |archivedate=2008-02-04 |url=http://www.itchu.com/e/e_parts_shamisen.html |title=The parts of a Shamisen |website=www.itchu.com }}</ref>

The {{nihongo|'''sao'''|?}}, or neck of the shamisen is usually divided into three or four pieces that fit and lock together. Indeed, most shamisen are made so that they can be easily disassembled and stowed to save space. The neck of the shamisen is a singular rod that crosses the drum-like body of the instrument, partially protruding at the other side of the body and there acting as an anchor for the strings. The pegs used to wind the strings are long, thin and hexagonal in shape. They were traditionally fashioned out of ivory, but as it has become a rare resource, they have been recently fashioned out of other materials, such as various kinds of wood and plastic.

The three strings are traditionally made of [[silk]], or, more recently, nylon. They are taut between the pegs at the head of the instrument, and a cloth tailpiece anchored at the end of the rod which protrudes on the other side of the body. The strings are stretched across the ''d?'', raised from it by means of a bridge, or {{nihongo|'''koma'''|?}}, which rests directly on the taut skin. The lowest string is purposefully laid lower at the nut of the instrument, so that it buzzes, creating a characteristic [[timbre]] known as ''[[sawari]]'' (somewhat reminiscent of the "buzzing" of a [[sitar]], which is called ''[[jivari]]''). The upper side of the d? (when on the player's lap) is almost always protected by a cover known as a ''d? kake'', and players often wear a little band of cloth on their left hand to facilitate sliding up and down the neck, known as a ''yubikake''. The head of the instrument known as a ''tenjin'' may also be protected by a cover. The material of the strings will depend on the skill of the player. Traditionally, silk strings are used. However, silk breaks easily over a short time, so this is reserved for professional performances. Students often use nylon or 'tetron' strings, which last longer than silk, and are also less expensive.

===Variations in construction and playing method===
[[Image:Shamisen compare.JPG|thumb|left|The heike shamisen compared with a medium-sized, or chuzao shamisen.]]
The construction of the shamisen varies in shape and size, depending on the genre in which it is used. The bachi used will also be different according to genre, if it is used at all. Shamisen are classified according to size and genre. There are three basic sizes; ''hosozao'', ''chuzao'' and ''futozao''. Examples of shamisen genres include ''nagauta'', ''jiuta'', ''min'yo'', ''kouta'', ''hauta'', ''shinnai'', ''tokiwazu'', ''kiyomoto'', ''gidayu'' and ''tsugaru''.

'''Hosozao'''<br />
The {{nihongo|'''hosozao'''|??||literally "thin neck"}}, as its Japanese name implies, is the smallest kind of shamisen. The body is small and particularly square-shaped, with a particularly thin neck, which tapers away from the strings just as it approaches the body. Generally, the ''hosozao'' is used in [[nagauta]], the shorter and thinner neck facilitating the agile and virtuosic requirements of [[Kabuki]]. Hosozao shamisen especially built for nagauta ensembles is often simply known as a "nagauta shamisen." The hosozao is also often used in [[kouta (music)|kouta]], where it is plucked with the fingernails.

'''Chuzao'''<br />
The {{nihongo|'''chuzao'''|??||literally "middle neck"}} is a size up from the ''hosozao''. As its name implies, the neck is slightly thicker. As the neck approaches the body of the instrument, the distance between the strings and the fingerboard is maintained, unlike the ''hosozao'', where it tapers off. The fingerboard ends abruptly, and the rest of the neck curves sharply into the body of the instrument. The pronounced curve that occurs just before the neck meets the body is called {{nihongo|'''hatomune'''|??||literally "pigeon's breast"}}. The result is an extended fingerboard that gives the ''chuzao'' a higher register than the ''hosozao''. The ''chuzao'' is favored for [[jiuta]] style playing, with a broader, more mellow timbre. It is also an "all-round" instrument that can actually be used across many genres.

'''Futozao'''<br />
Finally, {{nihongo|'''futozao'''|??||literally "fat neck"}} are used in the robust music of [[Gidayubushi]] (the music of [[Bunraku]]), [[J?ruri (music)|Joruri]] Min'yo, and [[Tsugaru-jamisen]]. In these genres, a thicker neck facilitates the greater force used in playing the music of these styles. The ''futozao'' of Tsugaru-jamisen is quite a recent innovation, and is purposefully constructed in a much larger size than traditional style shamisens, and its neck is much longer and thicker than the traditional nagauta or jiuta shamisens.

'''Variations in Bachi'''<br />
The ''bachi'' or plectrum used to play the shamisen also differ in size, shape, and material from genre to genre. The bachi used for nagauta shamisen are made out of three possible materials, i.e. wood, plastic, or ivory. While many nagauta teachers do not approve of the use of plastic, if ivory is unattainable and wood is still out of price range, plastic will suffice. Jiuta bachi are made entirely out of plastic or ivory, or plastic and tortoiseshell (bekko), or ivory and tortoiseshell. Jiuta bachi are the easiest identified because they are the longest, the widest and also have a deep indentation where the tortoiseshell meets the handle. There are sometimes also jiuta bachi that are made with a buffalo horn handle. The material however makes no difference in the sound. [[Gidayu]] shamisen uses the heaviest and thickest bachi, which however is not as wide as a nagauta bachi. The bachi used for tsugaru shamisen is the smallest. It is almost always tipped with tortoiseshell.
[[Image:Bachi compare.JPG|thumb|left|Pictured: Bachi for minyo, tsugaru and heike shamisens.]]

'''Other variations'''<br />
The ''koma'', or bridge, can be fashioned out of aged bamboo, ivory, ox-bone (shari), rosewood, buffalo horn, k?ki wood, any combination of the above, or plastic for the student level. Koma come in many heights. The higher the koma, the louder the sound will be, and the harder it is to control a rapid "sukui". The higher koma are not suitable for beginners. 

'''Koma variations'''

'''Nagauta Koma'''<br />
Heights used: 3.2 - 3.6
Koma for Nagauta are fashioned out of only three materials, i.e. ivory, bone, and plastic. Ivory is the most expensive and produces the most desirable sound and amplification, but due to its high price tag is normally only used in performances. Ox-Bone or "Shari" is the most popular koma for practice and with students who are performing. Because of Ivory's volume and vibration it is normally used by a teacher or "Tate-jamisen" (lead shamisen), so that the other players can follow their tone and signals. Plastic is becoming increasingly harder to find simply because it does not produce a desirable sound when compared to Shari koma. Shari is not much more expensive than plastic, and most teachers openly express their displeasure with plastic koma and require shari.

'''Jiuta Koma'''<br />
Heights used: 2.6 and 2.8 are the standard.
(Other heights may be available if specially ordered.)
Koma for Jiuta are made out of a few select materials,  i.e. yellow or black water buffalo horn ("suigyu") are the standard for Jiuta. Blackwater buffalo horn does not have a significant sound difference when cut in the Jiuta koma style, and is far less popular. Yellow suigyu is the most widely used for Jiuta style shamisen, both in practice and performance. Plastic is available because of the higher price tag of Suigyu. Many people believe that for Jiuta, there is not a great sound difference between the two, but there is a high change in vibration. Plastic makes a deader sound, which is not the most favorable for Jiuta. Shari is used from time to time in practice, but never for Jiuta performances.

'''Tsugaru/Min'yo Koma'''<br />
Heights Used:2.6, sometimes 2.7, and 2.8
Tsugaru Koma are very easily identifiable due to their unique structure and use of two different materials. Tsugaru Koma are very thin in width, and are not very high. The base is usually made of either bamboo, smoked bamboo, or a wood of some kind, while the top half in which the strings pass through can be made of ivory, bone, or tortoiseshell. Because of the thickness of both the strings and neck of the Futozao shamisen, the Tsugaru bridge in general tends to be longer than the others. One should note not to confuse a Gidayu (Highest Koma made, fashioned out of black buffalo horn) or Kiyomoto koma (looks exactly like Nagauta koma but is much wider at the base) with Tsugaru.

Shamisen used for traditional genres of Japanese music, such as jiuta, kouta, and nagauta, adhere to very strict standards. Purists of these genres demand that the shamisens be made of the correct wood, the correct skin, and are played with the correct bachi. There is little room for variation. The tsugaru-jamisen, on the other hand, has lent itself to modern use, and is used in modern genres such as jazz and rock. As a more open instrument, variations of it exist for show. The tuning pegs, which are usually fashioned out of [[ivory]], and bachi which are fashioned from a combination of ivory and tortoise-shell for example, are sometimes made of [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] material to give the shamisen a more modern, flashy look. Recently, [[avant-garde]] inventors have developed a Tsugaru-jamisen with electric pickups to be used with amplifiers, like the electric guitar: the electric tsugaru-jamisen [http://www.shamisen-katoh.com/e/AXIS.htm] has been born.

The Heike (??) shamisen is a shamisen particularly fashioned for the performance of the song [[Heike Ondo]], a folk tune originating from [[Shimonoseki]], [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]]. The neck of the Heike Shamisen is about half the length of most shamisen, giving the instrument the high range needed to play Heike Ondo. The use of more typical shamisen is possible, but they must be properly adjusted with a [[capo]] device to raise their pitch to make them suitable for use.

==Variations in playing==
[[Image:ShamisenBuskerPittStreetSydney.JPG|thumb|left|A [[busker]] playing a shamisen in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]]]
[[Image:Minyo bachi.JPG|thumb|left|Pictured: Bachi, or plectrum for the shamisen.]]
In most genres the shamisen, the strings are plucked with a ''bachi''. The sound of a shamisen is similar in some respects to that of the American [[banjo]], in that the drum-like ''d?'', amplifies the sound of the strings.  As in the [[clawhammer]] style of American banjo playing, the bachi is often used to strike both string and skin, creating a highly percussive sound. In {{nihongo|'''kouta'''|??||literally "small song"}} style shamisen, and occasionally in other genres, the shamisen is plucked with the fingers.

==Tuning==
The shamisen is played and tuned according to genre. The nomenclature of the nodes in an [[octave]] also varies according to genre.  In truth, there are myriad styles of Shamisen across Japan, and tunings, tonality and notation vary to some degree. Three of the most commonly recognized tunings across all genres are "honchoshi" (???), "ni agari" (????), and "san sagari" (????).

'''Honchoshi'''<br />
"Honchoshi" means "home tuning" or "base tuning," and it is called so because other tunings are considered derivatives of this one tuning. For ''honchoshi'', the first and third strings are tuned an octave apart, while the middle string is tuned to the equivalent of a fourth, in Western terms, from the 1st string. An example of this is D, G, D.

'''Ni Agari'''<br />
"Ni agari" means "raised two" or "raised second," and this refers to the fact that the pitch of the second string is raised (from honchoshi), increasing the interval of the first and second strings to a fifth (conversely decreasing the interval between the second and third strings to a fourth). An example of this is D, A, D.

'''San Sagari'''<br />
"San sagari," which means "lowered three" or "lowered third" refers to tuning the shamisen to honchoshi and lowering the 3rd string (the string with the highest pitch) down a whole step, so that now the instrument is tuned in fourths, e.g. D, G, C.

Instead of having a set tuning, such as on a guitar (i.e. E, A, D, G, B, E) or a violin (i.e. G, D, A, E), the shamisen is tuned according to the register of the singer, or simply to the liking of the player. The shamisen player can tune the shamisen to whatever register desired, so long as the above conventions are followed.

==Musical notation==
[[Image:Shami tab vertical.jpg|thumb|middle|Vertical shamisen tablature, read from right to left. Nodes for the 3rd string are indicated by Arabic numerals, for the 2nd string by Chinese numerals, and for the 1st string by Chinese numerals preceded by ?.]][[Image:Shami tab horizontal.jpg|thumb|right|Horizontal shamisen tablature, read from left to right. Similar to guitar tablature, three horizontal lines represent the strings of the shamisen. Nodes are represented by Arabic numerals, and note subdivisions are indicated by lines under them.]]

Music for the shamisen can be written in Western music notation, but is more often written in [[tablature]] notation. While tunings might be similar across genres, the way in which the nodes on the neck of the instrument (called {{nihongo|'''tsubo'''|?}} in Japanese) are named is not. As a consequence, tablature for each genre is written differently. For example, in [[min'yo]] style shamisen, nodes on the shamisen are labeled from 0, the open string called "0". However, in [[jiuta]] style shamisen, nodes are subdivided and named by octave, with "1" being the open string and first note in an octave, starting over at the next octave. The nodes are also labeled differently for Tsugaru style shamisen. To add to the confusion, sometimes nodes can be "sharped," and since the names of nodes and their positions are different for each genre, these will also vary. Consequently, students of one genre of shamisen will find it difficult to read tablature from other genres of shamisen, unless they are specially trained to read these kinds of tablatures.

[[Tablature]] can be written in traditional Japanese vertical right-to-left notation, or it can be written in more modern horizontal left-to-right notation, which resembles modern guitar tablature. In traditional vertical notation, Chinese characters and older symbols for dynamics are used, however notation from Western style music notation, such as Italian names for dynamics, [[time signature]] and the [[fermata]] have been imported. What tuning a work calls for is usually indicated on the tablature.

==History and genres==
The Japanese ''shamisen'' originated from the Chinese instrument ''[[sanxian]]'' ({{zh|c=??}}).<ref name="leiter">{{cite book|last=Leiter|first=Samuel L.|title=Encyclopedia of Asian Theatre: A-N|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-33530-3|page=445|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JttNAAAAYAAJ}}</ref><ref name="koda">{{cite book|title=Kodansha encyclopedia of Japan , Volume 7|year=1983|isbn=978-0-87011-627-8|page=77|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ean3cAAACAAJ&dq=Kodansha+encyclopedia+of+Japan}}</ref><ref name="malm">{{cite book|last=Malm|first=William P.|title=Traditional Japanese music and musical instruments, Volume 1|year=2000|publisher=Kodansha International|isbn=978-4-7700-2395-7|page=213|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Yn3VQbqywCsC}}</ref><ref name="pick">{{cite book|last=Picken|first=Laurence E.

The shamisen can be played solo or with other shamisen, in ensembles with other Japanese instruments, with singing such as [[nagauta]], or as an accompaniment to drama, notably [[kabuki]] and [[bunraku]]. Both men and women traditionally played the shamisen.

The most famous and perhaps most demanding of the narrative styles is giday?, named after Takemoto Giday? (1651–1714), who was heavily involved in the [[bunraku]] puppet-theater tradition in [[Osaka]]. The giday? shamisen and its plectrum are the largest of the shamisen family, and the singer-narrator is required to speak the roles of the play, as well as to sing all the commentaries on the action. The singer-narrator role is often so vocally taxing that the performers are changed halfway through a scene. There is little notated in the books (''maruhon'') of the tradition except the words and the names of certain appropriate generic shamisen responses. The shamisen player must know the entire work perfectly in order to respond effectively to the interpretations of the text by the singer-narrator. From the 19th century female performers known as ''onna-j?ruri'' or ''onna giday?'' also carried on this concert tradition.

In the early part of the 20th century, blind musicians, including [[Shirakawa Gunpachir?]] (1909–1962), [[Takahashi Chikuzan]] (1910–1998), and sighted players such as [[Kida Rinsh?ei]] (1911–1979), evolved a new style of playing, based on traditional folk songs ("[[Min'yo|min'y?]]") but involving much [[improvisation]] and flashy fingerwork. This style - now known as [[Tsugaru-jamisen]], after the home region of this style in the north of [[Honsh?]] - continues to be relatively popular in Japan. The virtuosic [[Tsugaru-jamisen]] style is sometimes compared to [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[banjo]].

''Kouta'' (??) is the style of song learned by [[geisha]] and [[Maiko (geiko)|maiko]]. Its name literally means "small" or "short song," which contrasts with the music genre found in bunraku and kabuki, otherwise known as [[nagauta]] (long song).

''Jiuta'' (??), or literally "earthen music" is a more classical style of shamisen music.

===Shamisen in non-traditional genres===
One contemporary shamisen player, [[Takeharu Kunimoto]], plays bluegrass music on the shamisen, having spent a year studying bluegrass at [[East Tennessee State University]] and performing with a bluegrass band based there. Another player using the Tsugaru-jamisen in non-traditional genres is [[Michihiro Sato]], who plays [[free improvisation]] on the instrument.

Japanese American jazz pianist [[Glenn Horiuchi]] played shamisen in his performances and recordings.

A duo popular in Japan known as the [[Yoshida Brothers]] developed an energetic style of playing heavily influenced by fast aggressive soloing that emphasizes speed and twang; which is usually associated with rock music on the electric guitar.

Metal guitarist [[Marty Friedman (musician)|Marty Friedman]] has often used a shamisen in his recordings to give a more exotic sound to his music.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_For_Speeding Marty Friedman - Music For Speeding</ref>

[[Takeshi Terauchi]] & Bunnys utilized shamisen played by [[Michiya Mihashi]] in combo with their instrumental rock group on their single "Tsugaru Jongara Bushi"<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzlCAAwZv7A</ref>  with "Dark Eyes".<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa9h4qI_AMI</ref>

Japanese extreme metal band [[Zenithrash]] played shamisen and shakuhachi in their latest album to achieve the band's ideal of Japanized extreme metal.<ref>http://www.myspace.com/zenithrash</ref>

Japanese rock musician [[Gackt]] opened his "Sixth Day Seventh Night" concerts in 2004 seated on stage with a shamisen, joined by two musicians from his band, GacktJOB, also playing shamisen.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Japanese rock musician [[Miyavi]] has also played the shamisen on various occasions, incorporating its use in albums and during [[concert]]s (e.g. during the debut live of [[Supergroup (music)|superband]] [[Skin (Japanese band)|S.K.I.N]] concert at the 2007 [[Anime Expo]] convention at [[Long Beach, California]] on June 29, 2007).<ref>http://www.jmusicamerica.com/us/article.php?id=2713 S.K.I.N. debut concert live report at JAME</ref>

Japanese traditional and jazz musician [[Hiromitsu Agatsuma]] incorporates a diverse mix of genres into his music. He arranged several [[jazz standards]] and other famous western songs for the shamisen on his latest album, ''[[Agatsuma Plays Standards]]''.<!--need year of release--> His previous recordings displayed [[funk]], [[electro music]] and traditional Japanese styles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}<!--When did he begin playing non-traditional music on the shamisen?-->  instrument also used in the music of pop speed metal band BabyMetal (Japan) can be seen in their music videos and live onstage

[[Image:I-4 east exits 111A-B.jpg|thumb|right|Exit numbers on [[Interstate 4]] in [[Volusia County, Florida]]. In this case, mile-based exits 111A and 111B had been sequential exits 53CA and 53CB, as the 'OLD 53CA' tab shows.]]
[[Image:I-4 west exit 58.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.64|On a road with distance-based exit numbering, the exit number (shown here on a [[gore (road)|gore]] sign) matches a nearby mile or kilometer marker.]]
[[Image:Puerto_RICO_HGW.JPG|thumb|right|[[Puerto Rico]] is the only place in the United States that uses Spanish like the "Salida 5B" sign.]]
An '''exit number''' is a number assigned to a [[road junction]], usually an exit from a [[freeway]]. It is usually marked on the same sign as the destinations of the exit, as well as a sign in the [[gore (road)|gore]].

Exit numbers typically reset at political borders such as [[U.S. state|state]] lines.<ref>[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/HTM/2003r1/part2/part2e2.htm#section2E28]</ref> In some areas, such as [[New Jersey]] (and its [[New Jersey Turnpike]]), the numbers are a part of popular culture; a [[cliché]]d greeting is "what exit?".

Some non-[[freeway]]s use exit numbers. Typically these are rural roads built to [[Limited-access road|expressway]] standards{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, and either only the actual exits are numbered, or the at-grade intersections are also numbered. An extreme case of this is in [[New York City]], where the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]] and [[Linden Boulevard]] were given sequential numbers, one per intersection (both boulevards no longer have exit numbers as of 2011). A milder version of this has been recently used on the [[West Side Highway]], also in New York, where only the major intersections are numbered (possibly to match the planned exits on the cancelled [[Westway (New York)|Westway]] freeway). Another case is the [[Nanaimo Parkway]] in [[Nanaimo, British Columbia]] carrying [[British Columbia Highway 19|Highway 19]], where all exits are numbered though all except one are at-grade intersections. Some other intersections on Highway 19 outside Nanaimo are also given numbers.

As a means of educating motorists, some [[state highway]] maps include a brief explanation of the exit numbering system on an inset. [[Iowa Department of Transportation|Iowa DOT]] maps from the 1980s and 1990s included a picture or drawing of a [[milestone|milepost]] and briefly described how Iowa had included milepost references near interchanges on the map.

==Sequential numbers==
[[Image:NJTP exit 8.JPG|thumb|left|The [[New Jersey Turnpike]], with its unusual exit signage, displaying exit 8. This interchange was opened in 1951.]]
[[Image:NJTP exit 8A.JPG|thumb|left|The New Jersey Turnpike at exit 8A several miles after exit 8. This interchange was opened in the 1970s, which is why the suffix exists.]]
The first exit numbers were [[sequential]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. This type of exit numbers usually begins with exit 1 at the beginning of the road; each subsequent exit is given the next number. The first implementations gave each ramp its own number, even when two ramps existed for two directions of a road{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}; later implementations used directional suffixes, as in 15N/15S or 15E/15W{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, and current [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] practice is to use 15A/15B. In [[France]] and [[Japan]], decimals are used, as in 15.1 and 15.2.

[[Toll road]]s, especially those using tickets, lend themselves nicely to sequential numbering, as each toll plaza gets its own number. Problems arise when exits are added. For instance, an exit between 15 and 16 would typically be 15A{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. On the [[New York State Thruway]], an exit was added between 21 and 21A, leading to the sequence 21 - 21B - 21A - 22. In [[Florida]], some new exits got the suffix C, so that if it had or acquired separate exits for the two directions, they would be 15CA and 15CB rather than 15AA and 15AB.  There are also occurrences of this happening on the New Jersey Turnpike as well, with the original interchanges opening in 1951, with some new ones opening in the 1970s and 1982. On the [[Baltimore Beltway]], there is an exit 12B and C: [[Maryland Route 372|MD 372]], but an exit 12A: [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]]. There is also an exit 8A: [[Interstate 895 (Maryland)|I-895]] and an exit 8: [[Maryland Route 168|MD 168]].

Occasionally sequential exits are renumbered due to added exits. For instance, the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] in [[New York]] was renumbered so that its northernmost exit, 27, became 30. However, the [[Merritt Parkway]], which continued its exit numbers in [[Connecticut]], was not renumbered, and the sequence now jumps from 30 down to 27 (the interchange on the state line had two exit 27s, and now has exits 30 and 27).

The [[Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] uses letters without numbers for its exits; it has many exits in a short distance, and the [[South Jersey Transportation Authority]] may have wanted to avoid sequential numbers.

==Distance-based numbers==<!-- This section is linked from [[Distance]] -->
[[Image:Quebec exit number.jpg|thumb|right|An exit sign (kilometer-based) on [[Quebec Autoroute 640]] in [[Quebec]]]]
[[Image:Quebec exit gore sign.jpg|thumb|upright=0.505|An exit gore sign on [[Autoroute 35]] in [[Quebec]]]]
As more highways were built, the limitations of sequential numbering became clear{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, and states began to experiment with '''distance-based''' ('''mile-based''') exit numbers. The first mile-based system known was implemented on the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey in the late 1950s. Michigan also implemented mile-based junction numbers on Interstate 94 in the 1960s. In this system, the number of miles from the beginning of the highway to the exit is used for the exit number. If two exits would end up with the same number, the numbers are sometimes modified slightly; this is often impossible and exits are given sequential or directional suffixes, just as with sequential numbers.

An exit can be numbered by where the exit in the direction of increased mileage leaves the freeway, or by where the road that the exit serves crosses the freeway (which is occasionally ambiguous). From this number, the [[integer]] exit number can be determined by rounding up, rounding down, or rounding to the nearest integer. Many jurisdictions prefer to avoid an exit 0. To this end, the numbers are either rounded up to get the exit number, or any exit that would get the number 0 is instead numbered 1.  Examples of highways with an exit 0 are [[British Columbia Highway 1]] on the mainland, [[Interstate 70]] in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]] along the [[West Virginia]]-[[Ohio]] border, [[Interstate 90]] on the Montana side of the  [[Idaho]]-[[Montana]] border, and [[Interstate 65]] in two locations: at its terminus with [[Interstate 10]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]], and just north of the [[Ohio River]] in [[Jeffersonville, Indiana]].

In areas that use the [[metric system]], distance-based numbers are by kilometer rather than mile. A few highways, such as [[Delaware Route 1]] and [[Interstate 19]], have been renumbered from miles to kilometers, even in areas that typically use miles.

Distance-based numbers have several advantages. They match the [[milepost]]s along the road; it is thus easy to calculate how far one has to go. Additionally, most new exits don't need letter suffixes, as in a sequential system{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

On the other hand, there are some disadvantages to changing from a sequential system. Suffixes are required when the same mile of highway contains multiple exits; the extreme example is along [[Interstate 70]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where there are 23 exits in the same mile, numbered 2A through 2Y (the I and O suffixes are skipped because of their resemblance to 1 and 0 respectively). Businesses and motorists have to adapt to the changes, and it costs money to replace the signs (as well as for temporary "old exit" tabs to ease the transition). Additionally, some argue that it is pointless to change to mile-based numbers, as the numbers would have to be replaced again if the [[United States|U.S.]] switches to the [[metric system]]. [[Ontario]]'s [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] changed to a mile-based system from a sequential system of exit numbers, then had to switch again to a kilometre-based system when Canada [[metrification|metricized]] in 1977.

==Exit numbers by country==

===Australia===
Uses distance based numbering on a section of the M1 (Pacific Motorway) south of Brisbane.

===British Isles and Continental Europe===
Most European countries use sequential numbering schemes. Spain uses distance-based numbering on its Autovias, but not on its Autopistas. Austria and the Czech Republic use distance-based schemes. A number of European countries (including the Netherlands, Belgium and France) do not number motorway intersections, apparently because one cannot "exit" the motorway there. Countries like Germany and Switzerland have attributed numbers to their exit, but instead of the usual exit symbol, they are given a specific interchange symbol.

Italy only uses (sequential) numbering on the ring roads of a couple of cities, including the ring road of Rome (''GRA'') and Milan (''Tangenziali''). At one time, it referred to junctions on the [[Autostrada del Sole]]<ref>[http://mryamamoto.50megs.com/Autostrada_del_sole.html Autostrada Del Sole]</ref> by number, and published same on toll tickets; though these may not have been posted on signs.

Both the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] use sequential numbering systems, with the junction number indicated by a white number in a black square in the corner of signs. In the [[United Kingdom]] they are frequently referenced in the media as the number with "J" on front of it, with for example Junction 1 being referred to as "J1". If a junction is newly constructed to between two existing junctions, it is normally allocated the number of the lower of the two junctions, with the letter "A" attached (and so on). For example, a new junction opened between junctions 3 and 4 would become Junction 3A.

In the Republic of Ireland, junction numbers have existed since the opening of the first section of the [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50 motorway]] in 1990, however due to the short length of Irish motorways until the early 2000s they were normally ignored by the general public. They are beginning to come into popular usage now, and since 2005 have been given greater prominence on road signs. With the development of the inter-urban motorway network under the [[National Development Plan]] and [[Transport 21]], the [[National Roads Authority]] has adopted a numbering scheme for the inter-urban roads that will see Junction 1 being designated as that road's junction with the M50 in most cases. This has meant renumbering of existing junctions on some motorways, most notably the [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7 motorway]]. Non-motorway dual carriageways forming part of major inter-urban roads also have junction numbers, however only grade-separated interchanges are numbered.

===Canada===
Most Canadian provinces use kilometre-based exit numbers.

*[[Ontario]] has the oldest exit number system, having started posting exit numbers sequentially in the [[1960s]] along [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]]; it switched to mile-based numbering before Canada went metric. Most short freeways do not have exit numbers, and until about 2000 (with Highways [[Highway 11 (Ontario)|11]] and [[Highway 69 (Ontario)|69]]/[[Highway 400 (Ontario)|400]]), incomplete freeways also did not have exit numbers.

*[[Quebec]] has the second oldest system; it also used mile-based junction numbering before the Canadian metric conversion in the mid-1970s.

*[[Manitoba]] has the fewest posted exit numbers. [[Manitoba Highway 1|Highway 1]] has three numbered exits. Exit numbers were first posted on the [[Perimeter Highway]] in 2001. 

*[[Alberta]] has the newest exit number system. The province started posting exit numbers on [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]] in 2004, and has since extended the system to Highways [[Alberta Highway 1|1]], [[Alberta Highway 16|16]], [[Alberta Highway 201|201]], and [[Alberta Highway 216|216]].

Sequential numbers are only used in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. 

*[[Nova Scotia]] also numbers level junctions on designated express highways.

*[[Saskatchewan]] does not really use exit numbers. On a section of [[Saskatchewan Highway 11|Highway 11]] from [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] to [[Lumsden, Saskatchewan|Lumsden]], letters "A", "B", and "C" are used sequentially as "exit letters" instead.

The territories of [[Yukon Territory|Yukon]], [[Nunavut]], and [[Northwest Territories]] use no exit numbers, as there are no [[freeway]]s or [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] in the territories. [[Prince Edward Island]] has no exit numbers either, as there is only one interchange in the province.

===Hong Kong===
{{further|Hong Kong Strategic Route and Exit Number System}}

Exit numbers were introduced to major [[Hong Kong]] routes in 2004, in conjunction with the re-organization of the route numbers. A sequential numbering scheme is used.

===Japan===
The main expressway system uses sequential numbering; Metropolitan Expressway systems also use sequential junction numbeing, usually appended with the expressway number expressed thusly: 5-1; 5-2, etc. There are multiple toll expressways not operated by the major national syndicates or the Metropolitan Expressway Authorities that have no junction numbering scheme.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand began introducing exit numbers in 2005. It uses a distance-based numbering system. The distance to the exit is measured from the origin of the highway. That is:
* State Highway 1 (Northern motorway) measured from the origin of SH1 at [[Cape Reinga]]
* State Highway 16 (Northwestern Motorway) measured from the origin at the Port
* State Highway 20 (Southwestern Motorway) measured from the origin at SH1

There is no exit zero. If there is an exit within 1.499&nbsp;km of the origin, Exit 1 is used. Exit 2 would be between 1.500 and 2.499&nbsp;km of the origin. Subsequent 'exit zones' are at 1&nbsp;km intervals.

Letter suffixes are added at multi-exit interchanges, or where two or more exits exist within the same exit zone. For example, State Highway 1 (Southern Motorway) has an Exit 429A (Symonds St), Exit 429B (Wellesley St) and Exit 429C (Port).

Instead of replacing existing ramp and link signs, the exit numbers were added as supplementary information. Thus drivers can navigate either by exit number or name.

Exit numbers are only used for exits that may be used by all vehicle types. Bus- or emergency vehicle-only exits would not be numbered.

===Philippines===
Metric distance based numbers are used on the tollways radiating from Manila. Supplemental "A" and "B" designations are appended to signage at the ends of slip roads.  Freeway signage, exit tabs, and kilometer-posts are nearly identical in appearance to American freeway signage.

===South Africa===
Uses distance based numbering (in kilometers) on main motorways. Letter suffixes are added at multi-exit interchanges, an example being the Buccleuch interchange in [[Johannesburg]].

Exit numbers are reset on the borders of the provinces as they were until 1994. This means that exit numbering may change in the middle of a province.

One exception to the usual distance based numbering is the southern portion of the M4 in [[Durban]], which uses sequential numbering.

===Taiwan===
[[Image:Taiwan Freeway Exit Sign.gif|thumb|150px|Taiwan exit sign prior to 2006]]
[[Image:Taiwan Freeway New Exit Sign.gif|thumb|150px|current Taiwan exit sign]]
[[Taiwan]] uses distance-based exit numbers in kilometers.  If two exits are located within the same kilometer mark, the Roman letters are appended to differentiate the exits.  Taiwan did experiment with sequential exit numbers with National Freeway No. 1 for a couple of years, but abandoned the experiment in 2004.

Prior to 2006, Taiwan exit signs were generally near replicas of their US counterparts.  However, the exit signs now not only indicate the distance number, but they also display the Chinese code-name for the interchange.

'''Keith Allen Haring''' (May 4, 1958&nbsp;– February 16, 1990) was an [[United States|American]] artist and [[Activism|social activist]] whose work responded to the [[New York City]] street culture of the 1980s by expressing concepts of birth, death, sexuality, and war.<ref>{{citation|title=Keith Haring: The Authorized Biography|author=John Gruen|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1992|isbn=9780671781507|page=1952}}</ref> Haring's work was often heavily political<ref name="Holmes2002">{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Julia|title=100 New Yorkers: A Guide To Illustrious Lives & Locations|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zopQ1LeZfG4C&pg=PA99|accessdate=7 September 2014|date=2002-10-01|publisher=Little Bookroom|isbn=9781892145314|pages=99–}}</ref> and his imagery has become a widely recognized visual language of the 20th century. <ref name="Haggerty2013">{{cite book|last=Haggerty|first=George|title=Encyclopedia of Gay Histories and Cultures|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Pez9AQAAQBAJ&pg=PA425|accessdate=7 September 2014|date=2013-11-05|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9781135585136|pages=425–}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Keith Haring was born in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], on May 4, 1958. He was raised in [[Kutztown, Pennsylvania]], by his mother, Joanne Haring, and father, Allen Haring, an engineer and amateur cartoonist. He had three younger sisters, Kay, Karen and Kristen. Haring became interested in drawing and art at a very early age. He studied [[commercial art]] from 1976 to 1978 at [[Pittsburgh]]'s Ivy School of Professional Art but lost interest in commercial art. He moved to New York to study [[painting]]. In his junior/senior year, he was behind on credits, because his professors could not give him credit for the very loose art work he was doing with themes of social activism.

==Career==

===Early work===
He first received public attention with his public art in subways. Starting in 1980, he organized exhibitions in [[Club 57]]. The exhibitions were filmed by the photographer [[Tseng Kwong Chi]]. Around this time, "The Radiant Baby" became his symbol. His bold lines, vivid colors, and active figures carry strong messages of life and unity. He participated in the Times Square Exhibition and drew animals and human faces for the first time. That same year, he photocopied and pasted around the city provocative collages made from cut-up and recombined ''[[New York Post]]'' headlines.<ref>Karen Rosenberg (March 22, 2012), [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/arts/design/keith-haring-1978-1982-at-brooklyn-museum.html?_r=0&adxnnl=1&ref=keithharing&adxnnlx=1350332040-Tew1St7ne+xa1SjJUEOOnw A Pop Shop for a New Generation] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> In 1981, he sketched his first chalk drawings on black paper and painted plastic, metal and [[found object]]s.

By 1982, Haring established friendships with fellow emerging artists [[Futura 2000]], [[Kenny Scharf]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]]. Haring created more than 50 public works between 1982 and 1989 in dozens of cities around the world. His "Crack is Wack" mural, created in 1986, is visible from New York's FDR Drive.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909234427/http://www.haring.com/!/about-haring/bio | title=Bio (archived) | publisher=The Keith Haring Foundation | accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref> He got to know [[Andy Warhol]], who was the theme of several of Haring's pieces, including "Andy Mouse." His friendship with Warhol would prove to be a decisive element in his eventual success, particularly after their deaths.

In December 2007, an area of the American Textile Building in the [[TriBeCa]] neighborhood of New York City was discovered to contain a painting of Haring's from 1979.<ref name="hope">{{Cite news |title= A Forgotten Haring Is Found by Contractors |periodical=[[The New York Sun]] |date=December 20, 2007 |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/68386 |first=Bradley|last=Hope |accessdate=December 20, 2007 |postscript= }}</ref>

===International breakthrough===
[[File:Tuttomondo - Haring front.jpg|thumb|Tuttomondo, [[Pisa]]]]
In 1984, Haring visited Australia and painted wall murals in [[Melbourne]] (such as the 1984 'Detail-Mural at [[Collingwood College, Victoria]]') and [[Sydney]] and received a commission from the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] and the [[Australian Centre for Contemporary Art]] to create a mural which temporarily replaced the water curtain at the National Gallery.<ref>Ellis, Rennie, ''The New Australian Graffiti'', (Sun Books Melbourne, 1985)</ref> He also visited and painted in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris|Paris Museum of Modern Art]], [[Minneapolis]] and [[Manhattan]]. He even designed a jacket worn by a pink-wigged Madonna for a performance of her song "[[Like a Virgin]]" for the TV dance program ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]''.

When asked about the commercialism of his work, Haring said: "I could earn more money if I just painted a few things and jacked up the price. My shop is an extension of what I was doing in the subway stations, breaking down the barriers between high and low art."<ref name="haring-nytimes">{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Yarrow | title = Keith Haring, Artist, Dies at 31; Career Began in Subway Graffiti | date = February 17, 1990 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/17/obituaries/keith-haring-artist-dies-at-31-career-began-in-subway-graffiti.html | work = New York Times | accessdate =May 25, 2010}}</ref> By the arrival of [[Pop Shop]], his work began reflecting more [[socio-political]] themes, such as anti-[[Apartheid]], [[AIDS]] awareness, and the [[crack epidemic|crack cocaine epidemic]]. He even created several [[pop art]] pieces influenced by other products: [[Absolut Vodka]], [[Lucky Strike]] cigarettes, and [[Coca-Cola]]. In 1987 he had his own exhibitions in [[Helsinki]] and [[Antwerp]], among others. He also designed the cover for the benefit album ''[[A Very Special Christmas (album)|A Very Special Christmas]]'', on which Madonna was included. In 1988 he joined a select group of artists whose work has appeared on the label of Chateau Mouton Rothschild wine.

Haring also created public murals in the lobby and ambulatory care department of [[Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center]] on [[Flushing Avenue]], Brooklyn.

A rare video of Haring at work<ref name="haring-video">[http://www.art.com/~/keithharingcollection/ Video Clip - art.com Keith Haring Collection]</ref> shows his energetic style. Haring wrote: "I am becoming much more aware of movement. The importance of movement is intensified when a painting becomes a performance. The performance (the act of painting) becomes as important as the resulting painting."

Haring was openly [[gay]] and was a strong advocate of [[safe sex]];<ref name="sheff">{{Cite news |title= Keith Haring, An Intimate Conversation |periodical=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=August 10, 1989|url=http://www.haring.com/archives/interviews/index.html |first=David |last=Sheff |accessdate=November 14, 2007 |postscript= }}</ref> however, in 1988, he was diagnosed with AIDS. He established the Keith Haring Foundation in 1989, its mandate being to provide funding and imagery to AIDS organizations and children's programs, and to expand the audience for Haring's work through exhibitions, publications and the licensing of his images. Haring enlisted his imagery during the last years of his life to speak about his own illness and generate activism and awareness about AIDS. In 1989, at the invitation of the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center to join a show of site-specific artwork for the building, at 208 West 13th Street, Haring chose the second-floor men's room for his mural ''Once Upon a Time''.<ref>David W. Dunlap (March 7, 2012), [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3D91E39F934A35750C0A9649D8B63&ref=keithharing A Joyous Mural, Born In an Era Filled With Fear] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> In June, on the rear wall of the convent of the Church of Sant'Antonio (in Italian: ''Chiesa di Sant'Antonio abate'') in [[Pisa]] ([[Italy]]), he painted the last public work of his life, the mural "Tuttomondo" (translation: "the whole world").

==Influences==
Haring's work very clearly demonstrates many important political and personal influences. Ideas about his sexual orientation are apparent throughout his work and his journals clearly confirm its impact on his work. Heavy symbolism speaking about the AIDS epidemic is vivid in his later pieces, such as ''Untitled (cat. no. 27)'', ''Silence=Death'' and his sketch ''Weeping Woman''. In some of his works—including cat. no. 27—the symbolism is subtle, but Haring also produced some blatantly activist works. ''Silence=Death'' is almost universally agreed upon as a work of [[Activism|HIV/AIDS activism]].<ref name="Haring, Keith 2001">Haring, Keith, Götz Adriani, and Ralph Melcher. Keith Haring: Heaven and Hell. Ostfildern-Ruit, Germany: Hatje Cantz, 2001. Print.</ref>

===Sexuality===
One of many consistent ideas, sexuality, was a predominant theme throughout Haring's work. Through much of his art there are scenes of penetration, in a bodily and sexual sense. These scenes are often filled with monsters, skeletons and beasts, which almost always adds a nightmarish feeling to the work. Rather than being something positive or affirming, sexuality is almost always presented as threatening or silence. "Rape, sexual compulsion and castration are the fundamental forms in which individual self-determination is forcibly prevented."<ref name="Haring, Keith 2001"/> For Haring, sex was part of his work because it was part of his life. "It's inevitable that the subway drawings have it too because it's part of my life and part of the rest of the body of work," he said.<ref name="Haring, Keith 1991">Haring, Keith. Barry Blinderman. Keith Haring: Future Primeval. Normal, Ill: University Galleries, Illinois State University, 1991. Print.</ref> Haring's perception of sex was later affected by constant fear as the threat of AIDS became apparent.

It is possible that the drama in Haring's work demonstrate the stigma associated with homosexual relationships, in particular male-male relationships. Because all of the sexual acts portrayed were shown as being experienced illicitly, Haring felt they would always "carry with them the feeling of guilt with which they were imagined, portrayed and executed."<ref name="Haring, Keith 2001"/> Haring was one of the first to present homosexuality in a politically progressive way. Because of that, almost&nbsp;– not in spite of it&nbsp;– the then-inevitable link between homosexual sexual activity and AIDS is apparent in Haring's later works.<ref name="Haring, Keith 2001"/>

The possible messages that can be identified in this painting have more power when the viewer takes into account Haring's aim of being sexually progressive in his work, and progressive on behalf of the homosexual community. Cultural views toward homosexuality, especially as they existed then, add a layer of guilt and loss to Haring's paintings. Haring's aim, in many ways, was to move sexuality (and specifically homosexuality) away from the subculture and stereotypes. With the rise of AIDS, Haring aimed to turn the message about the disease outward by presenting it through the joint lenses of political power, religious institutionalism, and anti-sexual morals.<ref name="Haring, Keith 2001"/>

===AIDS===
The theme of AIDS permeates Haring's late work, most likely because it had a heavy influence on his personal life. Midway through Haring's journals there is mention of the disease claiming his friends' lives, and later passages show Haring worrying increasingly about his own HIV status. For Haring, the fear was based in watching his friends die, not in his own fragility. On March 20, 1987, Haring wrote,  "I'm scared of having to watch more people die in front of me...I refuse to die like that. If the time comes, I think suicide is much more dignified and much easier on friends and loved ones. Nobody deserves to watch this kind of slow death."<ref name="Haring, Keith 1996">Haring, Keith. Keith Haring Journals. New York: Viking, 1996. Print.</ref> Haring avoided diagnosis for many years, but he felt it coming even then, and the impending diagnosis drove his work. "The odds are very great and, in fact, the symptoms already exist," he wrote in 1987. "I know in my heart that is only divine intervention that has kept me alive this long. I don't know if I have five months or five years, but I know my days are numbered. This is why my activities and projects are so important now. To do as much as possible as quickly as possible."<ref name="Haring, Keith 1996"/>

When looking at Haring's work post-1988, after his diagnosis, the focus seems to be primarily on male sexuality. The odd, foreboding symbol of the horned sperm begins to arise in much of his work, and this figure has been regarded as his personification of the AIDS virus. Perhaps the most representative example of Haring's post-AIDS work is the large scale work ''cat no. 27''. The piece features a large, horned sperm, drawn in white on a black background. The symbol was meant to embody everything that had become real in Haring's life: death as a result of physical love, or a deathly threat to sexuality. The horned sperm is shown hatching from an egg strapped to an individual's back. At the time of Haring's diagnosis, AIDS was nowhere near acceptance, and it was very much viewed through the prism of homophobia. "The discussion of AIDS as a 'gay cancer' and a 'divine punishment' for indecent living in the eighties was the subject of heated debate."<ref name="Haring, Keith 2001"/> Haring highlighted homophobia, and the corresponding AIDS-phobia, in his journal entries on many occasions, but there came a point when it no longer surprised him. "Read yet another AIDS article in the Herald Tribune," he wrote. "Article about homophobia increase on American college campuses. Violence, etc. Very frightening, but very predictable."<ref name="Haring, Keith 1996"/>

The symbolism in Haring's work bears the weight of this oppression. The burden of the egg in ''cat. no. 27'' could be seen to represent the oppressive effects AIDS had brought on the individuals dealing with the disease. The idea of anonymous sex was becoming more and more taboo in the homosexual community and the community was facing more and more discrimination as people reacted in fear to the AIDS epidemic. Haring states in his diary that he wanted danger declared, that he had to call it off, as does everyone else: "There really can't be any more anonymous sex." He probes into the horror that could result from extreme promiscuity at the height of the AIDS epidemic; talking about individuals who have literally "fucked themselves to death." Haring was conflicted about his dark perceptions of sex, but they persisted nonetheless. "Maybe I don't have any right to complain," he wrote. "I've had an incredible life and had enough sex in ten years for an entire lifetime, but it doesn't work like that. It's not a rational thing that can be explained away."<ref name="Haring, Keith 1996"/>

In his work ''Silence=Death'' Haring portrays multiple figures covering their eyes, mouths, and ears. The piece is intended to illustrate the oppression and invisibility that AIDS victims felt in the 1980s. Works like Haring's helped to give those living with AIDS more visibility at a time when many were suffering in absolute silence, with no voice, no visibility and no support from those around them. In ''Silence=Death'', the figures are all laid over a [[pink triangle]], a symbol associated with homosexual men. Originally used during the Holocaust, the pink triangle was used to signify those who were being targeted for their homosexuality. Since then, the symbol has often been reclaimed and re-appropriated by the gay rights movement. The AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) also used the symbol starting in 1987.

==AIDS Diagnosis==
In July 1987, Haring visited an AIDS specialist. In 1989, he began injecting himself with [[alpha interferon]] on a daily basis.  On May 1, 1987, he cited{{clarify|date=October 2014}} rumors that were circulating throughout the art community about his status. Haring's friend Tony was "still worried because the Art World gossip hotline still says I have AIDS... If anything causes me tension and stress it's him, not staying up late or working hard. I live for work."<ref name="Haring, Keith 1996"/>

Haring's diagnosis was never a secret; it was public knowledge and an accepted part of his persona in the media. Those publicly shared thoughts were reflected, often with more depth, in his work. Despite all the fear that led up to diagnosis, in some ways Haring found his impending death liberating. It pushed him to produce more work as quickly as possible. In a 1989 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Haring stated, "That's the point that I am at now, not knowing where it stops but knowing how important it is to do it now. The whole thing is getting more articulate. In a way it's really liberating."<ref name="Haring, Keith 1991"/> Critics have recognized this about Haring's works&nbsp;– particularly his later works&nbsp;– as well. "Haring's way of living life&nbsp;– liberated and with death in mind at a young age&nbsp;– allowed him to pull himself away from his diagnosis," Blinderman writes. "A year after his original diagnosis he was producing radiant paintings of birth and life." The introduction to the compilation of Haring's journals sings the same song: "Haring accepts his death. For in his art he found the key to transform desire, the force that killed him, into a flowering elegance that will lie beyond his time."<ref name="Haring, Keith 1996"/>

==Death==
Haring died on Friday February 16, 1990 of [[AIDS]]-related complications.<ref>{{Cite web | title = JOY broadcasts Haring mural anniversary - Gay News Network | accessdate = 2014-03-07| url = http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/victoria/joy-broadcasts-haring-mural-anniversary-13131.html }}</ref>

As a celebration of his life, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] declared the first New York date of her [[Blond Ambition World Tour]] a benefit concert for Haring's memory and donated all proceeds from her ticket sales to AIDS charities including [[AIDS Project Los Angeles]] and [[amfAR]]; the act was documented in her film ''[[Truth or Dare (documentary)|Truth or Dare]].'' Additionally, Haring's work was featured in several of [[Red Hot Organization]]'s efforts to raise money for AIDS and AIDS awareness, specifically its first two albums, ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' and ''[[Red Hot + Dance]]'', the latter of which used Haring's work on its cover.

==Exhibitions==
Haring contributed to the New York New Wave display in 1981 and in 1982, he had his first exclusive exhibition in the [[Tony Shafrazi]] Gallery. That same year, he took part in [[Documenta]] 7 in [[Kassel]], [[Germany]], as well as [[Public Art Fund]]'s "Messages to the Public" in which he created work for a Spectacolor Board in Times Square. He contributed work to the [[Whitney Biennial]] in 1983, as well as in the [[São Paulo]] [[São Paulo Art Biennial|Biennial]]. In 1985, the CAPC  in [[Bordeaux]] opened an exhibition of his works, and took part in the Paris Biennial.

Since his death Haring has been the subject of several international retrospectives. His art was the subject of a 1997 retrospective at the Whitney Museum in NewYork, curated by Elisabeth Sussman. In 1996, a retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia was the first major exhibition of his work in Australia. In 2008 there was a retrospective exhibition at the MAC in Lyon, France. In February 2010, on occasion of the 20th anniversary of the artist's death, [[Tony Shafrazi]] Gallery showed an exhibition containing dozens of works from every stage of Haring's mature work.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vartanian|first=Hrag|title=Keith Haring: 20th Anniversary|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=April 2010|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2010/04/artseen/keith-haring-20th-anniversary}}</ref> In March 2012, a retrospective exhibit of Haring's work, ''Keith Haring: 1978-1982'', opened at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in New York.<ref>[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/keith_haring/ "Exhibitions: Keith Haring: 1978–1982"], Brooklyn Museum, New York, March 16&nbsp;– July 8, 2012.

===Authentication issues===
There is no [[catalogue raisonné]] for Haring; however, there is copious information about Haring available on the estate's website and elsewhere, enabling prospective buyers or sellers to research exhibition history.<ref>Charlotte Burns (October 12, 2012), Haring market in turmoil - Prolific artist's foundation is latest to close its authentication board, ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.</ref> In 2012, the Keith Haring Foundation disbanded its authentication board; that same year, it donated $1 million to support exhibitions at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]<ref name="artinfo.com"/> and $1 million to [[Planned Parenthood]] of New York City's Project Street Beat. A 2014 lawsuit, filed by a group of nine art collectors at the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], argued that the Keith Haring Foundation's actions have "limited the number of Haring works in the public domain, thereby increasing the value of the Haring works that the foundation and its members own or sell."<ref>Benjamin Weiser (February 21, 2014), [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/arts/design/collectors-of-keith-haring-works-file-lawsuit.html Collectors of Keith Haring Works File Lawsuit] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

'''James Rosenquist''' (born November 29, 1933) is an American artist and one of the protagonists in the [[pop-art]] movement. Rosenquist was a 2001 inductee into the [[Florida Artists Hall of Fame]].<ref>[http://www.florida-arts.org/programs/ahf/displayArtist.cfm?member=31 James Rosenquist] Florida Artists Hall of Fame</ref>

==Background and education==
He was born in [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks]], North Dakota, and grew up as an only child. His parents, Louis and Ruth Rosenquist, of Swedish descent, were amateur pilots and moved from town to town to look for work, finally settling in [[Minneapolis]].  His mother, who was also a painter, encouraged her son to have an artistic interest. In junior high school, Rosenquist won a short-term scholarship to study at the [[Minneapolis College of Art and Design|Minneapolis School of Art]] and subsequently studied painting at the [[University of Minnesota]] from 1952 to 1954. In 1955, at the age of 21, he moved to [[New York, New York|New York City]] on scholarship to study at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]].<ref>{{cite web | title= In the Studio: James Rosenquist| last=Kastner |first= Jeffrey |publisher=artinfo.com  | date= November 22, 2007 | url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/25939/in-the-studio-james-rosenquist/ | accessdate=April 21, 2008 }}</ref>

==Career==

===Early Years and Pop===
<blockquote>''To be creative is to be accepting, but it’s also to be harsh on one’s self. You just don’t paint colors for the silliness of it all.'' - James Rosenquist<ref>Staniszewski,Mary Anne. [http://bombsite.com/issues/21/articles/956 "James Rosenquist Interview"] ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'' Fall, 1987. Retrieved May 17, 2013.</ref></blockquote>
From 1957 to 1960, he earned his living as a [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] painter.  This was perfect training, as it turned out, for an artist about to explode onto the [[pop art]] scene.  Rosenquist deftly applied sign-painting techniques to the large-scale paintings he began creating in 1960. Like other pop artists, Rosenquist adapted the visual language of advertising and [[pop culture]] (often funny, vulgar, and outrageous) to the context of fine art.  Rosenquist achieved international acclaim in 1965 with the room-scale painting ''F-111''.

Rosenquist has said the following about his involvement in the Pop Art movement: "They [art critics] called me a Pop artist because I used recognizable imagery. The critics like to group people together. I didn't meet [[Andy Warhol]] until 1964. I did not really know Andy or [[Roy Lichtenstein]] that well. We all emerged separately."<ref>[http://www.myartspace.com/blog/2008/04/art-space-talk-james-rosenquist.html "Art Space Talk: James Rosenquist"], ''Myartspace'', April 4, 2008. Retrieved May 16, 2008.</ref>

Rosenquist's paintings have been on display in the lobby of [[Key Tower]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. His ''F-111'' was displayed for many years.

===Mature work===
His specialty is taking fragmented, oddly images and combining, overlapping, and putting them on canvases to create visual stories.  This can leave some viewers breathless yet others confused, making them consider even the most familiar objects (a [[U-Haul]] trailer,  or a box of [[Oxydol]] [[detergent]], etc.) in more abstract and provocative ways.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Prints===
In addition to painting, he has produced a vast array of prints, drawings and [[collage]]s.  One of his prints, ''Time Dust'' (1992), is thought to be the largest print in the world, measuring approximately 7 x 35 feet.

In 1994, he created the print ''Discover Graphics'' in celebration of a Smithsonian educational program detailing the printmaking process.  The print's proceeds supported the Smithsonian Associates' cultural and educational programs, and an original of the lithograph hangs in the Smithsonian Art Collectors Program's ongoing exhibition, ''Graphic Eloquence'' in the [[S. Dillon Ripley Center]] in the [[National Mall]].

==Honors==
Rosenquist has received numerous honors, including selection as "Art In America Young Talent USA" in 1963, appointment to a six-year term on the Board of the [[National Council of the Arts]] in 1978, and receiving the [[Golden Plate Award]] from the [[American Academy of Achievement]] in 1988. In 2002, the [[Fundación Cristóbal Gabarrón]] conferred upon him its annual international award for art, in recognition of his great contributions to universal culture.

Since his first early career retrospectives in 1972 organized by the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], New York City, and the [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]], [[Cologne]], he has been the subject of several gallery and museum exhibitions, both in the United States and abroad. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] organized a full-career retrospective in 2003, which traveled internationally, and was organized by curators [[Walter Hopps]] and Sarah Bancroft.<ref>Stevens, Mark, ''New York Magazine'' (October 20, 2003). [http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/art/reviews/n_9376/ King of Pop]</ref>

Rosenquist continues to produce large-scale commissions, including the recent three-painting suite ''The Swimmer'' in the Econo-mist (1997–1998) for [[Deutsche Guggenheim]], Berlin, Germany, and a painting planned for the ceiling of the [[Palais de Chaillot]] in Paris, France. His work continues to develop in exciting ways and is an ongoing influence on younger generations of artists.  A note of interest would be that ''F-111'' was mentioned in a chapter of ''Polaroids from the Dead'' by [[Douglas Coupland]].

==Personal==
On April 25, 2009, a fire swept through Hernando County, Florida, where Rosenquist has lived for 30 years, burning the artist's house, studios, and warehouse. All of his paintings stored on his property were destroyed, including art for an upcoming show.<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/living/story/1023391.html Miamiherald.com]</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/arts/design/28arts-POPARTISTSWO_BRF.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Pop Artist's Works Lost in Studio Fire | first=Dave | last=Itzkoff | date=April 28, 2009 | accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.baynews9.com/article/news/2009/april/51991/Famous-artists-home-paintings-destroyed-in-brushfire Baynews9.com]</ref>

'''Wayne Thiebaud''' (born November 15, 1920) is an [[United States|American]] [[Painting|painter]] best known for his colorful works depicting commonplace objects&mdash;pies, lipsticks, paint cans, ice cream cones, pastries, and hot dogs&mdash;as well as for his landscapes and figures. He is associated with the [[Pop art]] movement because of his interest in objects of [[mass culture]], although his early works, executed during the fifties and sixties, slightly predate the works of the classic pop artists. Thiebaud uses heavy [[pigment]] and exaggerated colors to depict his subjects, and the well-defined shadows characteristic of advertisements are almost always included in his work.

==Early life and education==
Wayne Thiebaud was born to [[Mormon]] parents in [[Mesa, Arizona]], U.S.A.. His family moved to [[Long Beach, California]] when he was six months old.<ref name=BrownNYTimes>{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Patricia Leigh|title=Sweet Home California|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/arts/design/03wayne.html|accessdate=1 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 29, 2010}}</ref>  One summer during his high school years he apprenticed at the Walt Disney Pictures Walt Disney Studio making "in-betweeners" of Goofy, Pinocchio, and Jiminy Cricket making $14 a week. The next summer he studied at the Frank Wiggins Trade School in [[Los Angeles]]. From 1938 to 1949, he worked as a cartoonist and designer in California and New York. He served as an artist in the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] from 1942 to 1945.<ref name="ThiebaudBerkson">Thiebaud and Berkson 1994 (unpaginated).</ref>

In 1949, he enrolled at San Jose State College (now [[San Jose State University]]) before transferring to Sacramento State College (now [[California State University, Sacramento]]), where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1951 and a master's degree in 1952.

==Early career==
Thiebaud subsequently began teaching at [[Sacramento City College]]. In 1960, he became assistant professor at the [[University of California, Davis]], where he remained through the 1970s and influenced numerous art students. Thiebaud did not have much of a following among [[Conceptual artists]] because of his adherence to basically traditional disciplines, emphasis on hard work as a supplement to creativity, and love of realism.  Occasionally, he gave [[Pro bono publico|pro bono]] lectures at U.C. Davis.

On a leave of absence during 1956–57,  he spent time in [[New York City]], where he became friends with [[Elaine de Kooning|Elaine]] and [[Willem de Kooning]]<ref name=BrownNYTimes /> and [[Franz Kline]], and was much influenced by these abstractionists as well as by proto-pop artists [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]]. During this time, he began a series of very small paintings based on images of food displayed in windows, and he focused on their basic shapes.

Returning to California, he pursued this subject matter and style, isolating triangles, circles, squares, etc. He also co-founded the Artists Cooperative gallery, now Artists Contemporary Gallery, and other cooperatives including Pond Farm, having been exposed to the concept of cooperatives in New York.

In 1960, he had his first solo show in [[San Francisco]] at the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], and shows in [[New York City]] at the Staempfli and Tanager galleries. These shows received little notice, but two years later, a 1962 [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery exhibition in New York officially launched [[Pop Art]], bringing Thiebaud national recognition, although he disclaimed being anything other than a painter of illusionistic form.

In 1961, Thiebaud met and became friends with art dealer Allan Stone (1932–2006), the man who gave him his first "break."<ref name="ThiebaudBerkson" /> Stone was Thiebaud's dealer until Stone's death in 2006.<ref name=ASG>{{cite web|title=Gallery|url=http://www.allanstonegallery.com/gallery/|publisher=Allan Stone Gallery|accessdate=1 October 2013}}</ref> Stone said of Thiebaud "I have had the pleasure of friendship with a complex and talented man, a terrific teacher and cook, the best raconteur in the west with a spin serve, and a great painter whose magical touch is exceeded only by his genuine modesty and humility.  Thiebaud's dedication to painting and his pursuit of excellence inspire all who are lucky enough to come in contact with him. He is a very special man."  After Stone's death, Thiebaud's son [[Paul Thiebaud]] (1960–2010) took over as his dealer. Paul Thiebaud was a successful art dealer in his own right and had eponymous galleries in Manhattan and San Francisco; he died June 19, 2010.

In 1962, Thiebaud's work was included, along with [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Phillip Hefferton]], [[Joe Goode]], [[Edward Ruscha]], and [[Robert Dowd]], in the historically important and ground-breaking "[[New Painting of Common Objects]]," curated by [[Walter Hopps]] at the Pasadena Art Museum (now the Norton Simon Museum of Art at Pasadena).<ref name=NortonSimon>{{cite web|title=Museum History|url=http://www.nortonsimon.org/museum-history/|publisher=Norton Simon Museum|accessdate=1 October 2013}}</ref>  This exhibition is historically considered one of the first [[Pop Art]] exhibitions in America. These painters were part of a new movement, in a time of social unrest, which shocked America and the art world. 

In 1963, he turned increasingly to figure painting: wooden and rigid, with each detail sharply emphasized.  In 1964, he made his first prints at [[Crown Point Press]], and has continued to make prints throughout his career. In 1967, his work was shown at the Biennale Internationale.

Wayne Thiebaud has been married twice. With his first wife, Patricia Patterson, he produced two children, one of whom is the [[model (art)|model]] and writer [[Twinka Thiebaud]]. With his second wife, Betty Jean Carr, he had a son, [[Paul Thiebaud|Paul LeBaron Thiebaud]], who became an art dealer. He also adopted Betty's son, Matthew.<ref>[http://www.paulthiebaudgallery.com/paul/obit.html Gallery memorial] Retrieved August 27, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Paul-Thiebaud-art-dealer-son-of-painter-dies-3260365.php Paul Thiebaud, art dealer son of painter, dies]</ref>

==Work==
Thiebaud is well known for his paintings of [[production line]] objects found in [[diner]]s and [[cafeteria]]s, such as pies and pastries. As a young man in Long Beach, he worked at a cafe named ''Mile High and Red Hot'', where "Mile High" was [[ice cream]] and "Red Hot" was a [[hot dog]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Scheller |first=William |title= America, a history in art: the American journey told by painters, sculptors, photographers, and architects |publisher= [[Black Dog Publishing]] |year= 2008 }}</ref>

He was associated with the [[Pop art]] painters because of his interest in objects of [[mass culture]]; however, his works, executed during the fifties and sixties, slightly predate the works of the classic pop artists, suggesting that Thiebaud may have had an influence on the movement. Thiebaud uses heavy [[pigment]] and exaggerated colors to depict his subjects, and the well-defined shadows characteristic of advertisements are almost always included in his work.<ref name=McGuigan>{{cite news|last=McGuigan|first=Cathleen|title=Wayne Thiebaud Is Not a Pop Artist|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/Wayne-Thiebaud-is-Not-a-Pop-Artist.html|accessdate=1 October 2013|newspaper=Smithsonian Magazine|date=February 2011}}</ref> Thiebaud is averse to labels such as "fine art" versus "commercial art" and has described himself as "just an old-fashioned painter".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonian.com/videos/category/arts-culture/thiebaud-on-being-a-pop-artist/|title=Thiebaud on Being a Pop Artist|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref> He dislikes [[Andy Warhol]]'s "flat" and "mechanical" paintings and does not count himself as a pop artist.<ref name="Boxer">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/books/review/Boxer-t.html?_r=0|title=Life Is Sweet|last=Boxer|first=Sarah|date=February 17, 2008|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hodge|first=Susie|authorlink=Susie Hodge|title=Why Your Five Year Old Could Not Have Done That: Modern Art Explained|year=2012|isbn=9783791347356|pages=42-43|lccn=2012940064}}</ref>

In addition to pastries, Thiebaud has painted characters such as [[Mickey Mouse]] as well as [[landscape]]s, streetscapes, and cityscapes, which were influenced by the work of [[Richard Diebenkorn]].<ref name=Yau>{{cite journal|last=Yau|first=John|title=Wayne Thiebaud: 70 Years of Painting|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=July–August 2010|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2010/07/artseen/wayne-thiebaud-70-years-of-painting}}</ref>  His paintings such as ''Sunset Streets'' (1985) and ''Flatland River'' (1997) are noted for their hyper realism, and have been compared to [[Edward Hopper]]'s work, another artist who was fascinated with mundane scenes from everyday American life.<ref name=Yau />

Thiebaud is a voracious reader and is known for reading poetry to his students.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

On the right is the artificial Peberholm island, and on the left Saltholm. Picture is taken from the air.]]

'''Peberholm''' (literally "''Pepper Islet''", {{lang-sv|Pepparholm|links=no}}), is a small [[artificial island]] located in the [[Denmark|Danish]] part of the [[Øresund]].  It forms part of [[Tårnby|Tårnby municipality]]. It was created as part of the [[Øresund Bridge]] connecting [[Denmark]] with [[Sweden]]. Peberholm was constructed in the proximity of the small natural island of [[Saltholm]] (''Salt Islet''), and was named to complement it.

== Reasons for construction ==
The main reason for constructing the island was to have a crossover point between the tunnel and the bridge.

The tunnel was built since a bridge spanning the entire link between Malmö and Copenhagen would have interfered with obstacle-free zones around [[Copenhagen Airport|Kastrup Airport]]. Another reason was to provide an opportunity for large ships to pass the [[Öresund]] without worrying about the height of the bridge. To make the Øresund Bridge higher would interfere with the freight train traffic.

The other main reason was that the Øresund had to be dug deeper in order to not decrease the flow of the water because of the bridge. The material was used to create this island. The area was so shallow, and the amount of material so large, that it was chosen to make the island as long as 4&nbsp;km.

== Built to preserve ecology ==
[[File:Peberholm.JPG|thumb|View from north-west]]
The original designs for a bridge across the [[Øresund]] required extensive use of Saltholm as a stepping-stone for the bridge.  They required either the construction of both a motorway and railway across Saltholm or an expansion of the existing island to serve the same purpose.

Both of these options were ultimately abandoned in order to protect the island's [[ecology]]; Danish and Swedish politicians decided instead to construct an artificial island immediately south of Saltholm to achieve that goal.  The location was chosen in the belief that it would ensure the freest flow of water through the sound, a key element in the debate about whether or not the bridge should be constructed.

Peberholm is protected by strict laws.  Only biologists are allowed one annual visit to the areas of the island outside of the railroad and highway to which the island owes its creation.

The island is considered to be a biological experiment.  Scientists predicted that nature would colonize it and make the island flourish on its own, without any human interaction whatsoever. As of June 2007, scientists from the Biological Society of [[Lund]] had registered 454 species of plants on the island.<ref name="2770Tårnbyuge25">[http://www.taarnby-update.dk/arkiv/Uge25.htm Nye plante- og fuglearter på Peberholm] [[2770 Tårnby]], week 25, 2007. {{da icon}} {{Dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref> Also resident to the island as of 2004 were about 20 species of spiders, and approximately 12 species of birds.<ref>http://www.birds-of-denmark.dk/peberholm.htm, Accessed 21 January 2012</ref>

The city on the [[Neckar]] is a former [[Imperial Free City]] and is the seat of [[Heilbronn (district)|Heilbronn County]]. Heilbronn is also the economic center of the Heilbronn-Franken region that includes most of northeast Baden-Württemberg.

Heilbronn is known for its wine industry and is nicknamed ''Käthchenstadt'', after [[Heinrich von Kleist]]'s ''[[Das Käthchen von Heilbronn]].

==Geography==
Heilbronn is located in the northern corner of the [[Neckar]] [[Sedimentary basin|basin]] at the bottom of the Wartberg (308 m). It occupies both banks of the Neckar, and the highest spot inside city limits is the [[Schweinsberg (mountain)|Schweinsberg]] with a height of 372 meters. Heilbronn is adjacent to Schwäbisch-Fränkischer Wald State Park and is surrounded by vineyards.

Heilbronn and its surroundings are located in the northern part of the larger [[Stuttgart]] metropolitan area. The city is the economic center of the Heilbronn-Franken region and is one of fourteen such cities in the Baden-Württemberg master plan of 2002. It also serves [[Abstatt]], [[Bad Rappenau]], [[Bad Wimpfen]], [[Beilstein (Württemberg)|Beilstein]], [[Brackenheim]], [[Cleebronn]], [[Eberstadt (Württemberg)|Eberstatt]], [[Ellhofen]], [[Eppingen]], [[Flein]], [[Gemmingen]], [[Güglingen]], [[Ilsfeld]], [[Ittlingen]], [[Kirchardt]], [[Lauffen am Neckar]], [[Lehrensteinsfeld]], [[Leingarten]], [[Löwenstein]], [[Massenbachhausen]], [[Neckarwestheim]], [[Nordheim (Württemberg)|Nordheim]], [[Obersulm]], [[Pfaffenhofen (Württemberg)|Pfaffenhofen]], [[Schwaigern]], [[Siegelsbach]], [[Talheim, Neckar|Talheim]], [[Untergruppenbach]], [[Weinsberg]], [[Wüstenrot]], and [[Zaberfeld]] as a regional economic centre.

==History==

===Up to AD 1200===
The oldest traces of humans in and around Heilbronn date back to the [[Old Stone Age]] (30,000 BC). The fertile Neckar floodplains in the Heilbronn basin aided early settlement by farmers and ranchers. The city limits of present-day Heilbronn contain many sites of [[Bronze Age]] finds. Later on, but still before AD, the [[Celt]]s already mined here for salt from brine.

Under [[Roman Emperor]] [[Domitian]] (AD 81–96) the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] pushed east away from the [[Rhine]] and the outer boundary of the [[Roman Empire]] was set at the Neckar-Odenwald-Limes. A [[castle]] in today's borough of Böckingen was part of that limes, and nearby numerous Roman villas and plantations were built. Around AD 150, the Neckar-Odenwald-Limes became obsolete when the boundary of the Roman Empire was moved approximately {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} to the east, where it was subsequently fortified with the construction of the [[Upper Germanic Limes]] complete with [[parapet]] and [[trench]]es.

Around 260, the Romans surrendered the limes, and the [[Alamanni]] became rulers of the Neckar basin. Between the 4th and 7th centuries, the area became part of the [[Frankish Empire]], and the first settlement was built in the general vicinity of the present center of town.

In 741 Heilbronn is first mentioned in an official document of the [[Diocese of Würzburg]] as ''villa Helibrunna'' (together with a ''Michaelsbasilica''), and in 841, King [[Louis the German]] set up court here for a period of time. The name ''Heilbrunna'' (''healing well'') hints to a well that is located not far from the basilica. In 1050 a significant settlement of [[Jews]] is noted in official documents, and the Codex of the monastery in [[Hirsau]] documented Heilbronn's right to hold market days and mint coins, mentioning its harbor and vineyards as well.

===1200–1500===
[[File:DeutschHof HN.JPG|thumb|The ''Deutschhof''.]]
In 1225 Heilbronn was incorporated into the [[Hohenstaufen]] Empire as ''oppidum Heilecbrunnen''. ''Oppidum'' signified a city fortified by [[parapet]] and [[trench]]es. Later during the 13th century, the [[Teutonic Knights]] obtained ownership of a large area south of Heilbronn which would remain owned by that order until [[German Mediatisation]] in 1805. Starting in 1268, the order built the ''Deutschhof'' there as one of its residences. The church building of the order that was located on the premises was modified and expanded several times: First in 1350 it was expanded ([[gothic architecture|Gothic]]), then it was remodeled in 1719 ([[Baroque]]), and in 1977, it was consecrated as a cathedral.

After the demise of the [[Hohenstaufen|Staufen]] dynasty, King [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolf I]] returned city status to Heilbronn in 1281 and installed a regal advocate to rule the city. In addition to the advocate he put a council in place that was headed up by a mayor. Around 1300, the first city hall was erected in the market place and the [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]] (built on the foundation of the Michaelsbasilica) was expanded. The Neckar privilege gave the city the right to modify the flow of the river in 1333, which meant it now had the right to construct dams, harbors and mills. Because of the infrastructure thus created, during the 14th century Heilbronn grew attractive to merchants and craftspeople, who now demanded the right to determine their own fate.

In 1371 [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], issued a new charter to the city. Now Heilbronn needed to answer only to the Emperor and as such was an [[Imperial Free City]]. Craftspeople and merchants were now represented in its council and the villages of Böckingen, [[Flein]], [[Frankenbach]] and Neckargartach became part of Heilbronn's territory.

As an Imperial Free City Heilbronn was threatened by the ambitious House of [[Duchy of Württemberg|Württemberg]]. A relationship with the Holy Roman Emperor and a treaty with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] in effect from 1417 to 1622 strengthened Heilbronn's position and kept the House of Württemberg at bay. The political stability enjoyed by the city during the 15th century enabled it to expand, and many of its historic structures, such as the [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]] (1455–60), trace their origins to that era.

===1500–1700===
[[File:Heilbronn Bollwerksturm 20050828.jpg|left|thumb|160px|''Bollwerksturm'']]

[[Götz von Berlichingen]] spent three years in "knightly custody" in Heilbronn starting in 1519 and even spent a night in the tower of the bastion. That same year people first took note of the pub owner [[Jäcklein Rohrbach]] who with accomplices would later kill the executor of Böckingen. After he had spent some time in the [[Hohenlohe Plains]] and collected similarly minded characters around him, he returned to Heilbronn in April 1525 just as the [[German Peasants' War]] was getting into full swing. On April 16 the peasants killed many of the nobles in Weinsberg and on April 18 the Heilbronn cloister of the [[Carmelites|Order of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel]] was attacked and ransacked. The city opened its gates in response to demands of the peasants and consequently more churches and municipal institutions were robbed the next day. For about a month Heilbronn remained under the control of revolting peasants. And even though [[Johann Lachmann]], later a church reformer, had attempted to mediate, the peasants did not leave the city until one of their armies was defeated on May 12, 1525 in [[Böblingen]]. Their leader Rohrbach was executed on May 21, 1525 in Neckargartach and his home town of Böckingen was partially burnt to the ground in punishment.

In 1528, the replacement of the mayor by [[Hans Riesser]], a Protestant, brought on the previously delayed [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and through the efforts of Reformer Lachmann schools and healthcare were also reorganized. In 1529 the [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]] (church tower of the Kilianskirche) was completed. It was the first important religious building of the [[Renaissance]] in Germany. The year 1530 brought about the acceptance of the [[Augsburg Confession]] by city council and residents and the ''Heilbronn Catechism'' of 1536 is the second oldest catechism in the Protestant Church. In 1538 Heilbronn joined the [[Schmalkaldic League]] but by 1546 squabbles between troops of the Schmalkaldic League and those of the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] escalated into battles that were won by the Emperor. As a result, Charles V spent Christmas 1546 in Heilbronn to attend the ensuing criminal proceedings. It is also Charles V who in 1522 changed the charter of the city and this charter survived almost unscathed until 1803.

During the [[Thirty Years' War]] the city and surrounding villages suffered badly. After the [[battle of Wimpfen]] in 1622, Neckargartach was burnt to the ground. In 1631 Heilbronn was occupied by imperial troops but the same year the Swedes succeeded in conquering the city. From 1644 through 1647, Heilbronn was again part of the Holy Roman Empire, but then French troops moved in and later those of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]. The city was not free of occupying forces until four years after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648. But already in the 1670s the city again became the stage for armed manoeuvres, until it was occupied by French troops in 1688. But while that occupation of the city only lasted several months, the French were only persuaded to leave the surrounding areas in 1693, after a large defensive army had been put into the field and fortifications had been erected.

===1700–1900===
[[File:KäthchenHaus HN02.JPG|thumb|''Käthchenhaus'']]
During the 18th century, archives suggest all members of the city council enjoyed some sort of formal education; [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] came to visit; and elaborate buildings were being constructed in the [[Rococo]] style.

On September 9, 1802, Heilbronn lost its status as an Imperial Free City when the troops of Duke [[Frederick I of Württemberg]] arrived. The duke had conceded the left bank of the Rhine to France during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] but had been compensated with areas on the right bank. This is how Heilbronn and other former Imperial Free Cities became part of Württemberg in 1803. Heilbronn became the seat of an ''Oberamt'' (district), and the four Imperial Free villages became separate communities within the district. In 1806 the Duchy of Württemberg became the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]].

In 1815, Heilbronn again became a staging area for major armies ahead of the campaign against [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], and 10,000 troops paraded in front of Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz of Austria]] and more than one hundred German princes and generals in the ''Theresienwiese''. [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia]] met in Heilbronn with the [[Baltic German|Baltic]] Baroness [[Barbara Juliana, Baroness von Krüdener|Juliane von Krüdener]], who talked him into founding the "[[Holy Alliance]]".

[[Industrialization]] arrived in 1820. When the first train lines were placed in service in Württemberg, Heilbronn was at the end of the line of the northern branch that connected Heilbronn with [[Stuttgart]] and further fueled industrialization.
[[File:Heilbronn Stadtplan 1858-2.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of Heilbronn, 1858]]
For a while Heilbronn suffered from the upheavals of the [[History of Baden#Revolution of 1848/49|Baden Revolution]] that its civil guard participated in. During that time the 8th infantry regiment switched sides and joined the revolutionaries until it was subsequently disarmed and force-transferred out of the area.

Heilbronn became part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 during the [[unification of Germany]].

In the 1860s the city's train tracks were extended to [[Heidelberg]] via [[Bad Wimpfen]], to [[Würzburg]] via [[Osterburken]], and to [[Crailsheim]] (and later on to [[Nuremberg]]) via [[Schwäbisch Hall]]. In 1880, the [[Kraichgau]] line was completed and created an important connection towards [[Karlsruhe]], and by the end of the 19th century, Heilbronn had become an important hub, second in Wuerttemburg to Stuttgart in industrial output.

The year 1892 brought a connection to the power plant in Lauffen; thus Heilbronn became the first city in the world to enjoy long distance electric power.

===1900–1945===
[[File:Heilbronn ca. April 1945.jpg|thumb|Ruins in Heilbronn in 1945.]]

With the dissolution of monarchy in the [[German Reich]] as a result of World War I, Heilbronn became part of the [[Free People's State of Württemberg]] in 1918.

After almost a century of economic boom and growth of the local industry Heilbronn's citizenry included many labourers. The city came to be known as a "red hot spot"''';''' numerous worker and sports clubs were begun. Already prior to World War I the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] cornered the majority of the vote and stayed that course during the [[Weimar Republic]]. At his visit to the city on May 15, 1926, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was clearly not welcome by everyone, and several people were injured when a man was mistaken for Hitler and attacked. Hitler himself was able to give his speech in the city's community center ''Harmonie'', but the SPD had the majority in Heilbronn over the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] as late as the elections on March 5, 1933.

[[Richard Drauz]], who had been born into a respected Heilbronn family, became Heilbronn's NSDAP [[Kreisleiter]] (District Leader) in 1932 . He was also elected to the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] from 1933 on and pushed hard for the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' of the Heilbronn clubs and press in [[Nazi Germany]].

On July 28, 1935, the port was opened in a canal off the Neckar, and 1936 saw the [[Autobahn]] between Heilbronn and Stuttgart completed. Economy and infrastructure were booming in Württemberg, and Heilbronn was at the logistic centre of it all. As the result of a district reform on October 1, 1938, Heilbronn became the seat of the newly created [[Heilbronn (district)|Heilbronn County]] and regained independent city status. At the same time the previously independent communities of Böckingen, Sontheim, and Neckargartach were annexed, and with 72,000 residents Heilbronn then was the second largest city in Württemberg. The port turned into an important transfer station on the Neckar and one of the ten largest interior ports in the country.

On November 10, 1938, the Heilbronn [[synagogue]] was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]]. Soon thereafter the [[Jew]]ish community was all but eliminated.

Starting in 1942 during World War II, the salt mines in and around Heilbronn were used to store art and artifacts from Germany, France, and Italy. Similarly, important producers of the war industry were moved into the [[Shaft mining|mine shafts]]. The expansion of the shafts was undertaken by labour brigades of the [[concentration camp]] branches in Kochendorf and Neckargartach. From Heilbronn all the way to [[Neckarelz]] numerous subterraneous complexes, some of them gigantic, were constructed''';''' on November 20, 1942, the Heilbronn Bureau of Labour had 8,000 forced labourers registered in its district.

In 1940 [[Bombings_of_Heilbronn_in_World_War_II|allied air raids]] began, and the city and its surrounding area were hit about 20 times with minor damage. On September 10, 1944, a raid by the allies targeted the city specifically, in particular the Böckingen train transfer station. As a result of 1,168 bombs dropped that day, 281 residents died. The city was carpet-bombed from the southern quarter all the way to the [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]] in the center of town. The church was burnt out.

The catastrophe for Heilbronn was the bombing raid on December 4, 1944. During that raid the city center was completely destroyed and the surrounding boroughs heavily damaged. Within one half hour 6,500 residents perished, most incinerated beyond recognition. Of those, 5,000 were later buried in mass graves in the ''Ehrenfriedhof'' (cemetery of honor) in the valley of the Köpfer creek close to the city. A memorial continues to be held annually in memory of those that died that day. As a result of the war Heilbronn's population shrank to 46,350 ''(see [[Bombings of Heilbronn in World War II]])''.

After a [[Battle of Heilbronn (1945)|ten-day battle]], with the allies advancing over the strategically important [[Neckar]] crossings, the war ended for the destroyed city, and it was occupied by the U.S. Army on April 12, 1945. Local NSDAP leader [[Richard Drauz|Drauz]] became a fugitive because of executions of American prisoners of war he had ordered in March 1945. He was eventually arrested, tried, and hanged by the Allies in [[Landsberg Prison|Landsberg]] on December 4, 1946.

===Since World War II===
[[File:StadtTheater HN01.JPG|thumb|''Stadttheater'' Heilbronn.]]
After the war, Emil Beutinger, mayor until 1933, returned to office and began the formidable task of reconstruction that was subsequently continued by his successors [[Paul Metz]] and Paul Meyle. Milestones were the rededication of historic city hall in 1953 and the reopening of the community centre, ''Harmonie''. Heilbronn was part of [[Württemberg-Baden]] until 1952, after which it became part of [[Baden-Württemberg]].

After 1951, US troops were permanently stationed in Heilbronn. They used barracks built prior to World War II and added some structures of their own.

The opening of the Autobahn [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6]] from Heilbronn to [[Mannheim]] in 1968 was an important economic event. When the [[Bundesautobahn 81|A 81]] to [[Würzburg]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6]] to [[Nuremberg]] was completed in 1974 and 1979, respectively, Heilbronn became an important logistical centre in southern Germany. As a result, many large companies opened offices in Heilbronn.

When Klingenberg became part of Heilbronn on January 1, 1970, the city's population exceeded 100,000 for the first time; thus Heilbroon attained "major city" (''Großstadt'') status. During the last district reform in the 1970s, Kirchhausen, Biberach, Frankenbach and Horkheim were incorporated into Heilbronn, and the city was reconfirmed as independent city and seat of Heilbronn County. It was also declared seat of the newly formed Franken region, now Heilbronn-Franken.

Also during the 1970s, the centre of the city was transformed into a [[pedestrian zone]] and the rededication of the city theatre in 1982 closed one of the largest holes left in the inner city from World War II.

Pursuant to the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]] of 1979, [[Pershing II]] intermediate-range [[nuclear missiles]] were stationed just uphill of Heilbronn in the Waldheide. This made Heilbronn the only major city in Germany with atomic missiles inside its city limits — a fact that became front-page news during the missile accident on January 11, 1985. After the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF Treaty]] was signed in 1987, the missiles were removed .

In the 1980s, Heilbronn hosted ''Heimatttage'' and ''Landesgartenschau'' staged by the State of Baden-Württemberg. In 1998, Heilbronn was connected to the S-Bahn net with Karlsruhe. This further transformed the city centre, and an extension of the S-Bahn towards [[Öhringen]] opened on December 10, 2005, marking the completion of the east-west axis of the Baden-Wuerttemburg regional transportation system. The north-south axis was in the planning stages as of February 2006.

Heilbronn won the European competition "Entente Florale 2000" on September 9, 2000, in Broughshane, Northern Ireland, and in 2005–06 the city became the first [[UNICEF]] children's city in Germany.

Late in 2005, Heilbronn was chosen to host the [[Bundesgartenschau]] in 2019. An entire new borough along the S-Bahn line Böckingen–Theresienwiese–Neckargartach is planned.

===Religion===
[[File:Heilbronn Kilianskirche 20050828.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[St. Kilian's Church, Heilbronn]], as seen from the Kiliansplatz]]
Ever since the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I|Chlodwig]] settled in the Neckar region around 500 the area has been predominantly [[Christian]] and when Heilbronn was first mentioned in an official document in 741 Christian Michaelsbasilica, present day's [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]], was mentioned along with the city. The [[Teutonic Knights]] constructed its church from the 13th century and both churches were continually expanded. They were joined later by other churches and cloisters in the city.

Around 1050 an important Jewish community was mentioned that had settled in what became known as the ''Judengasse'' (''Lohtorstraße''). In 1298, 143 Jews were killed during the [[Rintfleisch-Pogrom]] and in 1350 Jews suffered attacks again during a European [[epidemic]] of the [[Bubonic plague]]. The city's constitution required the council to include Jews, but already in the middle of the 15th century Jews were the target of vigilantes again until they were evicted from the city in 1490 with the blessings of Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]].

It is worth noting that the common Jewish name Halpern, and many variants such as Alpert, derive from the name of this city Heilbronn, and the early Jewish community there.

While Heilbronn was part of the [[Diocese of Würzburg]], the independent villages of Böckingen, Neckargartach and Frankenbach were attached to the [[Diocese of Worms]]. From 1514 on the Heilbronn native Johann Lachmann was caretaker of the parish in St. Kilian, in 1521 he became its preacher, in 1524 he converted to [[Lutheranism]] and proceeded to teach and lead the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in Heilbronn against the wishes of both dioceses. After the [[Protestant reformation]] of Heilbronn was complete the city remained Lutheran for centuries and the council and citizens accepted the [[Augsburg Confession]] without dissent. Catholics were no longer welcome, Jews were prohibited from settling in Heilbronn, and the city took part in the [[Protestation at Speyer]] on April 19, 1529 (the Protestation was the origin of the terms Protestant and Protestantism).

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] brought Heilbronn freedom of religion. From 1803 Jews were again permitted to settle in the city, Catholics also began to move back in and by the 1860s Jews were granted equal rights as Heilbronn citizens.

After the city became part of Württemberg in 1803 it also became seat of a deacony and the [[Prelate]] or regional bishop of the Protestant State Church in Württemberg. To this day Protestants are in the majority in Heilbronn. The Catholic parishes belong to the Deacony Heilbronn and are part of the [[Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart]].

Around 1920 first groups of "Serious Bible Students" (now: [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]) formed. Their small community suffered from oppression during the [[Third Reich]] and many of its members died in [[concentration camps]]. Similarly, the Jewish community had to watch as its colossal [[synagogue]] went up in flames and its 350 members were subsequently all but extinguished. Jehovah's Witnesses built a first meeting room in Heilbronn in 1953 and many more have been added since then.

[[File:Heilbronn Rathausuhr 20050828.jpg|thumb|200px|Astronomical clock at City Hall.]]

Since the 1970s, after guest workers and immigrants from [[Islam]]ic or [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian-Orthodox]] countries settled here, these faiths are practiced by a growing part of the population and numerous mosques have been created since the 1990s in the city and county of Heilbronn.

==Government==
In connection with the district reform in the 1970s, municipal laws of Baden-Württemberg were amended to introduce borough councils for certain boroughs. Residents of such boroughs elect their borough council at each municipal election and the borough council must be consulted on all matters of significance to the respective borough. The Borough President also presides over the Borough Council. In Heilbronn the boroughs of Biberach, Frankenbach, Horkheim, Kirchhausen and Klingenberg have borough councils.

===City council===
After the municipal elections of June 7, 2009 the city council of Heilbronn was made up of 40 seats. The members belong to political parties as follows:

===Representatives from Heilbronn===
The city of Heilbronn together with the northern municipalities of Heilbronn County makes up the electoral District 268 for national elections of representatives to the [[Bundestag (Germany)|Bundestag]].

[[File:NaturHistMuseum HN01.JPG|thumb|Museum of Natural History.]]

For State elections to the [[Landtag of Baden-Württemberg]] Heilbronn makes up an electoral district (District 18) together with Erlenbach. Before the 2006 elections, it was an electoral district all by itself.

===Coat of arms===
Heilbronn's [[coat of arms]] features a black eagle with red tongue and claws on golden background. The eagle is protected by a red, silver and blue shield. The city flag is red, white and blue.

The oldest seal of the city dates back to 1265. The eagle is the symbol for the imperial freedom enjoyed by Heilbronn until it was [[German Mediatisation|annexed]] by the [[Grand Duchy]] (and later Kingdom) of [[Württemberg]]. While it is established that it appeared for the first time with shield in 1556 to distinguish it from other versions of eagles, the origin of the colors of the shield has yet to be determined. The colors also appeared in reverse order in 1556, 1581 and 1681 and there have been other variations of colour as well, such as white rather than golden background.

Interesting is the fact that Heilbronn sports three colours in its flag. Newly dedicated municipal flags in [[Baden-Württemberg]] only use two colours. According to State municipal laws, Heilbronn's flag was grandfathered as it had been in use prior to 1935.

In February the citizens of Heilbronn and the surrounding area have an opportunity to enjoy themselves at the Pferdemarkt. In May the Trollinger marathon takes place. July brings the ''Gaffenberg Festival'' and the ''Unterländer Volksfest'' takes the city from July into August. It is the largest festival of its kind in Heilbronn and takes place on the ''Theresienwiese''. Each year it begins on the last Friday in July and ends on the second Monday in August. In September, patrons enjoy themselves at the ''Heilbronner Weindorf'', in October at the ''Hafenmarkt'' and in November and December at the ''Weihnachtsmarkt'' by the [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]]. Every other year the ''Neckarfest'' and ''Traubenblütenfest'' are added to this already full schedule.

==Sport==
[[FC Heilbronn]] is a football club based in Heilbronn, Baden-Württemberg formed only recently – in 2003 – out of a merger between two former clubs with the elder dating back to 1896 and playing a five-year stint in the [[Regionalliga Süd (1963-74)|Regionalliga Süd]] (II) / [[2nd Bundesliga Süd (1974-81)|2nd Bundesliga Süd]] from 1969 to 1975.

Heilbronn hosts an annual tennis tournament [[Intersport Heilbronn Open|Heilbronn Open]] (see [http://www.heilbronn-open.de/ Heilbronn Open website]) which is part of the [[ATP Challenger Tour|ATP Challenger tour]].

Heilbronn is also the hometown of ice hockey team Heilbronner Falken (Heilbronn Falcons). The team currently plays in the second German ice hockey league.

==Economy and infrastructure==
[[File:Heilbronn Weinbau 20050904.jpg|thumb|250px|Vineyards east of Heilbronn]]

[[Viticulture]] has a long tradition in Heilbronn and is an important part of its economy to this day. Its 514 [[hectare|ha]], two thirds of it growing red grapes, is the third largest vineyard in [[Württemberg vine region|Württemberg's vine-growing region]] after [[Brackenheim]] and [[Lauffen am Neckar]]. In 1888 the [[vintner]]s of the Heilbronn area combined and formed the ''Weingärtnergesellschaft Heilbronn '', a cooperative. In 1933 that cooperative then combined with the competing cooperative ''Winzergenossenschaft Heilbronn'' that had formed in 1919 and that cooperative again merged with the Vintner cooperatives of [[Erlenbach, Baden-Württemberg|Erlenbach]] and [[Weinsberg]] to form the ''Genossenschaftskellerei Heilbronn-Erlenbach-Weinsberg'' with seat just outside the city limits in Erlenbach. In addition to the cooperative, numerous independent vintners are also located here.

South of the steam power plant is located the [[conveyor tower]] of the ''Südwestdeutsche Salzwerke AG'' (SWS). The SWS runs a [[salt]] mine in the Heilbronn area. That mine was connected through an underground tunnel with the now shut-down (since 1994) salt mine ''Kochendorf'' in [[Bad Friedrichshall]]. Extraction had extended the Heilbronn mine far to the west so that in 2004 a new shaft, ''Konradsberg'', was added — probably the last mining shaft that was constructed in all of Germany.

===Infrastructure===
[[File:Heilbronn Bahnhofsvorplatz Stadtbahn01 2002-09-08.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Heilbronn Stadtbahn|Heilbronn]]/[[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn]] train pulling into the station outside of [[Heilbronn Hauptbahnhof]]]]

The city of Heilbronn is readily accessible by road courtesy of the [[Weinsberg Intersection]] just to the northeast of the city, the intersection of the [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 81|A 81]] from [[Würzburg]] to [[Gottmadingen]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6]] from [[Saarbrücken]] to [[Waidhaus]]. In addition to the Autobahns the city is connected via the [[Bundesstraße]]n [[Bundesstraße 27|B 27]] from [[Blankenburg am Harz|Blankenburg]] to [[Schaffhausen]], [[Bundesstraße 39|B 39]] from [[Frankenstein (Palatine)]] to [[Mainhardt]] and [[Bundesstraße 293|B 293]] from [[Karlsruhe]] to Heilbronn that both run through the city itself.

Heilbronn is also a forerunner of [[right turn on red]] in Germany and 65 "Green arrow" signs have been installed at appropriate intersections since 1996.

Although [[Heilbronn Hauptbahnhof]] (central station) does not benefit from the [[DB Fernverkehr|Deutsche Bahn long-distance service]], the city is well connected by train. The [[Franconia Railway]] (''Frankenbahn'') connects [[Stuttgart]] and Würzburg, the [[Neckar Valley Railway]] and [[Elsenz Valley Railway]] run from Heilbronn to Heidelberg and [[Mannheim]], and the [[Hohenlohe Railway]] accommodates travel to [[Schwäbisch Hall]] via [[Öhringen]].

The [[Heilbronn Stadtbahn|Heilbronn]] and [[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn]]s provide a connection all the way to [[Karlsruhe]] on the [[Kraichgau Railway]]'s tracks. Currently the S 4 takes travellers from Karlsruhe through the central train station past the centre of town all the way to the Öhringen borough of Cappel (since December 11, 2005). Because of massive delays in the construction of the S-Bahn tracks through Heilbronn's city limits and with the modernization[[File:Heilbronn Kanalhafen 20050905.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Heilbronn canal port]] and electrification of the existing tracks from Heilbronn to Öhringen meant that the new section's official opening needed to be postponed several times. In the future, additional S-Bahn lines are planned to [[Neckarsulm]], [[Lauffen am Neckar]] and [[Zaberfeld]]. As well a these new lines, additional stops will also be built in the inner city of Heilbronn.

Whilst the original ''[[tram|Straßenbahn]]'' of Heilbronn, nicknamed the ''Spatzenschaukel'' (German for "sparrows' swing"), was discontinued on April 1, 1955, the city used electrically powered [[trolley bus]]es until 1960. Today, [[public transportation]] is provided by the S-Bahn that runs through Heilbronn similar to the [[Karlsruhe model]] and this is complemented by buses run by the ''Stadtwerke Heilbronn (Verkehrsbetriebe)'' and several other enterprises. All now belong to the ''Heilbronner Verkehrsverbund''.

[[File:Heilbronn EnBW 20050905.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Thermal power plant]]
[[File:Heilbronn PowerPlant view from Wartberg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|View of the Thermal Power Plant from Wartberg]]

The canal port on the Neckar is one of the ten largest German interior [[port]]s.

===Power plant===
In the industrial part of Heilbronn EnBW AG runs a large powerplant that is powered by coal. Its two chimneys (250 m tall) and cooling tower (140 m tall) are visible from afar, see [[Heilbronn Power Station]]

===Transport===
The public tram and bus system is run by [http://www.h3nv.de/ HNV (Heilbronner Hohenloher Haller Nahverkehr)].

===Media===
Heilbronn is home to one of the studios of [[Südwestrundfunk]] (SWR). From here regional programmes like ''Frankenradio'' are broadcast on SWR4 Baden-Württemberg. The ''[[Heilbronner Stimme]]'' is a daily newspaper published in the city and the advertisers ''Neckar Express'', ''echo am Mittwoch'' and ''echo am Sonntag'' are available weekly free of charge. Heilbronners also peruse the monthly city magazines ''Freizeit Journal'' and ''Moritz''.

===Public service===
As a major economic centre most major branches of government operate offices in Heilbronn. Examples are the Department of Labour, the Department of Finance and German Customs. It also is the seat of the regional chamber of commerce and several regional professional boards.

Several courts are located in Heilbronn, two belonging to the Stuttgart court district, a specialty court hearing labour issues, and a family court whose district includes the city of Heilbronn and the counties of [[Heilbronn (district)|Heilbronn]], [[Ludwigsburg (district)|Ludwigsburg]], [[Schwäbisch Hall (district)|Schwäbisch Hall]], [[Hohenlohekreis (district)|Hohenlohe]] and [[Main-Tauber-Kreis|Main-Tauber]].

The City is also the seat of the Prelature of Heilbronn and of the church district of Heilbronn (of the Protestant State Church as well as of the Heilbronn Deacony of the [[Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart]]).

===Education===
Heilbronn is the seat of the main campus of the ''[[Hochschule Heilbronn]]'', founded in 1961 as a public engineering school. Since 1971 the school was known as the ''Fachhochschule Heilbronn'' (Heilbronn University) and has operated a secondary campus in [[Künzelsau]] since 1988. Starting with the fall semester on September 1, 2005 the [[Fachhochschule]] was awarded the status of a [[Hochschule]].

[[File:Trappenseeschlösschen.JPG|250px|left|thumb|Trappenseeschlösschen]]
The private ''Heilbronn Business School'' opened at the ''Neckarturm'' in January 2005.

As far as general education is concerned, Heilbronn operates five college-track highschools or [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] (''Elly-Heuss-Knapp-Gymnasium'', ''Justinus-Kerner-Gymnasium'', ''Mönchsee-Gymnasium'', ''Robert-Mayer-Gymnasium'' and ''Theodor-Heuss-Gymnasium''), four non-college-track highschools or ''Realschulen'' (''Dammrealschule'', ''Helene-Lange-Realschule'', ''Heinrich-von-Kleist-Realschule'' in Böckingen and ''Mörike-Realschule''). There are also six special-education schools run by the city (''Wilhelm-Hofmann-Förderschule'', ''Pestalozzi-Förderschule'', and ''Paul-Meyle-Schule'' for the mentally and physically impaired, two special-education schools run by Heilbronn County (''Gebrüder-Grimm-Schule'' for the speech impaired and ''Hermann-Herzog-Schule'' for the seeing impaired), and the ''Lindenparkschule'', which is run by the state of Baden-Württemberg for the hearing and speech impaired. The latter also includes a boarding school and consultation centre.

'''Saltholm''' (''Salt Islet'') is a Danish island in the [[Øresund]], the [[strait]] that separates [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]. It is located to the east of the Danish island of [[Amager]] in [[Tårnby]] municipality and lies just to the west of the sea border between Denmark and Sweden. It is 7&nbsp;km long and 3&nbsp;km wide, covering an area of 16&nbsp;km², making it Denmark's 21st largest island. Saltholm is very flat; its highest point stands only 2&nbsp;m (6&nbsp;ft) above sea level, rendering it vulnerable to flooding if persistent east winds cause a tidal surge in the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref>Aage Aagesen, Niels Nielsen, Kongelige Danske geografiske selskab, ''Atlas over Danmark'', p. 117. H. Hagerup, 1992</ref> It is a relatively new landmass in geological terms, having risen from the sea about 4,000 years ago, and is surrounded by a large area of shallow water (of 2&nbsp;m depth or less) that covers an area of 28 km². A series of islets, inlets and rock deposits from the last [[ice age]] appear at the south end of the island.<ref name="Oresundsvand">{{Cite web |url=http://www.oresundsvand.dk/English/html/saltholm.html |title=Saltholm |accessdate=2009-01-14 |work=The Sound Water Cooperation |publisher=Øresundsvandsamarbejdet}}</ref>

Its neighboring island to the south is the [[artificial island]] [[Peberholm]] (''Pepper Islet''), which is a part of the [[Øresund Bridge]] and was named to complement Saltholm.

==Flora and fauna==

Saltholm's vegetation is dominated primarily by grasses, with its landscape consisting mainly of flat chalk meadowlands and coastal meadow. There are few trees on Saltholm, clustered mainly in two places in the north and south-west of the island.<ref name="dof">{{cite web|url=http://www.dof.dk/sider/index.php?Itemid=411&id=344&option=com_content&task=view | title=København / Copenhagen | publisher=[[Dansk Ornitologisk Forening]] | accessdate=2009-01-14}}</ref> The island has a rich variety of flora, notably [[motherwort]] (''Leonurus cardiaca''), [[henbane]] (''Hyoscyamus niger''), [[blue iris]] (''Iris spuria'') and [[Cerastium|chickweed]].<ref name="Aschehoug">"Saltholm". ''Aschehoug's Leksikon''. [[Aschehoug (Egmont)]], 2008</ref>

Saltholm is a protected nature reserve for wild birds which nest in large numbers on the island. The southern part of the island, an extensive [[salt marsh]], is protected under the [[Ramsar Convention]]<ref>D. Eisma, ''Dredging in Coastal Waters'', p. 42. Taylor & Francis, 2005. ISBN 0-415-39111-3</ref> and the island as a whole, along with the surrounding area of sea, has been designated a nature reserve by the [[European Union]]. [[Mussel]] beds, [[Zostera|eel grass]], snails, crustaceans and fish in the shallow waters around the island provide an important food source for water birds. Because of its importance as a wildlife sanctuary, access to Saltholm and its surrounding waters is strictly controlled. Access to the island is via a small harbour at Barakkebro, at the north end of Saltholm.<ref name="Oresundsvand" />

The island is Denmark's largest grazing area for geese, some 7,000 of which visit during the summer. Around 3,500 juvenile swans also live on the island in the summer, with some 2,000 wintering there. 10,000–12,000 ducks breed and graze on Saltholm during autumn and late winter/spring. Saltholm is also home to Europe's largest breeding colony of [[eider]]s; 15,000 live on the island during the spring and some 7,000–8,000 are hatched on the island each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skovognatur.dk/Udgivelser/Reservatfoldere/salt.htm|title=Saltholm| publisher=Skov- og Naturstyrelsen | accessdate=2009-01-14 | date=2008-05-29 | language=Danish}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Humans have lived in small numbers on Saltholm since the Middle Ages and probably before. The population has ranged from a peak of 298 people in 1916, when the island was fortified during [[World War I]], to only five people as of January 2008.<ref>{{cite web | title=Population 1 January by islands | url=http://statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?Maintable=BEF4&PLanguage=1 | publisher=Statistics Denmark | accessdate=2009-01-14}}</ref> The current inhabitants manage the farm Holmegård on a nature reserve in the northwest of the island to maintain the grass for nesting birds.

The existence of the island is first attested in 1230, when King [[Valdemar II of Denmark]] is recorded as having given Saltholm to Bishop [[Niels Stigsen]] of the see of [[Diocese of Roskilde (Roman-Catholic)|Roskilde]].<ref>Franz Blatt, C A Christensen, K Friis Johansen. ''Danmarks Riges Breve'', p. 109. Reitzel, 1979. ISBN 87-7421-008-4</ref> For centuries, the island was used to quarry [[limestone]], which was used in nearby [[Copenhagen]] and elsewhere; in 1289, the town lord of Copenhagen is recorded to have granted quarrying rights on Saltholm<ref>Lars Berggren,  Nils Hybel,  Annette Landen. ''Cogs, Cargoes and Commerce: Maritime Bulk Trade in Northern Europe, 1150-1400'', p. 35. Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 2002. ISBN 0-88844-815-5</ref> and quarrying continued until as late as 1935.<ref name="Aschehoug"/> The island was also traditionally used as pasture land for the cattle of the people of the nearby Danish island of Amager.<ref>"Amager", in ''The Penny Cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge'', p. 410. Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. C. Knight, 1833</ref> The cows of Saltholm were commemorated in the late 19th century by the Danish painter [[Theodor Philipsen]], who travelled frequently to the island to paint its cattle and treeless landscapes.<ref>Torsten Gunnarsson (trans. Nancy Adler), ''Nordic Landscape Painting in the Nineteenth Century'', p. 193. Yale University Press, 1998. ISBN 0-300-07041-1</ref>

Saltholm was used as a [[quarantine]] station between 1709 and 1711 when Copenhagen suffered [[bubonic plague|plague]] and [[cholera]] outbreaks. Travellers wishing to land in the city were required to stay in quarantine on the island for 40 days.<ref>Frandsen, Karl-Erik. ''Kampen mod pesten. Karantænestationen på Saltholm 1709-11''. Frydenlund, Copenhagen, 2004. ISBN 87-7887-180-8</ref> In 1873, a private company, the Saltholmlaug, acquired the island from the state and still owns it today.<ref name="dof" />

The island's position in the middle of the Øresund gave it some military significance during the two World Wars. In 1912, the Danish government constructed the "Flak Fort" ([[Flakfortet]]) on the Salthom Flak sands just north of the island proper, stationing a number of artillery pieces ranging in calibre from 47&nbsp;mm to 290&nbsp;mm. Most of the guns were mounted on [[barbette]] carriages and protected by armoured shields and concrete and earthen ramparts. The fort was still active at the start of [[World War II]]; although old, its guns were still seen as a strong deterrent.<ref>J. E. Kaufmann,  Robert M. Jurga. ''Fortress Europe: European Fortifications of World War II''. Da Capo Press, Incorporated, 2002. ISBN 0-306-81174-X</ref>

Saltholm was the site of an incident resulting in the loss of the British submarine [[HMS E13|HMS ''E13'']], which ran aground on the island on 17 August 1915 due to a faulty compass. Two days later, two German destroyers attacked the submarine while it was still stranded on the shoreline as the crew worked to refloat the vessel. Fifteen of the submariners were killed before Danish torpedo boats intervened to deter the attackers. The violation of the country's neutrality outraged the Danish government, prompting a diplomatic protest to the Germans, and the casualties were given high-profile official funerals by the Danish navy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9503E2D71539E333A25754C2A96E9C946496D6CF| title=Topics of the Times | publisher=New York Times | date=1915-08-27 | accessdate=2009-01-14 | format=PDF}}</ref> The surviving crew were interned in Denmark until the end of the war in November 1918, and the wrecked submarine was scrapped.<ref>Robert Gardiner,  Randal Gray,  Przemys?aw Budzbon.

The island was for many years considered as a possible location for a new international airport and fixed link between Denmark and Sweden. The nearby [[Copenhagen Airport]] at [[Kastrup]] has long been the busiest airport in Scandinavia but has suffered from an acute shortage of space and its proximity to built-up areas. In 1965, the [[Nordic Council]] agreed in principle to build a new international airport on Saltholm, to replace the airport at Kastrup, and to construct a bridge-and-tunnel link across the island to connect Copenhagen and Malmö.<ref>Frantz Wilhelm Wendt, ''Cooperation in the Nordic Countries: Achievements and Obstacles'', p. 204. Almqvist & Wiksell International, 1981. ISBN 91-22-00465-3</ref> The proposal was strongly supported by [[Scandinavian Airlines System]], the main user of Copenhagen Airport. The plan envisaged building two pairs of runways, which would be carrying up to 20 million passengers a year by 1990. A {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}} bridge would connect it to Malmö and a {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} tunnel would link to Kastrup on the Danish side. The project was costed at the equivalent of £250 million in 1967 (£3.1 billion / € 3.4 billion at 2009 prices).<ref>{{cite news |first=Arthur |last=Reed |title=SAS gives support to plan for island airport |publisher=The Times |page=5 |date=1968-07-15 |accessdate=2009-01-14}}</ref>

The plan was approved by the Danish parliament in 1969 with completion scheduled for 1985.<ref>{{cite news |title=Denmark votes for new airport |publisher=New York Times |page=5 |date=1969-04-27 |accessdate=2009-01-14}}</ref> However, it was repeatedly delayed; contributory factors included the [[1973 oil crisis]] and its economic fallout, a slump in air travel, and opposition from campaigners concerned about the impact on the fragile environment in the Øresund and around the island. The plan was abandoned in 1979 and further investment was made in Copenhagen Airport instead.<ref>Jim Berry, Stanley McGreal, ''European Cities, Planning Systems and Property Markets'', p. 166. Taylor & Francis, 1995. ISBN 0-419-18940-8</ref> When the Oresund fixed link was eventually built in the 1990s, it was routed 1&nbsp;km south of Saltholm to avoid damaging the island and the surrounding shallow waters.

'''Waterloo''' is an inner-east suburb of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Waterloo is located 4 kilometres south of the [[Sydney central business district]] and is part of the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of the [[City of Sydney]].

==History==
[[Image:Waterloo Town Hall.JPG|thumb|left|Waterloo Town Hall designed by [[John Smedley (architect)|John Smedley]]]]
Waterloo took its name from the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815, when Allied and Prussian forces under the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] and [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]] defeated the French forces under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]].

In the 1820s Waterloo began supporting industrial operations including the Fisher and Duncan Paper Mill and the Waterloo Flour Mills owned by William Hutchinson and Daniel Cooper. [[William Hutchinson (Superintendent)|William Hutchinson]], superindendent of convicts and public works, had been granted {{convert|1400|acre|km2}} of land in 1823. He sold Waterloo Farm to Daniel Cooper (1785-1853) and Solomon Levey (1794-1833). Cooper later bought out Levey's share and on his death the Waterloo Estate passed onto his son, also named Daniel Cooper, who was the first speaker of the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]].<ref>''The Book of Sydney Suburbs'', Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia ISBN 0-207-14495-8, page 266</ref>

==Location==
Waterloo is historically a working class region. Since early 2000s, the region has undergone some degree of [[gentrification]] with a rising business district focusing on technology-oriented firms and the development of more green space such as parks. By 2006, median individual income in Waterloo was slightly higher than the Australian average.<ref name="census-2006">{{Census 2006 AUS | id = SSC12015 | name = Waterloo (State Suburb) | quick = on | accessdate = 28 February 2008}}</ref> The suburb maintains numerous [[public housing in Australia|public housing]] apartments.

Waterloo is also a popular suburb to live for Sydney's large [[LGBT in Australia|Gay and Lesbian]] population due to its closeness to nearby suburbs of [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]] and [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]].

The Waterloo Urban Conservation Area is a residential area of predominantly 19th century terrace and cottage housing. New development and redevelopment in this area is encouraged to be sympathetic to the existing heritage style. 
[[File:More_park_new_south_wales_2.jpg|South Dowling Street apartments|thumb|270px]]

[[Green Square, New South Wales|Green Square]] is a district in the south and east of the suburb including the suburbs of Waterloo and [[Zetland, New South Wales|Zetland]] that is being redeveloped. It involves an urban renewal program which has seen many industrial buildings redeveloped or replaced by new residential and commercial developments. The area adjacent to South Dowling Street contains many high rise apartment buildings with retail space at ground level.

==Transport==
Waterloo is serviced by [[State Transit Authority]] [[Sydney Buses]] routes to the Sydney CBD. [[Green Square railway station|Green Square underground railway station]], on the [[Airport railway line|Airport line]] of the [[Sydney Trains]] network, is located in the south-west corner of the suburb. [[Redfern railway station]] is located close to the north-west corner of the suburb.

==Churches==
Waterloo hosts the city campus of [[Hillsong Church]] (affiliated with the [[Assemblies of God in Australia|Assemblies of God]]). Other churches include Shrine and Parish of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church, Waterloo Congregational Church, Waterloo Uniting Church and Waterloo Salvation Army.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 census, Waterloo has a population of 10,657 people, 64.3% of the population was born overseas. English was primarily spoken at home by 47.7% of the population, with the most important other languages being Chinese languages (10.3%), Russian (5.2%) and Korean (2.5%). The largest religions were Catholicism (20.1% of the population), Anglicanism (8.1%), Buddhism (5.3%) and Pentecostalism (3.9%). Furthermore, 26.1% of the population identified with no religion/atheism, slightly above the national average. 80.8% of the population lived in apartments, significantly different from the rest of Australia (where only 13.6% of the population are apartment dwellers). Furthermore, 74.5% of dwellings were rented, compared to 29.6% in Australia as a whole.

==Recreation==
The Waterloo [[Skate Park]], is a modern skate park and the first of its kind to copy the urban streetscape layout of popular skate spots like [[Martin Place]] and Cathedral Square in Sydney. The park is located next to Waterloo Oval and the South Sydney Youth Services building on Elizabeth Street.

'''Redfern''' is an inner-city suburb of Sydney located 3 kilometres south of the [[Sydney central business district]] and is part of the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of the [[City of Sydney]]. [[Strawberry Hills, New South Wales|Strawberry Hills]] is a locality on the border with [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]]. The area experienced the process of [[gentrification]] in recent years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Matthew|title=Transforming the great southern land|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/transforming-the-great-southern-land-20110429-1e0pj.html|accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> 

Redfern is subject to extensive redevelopment plans by the state government, to increase the population and reduce the concentration of poverty in the suburb and neighbouring [[Waterloo, New South Wales|Waterloo]] (see [[Redfern-Eveleigh-Darlington]]).

==History==
The suburb is named after surgeon [[William Redfern]], who was granted {{convert|100|acre|km2}} of land in this area in 1817 by [[Lachlan Macquarie]]. He built a country house on his property surrounded by flower and kitchen gardens. His neighbours were Captain Cleveland, an officer of the 73rd regiment, who built Cleveland House and John Baptist, who ran a nursery and seed business. Sydney's original railway terminus was built in Cleveland Paddocks and extended from Cleveland Street to Devonshire Street and west to [[Chippendale, New South Wales|Chippendale]]. The station's name was chosen to honour William Redfern. At that time, the present Redfern station was known as [[Eveleigh, New South Wales|Eveleigh]].<ref>The Department of Railways Research and Information Section (1966) ''Railway Quiz'' (Department of Railways) p11</ref> When Central station was built further north on the site of the Devonshire Street cemetery, Eveleigh station became Redfern and Eveleigh was retained for the name of the railway workshops, south of the station. The remains of Cleveland Paddocks became Prince Alfred Park.

Redfern has been characterised by migrant populations that have lived in the area. In the late 19th century many of the businessmen in the area were from [[Syria]] such as George Dan 1890, Stanton and Aziz Melick in 1888 and [[Shafiqah Shasha]] and Anthony and Simon Coorey in the 1890s. As waves of immigrants arrived in Australia, many made Redfern their first home.

On 17 January 1908 at [[Redfern Town Hall]] the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney club]] was formed to compete in the [[1908 NSWRFL season|first season]] of the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League Premiership]]. 

The notorious Redfern Mail Exchange was built in 1965, after 300 people were evicted from their homes on the 2.15 hectare site. It became the scene of many industrial disputes when the automatic mail-sorting machinery which was supposed to sort efficiently, actually destroyed many letters. It became known as the Redfern Mangler.<ref>''The Book of Sydney Suburbs'', Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia ISBN 0-207-14495-8</ref>

The [[2004 Redfern riots]] began on 14 February 2004, at the end of Eveleigh Street outside [[Redfern railway station, Sydney|Redfern station]], sparked by the death of Thomas 'TJ' Hickey. The teenager, riding on his bicycle, was allegedly being chased by a police vehicle, which led to his impalement on a fence. Members of his family were then reported to have started grieving for TJ around Eveleigh Street with a crowd gathering commiserating with the family. Fliers were distributed blaming police for TJ's death. The police closed the Eveleigh Street entrance to the railway station, but youths in the crowd became violent, throwing bricks and bottles; this escalated into a riot. A subsequent inquest found that although the police were following Hickey, they had not caused the accident, a verdict that caused controversy in Redfern's Aboriginal community. The riots sparked fresh debate into the welfare of [[Aboriginal Australians]] and the response of the police to those living in the Redfern area.

==Commercial area==
[[Image:RedfernRailwayStationSydneyFromPlatform1.jpg|thumb|[[Redfern railway station, Sydney|Redfern railway station]]]]
The main shopping strip is located on Redfern Street, east of Redfern railway station. There are also commercial developments nearby, along Regent Street and surrounding streets. The Redfern skyline is dominated by two office towers located between Regent Street and Gibbons Street, beside Redfern railway station.

===Transport===
[[Redfern railway station]], located on the western edge of the suburb is a major station on the [[Sydney Trains]] network. Redfern is the first station south from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central Sydney terminus]] on the edge of the city. Redfern station is the closest station to the main campus of the [[University of Sydney]] at [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] and [[Darlington, New South Wales|Darlington]]. A near-constant stream of commuters, mostly students, flows from Redfern station along the south side of Lawson Street towards the university in the morning, and back towards the station in a largely hourly rhythm in the afternoon.

==Churches and schools==
St Vincent de Paul Catholic Church is on Redfern Street. St Saviour's Anglican Church (which is also known as one1seven church) is on Young Street. St George Antioch Orthodox Church is on the corner of Walker Street and Cooper Street. The Greek Orthodox Church in Cleveland Street is called the Cathedral of the Annunciation of Our Lady, formerly St Paul's Church of England built in 1848 and designed by [[Edmund Blacket]]. The [[St Andrews Greek Orthodox Theological College]] sits beside it. [[Hillsong Church]]'s city campus is at 188 Young Street.

==Population==
The population of the suburb spans a broad spectrum of socioeconomic characteristics. This may be partly due to the geography of the suburb, which is long, narrow, and centrally located. Eastern Redfern has become increasingly [[gentrification|gentrified]], with many medium and high density developments replacing low density and industrial developments.

===Demographics===
According to the 2011 census, Redfern has a population of 12,035 people, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people making up 2.4% of the population. 50.8% of the population was born overseas. 61.7% of the population only spoke English at home, with the most important other languages being Chinese languages (5.5%), Greek (2.1%), Russian (2.0%) and Arabic (1.7%). 34.5% of the population identified with no religion/atheism, higher than the national average. Of the remainder, 18.9% were Catholic, 9.1% Anglican, 3.9% Eastern Orthodox, and 3.8% Buddhist.<ref>{{Census 2011 AUS|id=POA2016|name=Redfern (State Suburb)|accessdate=22 June 2012|quick=on}}</ref>

===Community===

[[File:Terraces on Lawson Street in Redfern.jpg|thumb|Terraces on Lawson Street]]

'[[The Block (Sydney)|The Block]]' is an area in the immediate vicinity of Redfern station bounded by Eveleigh, Caroline, Louis and Vine Streets. The Aboriginal Housing Company (AHC) was set up as the first urban Aboriginal community housing provider, using grant money to purchase the houses on the Block. As a result the area is important to the Aboriginal community.

Eveleigh Street, which is part of 'The Block', is well known for its community. In 2004 much of the housing here was demolished with plans for redevelopment, but it is still an area around which many people congregate. The AHC's plans for redevelopment are known as the [[Pemulwuuy Project]]. The plans were approved in 2009.

The local police boys club [[Police Citizens Youth Club|(PCYC)]] has artwork painted on the outside walls of the building which was completed in the early 1990s. The front wall has a mural of a picture taken at Cleveland Street High School of a day when Dwayne "the D Train" McClain former Sydney Kings player visited the school. The picture has local sports stars such as Richard Bell, Bruce Swanson, Rossie Symmans, Nicholas Murray, Nathan Denzil and Jamie Sharpe. The mural was painted by probably the most notable artist of the 90s in the Redfern district, Sir Joseph Phillips.

Redfern has many fine examples of Victorian [[terrace house|terraced housing]] similar to other inner suburbs, such as [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]] and [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]]. Also, like some other inner-city suburbs, some parts of Redfern have been gentrified, whilst other areas still project an image of "mean streets", with some [[public housing]].

== Sport and recreation ==
A number of well-known sporting teams represent the local area. One of them is the well known NRL club named the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] and one of the oldest [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] rugby league teams in Australia the [[Redfern All Blacks]] who play at [[Redfern Oval]]. The Redfern Raiders Soccer Club is the local Junior Soccer Club.. Redfern Gym opened in 1985 and many boxing world champions have trained there.

It is a mix of both high-rise housing blocks built in [[Communist times]] as well as low-density housing. The quarter is an [[Commuter town|exurban]] environment - that is, in between a rural area and a suburban environment. It is located in the city's far southwest, and, although there is good infrastructure in terms of education, shopping, and, to some extent, transportation, the quarter still has a significant number of unpaved roads and country-style houses. Io?ia is usually divided into three areas: Io?ia Nord, Calea Aradului and between those two, Old Io?ia.

Of the three areas of Io?ia, Io?ia Nord is the most developed, having 2 high schools, 1 kindergarten, 1 swimming pool, many supermarkets and a direct transportation line to the University of Oradea (being one of the two districts which have direct transportation to the University). It is also a beautiful place to take a walk, mainly because of the [[Cri?ul Repede]] river which separates Iosia Nord from the [[Rogerius, Romania|Rogerius district]] (beautiful at sunset).

Calea Aradului, lying on the southern part of Oradea, is, as its name says, the way to Arad, another county in Romania. The [[Oradea Airport]] is located here, at the town exit.

Io?ia Veche (Old = Vechi in Romanian) is entirely composed of houses, being the only one of the three areas with some unpaved roads.

The quarter is one of the most beautiful in Oradea because it maintains a rustic, rural feel which still being relatively built-up and close to the city. For tourists, it provides insight into Romanian country life while still being in the city close to all the excellent facilities that Oradea is home to. In Oradea, there is a stereotype about people from Io?ia as being fairly uneducated in comparison to more inner-city urbanites, even though this is changing fast as real estate prices are increasing in the city centre and wealthy people are building large houses (villas) in Io?ia. This neighborhood, is used to belong to the actual Santandrei village, most of the elders living in the area of Io?ia are former Santandrei village residents.

'''Rico Dredd''' is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' comic strip in ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' magazine. He is the brother of [[Judge Dredd|Judge Joe Dredd]], the strip's eponymous lead character. 

==Appearances==
Rico first appeared in "The Return of Rico" in ''2000 AD'' #30 (1977), written by [[Pat Mills]] and drawn by [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]. This story was retold in 1995, when Mills was asked to write an extended three-episode version of it to coincide with the release of the [[Judge Dredd (film)|1995 film]],<ref>"Flashback 2099: The Return of Rico," ''2000 AD'' #950-952</ref> in which Rico appeared. As well as introducing the character of Rico Dredd, the 1977 story also revealed Joe Dredd's first name. (As the first editor of ''2000 AD'' and the commissioning editor of the ''Judge Dredd'' strip, Mills had also given Dredd his surname, which originally had been going to be "Judge Dread."<ref>"Judge Dredd: The Mega-History," by Colin M. Jarman and Peter Acton (Lennard Publishing, 1995).</ref>)

Although Rico was killed off in his debut story, he occasionally recurs in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, most extensively in the story [[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|"Origins"]] (2006&ndash;2007) by [[John Wagner]].  His term of imprisonment on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] is also a major plot point in the audio play [[Judge Dredd: Trapped on Titan]].

Alternative versions of Rico from [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] also appeared in the novel "[[Dread Dominion]]" (1994) by [[Stephen Marley (writer)|Stephen Marley]], in which he played a major role, and in the comic strip story "[[Helter Skelter (Judge Dredd story)|Helter Skelter]]" (2001) by [[Garth Ennis]] (in which he appeared as part of an [[ensemble cast]] of villains).<ref>"Helter Skelter," ''2000 AD'' #1250-1261</ref>

[[Image:Rico2.jpg|200px|thumb|Rico Dredd's badge reads "Dredd." (Picture by [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]].)|left]]

==Badge==
Although in the original story, Rico was depicted wearing a [[Judge (2000 AD)|judge's]] badge with the name "Dredd" ''(see image, left)'', some artists in later stories have erroneously drawn him with a badge labelled "Rico" as though it were his surname. This error was also included in the script to a story by writer [[Gordon Rennie]].<ref>"Judgement," ''2000 AD'' #1523-1528</ref> This is possibly based on confusion with the character [[Judge Rico]], whose surname is Rico and whose badge therefore bears that name ''(see image [[Judge Rico|here]])''.

When [[Michael Carroll (author)|Michael Carroll]] wrote an e-book novella about Rico in 2014, he dealt with this issue in the story. In an interview with Irish Comic News he explained: "My argument has always been that Rico’s badge should show his surname… like every other Street Judge in Mega-City One. Why should he be the only one to have his first name on his badge? ... But Gordon’s story “Judgement” makes a plot-point of Rico temporarily wearing a “Dredd” badge in order to fool Judge Kenner into thinking that he is Joe … So I had to make a choice. In my re-telling of the relevant scenes from “Judgement” I omitted the part about the badge-swap. So far, no one has complained!"<ref>[http://www.irishcomicnews.com/2014/07/interview-michael-carroll-discusses-his-judge-dredd-work/ ICN's website] (retrieved 30 July 2014)</ref>

==Character biography==
'''Rico Dredd''' (2066&ndash;2099) was the "clone brother" of Joseph Dredd, which is to say that they were both [[cloning|cloned]] from the same genetic source, in their case [[Chief Judge Fargo]].<ref>"A Case for Treatment," ''2000 AD'' #389</ref> Their growth in the cloning tanks was artificially accelerated, so that within 16 months they emerged with the physical development of children aged five years. They also had their brains electronically induced with knowledge and training which greatly surpassed their apparent physical age, so that they could immediately begin training in law enforcement.<ref>"Origins," ''2000 AD'' #1515</ref> Rico was removed from the cloning tanks twelve minutes before Joe, and so he habitually referred to Joe as his little brother (or "Little Joe").<ref>"Blood Cadets," ''2000 AD'' #1187</ref>

At the [[Academy of Law]] Rico consistently demonstrated higher levels of skill than Joe, and he graduated at the top of their class in 2079, with Joe coming second.<ref>"The Return of Rico," ''2000 AD'' #30</ref> During his time as a cadet, he requested to join the older cadets in restoring order to the streets of [[Mega-City One]] in the immediate aftermath of the [[Atomic Wars]] of 2070. Rico and Joe served with distinction, and were personally chosen to take part in the raid on the White House to depose [[President Robert L. Booth|President Booth]] (who had usurped his office and had started the War).<ref>"Origins," ''2000 AD'' #1531</ref>

However, following an injury during a training mission in the [[Cursed Earth]], Rico began to become more aggressive, underhanded, and determined to prove himself better than Joe. After graduation, Rico began engaging in criminal activities, including extortion, assault and racketeering. Joe suspected that this was the result of exposure to radiation when Rico was injured on a training mission in the [[Cursed Earth]].<ref>"Blood Cadets," ''2000 AD'' #1187-88</ref> Rico himself had considered this in his early years but discounted it. In his opinion, Justice Department was itself a corrupt, absurd agency and this meant it didn't matter if he lined his own pockets. He considered it a farce that the 'good' judges like Joe were using just as much brutality as he did. <ref>Prog 950-1: "Return of Rico" retelling and ''Judge Dredd Year One - Wear Iron'', chapter 6 ([[Al Ewing]])</ref> 

Rico's crimes started with allowing gangs to operate as long as they stayed 'quiet'. This soon escalated to allowing guilty perps to remain free, unjudicial relations and drinking, taking bribes from organised crime<ref>''Rico Dredd: The Titan Years - The Third Law'' by Michael Carroll</ref>, running blackmail operations, protection rackets, killing perps that had surrendered (and faking the charges) and brutalising innocent people to get 'confessions'. As he had a high clearance rate, Justice Department didn't look at him too closely. <ref>''Wear Iron''</ref> Joe's efforts to persuade Rico to change his ways fell on deaf ears and much to Joe's distate, he found himself turning to Rico on occasion for information on underworld figures.<ref>''Judge Dredd Year One - City Fathers'' by Matt Smith</ref> When Judge Kenner, Rico's former Assessing Judge, became suspicious, Rico secretly murdered him and dumped the body in a rad pit.<ref>"Judgement," ''2000 AD'' #1523-1528</ref> He started to live in an Oldtown apartment, flaunting his money and corruption. <ref>"Blood Cadets" ''2000 AD'' #1188</ref>

In the ebook ''The Third Law'', Rico Dredd as narrator tells the reader that he was trying to enforce the law in a less remote fashion, allowing for mercy and accepting the citizens as they were; bribes are explained as a way of making sure the crimelords believed they controlled him and he wasn't the one ensuring they kept restrained. Sex and drinking are shrugged off as perks, and threats to Joe as being the result of drinking. Rico is implied to be an unreliable narrator and this calls his claims into questions. Notably, he claims he couldn't shoot Kenner in case the bullets were traced and he used the rad pit to kill him, and regretted 'having' to kill him; the original strip shows him hitting Kenner with an incendary round, shooting his limbs, and mocking him as he dies, using the rad pit to dispose of the corpse. <ref>Prog 1523 and 1525</ref> The ebook ''Wear Iron'' is told in third-person and describes Rico's thoughts circa 2080: here, when he isn't telling his own story, he's callous, brutal, and sometimes bursts out in manic laughter. He remembers Kenner's murder fondly. 

Eventually Rico allowed his brother to find out about his racketeering. When Joe witnessed Rico murder an innocent cafe owner who had refused to pay him protection money, Joe arrested him. Rico resisted arrest by opening fire, but the shots went wide. Given Rico's skill with a firearm, Joe would later posit the theory that Rico was trying to commit [[suicide by cop]] out of a deep disgust at what he had become, rather than trying to kill him.<ref>"Blood Cadets," ''2000 AD'' #1188</ref> In ''The Third Law'', Rico reveals the shop owner was a chocolate smuggler he was shaking down and claims he had only meant to wound the owner to throw a scare into him. Rather than suicide by cop, Rico claims he just couldn't shoot his brother. Whatever his motive, Rico was sentenced to twenty years [[hard labour]] on the prison colony of [[Titan in fiction|Titan]], where he grew to hate his brother. He was particularly angry that Joe didn't testify in his favour. <ref>''Rico Dredd: The Titan Years - The Third Law'' by Michael Carroll</ref>

(The twenty-year sentence means Rico should have been caught in 2079 but the ''Year One'' novellas have Rico active in 2080)

While Titan would become the mandatory sentence for corrupt judges, in 2079/80 only a few were sent there and the majority were civilian prisoners from various mega-cities; early on, the "Titan treatment" of being disfigured and modified to breath Titan's atmosphere was only done to prisoners as a punishment. Rico and a bus load of prisoners and guards were trapped on the moon after a hailstorm, with Rico helping get the survivors free. Corrupt guards began killing prisoners on their march to safety in order to preserve oxygen for themselves and Rico was left as the only survivor, after killing the remaining guards. While he was rescued soon after, the prison officials had him modified on spurious grounds: he'd survived on the moon surface and they wanted to discourage other prisoners from believing this could be done to escape.<ref>''Rico Dredd: The Titan Years - The Third Law'' by Michael Carroll</ref> For the rest of his sentence, he received 'personal' treatment from the guards: the lack of crooked judges in the early days meant any caught were put through hell.

While on Titan there he illicitly fathered a daughter, [[Vienna Dredd]], with a reporter who was interviewing him.<ref>"Blood & Duty," ''2000 AD'' #1300</ref> He discovered a crashed escape pod with an alien prince inside and sent out the pod's escape signal; in exchange, he asked that the alien fleet destroy the Earth when they arrived. He only told the truth to Jude, the oldest Titan prisoner, but rumours of "Rico's Rock" containing a great treasure would circulate through Titan for decades. (When the aliens arrived in the 2120s, Dredd impersonated Rico to call off the attack)<ref>''[[Judge Dredd: Trapped on Titan]]'' audio drama</ref> Even in his early months, Rico - having worked out there was an anti-alien military base on Titan - considered selling out Earth to hostile aliens in order to escape. <ref>''Rico Dredd: The Titan Years - The Third Law'' by Michael Carroll</ref>

After serving his time on Titan, Rico returned to [[Mega-City One]] seeking revenge on Joe. Confronting him at his home, Rico challenged him to a duel to settle their differences, knowing that with his superior skills he could always outdraw his brother. However he had grown used to the weaker gravity of Titan after his twenty years there. This slowed him down by a split second and allowed Joe to shoot him dead. Carrying his brother's lifeless body out into the street, Joe declined a paramedic's offer of assistance, allowing the writer, [[Pat Mills]], to conclude the story with a line from [[the Hollies]] song, [[He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother|"He ain't heavy - he's my brother!"]]<ref>"The Return of Rico," ''2000 AD'' #30</ref> (In the retelling, Rico brings up the violence and hypocrisy of Justice Department as well as what he's gone through on Titan)

Long after Rico's death, Dredd would be haunted by his memory. He tried to stop Vienna from learning about her father's death but she believed he must have had a good reason for killing him.

One of the Dredd/Fargo clones would [[Judge Rico|take his name]] in an attempt to rehabilitate it; Gila Bruja would attack this Judge Rico with the spectre of his namesake, but Rico overcame him. <ref>Going After Billy Zane, Megs 314 to 318</ref>


===Alternate reality versions===

Several versions of Rico have been shown in alternate timelines or Dredd's idea of alternate timelines. 

''Dread Dominion'' depicts a universe where Dredd executed Rico rather than arrest him and descended into madness. Rico had survived and worked with that dimension's Judge Cal to overthrow his brother.

A Winter Special showed a universe where Rico survived and his influence spread: by 2117, Justice Department is a corrupt gangster state and Rico was the top enforcer. (The framing story means this could be a dream by Joe Dredd)<ref>2000 AD Winter Special 1995: "Perchance to Dream"</ref>

After consuming hallucigens, Dredd imagines a timeline where he never exisited and Rico carried vital medicine acrossed the [[Cursed Earth]] instead. Instead of giving it to [[Mega City Two]], Rico blackmails the city into making him Chief Judge.

In 2123, a triumphant Rico from an alternate universe was part of a pan-dimensional invasion of the regular Mega-City One. When the invaders discussed what to do with their prisoners, he said "Give all the judges to me". <ref>"Helter Skelter," 2000 AD #1250-1261</ref>

==In other media==
===E-books===
In 2014 a novella was published as an e-book, written by [[Michael Carroll (author)|Michael Carroll]], called ''Rico Dredd: The Titan Years: The Third Law''.<ref>[http://www.rebellionstore.com/products/the_third_law Rebellion]</ref>

===Film version===
[[Image:Rico_Assante.JPG|right|thumb|230px|Rico Dredd in ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'' portrayed by [[Armand Assante]].]]
Rico appears as the main [[villain]] and antagonist in the 1995 [[Judge Dredd (film)|''Judge Dredd'' movie]], in which Joe was played by [[Sylvester Stallone]] and Rico by [[Armand Assante]]. In this version, although they were cloned from identical DNA, they did not look the same. Rico was portrayed as a straightforward [[psychopath]], having reached a point where he killed the innocent on the grounds that the division between guilt and innocence was merely a matter of timing and everyone would commit a crime in time. His deviant behavior was attributed to something going wrong in his creation which made him the perfect criminal. They were both friends in school (Joe was unaware of their true kinship, but it is unclear when Rico learned about their connection), but when he became a murderer, Joe judged him and sentenced him to life imprisonment, and his death was faked to reassure the public and prevent the truth of the clone program coming to light.

Rico later broke out of prison with help from [[Judge Griffin]] and killed a reporter who had been investigating the Judge program. Since he and Joe had the same DNA, Joe was wrongly convicted of the murder and given a life sentence. Griffin, Rico, and a scientist named Ilsa Hayden ([[Joan Chen]]) began working to reopen the cloning lab that created Rico and Joe. Griffin planned to create a new generation of Judges to enforce his views on the populace, but Rico wanted to create clones of himself to take over Mega-City One and killed Griffin to get him out of the way. Once Joe returned to the city, Rico tried to persuade him to join the effort; when Joe refused, Rico tried to kill him. The two fought atop the [[Statue of Liberty]], and Joe threw Rico over the edge to his death.

It is thought to have been composed in the Sanskrit language in [[History of India|India]] between 300 and 350 CE.

==Organization==
The complete work comprises five major sections based on seventeen [[Bhumi (Buddhism)|levels (''b?hubh?mi'')]] which cover the entire range of mental and spiritual levels in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism.

# The Compendium of Definitions (''vini?caya-samgraha'') which discusses and explicates aspects of the ''b?hubh?mi'' portion
# The Compendium of Exegesis (''vivarana-samgraha''), a manual of hermeneutical and exegetical techniques.
# The Compendium of Synonyms (''pary?ya-samgraha'') defining many of the various strings of quasi-synonymical expressions found in the [[?gama (Buddhism)|?gama]]s.
# The Compendium of Topics (''vastu-samgraha'') summarizing and explaining the key topics of each s?tra contained in the ''Samyukta-?gama.''
# The Compendium of the Vinaya (''vinaya-samgraha'').

The Chinese version also contains a Compendium of [[Abhidharma]], missing from the Tibetan translation. 

Most of the ''b?hubh?mi'' section which includes such seminal works as the ''[[Bodhisattva]]-bh?mi'' and the ''[[?r?vaka]]-bh?mi'' survives in Sanskrit, but little survives from the other parts.

==Chinese translation==
By the end of the [[Sui dynasty]] (589-618), Buddhism within China had developed many distinct schools and traditions. In the words of [[Dan Lusthaus]]:{{quote|[ [[Xuanzang]] ] came to the conclusion that the many disputes and interpretational conflicts permeating Chinese Buddhism were the result of the unavailability of crucial texts in Chinese translation. In particular, he [Xuanzang] thought that a complete version of the ''Yog?c?rabh?mi-??stra'', an encyclopedic description of the stages of the Yog?c?ra path to Buddhahood written by Asa?ga, would resolve all the conflicts. In the sixth century an Indian missionary named Param?rtha (another major translator) had made a partial translation of it. Xuanzang resolved to procure the full text in India and introduce it to China. <ref>Lusthaus, Dan, [https://web.archive.org/web/20131208153924/http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/thinkers/xuanzang-bio-uni.htm ''Xuanzang (Hsüan-tsang)''] (undated). (accessed: December 12, 2007) </ref>}}

The leader of [[Nalanda]], ??labhadra taught this [[shastra]] to Xuanzang and other audiences three times in nine or fifteen months. The Xuanzang version consists of one hundred fascicles (''juan''), and was translated into Chinese between 646-648 CE at Hongfu Monastery ({{zh|c=???}}) and Dacien Monastery ({{zh|c=????}}).

Before Xuanzang's version, [[Dharmak?ema]], [[Gu?abhadra]] (394-468) and [[Paramartha]] had translated part of it.

==Tibetan translation==
The [[Tibet]]an version was done by team of Indian scholars including [[Jinamitra]], [[Prajñ?varma]] and [[Surendrabodhi]] together with the renowned Tibetan translator, Yéshé Dé ({{bo|w=ye shes sde}}) [[lotsawa]].  In East Asia, authorship is attributed to [[Maitreya-n?tha]], while the Tibetan tradition considers it to have been composed by [[Asanga]], but in all probability it is the work of several writers who compiled it during the 4th century CE.

'''Dundee Football Club''', founded in 1893, are a football club based in the city of [[Dundee]], Scotland. They are nicknamed ''The Dark Blues'' or ''The Dees'' and play their home matches at [[Dens Park]].  Dundee are one of two [[Scottish Premiership]] clubs in the city, along with local rivals [[Dundee United F.C.]].

The club's most successful era was in the 1960s when, under the management of [[Bob Shankly]], Dundee won the [[Scottish Football League]] title in [[1961-62 in Scottish football|1962]] for the first and only time in their history before reaching the semi-finals of the [[1962-63 European Cup]].  Dundee have also won one [[Scottish Cup]] & three [[Scottish League Cup]]s.

==History==
{{see also|List of Dundee F.C. seasons}}

===Late 19th and early 20th century===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
Dundee played their first league game on 12 August 1893 at West Craigie Park against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] securing a 3–3 draw. (The 120th anniversary of this match was commemorated on 31 July 2013 at [[Dens Park]] with Rangers again the opponents. The score was 1–1.) Dundee struggled during the first 10 years of their existence. Their best league position was 5th which they achieved in seasons 1895–96 and 1896–97. They also reached the semi-finals of the [[Scottish Cup]] in 1894–95 and 1897–98, losing to [[Renton F.C.|Renton]] and [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] respectively. On 26 October 1895 Dundee lost a league game by a record score of 0–11 to [[History of Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in Glasgow. On 1 January 1894 Dundee defeated [[Newton Heath F.C.|Newton Heath]] (the future Manchester United) 2–1 at their then [[Carolina Port]] ground in Dundee. Carolina Port also hosted the first international football match held in Dundee on [[1895-96 British Home Championship|21 March 1896]] when Scotland defeated Wales 4–0. Dundee's goalkeeper [[List of Scotland international footballers (1–4 caps)|Frank Barrett]], midfielder [[List of Scotland international footballers (5–24 caps)|Sandy Keillor]] and inside-forward [[List of Scotland international footballers (1–4 caps)|Bill Thomson]] were all capped for Scotland during this early period of the club's history. Things began to improve for Dundee with the beginning of the new century. In 1899 they moved from Carolina Port to their present ground of [[Dens Park]]. In season [[1902-03 in Scottish football|1902–03]] they finished runners-up in the league championship to [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]]. (In season 1902–03 Dundee allowed just 12 league goals against. This remains the lowest amount of goals conceded by any British club in a full league season.) Dundee were also league runners-up in 1906–07 and 1908–09 finishing behind Celtic on both occasions, in [[1908-09 in Scottish football|1908–09]] by just 1 point. In the 10 seasons from 1902–03 Dundee lost just 16 league games at Dens Park out of 154 played and were unbeaten at home during season [[1909-10 in Scottish football|1909–10]]. Although ultimate success eluded Dundee in the league the club did manage to achieve success in the Scottish Cup. In season [[1909-10 in Scottish football|1909–10]] Dundee won their first trophy by defeating Clyde in the [[1909-10 Scottish Cup|Scottish Cup Final]]. (Remarkably, Dundee took 3 games to beat [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in the semi-final and then the same number to defeat [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]].) The winning goal in the 2nd replay was scored by [[John Hunter (footballer)|John 'Sailor' Hunter]]. In season [[1910-11 Scottish Cup|1910–11]] Dundee defeated [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] 2–1 at Dens Park in the Scottish Cup quarter-final but lost to [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton]] in the semi-final. The beginning of the First World War and the call-up of many players for military duty drastically curtailed football in Britain from 1914 and in [[List of Dundee F.C. seasons|1917]] Dundee and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] were both asked to withdraw from the league due to increasing transport costs for the other league clubs. In 1919 league football recommenced and good home form once again propelled Dundee up the league. They finished 4th in seasons [[1919-20 in Scottish football|1919–20]], [[1920-21 in Scottish football|1920–21]] and [[1921-22 in Scottish football|1921–22]], and were unbeaten at home during season 1921–22. However, they could not make the breakthrough to win the league championship.

[[Dave Halliday]] had played on the left for his previous clubs, his hometown side [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] and [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]]. Halliday went then to Dundee in 1921 with the celebrated Alec Troup already playing on the left wing. Dundee thus converted Halliday to [[centre forward]] with prolific results, finishing as Scottish top scorer in the [[1923–24 in Scottish football|1923–24 season]] with 38 goals from 36 appearances – a very good return in the era of the 3-man off side rule. With Halliday Dundee reached the [[Scottish Cup 1924-25|1924–25 Scottish Cup]] final eliminating the holders en route, the [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrieonians]] side of [[Hughie Gallacher]]. Halliday scored 103 goals in just 147 league and cup appearances for the Dees.

===Mid 20th century===

[[File:Dundee FC League Performance.svg|thumb|300px|right|Chart of yearly table positions of Dundee in the Scottish League.]]The post-Second World War period was a golden era for Dundee Football Club. Having been relegated on the eve of war, the Dark Blues started in 1946 in the first official season in the second tier but within five years they were runners-up in the Scottish League Championship and won their first trophy in forty-one years.

Back to back ‘B’ Division titles earned George Anderson’s Dundee promotion in 1947 and just two years later they were within a whisker of becoming Champions of Scotland. Silverware wasn’t very far away however as after spending a world record transfer fee of £23,500 on [[Billy Steel]], much to the chagrin of modern day supporters of the club – at leastsome anyway – who resent the aspect of finance in football and wish instead for 'homegrown' talent, they won the Scottish League Cup in 1951 in one of the most exciting finals Hampden has ever seen.

Twelve months later Dundee were back at Hampden to become the first side to retain the League Cup and in between these two victories appeared in the 1952 Scottish Cup Final. The Dark Blue side of the era included such as Bill Brown, Tommy Gallacher, Doug Cowie, Alfie Boyd, Bobby Flavell and Billy Steel.

In the [[Scottish Cup 1958-59|1958–59 Scottish Cup]] Dundee suffered a shock 1–0 defeat to [[Highland Football League|Highland League]] side [[Fraserburgh F.C.|Fraserburgh]]. This is widely regarded as Dundee's most embarrassing defeat in their history.

===1960s – Dundee's golden age===

[[Bob Shankly]] (brother of [[Bill Shankly]]) was appointed manager in 1959. Dundee won the league title of Scotland's top division, then called the [[Scottish Football League First Division|Division One]], in the [[1961–62 in Scottish football|1961–62 season]]. With players such as Bobby Cox, Bobby Wishart, Pat Liney (Goalkeeper), Alan Cousin, Andy Penman, Hugh Robertson, [[Alan Gilzean]], [[Alex Hamilton (footballer born 1936)|Alex Hamilton]], [[Bobby Seith]], [[Gordon Smith (footballer born 1924)|Gordon Smith]] and [[Ian Ure]] they clinched the title with a win against [[St. Johnstone F.C.|St. Johnstone]], which in turn relegated St. Johnstone to the then Second Division. Gordon Smith earned the unique distinction of being the only player to win the Scottish football championship with three different clubs ([[Hibernian F.C.|Hibs]], [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] and Dundee), none of them either half of the traditionally dominant [[Old Firm]].<ref name = "ancell">[http://qosfc.com/new_newsview.aspx?newsid=976 "Bobby Ancell" 10 Dec 2011]</ref>

The [[1962–63 in Scottish football|following season]] the club reached the [[European Cup 1962–63#Semi finals|semi-finals]] of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] beating [[1. FC Köln]], [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] and [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]], before losing to [[A.C. Milan]]. The Dees reached the Scottish Cup final again in the [[Scottish Cup 1963-64|1963–64 competition]]. Shankly moved on from Dundee in February 1965.<ref name = "ancell"/>

The next manager after Shankly was former player [[Bobby Ancell]] from the 1947 B Division Championship side. Ancell took Dundee to a 1967–68 League Cup final against the previous season's European Cup winners, Celtic. Ancell's team scored three times at [[Hampden Park]] in Celtic's native [[Glasgow]] but still lost out 5–3. In the [[1967–68 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] Dundee eliminated opposition from Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland to meet [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] in the semi final. After a 1–1 draw at Dens, a 1–0 second leg win took Leeds through.<ref name = "ancell"/>

===Late 20th century===

In 1973 under the management of [[David White (football manager)|David White]] and captaincy of [[Tommy Gemmell]] the [[League Cup]] returned to Dens following a 1–0 win against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. This is to date the last occasion when one of Scotland's three major trophies went to Dens Park. Dundee lost in the [[1980 Scottish League Cup Final]] to city rivals Dundee United with [[Billy Williamson (footballer)|Billy Williamson]] playing in blue against his previous club.

===21st century===
In 2000 the club hit the headlines when they signed [[Argentina national football team|Argentine international]] [[Claudio Caniggia]],<ref>{{cite news

| accessdate = 24 March 2010}}</ref> The signing of such high-profile players along with many others led Dundee to a Scottish Cup final and two top-six finishes. This was achieved under the managership of [[Ivano Bonetti]], who also made a short but notable contribution on the park linking up well with the Caniggia. The attendances at Dundee were still short of the hoped for numbers and Dundee FC's spending significantly out-weighed their income. Dundee were soon forced into administration due to unsustainable spending, however the main factor was the lack of income during the period when the club's plans to sell off players at a profit was doomed when the bottom fell out of the transfer market just at that time. This was in part due to the effects of the [[Bosman rule|Bosman Rule]] being implemented. The rule, passed in European legislation, prevented football clubs from retaining players past their contact dates. In effect, an asset value of a football player was invalidated, when the contract expired and a football club often lost players without gaining financially.

Before Dundee went into financial trouble they knocked out Glasgow side [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] 2–0 away from home in the third round of the [[Scottish Cup]]. The fourth round saw Dundee knock out [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] 2–0 at [[Dens Park]]. Dundee continued their march towards [[Hampden Park]] with a 1–1 draw away and a 4–1 extra time victory over [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] at Dens booked their place in the semi-finals playing [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness CT]] at [[Hampden Park]]. The only goal of the game was by [[Georgi Nemsadze]]. This secured a 1–0 victory and a place in [[2003 Scottish Cup Final|the Final]] against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. In the final [[Barry Smith (footballer born 1974)|Barry Smith]] hit the post for Dundee but [[Lorenzo Amoruso]] scored to bring Dundee's cup run to an end.

In 2003, due to the club's failure to sell on players as anticipated, insufficient income was raised to fund the large wage bill, under owners Peter and James Marr, resulting in a £23&nbsp;m debt, they were forced to go into administration with many players such as [[Fabian Caballero]], [[Craig Burley]] and [[Georgia national football team|Georgian]] captain [[Giorgi Nemsadze]] leaving the club in 2005. Despite this huge debt, Dundee survived by selling their stadium in 2003. But the club was then relegated to the second tier of the Scottish leagues, where they remained until July 2012. In mid-2006, it was announced that financial restructuring would see the club become debt-free.

In early 2007 James and Peter Marr severed some of their ties with Dundee, stepping down as [[Chairman]] and [[Chief Executive]] respectively, when their company P&J Taverns was forced into administration. Bob Brannan and [[Dave MacKinnon (footballer)|Dave MacKinnon]] took the Marrs' place.

In 2008 after a poor run in the league, manager [[Alex Rae (footballer born 1969)|Alex Rae]] was sacked, with former manager [[Jocky Scott]] taking over for his third stint with the club.<ref name="Jocky Scott">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee/7695798.stm|title=Scott set for Dundee appointment|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 October 2008 | date=30 October 2008}}</ref>

In the 2009/10 season Dundee director Calum Melville was in trouble for claiming he was going to offer rivals [[Dundee United F.C.]] £500,000 for ex Dundee midfielder [[Scott Robertson (footballer born 1985)|Scott Robertson]].<ref name="Jocky Scott">{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/more-scottish-football/dundee-director-calum-melville-faces-grilling-over-planned-bid-for-dundee-united-s-scott-robertson-1.928974|title=Melville faces grilling for planned bid|publisher=Herald Scotland|accessdate=28 October 2009 | date=29 October 2009}}</ref> Dundee won [[Scottish League Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup Final]] when they beat Inverness Caledonian Thistle 3–2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/cups/challenge-cup/2009/11/23/alba-cup-final-inverness-caledonian-thistle-2-dundee-3-86908-21842989/|title=Alba Cup Final: Inverness Caledonian Thistle 2 Dundee 3|date=23 November 2009|work=DailyRecord|accessdate=30 December 2009}}</ref>

On 20 March 2010, Scott was sacked as manager after a 3–0 defeat at the hands of [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee/8578476.stm|title=First Division leaders Dundee sack manager Jocky Scott|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 March 2010|accessdate=20 March 2010 | first=Jim | last=Spence}}</ref>  He was replaced on 21 March 2010 by Gordon Chisholm, with Billy Dodds as his assistant.

In September 2010 Dundee was again on the brink of going into administration due to a £365,000 unpaid tax bill. During negotiations with [[HM Revenue & Customs]], the club's offer to pay £100,000 immediately was rejected.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/d/dundee/9034209.stm|title=Dundee director bullish about club's future|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2010-09-27 | first=Jim | last=Spence | date=27 September 2010}}</ref> On 14 September it was announced that the club would be going into administration.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee/9085810.stm|title=Dundee face threat of liquidation as staff await fate|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2010-10-14 | first=Jim | last=Spence | date=15 October 2010}}</ref>  As punishment for entering administration the Scottish Football League docked Dundee 25 points on 1 November 2010.  At the time the punishment was imposed, this left Dundee bottom of the First Division table with ?11 points, 20 points behind the second-bottom team.  Dundee later appealed their punishment and are to hear the outcome before Christmas 2010. On 10 December 2010 the Dark Blues Business Trust was set up by former Dundee owner Peter Marr to help the club recover from their financial situation. On 17 December 2010 Dundee's appeal was rejected which resulted in Dundee appealing the punishment to the SFA, who also rejected it. Dundee went on a 23 match undefeated streak in the first division beating the previous record set by the team.

On 12 May 2011, Dundee FC exited administration.  The club's supporters' trust, Dundee FC Supporters' Society Ltd., is now the majority shareholder.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13380218.stm | title=Dundee Exit Administration | accessdate=12 May 2011 | work=BBC News | date=12 May 2011}}</ref>

On 6 November 2011, it was announced Harry MacLean had resigned from his position as Chief Executive and would work a months notice.<ref name="Harry_Leaves">{{cite news |title=Harry MacLean Resignation |url=http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news_detail.asp?h=HARRY-MACLEAN-RESIGNATION&newsid=1969 |work=dundeefc.co.uk |publisher=Dundee F.C. |date=6 November 2011|accessdate=6 December 2011 }}</ref> MacLean, who had played a key role in saving the club during administration,<ref name="Harry_Leaves"/> accepted an invitation to re-join the club in a non-executive role before departing his position as Chief Executive.<ref>{{cite news |title=Statement from Dundee FC and DFCSS |url=http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news_detail.asp?h=STATEMENT-FROM-DUNDEE-FC-AND-DFCSS&newsid=1992 |work=dundeefc.co.uk |publisher=Dundee F.C. |date=21 November 2011|accessdate=6 December 2011 }}</ref> His resignation was followed just eleven days later by Stuart Murphy’s decision to step down as club Chairman and Director of the Club which was effective immediately.<ref>{{cite news |title=Club Statement |url=http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news_detail.asp?h=CLUB-STATEMENT&newsid=1984 |work=dundeefc.co.uk |publisher=Dundee F.C. |date=17 November 2011|accessdate=6 December 2011 }}</ref> On 27 December 2011, Harry MacLean resigned from his non-executive role<ref>{{cite news |title=Harry Leaves Board |url=http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/home/news_detail.asp?newsid=2073 |work=dundeefc.co.uk |publisher=Dundee F.C. |date=27 December 2011 |accessdate=27 December 2011 }}</ref> causing questions to arise about the stability of the boardroom.

On 16 July 2012, Dundee were invited to join the Scottish Premier League to replace [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] who were headed for Division 3.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18850864 | title=Rangers: Dundee invited to take place in SPL  | accessdate=16 July 2012 | work=BBC News | date=16 July 2012}}</ref>

Since the second period of administration, Dundee FC, along with their Supporters' Society implemented regular KPI targets. These targets were set to ensure in some part, that the failures that lead to administration and indeed, several decades of financial turmoil, could not be repeated. Dundee FC were left after the second administration with only [[Administration (British football)|footballing debt]] and no borrowing capability. Since exiting administration, the club has focussed on honouring the footballing debt, whilst keeping lower football wages and stadium bills, according to the income generated. 'Cutting your cloth' is  a phrase often used to describe how Dundee FC must ensure their future, but with recent promotion and increased fan attendance at matches, this may become less of an issue in season 2012/13.

After an unsuccessful season in the premier league, when they were asked to replace [[Rangers F.C.]], Dundee were again relegated after finishing bottom, despite vastly improved form after [[John Brown (footballer, born 1962)|John Brown]] replaced [[Barry Smith (footballer born 1974)|Barry Smith]] as manager toward the end of the season. The following season(2013–2014) Dundee would take part in the [[Scottish Championship]](formerly the 1st Division) after reforms were made to the Scottish league system.

Throughout the summer leading up to the start of the 2013–2014 season talks were held regarding a possible Texan based takeover with investments to be made of up to £650,000. The takeover was completed and former Director Bill Colvin was appointed as Chairman to oversee this new board of which main investor John Nelms joined. The main focus of this new board was to carry on the work of the previous board as well as using the investment to rebuild Dundee's youth setup in order to put the club in a stronger place to access the wealth of upcoming talent in Scotland. The 2013–2014 season proved to be one to remember with Dundee clinching the title and promotion to the top tier on the last day of the season with a 2–1 win over [[Dumbarton F.C.]]. After a slow start and some poor results, Hamilton Accies held top spot for a long time, eventually The Dees caught up but couldn't find a way to get clear despite several opportunities. After a heavy defeat to [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] and a draw against Alloa, Manager [[John Brown (footballer, born 1962)|John Brown]] was replaced by [[Paul Hartley]]. The new gaffer's first game was against leaders Hamilton and a much more promising Dundee side won 1–0 at Dens. The league twisted and turned, and it looked like Dundee had blown their chances of promotion with a shock 1–0 defeat away to [[Greenock Morton F.C.]] But a 3–0 win at Alloa for The Dark Blues and a 4–1 loss to [[Dumbarton F.C.]] for Hamilton meant Dundee were in the driving seat when it came to the finale. [[Dens Park]] was sold out completely for the game against [[Dumbarton F.C.]] and the home crowd were cheering when Christian Nade headed in Kevin McBride's Free Kick. Not long after, Peter MacDonald pounced to head in goal number 2. The away side pulled a goal back in the second half and Hamilton managed to close the goal difference with a 10–2 victory over Morton. But an incredible last minute save from Kyle Letheren meant Dundee got the 3 points, and clinched promotion to the Scottish Premiership.

===Return to the Premiership===

Paul Hartley was quick in the transfer window for the following season, bringing in no fewer than twelve new players, in order to rebuild the squad for top-flight football, having already signed [[Greg Stewart (footballer)|Greg Stewart]] on a pre-contract from Cowdenbeath and [[Philip Roberts]] who joined before the end of May. Released [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] players [[James McPake]] and [[Kevin Thomson]] were next to join, along with [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa]] Goalkeeper [[Scott Bain]]. Thomson was made Captain after signing. [[Simon Ferry]], released from Portsmouth then returned to his hometown to play for Dundee. [[Paul McGowan (footballer)|Paul McGowan]] and [[Paul McGinn]] arrived from [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]] and Dumbarton respectfully, then attacking midfielder [[Gary Harkins]] signed for his 3rd spell at the club on the last day of June, after also being released from [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]]. With a number of first team players departing namely [[Christian Nade]] and [[Ryan Conroy]] who both went on to join [[raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]], [[Gavin Rae]] who retired from playing and player-coach [[Matt Lockwood]].

On the opening day of the [[2014–15 Dundee F.C. season|2014–15 season]], Dundee recorded a 1–1 draw against [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] at home, [[Gary Harkins]] put Dundee ahead from the spot after [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] conceded a penalty, with [[Craig Slater]] equalizing for the visitors from a well struck free-kick on the edge of the Dundee area. Dundee won their first game of the [[2014–15 Dundee F.C. season|2014–15 season]] on 23 August with a 1–0 win over [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]] away from home, a 79th minute goal from [[Peter MacDonald (footballer)|Peaso]] securing the win, making them unbeaten in their first four league games of the season. Dundee also started the League Cup well with two 4–0 wins on the bounce over [[Peterhead F.C.]] and [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]].

==Stadium==

[[File:dens_stand.jpg|thumb|right|The Bob Shankly Stand of [[Dens Park]]]]

{{main|Dens Park}}

Since 1899, Dundee have played their home matches at Dens Park which has a capacity of 11,506.[1] Uniquely, the stadium shares part of the same road (Sandeman Street) as [[Tannadice Park]], which is the home of city rivals Dundee United F.C.

In 2002, plans were drawn up for a new stadium to be built in the city as part of Scotland's bid to host the [[2008 European Football Championship]]. This stadium would have been shared by Dundee and near-neighbours Dundee United, which would have required the two to leave their historic grounds at Dens Park and Tannadice Stadium respectively.  However, when [[Ukraine]] & [[Poland]] were selected to co-host the event, the plans were shelved for the immediate future.

In May 2009, it was reported that the stadium is owned by local businessman John Bennett who, despite having invested heavily in Dundee, has rejoined the Dundee United board, where he had previously been a director until September 2008.[2]

In October 2014, Dundee Supporter's Society announced they have put forward plans to Bill Colvin which may allow the club to buy back the stadium from current owner John Bennett. They also expressed, this was not a plan to enable the Supporter's Society to own the Stadium but for the club themselves, they said they will "simply administer the scheme". <ref>http://www.dee4life.com/news/47/chairmans-update-october.html</ref>

Supporters argue the Reid technique is useful in extracting information from otherwise unwilling suspects, while critics have charged the technique can elicit [[false confession (legal)|false confessions]] from innocent persons, especially children.  Indeed, Reid's breakthrough case resulted in an overturned conviction decades later.<ref>Starr, Douglas. [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/12/09/131209fa_fact_starr "The Interview: Do police interrogation techniques produce false confessions?"], ''The New Yorker'', December 9, 2013</ref>

The term "Reid Technique" is a registered trademark of the firm John E. Reid and Associates, which offers training courses in the method they have devised. The technique is widely used by [[police|law-enforcement agencies]] in [[North America]]. However it has been criticized as it has a long history of eliciting false confessions.<ref>Brian Gallini, "Police 'Science' in the Interrogation Room: Seventy Years of Pseudo-Psychological Interrogation Methods to Obtain Inadmissible Confessions", ''Hastings Law Journal'', 61 (February 2010), p. 529.  See abstract at:  http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1474813</ref>

==Process==

In the Reid technique, interrogation is an accusatory process in which the investigator tells the suspect that there is no doubt as to his or her guilt. The interrogation is in the form of a [[monologue]] presented by the investigator rather than a question and answer format. The demeanor of the investigator during the course of an interrogation is ideally understanding, patient, and non-demeaning. His or her goal is to make the suspect progressively more and more comfortable with acknowledging the presumed truth about what he or she is alleged to have done. This is accomplished by the investigators' first imagining and then offering the subject various psychological constructs as justification for their behavior.

For example, an admission of guilt might be prompted by the question, "Did you plan this out or did it just happen on the spur of the moment?" This technique uses a [[loaded question]] that contains the unspoken, implicit assumption of guilt. The idea is that the person under interrogation must catch the hidden assumption and contest it to avoid the trap. Critics regard this strategy as hazardous, arguing that it is subject to [[confirmation bias]] (likely to reinforce inaccurate beliefs or assumptions) and may lead to prematurely narrowing an investigation.

=== Nine steps of interrogation ===
The Reid technique's nine steps of interrogation are:<ref>{{cite book| title=Practical Aspects of Interview and Interrogation |first1=David E. |last1=Zulawski |first2=Douglas E. |last2=Wicklander |publisher=CRC Press |location=Ann Arbor |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8493-0101-8}}</ref>

* Step 1 - Direct confrontation.  Lead the suspect to understand that the evidence has led the police to the individual as a suspect.  Offer the person an early opportunity to explain why the offense took place.
* Step 2 - Try to shift the blame away from the suspect to some other person or set of circumstances that prompted the suspect to commit the crime.  That is, develop themes containing reasons that will justify or excuse the crime.  Themes may be developed or changed to find one to which the accused is most responsive.
* Step 3 - Try to discourage the suspect from denying his or her guilt. Reid training video: "If you’ve let him talk and say the words ‘I didn’t do it’[...]the more difficult it is to get a confession."{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
* Step 4 - At this point, the accused will often give a reason why he or she did not or could not commit the crime. Try to use this to move towards the confession.
* Step 5 - Reinforce sincerity to ensure that the suspect is receptive.
* Step 6 - The suspect will become quieter and listen.  Move the theme discussion towards offering alternatives.  If the suspect cries at this point, infer guilt.
* Step 7 - Pose the “alternative question”, giving two choices for what happened; one more socially acceptable than the other.  The suspect is expected to choose the easier option but whichever alternative the suspect chooses, guilt is admitted.  There is always a third option which is to maintain that they did not commit the crime.
* Step 8 - Lead the suspect to repeat the admission of guilt in front of witnesses and develop corroborating information to establish the validity of the confession.
* Step 9 - Document the suspect's admission or confession and have him or her prepare a recorded statement (audio, video or written).

'''Wittenberg''' is a district (''Kreis'') in the east of [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Germany]]. Neighboring districts are (from west clockwise) [[Anhalt-Bitterfeld]], the district-free city of [[Dessau-Roßlau]], the districts of [[Potsdam-Mittelmark]], [[Teltow-Fläming]] and [[Elbe-Elster]] in [[Brandenburg]], and the district of [[Nordsachsen]] in the [[Free State of Saxony]].

== History ==
In 1994 the district was merged with the district of Jessen and a small part of the district of Gräfenhainichen. In 2007, 27 municipalities from the former district [[Anhalt-Zerbst]] were added to the district of Wittenberg.

== Geography ==
The main rivers in the district are the [[Elbe]] and its tributary, the [[Schwarze Elster]].
<!--==Partnerships==-->

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms show two swords which is the symbol of a field marshal in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. This title was bestowed upon the counts of Saxony, who therefore added the symbol to their coat of arms. The center of the principality of Saxony was located in the area now covered by the district.

== Towns and municipalities ==

The district of Wittenberg consists of the following towns: 

#[[Annaburg]]
#[[Bad Schmiedeberg]] 
#[[Coswig, Anhalt|Coswig]]
#[[Gräfenhainichen]]
#[[Jessen (Elster)]] 
#[[Kemberg]] 
#[[Oranienbaum-Wörlitz]]
#[[Wittenberg]] 
#[[Zahna-Elster]]

After the resolution of 6 October 2005, as part of municipal reform, the (then) 27 towns and municipalities of the former Verwaltungsgemeinschaften of [[Coswig (Verwaltungsgemeinschaft)|Coswig]] and [[Wörlitzer Winkel]], formerly in the [[Anhalt-Zerbst]] district, were assigned to Wittenberg district on 1 July 2007.

'''Fred Hampton''' (August 30, 1948 – December 4, 1969) was an [[African-American]] activist, chairman of the [[Illinois]] chapter of the [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP), and deputy chairman of the national BPP. He was murdered while sleeping at his apartment during a raid by a tactical unit of the [[Cook County, Illinois]] State's Attorney's Office (SAO), in conjunction with the [[Chicago Police Department]] (CPD) and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). Hampton's murder was chronicled in the documentary film ''[[The Murder of Fred Hampton]]'' (1971) as well as an episode of the critically acclaimed documentary series ''[[Eyes on the Prize]]''.<ref>{{YouTube|rEBQ5ELEvbc|Episode 12: A Nation of Law (1968-1971)}}.  (This is a link to the first part of the episode; parts two and three can be easily accessed from the link to part one.)</ref>

==Youth==
Hampton was born on August 30, 1948, in present day [[Summit, Illinois]], and grew up in [[Maywood, Illinois|Maywood]], a suburb west of the city.  His parents had moved north from [[Louisiana]], and both worked at the Argo Starch Company.  As a youth, Hampton was gifted both in the classroom and on the [[Sport|athletic]] field, and strongly desired to play center field for the [[New York Yankees]]. He graduated from [[Proviso East High School]] with honors in 1966.

Following his graduation, Hampton enrolled at [[Triton College|Triton Junior College]] in nearby [[River Grove, Illinois]], where he majored in pre-law. He planned to become more familiar with the legal system, to use it as a defense against police. He and fellow [[Black Panthers]] would follow police, watching out for [[police brutality]], and used this knowledge of law as a defense. He also became active in the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), and assumed leadership of the Youth Council of the organization's West Suburban Branch.  In his capacity as an NAACP youth organizer, Hampton began to demonstrate his natural leadership abilities; from a community of 27,000, he was able to muster a youth group 500-members strong.  He worked to get more and better recreational facilities established in the neighborhoods, and to improve educational resources for Maywood's impoverished black community.  Through his involvement with the NAACP, Hampton hoped to achieve [[social change]] through [[nonviolent]] [[activism]] and [[community organizing]].<ref name="spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAhamptonF.htm |title=Fred Hampton |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref>

==Chicago==
About the same time that Hampton was successfully organizing young African-Americans for the NAACP, the [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP) started rising to national prominence.  Hampton was quickly attracted to the Black Panthers' approach, which was based on a [[Black Panther Party#Ten Point Program|ten-point program]] that integrated black [[self-determination]] and certain elements of [[Maoism]].  Hampton joined the Party and relocated to downtown Chicago, and in November 1968 he joined the Party's nascent Illinois chapter &mdash; founded by [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) organizer Bob Brown in late 1967.

Over the next year, Hampton and his associates made a number of significant achievements in Chicago.  Perhaps his most important accomplishment was his brokering of a [[nonaggression pact]] between Chicago's most powerful [[street gangs]]. Emphasizing that racial and ethnic conflict between gangs would only keep its members entrenched in [[poverty]], Hampton strove to forge a [[class-consciousness|class-conscious]], multi-racial alliance between the BPP, the [[Young Patriots Organization]], and the National [[Young Lords]] under the leadership of [[Jose Cha Cha Jimenez]]. Later, they were joined by the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] ("SDS"), the [[Black P. Stones|Blackstone Rangers]], the [[Brown Berets]], and the [[Red Guard Party]].<ref name="agents-repression-66" /><ref name="we-are-not-216" />  In May 1969, Hampton called a press conference to announce that a truce had been declared among this "rainbow coalition", a phrase coined by Hampton and made popular over the years by [[Jesse Jackson|Rev. Jesse Jackson]], who eventually appropriated the name in forming his own, unrelated, coalition, [[Rainbow/PUSH]].

Hampton's organizing skills, substantial oratorical gifts, and personal charisma allowed him to rise quickly in the Black Panthers. Once he became leader of the Chicago chapter, he organized weekly rallies, worked closely with the BPP's local People's Clinic, taught political education classes every morning at 6am, and launched a project for community supervision of the police. Hampton was also instrumental in the BPP's Free Breakfast Program. When Brown left the Party with [[Stokely Carmichael]] in the [[FBI]]-fomented [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]]/Panther split, Hampton assumed chairmanship of the Illinois state BPP, automatically making him a national BPP deputy chairman. As the Panther leadership across the country began to be decimated by the impact of the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]], Hampton's prominence in the national hierarchy increased rapidly and dramatically. Eventually, Hampton was in line to be appointed to the Party's Central Committee's Chief of Staff. He would have achieved this position had it not been for his [[assassination]] on the morning of December 4, 1969.<ref name="agents-repression-66" /><ref name="we-are-not-216" />

==FBI investigation==
While Hampton impressed many of the people with whom he came into contact as an effective leader and talented communicator, those very qualities marked him as a major threat in the eyes of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. It began keeping close tabs on his activities. Subsequent investigations have shown that FBI chief [[J. Edgar Hoover]] was determined to prevent the formation of a cohesive Black movement in the [[United States]].  Hoover saw the Panthers, and similar radical coalitions forged by Hampton in Chicago, as a frightening steppingstone toward the creation of just such a revolutionary body that could, in its strength, cause a radical change in the U.S. government.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The FBI opened a file on Hampton in 1967 that over the next two years expanded to twelve volumes and over 4000 pages.  A [[wire tap]] was placed on Hampton's mother's phone in February 1968.  By May of that year, Hampton's name was placed on the "[[Agitator]] Index", and he would be designated a "key militant leader for Bureau reporting purposes."{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} <!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:William O'Neal.jpg|thumb|William O'Neal]] -->

In late 1968, the Racial Matters squad of the FBI's Chicago field office brought in an individual named William O'Neal, who had recently been arrested twice, for interstate car theft and impersonating a federal officer.  In exchange for having his felony charges dropped and a monthly stipend, O'Neal apparently agreed to infiltrate the BPP as a counterintelligence operative.<ref>[http://altlaw.org/v1/cases/493231 "Iberia HAMPTON et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v. Edward V. HANRAHAN et al., Defendants-Appellees, United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, September 12, 1979, page 1, paragraph 13."]</ref>  He joined the Party and quickly rose in the organization, becoming Director of Chapter security and Hampton's [[bodyguard]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In 1969, the FBI special agent in San Francisco wrote Hoover that the agent's investigation of the BPP revealed that in his city, at least, the Panthers were primarily feeding breakfast to children. Hoover fired back a memo implying the career ambitions of the agent were directly related to his supplying evidence to support Hoover's view that the BPP was "a violence-prone organization seeking to overthrow the Government by revolutionary means".{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

By means of anonymous letters, the FBI sowed distrust and eventually instigated a split between the Panthers and the [[Black P. Stones|Rangers]], with O'Neal himself instigating an armed clash between the two on April 2, 1969.  The Panthers became effectively isolated from their powerbase in the [[ghetto]], so the FBI went to work to undermine its ties with other radical organizations.  O'Neal was instructed to "create a rift" between the Party and SDS, whose Chicago headquarters was only blocks from that of the Panthers.  The Bureau released a batch of [[racist]] cartoons in the Panthers' name,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} aimed at alienating white activists, and launched a [[disinformation]] program to forestall the realization of the "Rainbow Coalition".  In repeated directives, Hoover demanded that the [[COINTELPRO]] personnel "destroy what the [BPP] stands for" and "eradicate its 'serve the people' programs".{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

On July 16, there was an armed confrontation between party members and the [[Chicago Police Department]], which left one BPP member mortally wounded and six others arrested on serious charges.

On May 26, 1969, Hampton was successfully prosecuted in a case related to a theft in 1967 of $71 worth of [[Good Humor]] Bars in Maywood. He was sentenced to two to five years but managed to obtain an [[appeal bond]], and was released in August.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In early October, Hampton and his girlfriend, Deborah Johnson (now known as Akua Njeri), pregnant with their first child ([[Fred Hampton, Jr.]]), rented a four-and-a-half room apartment on 2337 West Monroe Street to be closer to BPP headquarters.  O'Neal reported to his superiors that much of the Panthers' "provocative" stockpile of arms was being stored there.  In early November, Hampton traveled to California on a speaking engagement to the [[UCLA]] Law Students Association.  While there, he met with the remaining BPP national hierarchy, who appointed him to the Party's Central Committee. Shortly thereafter, he was to assume the position of Chief of Staff and major spokesman.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Fred Hampton was quickly moving up the ranks in the Black Panther Party, and his talent as a political organizer has been described as remarkable.<ref name="agents-repression-66">{{cite book |author1=[[Ward Churchill]]|author2=Jim Vander Wall|year=1988|title=Agents of Repression: The FBI's Secret Wars Against the Black Panther Party and the [[American Indian Movement]]|isbn=0-89608-293-8|page=66}}</ref><ref name="we-are-not-216">{{cite book |title=We Are Not What We Seem: Black Nationalism and Class Struggle in the American Century|author=Rod Bush|isbn=978-0-8147-1318-1|year=2000|publisher=NYU Press|page=216}}</ref>

In 1968, he was on the verge of creating a merger between the BPP and a southside street gang with thousands of members, which would have doubled the size of the national BPP.<ref name="agents-repression-66" /><ref name="we-are-not-216" />

In November 1969, Hampton traveled to California and met with the National BPP leadership at UCLA. It was there that they offered him a position on the Central Committee as the chief of staff and asked him to serve as the national spokesman for the BPP. While Hampton was out of town, two Chicago police officers, [[John J. Gilhooly]] and [[Frank G. Rappaport]], were killed in a gun battle with Panthers on the night of November 13. A total of nine police officers were shot; a 19-year-old Panther named Spurgeon Winter, Jr. was killed by police; and another Panther, Lawrence S. Bell, was charged with murder. In an editorial headlined "No Quarter for Wild Beasts", the ''Chicago Tribune'' urged that Chicago police be given the order to approach all Panther suspects prepared to shoot.<ref>"Second Cop in Gun Battle Dies, Wounded Describe Nightmare", ''Chicago Tribune'', Nov. 14, 1969, p. 1.</ref><ref>"No Quarter for Wild Beasts", ''Chicago Tribune'', Nov. 15, 1969, p. 10.</ref>

The FBI, determined to prevent any enhancement of the BPP leadership's effectiveness, decided to set up an armed raid on Hampton's Chicago apartment. FBI informant William O'Neal provided them with detailed information about Hampton's apartment, including the location of furniture and the bed in which Hampton and his then-pregnant girlfriend slept. An augmented, 14-man team of the SAO &mdash; Special Prosecutions Unit &mdash; was organized for a pre-dawn raid armed with a warrant for illegal weapons.<ref name="agents-repression-66" /><ref name="we-are-not-216" />

On the evening of December 3, Hampton taught a political education course at a local church, which was attended by most members. Afterwards, as was typical, several Panthers retired to the Monroe Street apartment to spend the night, including Hampton and Deborah Johnson (also known as Akua Njeri), Blair Anderson, Ronald "Doc" Satchell, Harold Bell, Verlina Brewer, Louis Truelock, Brenda Harris, and [[Mark Clark (Black Panther)|Mark Clark]].

Upon arrival, they were met by O'Neal, who had prepared a late dinner, which the group ate around midnight. O'Neal had slipped the powerful [[barbiturate]] sleep agent, [[secobarbitol]], into a drink that Hampton consumed during the dinner, in order to sedate Hampton so he would not awaken during the subsequent raid. O'Neal left at this point, and, at about 1:30 a.m., Hampton fell asleep in mid-sentence talking to his mother on the telephone.<ref>{{cite book |title=We Are Not What We Seem: Black Nationalism and Class Struggle in the American Century|last=Bush|first=Rod|publisher=NYU Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8147-1318-1|page=216|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hhHCuKDo5xIC&pg=PA216}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Outlaws of America: the Weather Underground and the politics of solidarity|last=Berger|first=Dan|publisher=AK Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1-904859-41-3|page=66|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6KC36MHH3j8C&pg=PT66}}</ref><ref name='tcpp'>{{cite book | author1 = [[Ward Churchill]] | author2 = Jim Vander Wall | title = The COINTELPRO Papers: Documents from the FBI's Secret Wars Against Dissent | publisher = [[South End Press]] | year = 2002 | page = 358 | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DFlIcxsGUEIC&pg=PA358&lpg=PA358&dq=fred+hampton+drugged&source=web&ots=X7vAJT8-eb&sig=GuFsCQJEnJxDGxBpbL4GGsw31a4&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result | isbn = 0-89608-648-8 }}</ref><ref name="deep-pol-308">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zWewDbarT3YC&pg=PA308&dq=fred+hampton+drugged&source=web&ots=6FPcUkNDum&sig=hSsNL341vsDHdQi6PA1_rxY-zlQ&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result#PPA314,M1|title=Deep Politics and the Death of JFK|author=Peter Dale Scott|page=308|publisher=Univ. of California Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-520-20519-2}}</ref> Although Hampton was not known to take drugs, Cook County chemist Eleanor Berman would report that she ran two separate tests which each showed a powerful barbiturate had been introduced into Hampton's blood.

At 4:00 a.m., the heavily armed police team arrived at the site, divided into two teams, eight for the front of the building and six for the rear. At 4:45 a.m., they stormed into the apartment.

Mark Clark, sitting in the front room of the apartment with a shotgun in his lap, was on security duty. He was shot in the heart and died instantly.<ref name="Hampton v.

Automatic gunfire then converged at the head of the south bedroom where Hampton slept, unable to awaken as a result of the barbiturates the FBI infiltrator had slipped into his drink. He was lying on a mattress in the bedroom with his pregnant fiancée, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant with their child.<ref name="Hampton v. City Of Chicago, et al"/> Two officers found him wounded in the shoulder, and fellow Black Panther Harold Bell reported that he heard the following exchange:

:"That's Fred Hampton."
:"Is he dead?... Bring him out."
:"He's barely alive.
:"He'll make it."

Two shots were heard, which it was later discovered were fired point blank in Hampton's head.  According to Johnson, one officer then said:

:"He's good and dead now."<ref name="agents-repression-69-70">{{cite book |author1=[[Ward Churchill]]|author2=Jim Vander Wall|year=1988|title=Agents of Repression: The FBI's Secret Wars Against the Black Panther Party and the [[American Indian Movement]]|isbn=0-89608-293-8|pages=69–70}} -- The primary source cited by Churchill and Vander Wall for the police raid were court transcripts of Iberia Hampton, et al. vs. Plaintiffs-Appellants, v Edward V. Hanrahan, ''et al.'', Defendants-Appellees (Nos.77-1968, 77-1210 and 77-1370). In particular, witnesses Harold Bell and Deborah Johnson testified to the police exchange.</ref>

Hampton's body was dragged into the doorway of the bedroom and left in a pool of blood. The officers then directed their gunfire towards the remaining Panthers, who had been sleeping in the north bedroom (Satchel, Anderson, and Brewer).<ref name="Hampton v. City Of Chicago, et al"/>  Verlina Brewer, Ronald "Doc" Satchel, Blair Anderson, and Brenda Harris were seriously wounded,<ref name="Hampton v. City Of Chicago, et al"/> then beaten and dragged into the street, where they were arrested on charges of aggravated assault and the attempted murder of the officers. They were each held on US$100,000 bail.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Hampton's fiancée, Deborah Johnson, was eight months pregnant at the time and was sleeping next to him when the police raid began. She was forcibly removed out of the room by the police officers while an unconscious Hampton lay in bed. The seven Panthers that survived the raid were indicted by a grand jury on charges of attempted murder, armed violence, and various other weapons charges. These charges were subsequently dropped.  During the trial, the Chicago police department claimed that the Panthers were the first to fire shots; however, a later investigation found that the Chicago police fired approximately anywhere between ninety and ninety-nine shots while the Panthers had in reality only shot twice. After the raid, the apartment was left unguarded, which allowed the Panthers to send some members to investigate. They brought with them a videographer, and the footage was later released in the 1971 documentary ''The Murder of Fred Hampton''.

Despite the evidence that suggested otherwise, Hampton's death was ruled as a justifiable homicide. However, after a surge in support of the Black Panthers, the rising public pressure forced the county to re-open and re-examine the case. Ceding to the pressure, the county held a trial July 1972 to determine whether or not law officials had a part in a conspiracy to obstruct justice. Four months later, the defendants were found not guilty of all charges.

After a break-in at an FBI office in Pennsylvania the existence of an illegal counter-intelligence program that went by the name of [[COINTELPRO]] was brought to light. The purpose of this program was to target and neutralize "Black Nationalist-Hate Groups". When knowledge of this program came to light, many began to suspect that the police raid and the assassination of Fred Hampton was a part of the program's initiative. One of the documents that were released after the break-in was a floor plan of Hampton's apartment. Another document outlined a deal the FBI brokered with the deputy attorney general to conceal the FBI's role in the assassination of Hampton and the existence of COINTELPRO.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Hans|title=The Black Panthers and the Assassination of Fred Hampton|journal=Journal of Pan African Studies|year=2010|volume=3|issue=6}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
[[File:Fred Hampton BPP funeral.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Funeral procession for Fred Hampton. Hampton was widely loved in the black Chicago community, and his funeral was attended by over 5,000 people.]]
At a press conference the next day, the police announced the arrest team had been attacked by the "violent" and "extremely vicious" Panthers and had defended themselves accordingly.  In a second press conference on December 8, the assault team was praised for their "remarkable restraint", "bravery", and "professional discipline" for not killing all the Panthers present. Photographic evidence was presented of "bullet holes" allegedly made by shots fired by the Panthers, but this was soon challenged by reporters (although the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' initially published these photos in support of the police action).  An internal investigation was undertaken, and the assault team was exonerated of any wrongdoing.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Hampton's funeral was attended by 5,000 people, and he was eulogized by such black leaders as [[Jesse Jackson]] and [[Ralph Abernathy]], [[Martin Luther King]]'s successor as head of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]].  In his eulogy, Jackson noted that "when Fred was shot in Chicago, black people in particular, and decent people in general, bled everywhere."{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

On December 6, members of the [[Weather Underground]] destroyed numerous police vehicles in a retaliatory bombing spree at 3600 N. Halsted Street, Chicago.<ref>Weather Underground Anon. Prairie Fire: The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-Imperialism. UK, Red Dragon Print Collective, c1970.</ref>

Four weeks after witnessing Hampton's death at the hands of the police, Deborah Johnson gave birth to [[Fred Hampton, Jr.]].<ref>[http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2009/12/05/18631541.php Fred Hampton Jr. Speaks About the Assassination of His Father]</ref>

Civil rights activists [[Roy Wilkins]] and [[Ramsey Clark]] (styled as "The Commission of Inquiry into the Black Panthers and the Police") subsequently alleged that the Chicago police had killed Fred Hampton without justification or provocation and had violated the Panthers' constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure.<ref name="spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk"/>  "The Commission" further alleged that the Chicago Police Department had imposed a summary punishment on the Panthers.<ref>Wilkins, Roy and Ramsey Clark, chairmen.

==Legacy==

===Legal and political impacts===
According to a 1969 ''Chicago Tribune'' report, "The raid ended the promising political career of Cook County State's Atty. Edward V. Hanrahan, who was indicted but cleared with 13 other law-enforcement agents on charges of obstructing justice. Bernard Carey, a Republican, defeated him in the next election, in part because of the support of outraged black voters."<ref>{{cite news|work=Chicago Tribune|date=December 4, 1969|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-chicagodays-pantherraid-story,0,3414208.story

The families of Hampton and Clark filed a US$47.7 million civil suit against the city, state, and federal governments. The case went to trial before Federal Judge [[Joseph Sam Perry|J. Sam Perry]]. After more than 18 months of testimony and at the close of the Plaintiff's case, Judge Perry dismissed the case. The Plaintiffs appealed and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, ordering the case to be retried.  More than a decade after the case had been filed, the suit was finally settled for $1.85 Million.<ref name="philly"/> The two families each shared in the settlement.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Jeffrey Haas, author and attorney for the plaintiffs in the federal suit ''Hampton v. Hanrahan'', posited that Chicago was worse off without Hampton:

{{cquote|Of course, there's also the legacy that, without a young leader, I think the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] of Chicago degenerated a lot into drugs. And without leaders like Fred Hampton, I think the gangs and the drugs became much more prevalent on the West Side. He was an alternative to that. He talked about serving the community, talked about breakfast programs, educating the people, community control of police. So I think that that's unfortunately another legacy of Fred's murder.<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2009/12/4/the_assassination_of_fred_hampton_how Jeffrey Haas interview with Democracy Now]</ref>}}

In 1990, the [[Chicago City Council]] unanimously passed a resolution, introduced by then-Alderman Madeline Haithcock, commemorating Dec. 4, 2004, as "Fred Hampton Day in Chicago". The resolution read in part: "Fred Hampton, who was only 21 years old, made his mark in Chicago history not so much by his death as by the heroic efforts of his life and by his goals of empowering the most oppressed sector of Chicago's Black community, bringing people into political life through participation in their own freedom fighting organization."<ref>{{cite news|work=Workers World|url=http://www.workers.org/ww/2004/hampton1216.php|date=December 16, 2004|author=Monica Moorehead|title=CHICAGO: 'Fred Hampton Day' declared}}</ref>

===Weather Underground reaction===
In response to the killings of Black Panther members Fred Hampton and [[Mark Clark (Black Panther)|Mark Clark]] in December, 1969, during a police raid, on May 21, 1970, the [[Weather Underground]] issued a "Declaration of War" against the United States government, using for the first time its new name, the "Weather Underground Organization" (WUO); they also adopted fake identities, and decided to pursue [[covert]] activities only. These initially included preparations for a bombing of a U.S. military non-commissioned officers' dance at [[Fort Dix]], New Jersey in what [[Brian Flanagan]] said had been intended to be "the most horrific hit the United States government had ever suffered on its territory".<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03/08/21/1441247 Democracy Now! | Ex-Weather Underground Member Kathy Boudin Granted Parole<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

'''''Guys and Dolls''''' is a [[musical theater|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Frank Loesser]] and book by [[Jo Swerling]] and [[Abe Burrows]]. It is based on "[[The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown]]" and "Blood Pressure"{{spaced ndash}}two short stories by [[Damon Runyon]],<ref name=nadel /><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ebooks-library.com/author.cfm/AuthorID/900 |title = Damon Runyon|work = Authors|publisher = The eBooks-Library|accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref>{{spaced ndash}}and also borrows characters and plot elements from other Runyon stories{{spaced ndash}}most notably "Pick the Winner".<ref>Stempel, 435</ref>

The premiere on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] was in 1950. It ran for 1200 performances and won the [[Tony Award]] for Best Musical. The musical has had several Broadway and London revivals, as well as a [[Guys and Dolls (film)|1955 film adaptation]] starring [[Marlon Brando]], [[Jean Simmons]], [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Vivian Blaine]].

''Guys and Dolls'' was selected as the winner of the 1951 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]]. However, because of writer [[Abe Burrows]]' troubles with the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC), the Trustees of Columbia University vetoed the selection, and no Pulitzer for Drama was awarded that year.<ref>Suskin, 275</ref>

==Background==
''Guys and Dolls'' was conceived by producers [[Cy Feuer]] and Ernest Martin as an adaptation of Damon Runyon's short stories.<ref name=Zolotow>Zolotow, Maurice. "Guys, Dolls and Runyon". ''The New York Times'', Nov. 12, 1950, Section 2, p. 1,3.</ref> These stories, written in the 1920s and 1930s, concerned gangsters, gamblers, and other characters of the New York underworld. Runyon was known for the unique dialect he employed in his stories, mixing highly formal language and slang.<ref name=Stempel434>Stempel, 434</ref> Frank Loesser, who had spent most of his career as a lyricist for movie musicals, was hired as composer and lyricist. [[George S. Kaufman]] was hired as director. When the first version of the show's book, written by [[Jo Swerling]], was deemed unusable, Feuer and Martin asked radio comedy writer [[Abe Burrows]] to write a new version of the book.<ref name=Zolotow/><ref>Suskin, 272-276</ref>

Loesser had already written much of the score to correspond with the first version of the book.<ref name=Stempel434/> Burrows later recalled, "Frank Loesser's fourteen songs were all great, and the [new book] had to be written so that the story would lead into each of them. Later on, the critics spoke of the show as 'integrated'. The word ''integration'' usually means that the composer has written songs that follow the story line gracefully. Well, we accomplished that but we did it in reverse".<ref>Burrows, Abe (1980). ''Honest Abe''. Boston: Atlantic-Little, Brown, p. 149, cited in Stempel, 434-435</ref> The character of Miss Adelaide was created specifically to fit [[Vivian Blaine]] into the musical, after Loesser decided she was ill-suited to play the conservative Sarah.<ref name="npr2000">Scott Simon (host). "Creation of the musical ''Guys and Dolls'', ''Weekend Edition Saturday'', National Public Radio, November 2=pk2000</ref> When Loesser suggested reprising some songs in the second act, Kaufman warned: "If you reprise the songs, we’ll reprise the jokes."<ref>{{cite book

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
A pantomime of never-ceasing activities depicts the hustle and bustle of New York City ("Runyonland"). Three small-time gamblers, Nicely-Nicely Johnson, Benny Southstreet, and Rusty Charlie, argue over which horse will win a big race ("Fugue for Tinhorns"). The band members of the Save-a-Soul Mission, led by the pious and beautiful Sergeant Sarah Brown, call for sinners to "Follow the Fold" and repent. Nicely and Benny's employer, Nathan Detroit, runs an illegal floating [[craps|crap game]]. Due to local policeman Lt. Brannigan's strong-armed police activity, he has found only one likely spot to hold the game: the "Biltmore garage." However, the owner, Joey Biltmore, requires a $1,000 security deposit, and Nathan is broke ("The Oldest Established"). Nathan hopes to get $1,000 by winning a bet against Sky Masterson, a gambler willing to bet on virtually anything.  Nathan proposes a bet which he believes he cannot lose: Sky must take a doll (a woman) of Nathan's choice to dinner in Havana, Cuba. Sky agrees, and Nathan chooses Sarah Brown. At the mission, Sky claims he wants to be saved, impressing Sarah with his knowledge of the Bible. He offers Sarah a deal: He will bring the mission "one dozen genuine sinners" if she will accompany him to Havana the next night. Sarah rebuffs him, telling him that she plans to fall in love with an upright, moral man. Sky replies that he plans on being surprised when he falls in love ("I'll Know"). Sky kisses Sarah, and she slaps him. Nathan goes to watch his fiancée of 14 years, Miss Adelaide, perform her nightclub act ("[[A Bushel and a Peck]]"). After her show, she asks him, as she has many times before, to go down to city hall and get a marriage license. She is distraught to find out that Nathan is still running the crap game. She consults a medical book, which tells her that her chronic cold is a psychosomatic reaction to her frustration with Nathan's failure to marry her ("[[Adelaide's Lament]]").

The next day, Nicely and Benny watch as Sky pursues Sarah, and Nathan tries to win back Adelaide's favor. They declare that guys will do anything for the dolls they love ("Guys and Dolls"). General Cartwright, the leader of the Save-a-Soul organization, visits the mission and explains that she will be forced to close the branch unless they succeed in bringing some sinners to the upcoming revival meeting. Sarah, desperate to save the mission, promises the General "one dozen genuine sinners", implicitly accepting Sky's deal. The gamblers, including a notorious gangster from Chicago named Big Jule, are waiting for Nathan to secure the spot for the game and Lt. Brannigan becomes suspicious. To convince him of their innocence, they tell Brannigan their gathering is Nathan's "surprise bachelor party". This satisfies Brannigan, and Nathan resigns himself to eloping with Adelaide. Adelaide goes home to pack, promising to meet him after her show the next afternoon. The Save-A-Soul Mission band passes by, and Nathan sees that Sarah is not in it; he realizes that he lost the bet and faints.

In a Havana nightclub, Sky buys a drink for himself and a "Cuban milkshake" for Sarah. She doesn't realize that the drink contains [[Bacardi]] rum, and she innocently drinks multiple glasses, becoming progressively tipsier.  Outside the club, Sarah kisses Sky and proclaims that she is truly enjoying herself for the first time in her life ("If I Were A Bell"). She wants to stay in Havana with Sky. Sky is surprised to find, though, that he truly cares about Sarah's welfare, and he insists that they go back to the airport and return to New York. Back in New York, it is 4:00 AM, and as Sky and Sarah (now sober) stand in the street outside the mission, Sky explains that this is his favorite time of day, and Sarah is the only woman he's ever wanted to share it with him ("My Time of Day"). They both spontaneously admit that they're in love ("I've Never Been in Love Before"). A siren rings out and gamblers run out of the mission, where Nathan has been holding the crap game. Sarah assumes that Sky took her to Havana and pretended to be in love with her just so Nathan could use the mission for the game, rejecting his protests of innocence.

===Act II===

The next evening, Adelaide performs her act at the Hot Box ("Take Back Your Mink"). Nathan doesn't show up for the elopement because he's still running the crap game. She soon realizes that Nathan has stood her up again and turns to her book for comfort ("Adelaide's Second Lament").

Sarah admits to Arvide Abernathy, her uncle and fellow mission worker, that she loves Sky but will never see him again because she believes he is responsible for the previous night's crap game. Abernathy expresses his faith in Sky's inherent goodness and urges Sarah to follow her heart ("More I Cannot Wish You"). Sky tells Sarah he intends to deliver the dozen genuine sinners for the revival. She doesn't believe him and walks off, but Arvide subtly encourages him.

Nicely shows Sky where the game is being held: the sewer ("Crapshooters Dance"). Big Jule has lost a large amount of cash and insists on playing on credit. To change his luck he uses his own dice which are blank and proceeds to cheat Nathan out of all of his money. Sky then arrives with Nicely. Big Jule isn't impressed in the slightest but Sky responds by punching him out. He then gives Nathan $1,000, saying that Nathan won the bet and implying that Sarah refused to go to Havana with him. Sky, determined to get the dozen sinners he promised Sarah, bets every man at the game a thousand dollars against their souls. If he loses, everyone gets a thousand dollars each, but if he wins, they must all attend the revival at the mission ("Luck, Be a Lady"). He tosses the dice. The gamblers head towards the mission, and it is clear that Sky has won his bet. On his way there, Nathan runs into Adelaide and tells her that he has to attend the prayer meeting. Adelaide does not believe him. She asks herself why she keeps putting up with Nathan's lies, and he tells her that he loves her ("Sue Me").

Sky and the gamblers arrive at the mission, much to Sarah's surprise. General Cartwright asks if anyone wishes to give testimony to their sins. Benny and Big Jule testify but another gambler named Harry The Horse lets slip that Sky only got them to the meeting because he won their souls in a dice game. The General is very pleased by this as it shows that good can come out of evil. Attempting to appear contrite, Nicely invents a dream which encouraged him to repent, and the gamblers join in with revivalist fervor ("Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat"). Brannigan arrives and threatens to arrest everyone for the crap game in the Mission, but Sarah clears them, saying that none of the gamblers were at the mission the previous night. After Brannigan leaves, Nathan gives testimony and confesses that they held the crap game in the mission. He also confesses the bet he made with Sky about taking Sarah to Havana. He adds that he won the bet, to Sarah's shock, and she realizes that Sky wanted to protect her reputation and must genuinely care about her.

Sarah and Adelaide run into each other, and they commiserate and then resolve to marry their men anyway and reform them later ("Marry the Man Today"). Several weeks later, Nathan has opened a newsstand and is going to marry Adelaide at the mission. Sky and Sarah have just been married, and Sky is playing in the mission band ("Guys and Dolls" (Finale/Reprise)).

===1982 London revival===
[[Laurence Olivier]] had wanted to play Nathan Detroit, and began rehearsals for a planned 1971 London revival of ''Guys and Dolls'' at his National Theatre Company's [[Old Vic]] theatre. However, due to poor health he had to stop, and his revival never saw the light of day.<ref>Vermilye, Jerry.

In 1982, [[Richard Eyre]] directed a major revival at London's [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]]. Eyre called it a "re-thinking" of the musical, and his production featured an award-winning neon-lit set design inspired by Rudi Stern's 1979 book ''Let There Be Neon'',<ref>Eyre, Richard.

Following Ian Charleson's untimely death from AIDS at the age of 40, in November 1990 two reunion performances of ''Guys and Dolls'', with almost all of the original 1982 cast and musicians, were given at the National Theatre as a tribute to Charleson. The tickets sold out immediately, and the dress rehearsal was also packed. The proceeds from the performances were donated to the new Ian Charleson Day Centre HIV clinic at the Royal Free Hospital, and to scholarships in Charleson's name at LAMDA.<ref>Benedict, David.

==Reception==
The original Broadway production of ''Guys and Dolls'' opened to unanimously positive reviews. Critics praised the musical's faithfulness to Damon Runyon's style and characterizations. [[Richard Watts, Jr.|Richard Watts]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' said "''Guys and Dolls'' is just what it should be to celebrate the Runyon spirit...[it is] filled with the salty characters and richly original language sacred to the memory of the late Master".<ref name=Suskin>Suskin, Steven. ''Opening Night on Broadway: A Critical Quotebook of the Golden Era of the Musical Theatre'', pp. 272-276. Schirmer Books, New York, 1990. ISBN 0-02-872625-1</ref> William Hawkins of the ''[[New York World-Telegram|New York World-Telegram & Sun]]'' stated, "It recaptures what [Runyon] knew about Broadway, that its wickedness is tinhorn, but its gallantry is as pure and young as [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Eva|Little Eva]]".<ref name=Suskin/> Robert Coleman of the ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]'' declared, "We think Damon would have relished it as much as we did".<ref name=Suskin/>

The book and score were greatly praised as well; John Chapman of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' declared, "The book is a work of easy and delightful humor. Its music and lyrics, by Frank Loesser, are so right for the show and so completely lacking in banality, that they amount to an artistic triumph".<ref name=Suskin/> Coleman stated, "Frank Loesser has written a score that will get a big play on the juke boxes, over the radio, and in bistros throughout the land. His lyrics are especially notable in that they help Burrows's topical gags to further the plot". In ''The New York Times'', [[Brooks Atkinson]] wrote, "Mr. Loesser's lyrics and songs have the same affectionate appreciation of the material as the book, which is funny without being self-conscious or mechanical".<ref name=Atkinson>[[Brooks Atkinson|Atkinson, Brooks]]. "At the Theatre". ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 25, 1950. p. 21</ref>

Multiple critics asserted that the work was of great significance to musical theatre. John McClain of the ''[[New York Journal American]]'' proclaimed, "it is the best and most exciting thing of its kind since ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]''. It is a triumph and a delight".<ref name=Suskin/> Atkinson stated, "we might as well admit that ''Guys and Dolls'' is a work of art. It is spontaneous and has form, style, and spirit."<ref name=Atkinson/> Chapman asserted, "In all departments, ''Guys and Dolls'' is a perfect musical comedy".<ref name=Suskin/>

==Film adaptations==
{{Main|Guys and Dolls (film)}}
On November 3, 1955 [[Guys and Dolls (film)|the film version]] of the musical was released, starring [[Marlon Brando]] as Sky, [[Frank Sinatra]] as Nathan Detroit, and [[Jean Simmons]] as Sarah, with [[Vivian Blaine]] reprising her role as Adelaide. The film was directed by [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] and produced by [[Samuel Goldwyn]].

Three new songs, written by Frank Loesser, were added to the film: "Pet Me Poppa"; "A Woman in Love"; and "Adelaide", which was written specifically for Sinatra. Five songs from the stage musical were omitted from the movie: "A Bushel and a Peck", "My Time of Day", "I've Never Been In Love Before", "More I Cannot Wish You", and "Marry the Man Today".

[[20th Century Fox]] acquired the film rights to the musical in early 2013, and plan to cast [[Channing Tatum]] and [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] in a remake of ''Guys and Dolls''.<ref>Fleming Jr., Mike [http://www.deadline.com/2013/04/fox-seals-guys-and-dolls-rights-wants-channing-tatum-joseph-gordon-levitt-to-fill-frank-sinatra-and-marlon-brando-shoes/ "Fox Seals ‘Guys And Dolls’ Rights; Wants Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt To Fill Frank Sinatra And Marlon Brando Shoes."] ''[[Deadline.com]]'' (April 24, 2013).</ref>

'''Operation Bernhard''' was the codename of a secret [[Nazism|Nazi]] plan devised during the [[World War II|Second World War]] by the [[SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt|RSHA]] and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] to destabilise the [[United Kingdom|British]] economy by flooding the country with forged [[Bank of England]] [[Pound sign|£]]5, £10, £20, and £50 [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|notes]]. It was the largest [[counterfeit]]ing operation in history and has been dramatised in books, the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] comedy-drama miniseries ''[[Private Schulz (TV series)|Private Schulz]]'' and a 2007 [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Oscar]]-winning [[Cinema of Austria|Austrian film]], ''[[The Counterfeiters (2007 film)|The Counterfeiters]]'' (Die Fälscher).

==History==
The plan was directed by, and named after, [[Schutzstaffel]] [[Sturmbannführer]] ([[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[Major]]) [[Bernhard Krüger]], who set up a team of 142 counterfeiters from inmates at [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] at first, and then from other camps, especially [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]].  Beginning in 1942, the work of engraving the complex printing plates, developing the appropriate rag-based paper with the correct watermarks, and breaking the code to generate valid serial numbers was extremely difficult, but by the time Sachsenhausen was evacuated in April 1945 the printing press had produced {{nowrap|8,965,080 banknotes}} with a total value of {{nowrap|£134,610,810.}} The notes are considered among the most perfect counterfeits ever produced, being almost impossible to distinguish from the real currency.

[[File:forgednote.jpg|thumb|<center>A £5 ([[White fiver]]) note forged by the Jewish [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] prisoners.</center>]]
The plan was to destabilize the [[Economic history of the United Kingdom#Second World War|British economy during the war]] by dropping the notes from aircraft, on the assumption that most Britons would collect the money and spend it, thus triggering inflation. This scheme was not put into effect: it was postulated that the Luftwaffe did not have enough aircraft to deliver the forgeries, and by that time the operation was in the hands of SS foreign intelligence. From late 1943, approximately one million notes per month were printed. Many were transferred from SS headquarters to a former hotel near [[Meran]] in [[South Tyrol]], [[Northern Italy]], from where they were laundered and used to pay for strategic imports and German secret agents operating in Allied countries. It has been rumoured that counterfeit currency was used to finance the [[Gran Sasso raid|rescue of Benito Mussolini]] in 1943.

The Bank of England learned of a plot from a spy as early as 1939 and detected forged notes in 1943, which were called "the most dangerous ever seen". Clerks first recorded the counterfeits from a British bank in [[Tangiers]]. Every banknote issued by the Bank of England was recorded in large leather-bound ledgers, still in the Bank's archives and it was found that one of the notes had been recorded as having been paid off.{{clarify|date=October 2013}} The counterfeiting team turned its attention to [[United States Dollar|US currency]], producing samples of one side of $100 bills on 22 February 1945, with production scheduled to start the next day but the Reich Security Head Office ([[SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt|RSHA]]) ordered the work halted and the press dismantled.

On the evacuation of Sachsenhausen, the counterfeiting team was transferred to [[Redl-Zipf]] in [[Austria]], a subsidiary camp of [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]]. At the beginning of May 1945, the team was ordered to transfer to [[Ebensee concentration camp|Ebensee subsidiary camp]], where they were to be murdered.<ref>Malkin, Lawrence. ''Krueger's Men: The Secret Nazi Counterfeit Plot and the Prisoners of Block 19'' (2006) ISBN 0-316-05700-2  ISBN 978-0-316-05700-4, p184</ref> Their SS guards had only one truck for the prisoners, so the transfer required three trips. The truck broke down during the third trip and the last batch of prisoners had to be marched to Ebensee, where they arrived on 4 May. The guards of the first two batches of prisoners fled when the prisoners at the Ebensee camp revolted and refused to be moved into tunnels, where they would have probably been blown up. The counterfeiters then dispersed among the prisoners at Ebensee. The order was that all the counterfeiters be liquidated together; the delayed arrival of the third batch therefore saved the lives of all of them.

The Ebensee camp was liberated by US forces on 6 May 1945.<ref>Max Garcia, "Befreiung des KZ-Nebenlagers Ebensee: Neue historische Details." ''Zeitschrift des Zeitgeschichtemuseums Ebensee,'' 1998.</ref> One of the prisoners, the [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Slovakia|Slovak]] printer-turned-counterfeiter [[Adolf Burger]], later contributed to the awareness of Operation Bernhard with several versions of [[Adolf Burger#Bibliography|his memoirs]] published in [[Central Europe]]an languages and in [[Persian language|Persian]]. An English version was published in 2009 as ''The Devil's Workshop''.<ref>Adolf Burger, ''The Devil's Workshop''. 2009. Frontline Books. ISBN 978-1-84832-523-4</ref>

After the war, Major Krüger was detained by the British for two years, then turned over to the French for a year. He said they asked him to forge documents but that he refused. He was released in 1948 without charge. In the 1950s he went before a De-Nazification Court, where statements were produced from the forger-inmates whose lives he had been responsible for saving. He later worked for the company that had produced the special paper for the Operation Bernhard forgeries.

After the defeat of the Third Reich, large bundles of fake pounds ended up in the hands of the Jewish underground, which used the forged notes to buy equipment and to bring colonists to [[Palestine]], among them Chaim Shurik, a Polish printer whose {{nowrap|20-page}} account of his counterfeiting days was written in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Kalish |first=Jon |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/13635/ |title=The Counterfeit Saga(s): What Really Happened at Sachsenhausen? |newspaper=[[The Forward]] |date=July 4, 2008 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}</ref>

It is believed that most of the notes produced ended up at the bottom of [[Lake Toplitz]] near Ebensee, from where they were recovered by divers in 1959 but examples turned up in circulation in Britain for many years, which caused the Bank of England to withdraw all notes larger than £5 from circulation. A new £5 banknote colored blue was issued on 21 February 1957 and the other denominations were reintroduced on February 21, 1964 (£10), July 9, 1970 (£20) and March 20, 1981 (£50).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/withdrawn/index.htm
|title=Bank of England: Withdrawn Banknotes |publisher=Bankofengland.co.uk}}</ref>

German spy [[Elyesa Bazna]] (codename "Cicero") was paid with counterfeit notes, sued the German government after the war for outstanding pay and lost the case.

==In fiction==
[[File:Adolf-Burger-Faussaires-2.JPG|thumb|[[Adolf Burger]] displaying a forged £5 note at the Paris première of ''[[:en:The Counterfeiters (2007 film)|Die Fälscher]]'', January 2008]]

A fictional version of Operation Bernhard was the topic of a comedy drama serial, ''[[Private Schulz (TV series)|Private Schulz]]'', starring [[Michael Elphick]] and [[Ian Richardson]], produced by the BBC in 1980.

Operation Bernhard forms part of the [[backstory]] for the forger in the 1972 [[Frederick Forsyth]] novel, ''[[The Odessa File]]''.

The 2007 Oscar-winning Austrian film, ''[[The Counterfeiters (2007 film)|The Counterfeiters]]'' (''Die Fälscher''), tells the story of Salomon Sorowitsch, loosely based on the lives of counterfeiter [[Salomon Smolianoff]] and Adolf Burger, a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Slovakia|Slovak]] book printer who was put to work on Operation Bernhard in Sachsenhausen concentration camp and whose memoirs were turned into the screenplay.<ref>Compare [http://www.lawrencemalkin.com/kruegers-men-the-secret-documents-7-1-1.html records of Smolianoff's 1946 debriefing], PRO [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=1807859&CATLN=6&accessmethod=5 MEPO 3/2766], from Lawrence Malkin's website</ref>

In the movie ''[[5 Fingers]]'', based upon the life of the German spy [[Elyesa Bazna|Cicero]], the final plot turn is the revelation that the British currency is counterfeit.

In the British comedy series ''[[Goodnight Sweetheart]]'' starring [[Nicholas Lyndhurst]], the episode "It's a Sin to Tell a Lie" involves the main characters catching a Nazi spy who [[uttering]] notes, forged by Operation Bernhard, in local pubs and shops in London.

The 1941 novel ''[[Traitor's Purse]]'' (US title ''The Sabotage Murder Mystery'') by [[Margery Allingham]] featured (presumably by coincidence) a similar plot where the forged notes were to be posted to every household in Britain, in parallel with a secretly-planned genuine Government mailing.

Dov Landau a leading character of the [[Leon Uris]] novel ''[[Exodus (novel)|Exodus]]'', was a Jewish teenager who saved his life by showing his counterfeiting skills during selection in [[Auschwitz]].

"Reichsbank forgeries" are mentioned in the James Bond novel ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'' during Bond's interview with a Colonel Smithers of the Bank of England.

'''''Empire of the Sun''''' is a 1984 novel by [[J. G. Ballard]] which was awarded the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] and was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/books/21ballard.html</ref> Like Ballard's earlier short story, "The Dead Time" (published in the anthology ''[[Myths of the Near Future]]''), it is essentially fiction but draws extensively on Ballard's experiences in [[World War II]]. The name of the novel is derived from the etymology of the name for [[Japan]].

Ballard later wrote of his experiences in China as a boy and the making of the film of the same name in his autobiography ''[[Miracles of Life]]''.

==Plot==
The novel recounts the story of a young British boy, Jamie Graham (named after Ballard's two first names, "James Graham"), who lives with his parents in Shanghai. After the [[Pearl Harbor attack]], [[Japanese Empire|Japan]] occupies the [[Shanghai International Settlement]], and in the following chaos Jim becomes separated from his parents.

He spends some time in abandoned mansions, living on remnants of packaged food. Having exhausted the food supplies, he decides to try to surrender to the Japanese Army. After many attempts, he finally succeeds and is interned in the [[Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center]].

Although the Japanese are "officially" the enemies, Jim identifies partly with them, both because he adores the pilots with their splendid machines and because he feels that Lunghua is still a comparatively safer place for him.

Towards the end of the war, with the Japanese army collapsing, the food supply runs short. Jim barely survives, with people around him starving to death. The camp prisoners are forced upon a march to Nantao, with many dying along the route. Jim then leaves the march and is saved from starvation by air drops from American Bombers. Jim returns to Lunghua camp and finds Dr. Ransome there, soon returning to his pre-war residence with his parents.

==Film adaptation==
{{main|Empire of the Sun (film)}}
The book was adapted by [[Tom Stoppard]] in 1987. The screenplay was filmed by [[Steven Spielberg]], to critical acclaim, being nominated for six [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] and winning three [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|British Academy Awards]] (for cinematography, music and sound). It starred a then 13-year-old [[Christian Bale]], as well as [[John Malkovich]] and [[Miranda Richardson]]; it also featured a cameo by the 21 year old [[Ben Stiller]], in a dramatic role.

'''Ebla''' ({{lang-ar| ????}}, modern: '''Tell Mardikh''' ?? ?????, [[Idlib Governorate]], [[Syria]]) was one of the earliest kingdoms in Syria, located about {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Aleppo]] near the village of [[Mardikh]]. It was an important center throughout the [[3rd millennium BC|third millennium BC]] and in the first half of the [[2nd millennium BC|second millennium BC]], its discovery in 1968 proved the [[Levant]] to be an equal center of ancient centralized civilization next to [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]],<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=5IXecSZOcS8C&pg=PA12|title= The Bible and the Ancient Near East: Collected Essays|author= Jimmy Jack McBee Roberts|page= 12|year= 2002}}</ref> and ruled out the view that the former two were the only important centers in the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]] during the early [[Bronze Age]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=LKQ0fZFTeHkC&pg=PA199|title= Mobile Pastoralism and the Formation of Near Eastern Civilizations: Weaving Together Society|author= Anne Porter|page= 199|year= 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=TXoWAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA23|title= Making Europe: The Story of the West, Volume I to 1790|author=Frank Kidner,Maria Bucur,Ralph Mathisen,Sally McKee,Theodore Weeks|page= 23|year= 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=5H4fAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT309|title= The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of the Levant: C. 8000&ndash;332 BCE|author=Margreet L.

Starting as a small settlement in the early Bronze Age (c. 3500 BC), it developed into a trading empire and later turned into an expansionist power that imposed its hegemony over much of northern and eastern Syria. Its language the [[Eblaite language|Eblaite]], is now considered the earliest attested [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]] after [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]].<ref name="bryce3">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=E1aF0hq1GR8C&pg=PA210|title= The Routledge Handbook of the Peoples and Places of Ancient Western Asia: The Near East from the Early Bronze Age to the Fall of the Persian Empire|author=Trevor Bryce|page= 210}}</ref> The site is most famous for the [[Ebla tablets]], an archive of about 20,000 [[cuneiform]] tablets found there,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=FwVMsCH1VosC&q|title= Forgotten scripts: their ongoing discovery and decipherment|author=Cyrus Herzl Gordon|page= 155|year=1987}}</ref> dated to around 2350 BC.{{efn|All dates in the article are estimated by the [[Middle Chronology]].}} Written in both [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and Eblaite and using the [[Cuneiform|Sumerian Cuneiform]], the archive has allowed a better understanding of the Sumerian language.

Ebla was destroyed during the 23rd century BC; it was then rebuilt and was attested in the records of the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]]. The second Ebla was a continuation of the first, ruled by a new royal dynasty. It was destroyed at the end of the third millennium BC, which paved the way for the [[Amorite]] tribes to settle in the city and form the third Ebla. The third kingdom flourished again as a trade center; it became a subject and an ally to [[Yamhad]] (modern [[Aleppo]]) until its final destruction by the [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[Mursili I]] in c. 1600 BC.

Ebla maintained its prosperity through a vast trading network. Artifacts from [[Sumer]], [[Cyprus]], [[Egypt]] and as far as [[Afghanistan]] were recovered from the palaces of the city. The political organization of Ebla had unique features different from the Sumerian model. Women enjoyed a special status and the queen had major influence in the state and religious affairs. The pantheon of gods was mainly north Semitic and included deities exclusive to Ebla.

During the first kingdom period between about 3000 and 2300 BC, Ebla was the most prominent kingdom amongst the Syrian states, especially during the second half of the 3rd millennium BC, which is known as the age of the archives after the Ebla tablets.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=AaZg0ypYrnQC&pg=PA37|title= Ebla and its Landscape: Early State Formation in the Ancient Near East|author=Paolo Matthiae,Nicoló Marchetti|page= 37}}</ref>

====Early period====
The early period between 3000 and 2400 BC is designated '''Mardikh IIA'''. The first part of this period is identified with buildings located on the southern slopes of the acropolis in an area designated as '''CC''', the most important of which was building '''G2'''.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=9bbgJzacoJYC&pg=PA246|title= 6 ICAANE|author= Paolo Matthiae,Licia Romano|year=2010|page= 246 + 247}}</ref> The dates of the earliest kings have been estimated from king lists, and they suggest that the first royal dynasty started at the same period that '''G2''' was built. This was apparently a royal palace built c. 2700 BC.<ref name="Hamblin" /><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=J9eZToFfVJ0C&pg=PA66|title= 4 ICAANE|author=Hartmut Kühne,Rainer Maria Czichon,Florian Janoscha Kreppner|page= 66}}</ref> A sequence of 21 Kings ruling in this period has been constructed.

====Archive period====
[[File:EblaSogPalast.jpg|thumb|280px|Royal palace '''G'''.]]
The archive period, which is designated '''Mardikh IIB1''', lasted from c. 2400 BC until c. 2300 BC. The end of the period is known as the "first destruction", mainly of the palace (called palace '''G''' and built over the earlier '''G2''') and much of the acropolis.<ref name="bryce3" /><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=AaZg0ypYrnQC&pg=PA239|title= Ebla and its Landscape: Early State Formation in the Ancient Near East|author=Paolo Matthiae,Nicoló Marchetti|page= 239}}</ref> In the archive period Ebla had political and military dominance over the other Syrian city-states of northern and eastern Syria, which are mentioned in the tablets.<ref name="Bryce">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=q8Z7AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA15|title= Ancient Syria: A Three Thousand Year History|author=Trevor Bryce|page= 15}}</ref> Most of the tablets, which date from that period, are about economic matters, but they also include royal letters and diplomatic documents.<ref name="Bryce" /> 

In the middle of the 25th century BC, [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] was defeated by Ebla, perhaps by King [[Kun-Damu]], whose reign over Ebla can be dated to this period.{{efn|It is suggested that he was a contemporary of king Ishtup-Ishtar of Mari (who is also mentioned in the tablets).}}<ref name="4ican">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=J9eZToFfVJ0C&pg=PA68|title= 4 ICAANE|author=Hartmut Kühne, Rainer Maria Czichon, Florian Janoscha Kreppner|page= 68}}</ref> The power of Ebla then declined,{{efn|The political weakness started during the short reign of Adub-Damu.}} and during the reign of King [[Igrish-Halam]] in the mid-24th century it paid tribute to Mari.<ref name="4ican" /> Ebla recovered under King [[Irkab-Damu]] in about 2340 BC; becoming prosperous and launching a successful counteroffensive against Mari.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=_ez3ih5JgzUC&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Brotherhood of Kings: How International Relations Shaped the Ancient Near East|author=Amanda H.

The king's chief official was called the vizier, the holder of this office started to acquire substantial authority during the reign of Irkab-Damu. Important viziers included [[Darmiya (Vizier)|Darmiya]] and [[Arrukum]] (Ar-Ennum), but the most powerful was [[Ibrium]], who campaigned against the city of [[Abarsal]] (probably located along the Euphrates river east of Ebla) during the term of his predecessor Arrukum.<ref name="mario" /><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=8l9X_3rHFdEC&pg=PA462|title= Art of the First Cities: The Third Millennium B.C|author= Joan Aruz,Ronald Wallenfels|page= 462|year= 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=46SmAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT132|title= The Development of Pre-State Communities in the Ancient Near East: Studies in Honour of Edgar Peltenburg|author= Diane Bolger, Louise C.

Ibbi-Sipish conducted a military campaign in his third year against a city called Bagara, and also launched several attacks on Armi, in one of which he received linen textiles.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=9bbgJzacoJYC&pg=PA485|title= 6 ICAANE|author=  Paolo Matthiae,Licia Romano|year=2010|page= 485}}</ref><ref name="ica6">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=9bbgJzacoJYC&pg=PA486|title= 6 ICAANE|author=  Paolo Matthiae,Licia Romano|year=2010|page= 486}}</ref> He also campaigned against the city of [[Ibal]] in the south (close to [[Qatna]]), and made an alliance with [[Tell Brak|Nagar]] and [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] to defeat Mari in a battle near [[Terqa]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=_EtJAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT208|title= The Ancient Near East: History, Society and Economy|author= Mario Liverani|page= 208}}</ref> The alliance then attacked Armi and occupied it, leaving Ibbi-Sipish's son Enzi-Malik as governor.

====First destruction of Ebla====
The first destruction occurred during the 23rd century BC. Palace '''G''' was burned, baking the clay tablets of the royal archives, and thus preserving the Ebla tablets. Many theories have been suggested for the cause, the date and the perpetrator:<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=vtiZFkkq6NkC&pg=PA62|title= The Ancient Near Eastern World |author=Amanda H Podany, Marni McGee|page= 62|year= 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?ei=RF-OU632LcXJPNf3gbgE&hl=nl&id=DsNtAAAAMAAJ&dq|title= The archives of Ebla: an empire inscribed in clay|author=Giovanni Pettinato|page= 40|year= 1981}}</ref>

* '''High (early) dating hypothesis''': [[Giovanni Pettinato]] supports an early dating for Ebla which would put the destruction at around 2500 BC.{{efn|At first Pettinato supported the Sargon theory before proposing the High dating.}} Pettinato, while preferring the date of 2500 BC later accepted that the event could have happened in 2400 BC,{{efn|[[Michael Astour]] argue that in 2500 BC, Mari was ruled by [[Isqi-Mari]], a contemporary of [[Ur-Nanshe]] of [[Lagash]] and it is known that Ebla was destroyed during the time of the Mariote king [[Hidar]] whose reign was separated from Isqi-Mari reign by at least 7 other monarchs making the 2500 BC date unlikely.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=0Rwals-oh6kC&pg=PA63#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Eblaitica: Essays on the Ebla Archives and Eblaite Language, Volume 4|author= Cyrus Herzl Gordon,Gary Rendsburg,Nathan H.

The third kingdom is designated '''Mardikh III''', and is divided into periods '''A''' (c. 2000–1800 BC) and '''B''' (c. 1800–1600 BC). In period '''A''' the kingdom was settled by the [[Amorite]]s and Ebla was quickly rebuilt as a planned city. The foundations covered what remained of Mardikh II; new fortifications were built in two circles, one for the low city and one for the acropolis, in addition to new palaces and temples in the lower city.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=X2eomg9Y14EC&pg=PA75|title= Ancient Near Eastern Art in Context|author= Jack Cheng,Marian H.

Ebla never recovered from its third destruction.

Society was less centered around the palace and the temple than in Mesopotamian kingdoms. The Eblaite palace was designed around the courtyard, which was open toward the city, thus making the administration approachable.

==Economy==
During the first kingdom period, the palace controlled the economy,<ref name="mario" /> but wealthy families managed their financial affairs without government intervention.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?ei=qoI9U-j3KqeW0QXl1oCoCA&hl=nl&id=K4JtAAAAMAAJ&dq|title= Ebla, a new look at history|author= Giovanni Pettinato|page= 168}}</ref> The system was redistributive, and the palace distributed food to its permanent and seasonal workers. It is estimated that around 40,000 persons contributed to this system, but in general (unlike Mesopotamia) lands stayed in the hands of the villages which paid an annual share to the palace.<ref name="mario6">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=_EtJAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT209|title= The Ancient Near East: History, Society and Economy|author= Mario Liverani|page= 209}}</ref> The agriculture was mainly pastoral; large herds of cattle were managed by the palace,<ref name="mario6" /> and the city's inhabitants owned about 200,000 head of sheep, goats, and cows.

The prosperity of Ebla derived from trade, much of it with Mesopotamia, and the kingdom's wealth was equal to that of the most important Sumerian cities. Finds in the palaces include a small sculpture made out of precious materials, such as black stones and gold.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=_EtJAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT217|title= The Ancient Near East: History, Society and Economy|author= Mario Liverani|page= 217}}</ref> The kingdom's major commercial rival was [[Mari, Syria|Mari]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=0Rwals-oh6kC&pg=PA58&dq|title=Eblaitica: Essays on the Ebla Archives and Eblaite Language, Volume 4|author= Cyrus Herzl Gordon,Gary Rendsburg,Nathan H.

Ebla continued to be a trading state during the third kingdom.

==Religion==

The first genre included the eastern semitic chief god [[Dagon|Dagan]]<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=D3JiAAAAMAAJ&q|title= The Asia Minor Connexion: Studies on the Pre-Greek Languages in Memory of Charles Carter|author= Yoël L.

The second genre included the Hurrian goddess [[Ishara]], who was the goddess of the royal family.<ref name="eblai55" /> [[Ishtar]] was also worshiped, but Ishara was far more important, appearing 40 times in one of the monthly offering lists, while Ishtar was mentioned only five times.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=5a8-NudlBx8C&pg=PA27|title= Recent Developments in Hittite Archaeology and History|author= Hans Gustav Güterbock,K.

The third genre included many gods such as the artisan god [[Chemosh|Kamish/Tit]], [[Kothar-wa-Khasis]], and the planet [[Venus]] represented by [[Shahar (god)|Shahar]] as the morning star and [[Shalim]] as the evening star. Eblaites also practiced the deification of dead kings.<ref name="eblai8" /> The four city gates were named after the gods Dagan, Hadda, Rasap and Utu, but which gate had which name is unknown.<ref name="Feliu">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=IN9_IRYKKUMC&pg=PA8|title= The God Dagan in Bronze Age Syria|author= Lluís Feliu|page= 8|year= 2003}}</ref> Overall, about forty deities are mentioned in the offering lists as receiving sacrifices.<ref name="sarah" />

===Biblical connection theories===
At the beginning of the tablets deciphering process, Pettinato made claims about a possible connections between Ebla and the [[Bible]]. However, much of the initial media excitement about a supposed Eblaite connections with the Bible, based on preliminary guesses and speculations by Pettinato and others, is now widely deplored as "exceptional and unsubstantiated claims" and "great amounts of disinformation that leaked to the public".<ref name="Chavalas">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=60fmNZQzwjYC&dq|title= Mesopotamia and the Bible|author= Mark W.

====Yahweh====
Among Pettinato's controversial claims, he suggested that there was a change in the [[Theophoric name]]s (names of gods) shown in many of the tablets from '''El''' to '''Yah''' (the change is represented by the [[Cuneiform#Sign inventories|cuneiform]] sign '''[[List of cuneiform signs#TAB .28two A.C5.A0.29|NI]]''' which Pettinato read as '''ya'''){{efn|Cuneiform sign NI is ascribed the unicode codepoint U+1224C, it is number 380 according to the sign numbers (MesZL) of [[Riekele Borger]].}}<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=vO8XRZyhvpMC&pg=PA403|title= The Face of Old Testament Studies: A Survey of Contemporary Approaches|author= David W.

====Hebrew names====
Many [[ancient Hebrew language|ancient Hebraic]] names that have not been found in other Near Eastern languages have been reported to occur in similar forms in Eblaite ([[Adam (Bible)|Adamu]], [[Eve (name)|H'à-wa]], [[Jabal (Bible)|Jabal]], [[Abraham|Abarama]], [[Bilhah]], [[Ishmael|Ishma-el]], [[Israel|Isûra-el]], [[Esau]], [[Michael|Mika-el]], [[Saul]], [[David]]). A large number of Biblical locations (many of them known from other sources) have also been reported to occur in the texts, for example [[Ashtaroth]], [[Sinai]], [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], [[Lachish]], [[Gezer]], [[Tel Dor|Dor]], [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], [[Jaffa|Joppa]], [[Ur]] etc. Giovanni Pettinato has also claimed to find references to [[Sodom and Gomorrah]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=hOXbAAAAMAAJ&q|title= Christian Herald, Volume 100|author=Louis Klopsch, Thomas De Witt Talmage, George Henry Sandison|page= 29|year= 1977 }}</ref>

Contrary to many earlier claims, the present consensus is that "Ebla has no bearing on the [[Minor Prophets]], the historical accuracy of the [[biblical Patriarchs]], Yahweh worship, or Sodom and Gomorra".<ref name = Chavalas/> 

====Creation myth====
Three versions of a text described as an Eblaite [[creation myth|creation]] hymn have been found. They have been translated by Pettinato as ''':'''

:''Lord of heaven and earth:''
:''the earth was not, you created it,''
:''the light of day was not, you created it,''
:''the morning light you had not [yet] made exist.''<ref name = davis/>

These lines seem to have points in common both with known Sumerian creation stories and with the Biblical account. Nevertheless, Alfonso Archi has objected that the original text is unclear to the point of being incomprehensible,<ref name=Arch/> (texts from Ebla are difficult to read in general),<ref name=mannheim/><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=6OJvO2jMCr8C&pg=PA756|title= International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q&ndash;Z|author= Geoffrey W.

==Discovery and library==
{{Details|Ebla tablets}}
[[File:Ebla.jpg|thumb|280px|Part of the excavations, showing palace '''Q'''.]]
In 1964, Italian archaeologists from the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] under the direction of [[Paolo Matthiae]] began excavating at Tell Mardikh. In 1968, they recovered a statue dedicated to the goddess [[Ishtar]] bearing the name of [[Ibbit-Lim]] mentioning him as king of Ebla.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=6OJvO2jMCr8C&pg=PA751|title= Mesopotamia|author= Lorna Oakes|page= 751|year= 2009}}</ref> That identified the city, long known from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] inscriptions.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=XneTstDbcC0C&pg=PA683|title= Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology|author= Barbara Ann Kipfer|page= 683|year= 2000}}</ref> In the next decade the team discovered a palace (palace G) dating c. 2500&nbsp;– 2000 BC. About 2,500 well-preserved  [[Cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] tablets and thousands of fragments were discovered in the ruins.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=UVN2kQEACAAJ&dq|title= The Royal Archives of Ebla|author= Paolo Matthiae|page= |year= 2007}}</ref> About 80% of the tablets are written using the usual Sumerian combination of [[logogram]]s and phonetic signs,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?ei=HyvdU6KkBsP4yQOHr4EQ&hl=nl&id=NfFrAAAAIAAJ&dq|title= Early history of the alphabet: an introduction to West Semitic epigraphy and palaeography|author= Joseph Naveh|page= 28|year= 1982}}</ref> while the others exhibited an innovative, purely phonetic representation using Sumerian cuneiform of a previously unknown Semitic language, which was called ''Eblaite''.<ref name="mur">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=HMgtAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT22|title= The Library: An Illustrated History|author= Stuart A. P. Murray|page= 22}}</ref> Bilingual Sumerian/Eblaite vocabulary lists were found among the tablets, allowing them to be translated.<ref name="Feliu" />

The tablets constitute one of the oldest archives and library ever found and there is also tangible evidence of their arrangement and even classification.<ref name=Wellisch1>Wellisch, Hans H. (1981). Ebla: The World's Oldest Library. ''The Journal of Library History (1974-1987)'', Vol. 16, No. 3 (Summer, 1981), pp. 488-500.</ref> As the larger tablets had originally been stored on shelves, but had fallen onto the floor when the palace was destroyed.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&pg=PA141|title= Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|author= Michael Dumper, Bruce E. Stanley|page= 141|year= 2007}}</ref> The location where tablets were discovered where they had fallen allowed the excavators to reconstruct their original position on the shelves, and it was found that they were originally shelved according to subject.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=CNGcAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq|title= Records and Information Management|author= Patricia C. Franks|page= 2|year= 2013}}</ref> These features were notably absent from earlier Sumerian excavations. Such sophisticated techniques of arrangement of the texts, coupled with their composition, point to the great antiquity of archival and library practices, which may indeed be far older than was assumed to be the case before their discovery.<ref name=Wellisch1/> A sizable part of the tablets contain literary and lexicographic texts, and evidence seems to suggest that the collection also served at least partially as a true library, as opposed to simply a collection of archives intended solely for use by the kings, their ministers, and their bureaucracy.<ref name=Wellisch1/> The tablets show evidence of the early transcription of texts into foreign languages and scripts, classification and cataloging for easier retrieval, and arrangement by size, form, and content.<ref name=Wellisch1/> The Ebla Tablets have thus provided scholars with new insights into the origin of library practices that were in use 4,500 years ago.

Ebla's close link to southern [[Mesopotamia]], where the script had developed, further highlights the links between the [[Sumer]]ians and [[Semitic]] cultures at that time. The tablets provide many important insights into the cultural, economic, and political life in northern [[Mesopotamia]] around the middle of the third millennium BC.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=cOG-fAFvbXcC&pg=PA134|title= Excavating Asian History: Interdisciplinary Studies in Archaeology and History|author=  Norman Yoffee,Bradley L.

'''Lassi''' ({{IPA-hns|l?s-si?|pron}}) is a popular, traditional, [[yogurt]]-based drink from [[Bangladesh]], [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. Lassi is a blend of yogurt, water, [[spices]] and sometimes, fruit. ''Traditional'' lassi (a.k.a., "salted lassi", or simply, "lassi") is a savoury drink, sometimes flavoured with ground and roasted [[cumin]]. ''Sweet'' lassi, however, contains sugar or fruits, instead of spices.

In [[Dharmic religion]]s, yogurt sweetened with honey is used while performing religious rituals. Less common is lassi served with milk and topped with a thin layer of [[clotted cream]]. Lassis are enjoyed chilled as a hot-weather refreshment, mostly taken with lunch. With a little [[turmeric]] powder mixed in, it is also used as a [[folk remedy]] for [[gastroenteritis]].

==Variations==

===Traditional mild sweet (or salty) lassi===
[[File:Lassi shop.jpg|right|thumb|A ''lassi'' shop]]
[[File:Lassi in Varanasi.jpg|right|thumb|Lassi in an earthen tumbler, ''Kullhad'', Varanasi.]]
[[File:Mint lassi.jpg|thumb|Mint sweet lassi in [[Chandigarh]].]]
This form of lassi is more common in the villages of [[Punjab]] and [[north India]].  It is prepared by blending [[yogurt]] with water and adding sugar and other spices to taste.  Salt can be substituted in place of sugar. The resulting beverage is known as salted lassi. This is similar to [[ayran]] or [[doogh]].

===Sweet lassi===
Sweet lassi is a form of lassi flavoured with sugar, [[rosewater]] and/or [[lemon]], [[strawberry]] or other fruit juices. [[Saffron]] lassis, which are particularly rich, are a specialty of [[Sindh]] in Pakistan, and [[Jodhpur]] and [[Rajasthan]] in India. ''Makkhaniya lassi'' is simply lassi with lumps of [[butter]] in it (''makkhan'' is the [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] word for butter). It is usually creamy like a milkshake.

===Mango lassi===
[[Mango]] lassi is gaining popularity worldwide. It is made from yogurt, water and mango pulp. It may be made with or without additional sugar. It is widely available in UK, Malaysia and Singapore, and in many other parts of the world. In various parts of Canada, mango lassi is a cold drink consisting of sweetened [[kesar mango]] pulp mixed with yogurt, cream, or ice cream. It is served in a tall glass with a straw, often with ground pistachio nuts sprinkled on top.<ref>{{cite web|author=Wayne Collins |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/mango_lassi_cocktail_91336 |title=Food - Recipes : Mango lassi cocktail |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-01-08}}</ref>

===Bhang lassi===
Bhang (or bhung) lassi is a special lassi that contains ''[[bhang]]'', a liquid derivative of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], which has effects similar to [[cannabis foods|other eaten forms of cannabis]]. It is legal in many parts of India and mainly sold during [[Holi]], when [[pakora]]s containing bhang are also sometimes eaten. [[Uttar Pradesh]] is known to have licensed bhang shops, and in many places one can buy bhang products and drink bhang lassis.<ref>Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations Collection 2, Episode 5; Final Segment</ref>

==Chaas==
[[Chaas]] or chaach is a salted drink like lassi; however, chaas contains more water than lassi and has the butterfat removed, so its consistency is not as thick as lassi. Salt and [[Jeera]] (cumin seeds) are normally added for taste and sometimes even fresh coriander. Fresh ground ginger & green chillies may also be added as seasoning. Chaas is popular in the Indian states [[Gujarat]] and [[Rajasthan]], where it is drunk with the main meal, and was known to aid digestion<ref name="Chaas popular drink">{{cite news|title=Cool curds|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/cool-curds/article5172685.ece|accessdate=9 February 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=September 27, 2013}}</ref> and is an excellent coolant in the Indian and Pakistani summers .{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} It is called 'majjige' in [[Kannada]], 'taak' in [[Marathi language|Marathi]], 'majjiga' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]], 'moru' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malayalam]], Mahi in [[Madheshi]] languages, and 'ghol' in [[Bengali language|Bengali]].

'''Structural analysis''' is the determination of the effects of [[structural load|load]]s on physical [[structure]]s and their [[Structural engineering#Structural elements|components]]. Structures subject to this type of analysis include all that must withstand loads, such as buildings, bridges, vehicles, machinery, furniture, attire, soil strata, prostheses and biological tissue.  Structural analysis incorporates the fields of [[applied mechanics]], [[materials science]] and [[applied mathematics]] to compute a structure's [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]]s, internal [[force]]s, [[stress analysis|stress]]es, support reactions, accelerations, and [[structural stability|stability]]. The results of the analysis are used to verify a structure's fitness for use, often saving [[physical test]]s. Structural analysis is thus a key part of the [[structural engineering|engineering design of structures]].

==Structures and Loads==
A [[structure]] refers to a body or system of connected parts used to support a load. Important examples related to [[Civil Engineering]] include buildings, bridges, and towers; and in other branches of engineering, ship and aircraft frames, tanks, pressure vessels, mechanical systems, and electrical supporting structures are important. In order to design a structure, one must serve a specified function for public use, the engineer must account for its safety, aesthetics, and serviceability, while taking into consideration economic and environmental constraints. Other branches of [[engineering]] work on a wide variety of [[nonbuilding structure]]s.

===Classification of structures===
A ''structural system'' is the combination of structural elements and their materials.
It is important for a structural engineer to be able to classify a structure by either its form or its function, by recognizing the various [[Structural engineering#Structural elements|elements]] composing that structure. 
The structural elements guiding the systemic forces through the materials are not only such as a connecting rod, a truss, a beam, or a column, but also a cable, an arch, a cavity or channel, and even an angle, a surface structure, or a frame.

===Loads===
{{main|Structural load}}
Once the dimensional requirement for a structure have been defined, it becomes necessary to determine the loads the structure must support. In order to design a structure, it is therefore necessary to first specify the loads that act on it. The design loading for a structure is often specified in [[building codes]]. There are two types of codes: general building codes and design codes, engineer must satisfy all the codes requirements for a reliable structure.

There are two types of loads that structure engineering must encounter in the design. First type of load is called Dead loads that consist of the weights of the various structural members and the weights of any objects that are permanently attached to the structure. For example, columns, beams, girders, the floor slab, roofing, walls, windows, plumbing, electrical fixtures, and other miscellaneous attachments. Second type of load is Live Loads which vary in their magnitude and location. There are many different types of live loads like building loads, highway bridge Loads, railroad bridge Loads, impact loads, wind loads, snow loads, earthquake loads, and other natural loads.

==Analytical methods==
To perform an accurate analysis a structural engineer must determine such information as [[structural load]]s, [[List of structural elements|geometry]], support conditions, and materials properties. The results of such an analysis typically include support reactions, [[Stress (physics)|stresses]] and [[Displacement (vector)|displacements]]. This information is then compared to criteria that indicate the conditions of failure. Advanced structural analysis may examine [[dynamic response]], [[buckling|stability]] and [[non-linear]] behavior.
There are three approaches to the analysis: the [[Strength of materials|mechanics of materials]] approach (also known as strength of materials), the [[3-D elasticity|elasticity theory]] approach (which is actually a special case of the more general field of [[continuum mechanics]]), and the [[finite element]] approach. The first two make use of analytical formulations which apply mostly to simple linear elastic models, lead to closed-form solutions, and can often be solved by hand. The finite element approach is actually a numerical method for solving differential equations generated by theories of mechanics such as elasticity theory and strength of materials. However, the finite-element method depends heavily on the processing power of computers and is more applicable to structures of arbitrary size and complexity.

Regardless of approach, the formulation is based on the same three fundamental relations: [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[Constitutive equation|constitutive]], and [[Compatibility (mechanics)|compatibility]]. The solutions are approximate when any of these relations are only approximately satisfied, or only an approximation of reality.

''Limitations''.
Each method has noteworthy limitations. The method of mechanics of materials is limited to very simple structural elements under relatively simple loading conditions. The structural elements and loading conditions allowed, however, are sufficient to solve many useful engineering problems. The theory of elasticity allows the solution of structural elements of general geometry under general loading conditions, in principle. Analytical solution, however, is limited to relatively simple cases. The solution of elasticity problems also requires the solution of a system of partial differential equations, which is considerably more mathematically demanding than the solution of mechanics of materials problems, which require at most the solution of an ordinary differential equation. The finite element method is perhaps the most restrictive and most useful at the same time. This method itself relies upon other structural theories (such as the other two discussed here) for equations to solve. It does, however, make it generally possible to solve these equations, even with highly complex geometry and loading conditions, with the restriction that there is always some numerical error. Effective and reliable use of this method requires a solid understanding of its limitations.

==Strength of materials methods (classical methods)==
The simplest of the three methods here discussed, the mechanics of materials method is available for simple structural members subject to specific loadings such as axially loaded bars, prismatic [[Beam (structure)|beams]] in a state of [[pure bending]], and circular shafts subject to torsion. The solutions can under certain conditions be superimposed using the [[superposition principle]] to analyze a member undergoing combined loading. Solutions for special cases exist for common structures such as thin-walled pressure vessels.

For the analysis of entire systems, this approach can be used in conjunction with statics, giving rise to the ''method of sections'' and ''method of joints'' for [[truss]] analysis, [[moment distribution method]] for small rigid frames, and ''portal frame'' and ''cantilever method'' for large rigid frames. Except for moment distribution, which came into use in the 1930s, these methods were developed in their current forms in the second half of the nineteenth century. They are still used for small structures and for preliminary design of large structures.

The solutions are based on linear isotropic infinitesimal elasticity and Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. In other words, they contain the assumptions (among others) that the materials in question are elastic, that stress is related linearly to strain, that the material (but not the structure) behaves identically regardless of direction of the applied load, that all [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]]s are small, and that beams are long relative to their depth. As with any simplifying assumption in engineering, the more the model strays from reality, the less useful (and more dangerous) the result.

===Example===
There are 2 commonly used methods to find the truss element forces, namely the Method of Joints and the Method of Sections. Below is an example that is solved using both of these methods. 
The first diagram below is the presented problem for which we need to find the truss element forces. The second diagram is the loading diagram and contains the reaction forces from the joints.
:[[Image:Truss Structure Analysis, Full Figure2.jpg|center|border|750x450px]]
Since there is a pin joint at A, it will have 2 reaction forces. One in the x direction and the other in the y direction. At point B, we have a roller joint and hence we only have 1 reaction force in the y direction. Let us assume these forces to be in their respective positive directions (if they are not in the positive directions like we have assumed, then we will get a negative value for them).
:[[Image:Truss Structure Analysis, FBD2.jpg|center|border|750x450px]]
Since the system is in static equilibrium, the sum of forces in any direction is zero and the sum of moments about any point is zero.
Therefore, the magnitude and direction of the reaction forces can be calculated.

:<math>\sum M_A=0=-10*1+2*R_B \Rightarrow R_B=5</math>
:<math>\sum F_y=0=R_{Ay}+R_B-10 \Rightarrow R_{Ay}=5</math>
:<math>\sum F_x=0=R_{Ax}</math>

====Method of Joints====

This method uses the force balance in the x and y directions at each of the joints in the truss structure. 
:[[Image:Truss Structure Analysis, Method of Joints2.png|border|350x450px]]

At A,
:<math>\sum F_y=0=R_{Ay}+F_{AD}\sin(60)=5+F_{AD}\frac{\sqrt{3} }{2} \Rightarrow F_{AD}=-\frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}</math>
:<math>\sum F_x=0=R_{Ax}+F_{AD}\cos(60)+F_{AB}=0-\frac{10}{\sqrt{3} }\frac{1}{2}+F_{AB} \Rightarrow F_{AB}=\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}</math>
At D,
:<math>\sum F_y=0=-10-F_{AD}\sin(60)-F_{BD}\sin(60)=-10-\left(-\frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}\right)\frac{\sqrt{3} }{2}-F_{BD}\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \Rightarrow F_{BD}=-\frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}</math>
:<math>\sum F_x=0=-F_{AD}\cos(60)+F_{BD}\cos(60)+F_{CD}=-\frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{10}{\sqrt{3} }\frac{1}{2}+F_{CD} \Rightarrow F_{CD}=0</math>
At C,
:<math>\sum F_y=0=-F_{BC} \Rightarrow F_{BC}=0</math>

Although we have found the forces in each of the truss elements, it is a good practice to verify the results by completing the remaining force balances.
:<math>\sum F_x=-F_{CD}=-0=0 \Rightarrow verified</math>
At B,
:<math>\sum F_y=R_B+F_{BD}\sin(60)+F_{BC}=5+\left(-\frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}\right)\frac{\sqrt{3} }{2}+0=0 \Rightarrow verified</math>
:<math>\sum F_x=-F_{AB}-F_{BD}\cos(60)=\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}-\frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}\frac{1}{2}=0 \Rightarrow verified</math>

====Method of Sections====

This method can be used when the truss element forces of only a few members wants to be known. This method is used by introducing a single straight line cutting through the member whose force wants to be calculated. However this method has a limit in that the cutting line can pass through a maximum of only 3 members of the truss structure. This restriction is because this method uses the force balances in the x and y direction and the moment balance, which gives us a maximum of 3 equations to find a maximum of 3 unknown truss element forces through which this cut is made.
Let us try to find the forces FAB, FBD and FCD in the above example

=====Method 1: Ignore the right side=====
:[[Image:Truss Structure Analysis, Method of Sections Left2.jpg|border|550x450px]]
:<math>\sum M_D=0=-5*1+\sqrt{3}*F_{AB} \Rightarrow F_{AB}=\frac{5}{\sqrt{3} }</math>
:<math>\sum F_y=0=R_{Ay}-F_{BD}\sin(60)-10=5-F_{BD}\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}-10 \Rightarrow F_{BD}=-\frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}</math>
:<math>\sum F_x=0=F_{AB}+F_{BD}\cos(60)+F_{CD}=\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}-\frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}\frac{1}{2}+F_{CD} \Rightarrow F_{CD}=0</math>

=====Method 2: Ignore the left side=====

:[[Image:Truss Structure Analysis, Method of Sections Right2.jpg|border|600x450px]]
:<math>\sum M_B=0=\sqrt{3}*F_{CD} \Rightarrow F_{CD}=0</math>
:<math>\sum F_y=0=F_{BD}\sin(60)+R_B=F_{BD}\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+5 \Rightarrow F_{BD}=-\frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}</math>
:<math>\sum F_x=0=-F_{AB}-F_{BD}\cos(60)-F_{CD}=-F_{AB}-\left(-\frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}\right)\frac{1}{2}-0 \Rightarrow F_{AB}=\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}</math>

The truss elements forces in the remaining members can be found by using the above method with a section passing through the remaining members.

==Elasticity methods==
Elasticity methods are available generally for an elastic solid of any shape. Individual members such as beams, columns, shafts, plates and shells may be modeled. The solutions are derived from the equations of [[linear elasticity]]. The equations of elasticity are a system of 15 partial differential equations. Due to the nature of the mathematics involved, analytical solutions may only be produced for relatively simple geometries. For complex geometries, a numerical solution method such as the finite element method is necessary.

==Methods using numerical approximation==
It is common practice to use approximate solutions of differential equations as the basis for structural analysis. This is usually done using numerical approximation techniques. The most commonly used numerical approximation in structural analysis is the [[Finite Element Method]].

The finite element method approximates a structure as an assembly of elements or components with various forms of connection between them. Thus, a continuous system such as a plate or shell is modeled as a discrete system with a finite number of elements interconnected at finite number of nodes. The behaviour of individual elements is characterised by the element's stiffness or flexibility relation, which altogether leads to the system's stiffness or flexibility relation. To establish the element's stiffness or flexibility relation, we can use the ''mechanics of materials'' approach for simple one-dimensional bar elements, and the ''elasticity approach'' for more complex two- and three-dimensional elements. The analytical and computational development are best effected throughout by means of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix algebra]], solving [[partial differential equation]]s.

Early applications of matrix methods were for articulated frameworks with truss, beam and column elements; later and more advanced matrix methods, referred to as "[[finite element method in structural mechanics|finite element analysis]]," model an entire structure with one-, two-, and three-dimensional elements and can be used for articulated systems together with continuous systems such as a [[pressure vessel]], plates, shells, and three-dimensional solids. Commercial computer software for structural analysis typically uses matrix finite-element analysis, which can be further classified into two main approaches: the displacement or [[stiffness method]] and the force or [[flexibility method]]. The stiffness method is the most popular by far thanks to its ease of implementation as well as of formulation for advanced applications. The finite-element technology is now sophisticated enough to handle just about any system as long as sufficient computing power is available. Its applicability includes, but is not limited to, linear and non-linear analysis, solid and fluid interactions, materials that are isotropic, orthotropic, or anisotropic, and external effects that are static, dynamic, and environmental factors. This, however, does not imply that the computed solution will automatically be reliable because much depends on the model and the reliability of the data input.

'''''Return of the Living Dead''''' is a [[zombie film]] series of five films beginning with the 1985 film ''[[The Return of the Living Dead]]''.<ref name="PM">{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/159439-legacy-of-the-living-dead/|author=J.C. Maçek III|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=The Zombification Family Tree: Legacy of the Living Dead|date=2012-06-15}}</ref>

== History ==
The series came about as a dispute between [[John A. Russo]] and [[George A. Romero]] over how to handle sequels to their 1968 film, ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''. The two reached a settlement wherein Romero's sequels would be referred to as the ''Dead'' movies, and Russo's sequels would bear the suffix ''Living Dead''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Thus, each man was able to do what he pleased with the series, while still having one another's work distinct and be considered [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. Following this decision, Russo wrote a horror novel, ''[[Return of the Living Dead (novel)]]'', which he planned on adapting into a film script. Although the film rights were initially sold in 1979, they were passed along by several different studios and directors before finally being obtained by [[Tobe Hooper]], for whom Russo wrote a script. Hooper dropped out of the project, though, and the script never came to fruition.

Following Hooper's departure from the project, Russo, along with his new partner, [[Dan O'Bannon]], wrote a new script (with Russo adapting it into an accompanying novel), also titled ''The Return of the Living Dead''. This project alleviated confusion amongst fans of Romero's work by including a scene in which a character acknowledges the George Romero films and explains that while they are based on true events, the events of the ''Return'' series are the "true story". In addition to this separation of the storylines, the films in the ''Return'' series are markedly more comedic than Romero's films, with [[slapstick]] humor.

Although Russo and O'Bannon were only directly involved with the first film in the series, the rest of the films, to varying degrees, stick to their outline and "rules" established in the first film.

The fourth and fifth films in the series were filmed simultaneously near the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant|Chernobyl nuclear power plant station]] in [[Ukraine]]. Despite being intended for a theatrical release,{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} edited versions of both films made their debut on the [[Syfy|SciFi Channel]] on October 15, 2005 and were later released on DVD.

A documentary about ''The Return of the Living Dead'', ''The Return of the Living Dead Part II'' and ''The Return of the Living Dead 3''  titled ''More Brains! A Return to the Living Dead Retrospective'' was released on October 18, 2011.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=== ''The Return of the Living Dead'' (1985) ===
{{main|The Return of the Living Dead}}

Medical supply warehouse foreman Frank ([[James Karen]]) informs his new protege, Freddy ([[Thom Matthews]]) that ''Night of the Living Dead'' was a true story, based on events that occurred when a gas (2-4-5 Trioxin) was released into the morgue in the basement of a VA hospital. The warehouse was the inadvertent recipient of several canisters, one of them containing a corpse – nicknamed "Tarman" ([[Allan Trautman]]) due to his rotten appearance soaked in thick black tar – sealed inside. Due to the canister's less than stellar durability, a light tap causes it to burst open, releasing Trioxin. The gas leaks out of control, which poisons Frank and Freddy and releases "Tarman" from his imprisonment within the tank but the zombie is not actually seen until later on in the movie. Frank and Freddy awaken to discover that various body parts (and bodies) in the warehouse are now alive, as well as the cadaver locked in the freezer and even a split dissected dog. Unaware that they are slowly turning into zombies due to the effects of the gas, Frank and Freddy enlist the help of the warehouse owner, Burt ([[Clu Gulager]]), and his mortician friend, Ernie ([[Don Calfa]]), to cremate the cadaver's  body parts. They had tried to chop it up to kill it. Unfortunately, the resulting smoke carries the evaporated trioxin with it, which then mixes with an overhead raincloud.  It rains on a nearby cemetery, resulting in the reanimation of the buried corpses.

The zombies differ in this movie, in that they are as fast, strong and intelligent as they were in their previous lives, and can form words even when they are merely very degraded bodies. Instead of hunting humans for their flesh, they hunt for the humans' brains, stating that brains can ease the pain of their decomposition. It appears that injuries to their brains do not have any effect, and the only way to fully destroy them is to cremate their bodies, although the ensuing smoke also spreads the contagious gas. It also seems that their bites are not contagious, as Suicide, who was killed by Tarman never reanimated, while Trash, killed by several zombies in the graveyard later did reanimate (probably due to the contaminated rain falling on her corpse).

=== ''Return of the Living Dead Part II'' (1988) ===
{{main|Return of the Living Dead Part II}}

The second film was written and directed by Ken Wiederhorn. The plot follows seven people as they attempt to escape their town after a mass of undead are awoken due to a barrel full of Trioxin gas that was left over from the first film. In this film it is revealed that powerful [[electric discharge]]s are the only secure way of destroying the zombies without the risk of reanimating more corpses (it seems the electric energy annihilates completely the reanimative effect of the trioxin).

The film was released on January 15, 1988, and made $9m at the box office in the USA.

=== ''Return of the Living Dead 3'' (1993) ===
{{Main|Return of the Living Dead 3}}

The third film was produced and directed by [[Brian Yuzna]], noted for making the ''[[Re-Animator]]'' series. This film switches gears from the first two films' comedy/horror formula, instead being a romantic drama/teen romance/horror film. The story involves Curt, whose father, a Colonel in the US Army, is overseeing experiments being performed with Trioxin. After Curt's girlfriend, Julie, is killed in a motorcycle accident, he exposes her corpse to the gas, bringing her back to life as a zombie. Throughout the film, Julie, now one of the living dead, grows hungrier and hungrier for human brains.  She discovers, though, that by causing herself pain via a series of more and more extreme body piercings with springs, nails, glass, basically whatever sharp objects she can find, that she can stave off, although only temporarily, the ghastly hunger growing within her.  The two begin a cross-country trek to escape the US Army that ends in the city sewers when Curt, after witnessing Julie kill and eat Riverman, a friendly homeless man who gives them shelter, steps aside to let his father finally put Julie down. The film ends with Curt rescuing Julie from a fate worse than living death as a biomechanical killer for the military. In the end, after himself being bitten by a zombie, Curt and Julie step into an incinerator and embrace in a final kiss as the flames engulf them.

This film is currently available in its uncut form on the UK Region 2 DVD.

The film received a limited theatrical release on October 29, 1993, where it was a financial failure, making back only $54,000 of its $2,000,000 budget at the boxoffice in the USA.

=== ''Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis'' (2005) ===
{{main|Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis}}

''Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis'', the fourth film in the series, was filmed in [[Romania]] and [[Ukraine]]. The film stars [[Peter Coyote]] and Aimee Lynn Chadwick. The plot revolves around a group of teenagers attempting to rescue their friend from an [[evil corporation]]. In doing so, they wind up releasing a horde of blood-thirsty zombies. An edited version of the film aired on the [[Syfy|SciFi Channel]] on October 15, 2005. The R-rated version of the film was released on DVD on April 18, 2006. The film was originally advertised as ''Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis'' but once it was finally released, the number 4 was removed from the title. Both ''Necropolis'' (4) and ''Rave'' (5) are criticized for straying from the series' rules.

Most notable of these changes is that Trioxin zombies are no longer the indestructible juggernauts of the first movie, but instead much weaker than even "[[Romero zombies]]."  Several times throughout the movie they are seen to be dispatched with no more than a few body shots, sometimes as few as two hits will end their undead life.  Prior to this film nothing short of incineration or electrocution with extreme high voltage would terminate a Trioxin zombie.

However, this may be a different form of Trioxin; here, it is referred to as "Trioxin 5," which may explain why the zombies are weaker.

=== ''Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave'' (2005) ===
{{main|Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave}}

''Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave'' was filmed immediately after ''Necropolis'' using the same locations of [[Romania]] and [[Ukraine]]. [[Cory Hardrict]], 
[[John Keefe (actor)|John Keefe]], [[Peter Coyote]] and Aimee Lynn Chadwick return from the previous installment. The film takes place one year after ''Necropolis'' and the returning teenage characters, from the previous film, are now college freshmen. They discover that Trioxin can be used as a recreational drug named 'Z', but the drug will eventually turn the user into a zombie. The speed of "zombification" depends on the dose of Trioxin consumed. An edited version of the film aired along with ''Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis'' on the [[Syfy|SciFi Channel]] on October 15, 2005. As was the case with ''Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis'' switching to ''Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis'', ''Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave'' was advertised as ''Return of the Living Dead 5: Rave To the Grave'' before removing the number 5 from the title. The R-rated version of the film was released on DVD on March 20, 2007 by Lions Gate.

The film also features a comical cameo appearance by Tarman from the [[The Return of the Living Dead|original movie]] and its [[Return of the Living Dead Part II|first sequel]]. However, as opposed to being a major threat like he initially was, the character is mostly used for comic relief. Though when he first appears in the film, he tries to attack the protagonists but later gives up and desperately tries to hitchhike a ride to the party. After scaring away a woman who almost gave him a ride, he gets annoyed and decides to walk to the party, yelling his trademark "Brains!" as he goes.

Between 1997 and April 2002, they operated under two brand names '''Dialog''' (for monthly subscription plans, in Romanian means "dialogue") and '''Alo''' (for prepay services). In April 2002, after [[Orange S.A.|France Télécom]] gained a majority stake it was re-branded to comply with the group's global strategy. As of December 2012, Orange Romania has 10.3 million mobile subscribers.<ref name="Financial"/>

Orange is in head-to-head competition with [[Vodafone Romania]] for one of the most dynamic mobile telephony markets in south eastern Europe. Currently the mobile penetration is at about 115% (active users only).<ref>[http://www.anrcti.ro/desktopdefault.aspx?tabid=4648]</ref> Orange edged ahead of Vodafone (formerly Connex) in terms of number of subscribers in September 2004. They are the main mobile telephony operators, with Orange having a market share of almost 38% of the total market (active and inactive users).

Orange România also controls 4% of the Moldovan operator [[Orange Moldova]].

'''''Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them''''' is a [[satire|satirical]] book on American politics by comedian, political commentator and now [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Senator]] from [[Minnesota]] [[Al Franken]], published in 2003 by [[Dutton Penguin]]. Franken had a study group of 14 [[Harvard]] graduate students known as "TeamFranken" to help him with the research.<ref>''Chapter and verse on the need for regime change'' by Mark Hertsgaard for the LA Times [http://www.markhertsgaard.com/articles/144]</ref> The book's subtitle, "''A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right''," is a [[parody]] of [[Fox News]]' tagline "[[Fair and Balanced]]." Fox sued Franken over the use of the phrase in a [[Fox v. Franken|short-lived lawsuit]], which has been credited with [[Streisand effect|increasing the sales of the book]].

''Lies'' is one of several books published in 2003 written by American [[liberalism|liberals]] challenging the viewpoints of [[conservatism|conservatives]] such as [[Bernard Goldberg]], [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], [[Sean Hannity]] and [[Ann Coulter]]. These books by Franken and fellow authors such as [[Joe Conason]], [[Michael Moore]] and [[Jim Hightower]] were described by columnist [[Molly Ivins]] as the "great liberal backlash of 2003."<ref>{{cite news

==Summary==
''Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them'' largely targets prominent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[conservative]]s, highlighting what Franken asserts are documentable lies in their claims. A significant portion of the book is devoted to comparisons between [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] and former president [[Bill Clinton]] regarding their [[economics|economic]], [[natural environment|environment]]al, and [[military]] policies. Franken also criticizes several [[Pundit (expert)|pundits]], especially those he believes to be the most dishonest, including O'Reilly, Hannity, and Coulter.

==Publicity==
{{see also|Fox v. Franken}}
[[Fox News]] sought damages from Franken, claiming in its lawsuit that the book's subtitle violated its trademark of the slogan "[[Fair and balanced (marketing slogan)|Fair and Balanced]]". The lawsuit was dismissed, and the attempt backfired on Fox News in that it provided Franken with free publicity just as the book was launched. "The book was originally scheduled to be released Sept. 22 but will be made available Aug. 21," according to its publisher. "We sped up the release because of tremendous demand for the book, generated by recent events."

In the lawsuit, Fox described Franken as "intoxicated or deranged" as well as "shrill and unstable." In response, Franken joked that he had trademarked the word "funny", and that Fox had infringed his [[intellectual property rights]] by characterizing him as "unfunny." The publicity resulting from the lawsuit propelled Franken's yet-to-be-released book to #1 on [[Amazon.com]].<ref>http://www.bookreporter.com/reviews/0452285216.asp</ref>

On August 22, 2003, U.S. District Judge [[Denny Chin]] denied Fox's request for an injunction to block the publication of Franken's book, characterizing the network's claim as "wholly without merit, both factually and legally."  During the judge's questioning, spectators in the court's gallery frequently laughed at Fox's case.<ref name="nytfox">{{cite web| last = Saulny| first = Susan| title = In Courtroom, Laughter at Fox and a Victory for Al Franken| publisher = New York Times| date = 2003-08-23| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/23/nyregion/23FRAN.html?ex=1376971200&en=221c949c94e93f90&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND| accessdate = 2007-03-15 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Franken later joked, "Usually when you say someone was literally laughed out of court, you mean they were figuratively laughed out of court, but Fox was literally laughed out of court."<ref name="stanfordprogressive">{{cite web| last = Corman| first = Mary| title = Franken Speaks Frankly| work = interview| publisher = Stanford Progressive| date = 2003-08-23| url = http://progressive.stanford.edu/2003.11_franken.html| accessdate = 2007-03-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070109235717/http://progressive.stanford.edu/2003.11_franken.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-01-09}}</ref> Three days later, Fox filed to dismiss its lawsuit.

Franken describes the legal battle in a [[paperback]]-only chapter of ''Lies'' entitled "I Win".

==Book critiques==

===Difficulty posed by use of satire and nonfiction===
In a largely favorable review of Franken's book in the Washington newspaper ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', reviewer Mary Lynn F. Jones wrote: "Franken's tendency to mix fact with fiction [also] left me wondering sometimes what was true and what wasn't."<ref name="joneshill">{{cite web | last =Jones| first =Mary Lynn F.| title =Franken's humor overpowered by cynical Look at the Right| publisher =The Hill| date =2003-09-09| url =http://thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/Features/BookReview/090903.html| accessdate = 2007-03-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070107221953/http://thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/Features/BookReview/090903.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-01-07}}</ref> As an example, she cited a passage in Franken's book in which he wrote that former [[George W. Bush administration|Bush]] foreign policy advisor [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]] "bolted" from a [[United States Senate|Senate]] hearing and "[knocked] over veteran reporter [[Helen Thomas]], breaking her hip and jaw".<ref>Franken, page 218</ref> The [[paperback]] version has a footnote saying, "The Helen Thomas thing is a joke."<ref>Franken, page 227 of the paperback</ref>

'''Ethics in the Bible''' are the ideas concerning right and wrong actions that exist in scripture in the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew]] and [[Bible#Christian_Bibles|Christian Bibles]]. Biblical accounts contain numerous prescriptions or [[Biblical law|laws]] that people use as guides to action.

==Hebrew Bible/Old Testament==
{{main|613 Mitzvot}}
{{see also|Eye for an eye}}
Prescriptive utterances ([[613 Mitzvot|commandments]]) are found throughout the Hebrew Bible and Old Testament, some related to inter-human relationships (the prohibition against murder) while others focus on issues of worship and ritual (e.g. the [[Day of Atonement]] festival). Rabbinic tradition classically schematizes these prescriptions into [[613 mitzvot]], beginning with "Be fruitful and multiply" (God's command to all life) and continuing on to the [[Seven Laws of Noah|seven laws of Noah]] (addressed to all humanity) and the several hundred laws which apply specifically to the [[Israelites]] (such as the ''[[kashrut]]'' dietary laws). Rabbinic tradition also records the aforementioned distinction between commandments that relate to man's interaction with fellow man (??? ??? ??????) and those that affect his relationship with God (??? ??? ?????).{{cn|date=March 2013}} Many commandments are remarkable in their blending of the two roles. For example, observance of ''[[Shabbat]]'' is couched in terms of recognizing God's sovereignty and creation of the world, while also being presented as a social-justice measure to prevent overworking one's employees, slaves, and animals. As a result, the Bible consistently binds worship of the Divine to ethical actions and ethical actions with worship of the Divine.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

Several Biblical prescriptions may not correspond to modern notions of justice in relation to concepts such as [[slavery]] (Lev. 25:44-46), intolerance of [[religious pluralism]] (Deut. 5:7, Deut. 7:2-5, 2 Corinthians 6:14) or of [[freedom of religion]] (Deut. 13:6-12), [[discrimination]] and [[racism]] (Lev. 21:17-23, Deut. 23:1-3), treatment of [[women in the Bible|women]], [[honor killing]] (Ex. 21:17, Leviticus 20:9, Ex. 32:27-29), [[genocide]] (Num. 31:15-18, 1 Sam. 15:3), [[religious war]]s, and [[capital punishment]] for sexual behavior like [[adultery]] and [[the Bible and homosexuality|sodomy]] and for [[Sabbath breaking]] (Num. 15:32-36).

The [[Book of Proverbs]] recommends disciplining a child: 
{{quote|text=  Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.|sign=Proverbs 22:15}}

==New Testament==
{{see also|Biblical law in Christianity|Christian ethics|Paul the Apostle and Judaism}}
[[Image:Vincent Willem van Gogh 022.jpg|thumb|The Good Samaritan]]
The main dispute of the [[Council of Jerusalem]], whether non-Jewish converts should be considered bound to the Old Testament laws, are addressed elsewhere in the New Testament, e.g. regarding [[dietary laws]]
{{quote|"Don't you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can't defile him, because it doesn't go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus making all foods clean?"-{{bibleref2|Mark|7:18}}. (See also [[Mark 7]])}}

or regarding [[divorce]]
{{quote|"I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery."-{{bibleref2|Matthew|5:31}}. (See also [[Mark 5]])}}

The central teachings of [[Jesus]] are presented in the [[Sermon on the Mount]],<ref>The Sermon on the mount: a theological investigation by Carl G. Vaught 2001 ISBN 978-0-918954-76-3 pages xi–xiv</ref> notably the "[[Ethic of reciprocity#Christianity|golden rule]]" and the prescription to [[Matthew 5:44|"love your enemies"]] and "[[turn the other cheek]]".
:"You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you."-{{bibleref2|Matthew| 5:43-44}}

Elsewhere in the New Testament (for example, the "Farewell Discourses" of John 14 through 16) Jesus elaborates on what has become known the commandment of love{{according to whom?|date=October 2014}}, repeated and elaborated upon in the epistles of Paul ([[1 Corinthians 13]] etc.), see also [[The Law of Christ]] and [[The New Commandment]].

==Theological issues==
===Euthyphro Dilemma===
{{main|Euthyphro Dilemma|Divine command theory}}
A central problem in religiously motivated ethics is the apparent [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] inherent in the concept that what is commanded by God is morally right. This line of reasoning is introduced most famously in [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Euthyphro]]'', which asks whether something is right because the gods love it, or whether the gods love it because it is right.

===Moral relativism===
{{main|Antinomianism|Biblical law in Christianity}}
{{see also|Argument from inconsistent revelations}}
The predominant Christian view{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} is that Jesus mediates a [[New Covenant]] relationship between God and his followers and [[Supersessionism|abolished some Mosaic Laws]], according to the New Testament ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|10:15-18}}; {{bibleverse||Gal|3:23-25}}; {{bibleverse|2|Cor|3:7-17}}; {{bibleverse||Eph|2:15}}; {{bibleverse||Heb|8:13}}, {{bibleverse||Rom|7:6}} etc.). From a Jewish perspective however, the Torah was given to the Jewish people as an eternal covenant ({{bibleverse||Exo|31:16-17}}, {{bibleverse||Exo|12:14-17}}, {{bibleverse||Mal|3:6-7}}) and will never be replaced or added to ({{bibleverse||Deut|4:2}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Deut|13:1|HE}}). There are differences of opinion as to how the new covenant affects the validity of biblical law. The differences are mainly as a result of [[Internal consistency of the Bible|attempts to harmonize biblical statements]] to the effect that the biblical law is eternal ({{bibleverse||Exodus|31:16-17}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exo|12:14-17}}) with New Testament statements that suggest that it [[Antinomianism#Antinomianism in the New Testament|does not now apply at all]], or at least [[Abrogation|does not fully apply]]. Most biblical scholars admit the issue of the Law can be confusing and the topic of [[Paul the Apostle#Relationship with Judaism|Paul and the Law]] is still frequently debated among New Testament scholars<ref>Gundry, ed., ''Five Views on Law and Gospel''. (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1993).</ref> (for example, see [[New Perspective on Paul]], [[Pauline Christianity]]); hence the various views.

===God's benevolence===
{{further|Theodicy}}
A central issue in [[monotheist]] ethics is the [[problem of evil]], the apparent contradiction between a [[Omnibenevolence|benevolent]], [[Omnipotence|all-powerful God]] and the existence of [[evil]] and hell (see [[Problem of Hell]]). [[Theodicy]] seeks to explain why we may simultaneously affirm God's goodness, and the presence of evil in the world.
[[Descartes]] in his ''Meditations'' considers, but rejects, the possibility that God is an evil demon ("[[dystheism]]").

The Bible contains numerous examples seemingly unethical acts of God.
* In the [[Book of Exodus]], God deliberately "hardened Pharaoh's heart", making him even more unwilling to free the Hebrew slaves ({{bibleref2|Exo|4:21}}, {{bibleref2|Rom|9:17-21}}).
* Genocidal commands of God in [[Deuteronomy]], such as the call to eradicate all the  [[Canaan]]ite tribes including children and infants ({{bibleref2|Deut|20:16-17}}). According to the Bible, this was to fulfill God's covenant to Israel, the "[[promised land]]" to his chosen people.({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|7:1-25|niv}})
* God ordering the Israelites to undertake punitive military raids against other tribes. This happened, for instance, to the Midianites of Moab, who had enticed some Israelites into worshipping local gods ({{bibleverse||Numbers|25:1-18|niv}}). The entire tribe was exterminated, except for the young virgin girls; who were kept by the Israelites as slaves ({{bibleverse||Numbers|31:1-54|niv}}). In {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|15:3|niv}}, God orders the Israelites to "attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys." <ref>The Dominion of Love: Animal Rights According to the Bible, Norm Phelps, p. 14</ref>       
* In the [[Book of Job]], God allows [[Satan]] to plague His loyal servant Job with devastating tragedies leaving all his children dead and himself poor. The nature of Divine justice becomes the theme of the entire book. However after he got through his troubles his health was restored and all he had was doubled.
* Sending evil spirits to people ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|18:10|niv}}, {{bibleverse||Judges|9:23|niv}}).
* Punishing the innocent for the sins of other people ({{bibleref2|Isa|14:21}}, {{bibleref2|Deut|23:2}}, {{bibleref2|Hosea|13:16}}).

==Criticism==
[[Simon Blackburn]] states that the "Bible can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women".<ref>{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 12}}</ref> Elizabeth Anderson, a Professor of Philosophy and Women's Studies at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]], states that "the Bible contains both good and evil teachings", and it is "morally inconsistent".<ref>Elizabeth Anderson, "If God is Dead, Is Everything Permitted?"

===The Old Testament===
Elizabeth Anderson criticizes commands God gave to men in the Old Testament, such as: kill adulterers, homosexuals, and "people who work on the Sabbath" (Leviticus 20:10; Leviticus 20:13; Exodus 35:2, respectively); to commit [[ethnic cleansing]] (Exodus 34:11-14, Leviticus 26:7-9); commit [[genocide]] (Numbers 21: 2-3, Numbers 21:33–35, Deuteronomy 2:26–35, and Joshua 1–12); and other mass killings.<ref name="ReferenceA">Elizabeth Anderson, "If God is Dead, Is Everything Permitted?" In {{cite book |title= The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever|last= Hitchens|first= Christopher|year= 2007|publisher= Da Capo Press|location= Philadelphia|isbn= 978-0-306-81608-6|page= 337}}</ref> Anderson considers the Bible to permit slavery, the beating of slaves, the rape of female captives in wartime, [[polygamy]] (for men), the killing of prisoners, and child sacrifice.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> She also provides a number of examples to illustrate what she considers "God's moral character": "Routinely punishes people for the sins of others&nbsp;... punishes all mothers by condemning them to painful childbirth", punishes four generations of descendants of those who worship other Gods, kills 24,000 Israelites because some of them sinned (Numbers 25:1–9), kills 70,000 Israelites for the sin of David in 2 Samuel 24:10–15, and "sends two bears out of the woods to tear forty-two children to pieces" because they called someone names in 2 Kings 2:23–24.<ref>Elizabeth Anderson, "If God is Dead, Is Everything Permitted?"

Blackburn provides examples of Old Testament moral criticisms such as the phrase in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:18 that has "helped to burn alive tens or hundreds of thousands of women in Europe and America": "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live," and notes that the Old Testament God apparently has "no problems with a slave-owning society", considers birth control a crime punishable by death, and "is keen on child abuse".<ref>{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 10, 12}}</ref> Additional examples that are questioned today are: the prohibition on touching women during their "period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19–24)", the apparent approval of selling daughters into slavery (Exodus 21:7), and the obligation to put to death someone working on the Sabbath (Exodus 35:2).<ref>{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 11}}</ref>

===The New Testament===
Anderson criticizes what she terms morally repugnant lessons of the New Testament. She claims that "Jesus tells us his mission is to make family members hate one another, so that they shall love him more than their kin (Matt 10:35-37)", that "Disciples must hate their parents, siblings, wives, and children (Luke 14:26)", and that Peter and Paul elevate men over their wives "who must obey their husbands as gods" (1 Corinthians 11:3, 14:34-5, Eph. 5:22-24, Col. 3:18, 1 Tim. 2: 11-2, 1 Pet. 3:1).<ref>Elizabeth Anderson, "If God is Dead, Is Everything Permitted?"

In {{cite book |title= The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever|last= Hitchens|first= Christopher|year= 2007|publisher= Da Capo Press|location= Philadelphia|isbn= 978-0-306-81608-6|page= 339}}</ref>

'''RAF Machrihanish''' is a former [[Royal Air Force]] station located {{convert|3|NM|lk=in}} west of [[Campbeltown]]<ref name="aip"/> at the tip of [[Kintyre]]. It is now known as '''MoD Machrihanish''' and also incorporates [[Campbeltown Airport]] which has commercial flights to [[Glasgow International Airport|Glasgow]], operated by [[Loganair]].

The United States maintained a [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] commando unit, a 20 person team known as [[United States Naval Special Warfare Command|Naval Special Warfare Detachment 1]] (The other overseas Naval Special Warfare Detachments, 2 and 3 were based at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, and Subic Bay, Philippines) at the airfield and the [[Royal Marines]] occasionally use the facility for training exercises. The civilian airport is located at the opposite end of the station from the hangars, bunkers and the SEAL building.

In July or August 1918, RAF Machrihanish opened for the first time operating as a sub-station of the RNAS airship station based at Luce Bay.  The airfield was part of [[No. 25 Group RAF]], North West Area, with [[No. 272 Squadron RAF]] stationed there.  The station closed in December 1918, when the last squadron to be posted there was disbanded. (Secret Scotland Wiki)

No [[772 Naval Air Squadron]] arrived at Machrihanish in July 1940 as Portland, its previous base, had become a prime target for the Luftwaffe since the fall of France.  Thus the squadron and the anti-submarine school both moved north. [[766 Naval Air Squadron]] (Operational Training Unit) arrived in August 1942. [[768 Naval Air Squadron]] (Deck Landing Training) also arrived in the middle of 1943. In addition to its resident squadrons, records indicate a further ten front line squadrons were stationed there in spring 1942. A large number of other squadrons used the base for training for short periods. (Secret Scotland Wiki)

During the [[Cold War]], Machrihanish was a strategically important [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) airfield, with its location giving immediate access to patrol & support naval operation over the North Atlantic. It was also valuable as a stopping point for transatlantic military flights.

At {{convert|3049|m|abbr=on|0}}, the original runway 11/29 at Campbeltown Airport was the longest of any public airport in Scotland.  It was built between 1960 and 1962 as part of a major reconstruction for the airport's role in NATO. It was certified to accept NASA's Space Shuttle should it have needed to make an emergency landing in Europe.

An answer to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in 2004 reveals that the airfield was handed over by the [[United States Navy]] back to [[Ministry of Defence (UK)|Ministry of Defence]] control on 30 June 1995.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040223/text/40223w14.htm#40223w14.html_sbhd3 House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 23 Feb 2004 (pt 14)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The station is now on what is termed under "care and maintenance" — this allows the airfield to be used by civilian [[airline]]s, which may conduct scheduled and charter flights from the aerodrome. The MoD are responsible for the upkeep of the aerodrome, which may sometimes be used by military detachments whilst on exercise. During times of conflict or national emergency, the aerodrome could revert to its intended military use. In 2005 the MoD was still reported to be considering reactivating the airfield.<ref>[[The Scotsman]], [http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=202502005]</ref>

On 14 May 2009, it was announced that the station would be made available for sale,<ref>[[Campbeltown Courier]], [http://www.campbeltowncourier.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/5066/Base_for_sale.html] {{Dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref> and in 2012 was sold for £1 to a local consortium who hope to develop the site for the benefit of the local community.<ref>[[BBC News]], [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-18222334 Former RAF Machrihanish bought for £1]</ref>

'''''Engelhardia''''' is a [[genus]] of seven species of [[tree]]s in the family [[Juglandaceae]], native to southeast [[Asia]] from northern [[India]] east to [[Taiwan]], [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]]. The genus name is commonly misspelled "''Engelhardtia''", a "correction" made by the original author Blume in 1829 and persistent until today, as it was thus entered in the ''[[Index Kewensis]]''; the original spelling is ''Engelhardia''.

''Engelhardia'' pollen has been found in deposits of [[Miocene]] Age in [[Denmark]].<ref>Larsson et al. (2006) Early Miocene pollen and spores from western Jylland, Denmark – environmental and climatic implications. GFF 128 (3): 261-272</ref>

==Career==
Shue's two best-known plays were written and first performed while he was playwright-in-residence at the [[Milwaukee Repertory Theater]]:
*''[[The Nerd]]'' premiered in April 1981, and was produced successfully in [[London]]'s [[West End theatre|West End]]. It transferred to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1987. It is a simple character-based comedy, in which a normal dinner party, interrupted by the house-guest from hell, dissolves into insanity.
*[[The Foreigner (play)|''The Foreigner'']] premiered in 1983, and transferred to [[Off-Broadway]]. The central character is Charlie Baker, who, while on a vacation in a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] hunting lodge, pretends not to be able to understand [[English language|English]], so as to avoid the attentions of the other guests. His plan backfires and he soon finds himself the confidant of everyone there, especially a young man named Ellard, who thinks he is teaching Charlie English. Charlie ends up having to foil the schemes of the local [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapter without revealing his secret.

His other plays include:
*''Grandma Duck is Dead'' - about antics in a college [[dormitory]]
*''My Emperor's New Clothes'' - "set in the kingdom of Mango-Chutney, a [[One-act play|one-act]] children's [[Musical theatre|musical]] based on the [[Hans Christian Andersen]] [[The Emperor's New Clothes|story]] (Shue works in some cross-dressing, as well as a rhyme for "orange")"<ref name= "appreciation">{{cite web |url= http://nouveau.home.comcast.net/~nouveau/shue/ |author= Gorsline, David |title= Larry Shue, an appreciation |date= |accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref>
*''Wenceslas Square'' - set in 1974 [[Prague]] after the Soviet invasion of 1968

The off-Broadway production of ''The Foreigner'' resulted in two [[Obie]] awards in 1985, to [[Jerry Zaks]] for direction and [[Anthony Heald]] for performance.<ref name=obies-1985>{{cite web|title=New York Obies Theater Awards|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/obies/index/1985/|publisher=Village Voice, LLC|accessdate=8 April 2013}}</ref> From the [[Outer Critics Circle]], it received the John Gassner Playwriting Award and the award for Best Off Broadway Play.<ref name=occ-1984>{{cite web|title=Awards Archive|url=http://www.outercritics.org/AwardArchives.aspx?_y=1984-1985|publisher=Outer Critics Circle|accessdate=8 April 2013}}</ref>

==Death==
Shue's success was short-lived. At the age of 39, he died in the crash of a Beech 99 commuter plane enroute to [[Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport]] near [[Weyers Cave, Virginia]]; all fourteen people on the flight were killed, twelve passengers and two crew.<ref name=specter-carton>{{cite news|last1=Specter|first1=Michael|last2=Carton|first2=Barbara|title=Crash Cause Sought At Blue Ridge Site|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=25 September 1985|pages=C1,C5}}</ref><ref name=smith-victims>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Philip|title=Actor-Playwright and Businessmen Among Victims Aboard Henson Flight|accessdate=2 April 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=25 September 1985|page=C5}}</ref> At the time, Shue was preparing for his first big Broadway role, as Reverend Crisparkle in [[Joseph Papp]]'s ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/theater/reviews/10393/ |author= Simon, John |title= Southern Exposure: Matthew Broderick goes nonnative in the fishing farce The Foreigner |publisher= ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' |date=22 November 2004 |accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref>

Among many other eulogies, author [[Thomas M. Disch]] said that Shue's death was "fate's cruelest trick on the theater since the murder of [[Joe Orton]]."<ref>{{cite journal |url= |last= Disch |first= Thomas M. |title= ''The Nerd'' |journal= [[The Nation]] |volume= 244 |date= April 18, 1987 |page= 517}}</ref> Also in remembrance, Canadian actor [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0112048/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 Jeff Brooks] said, "I knew him, and I saw him play Charlie [in the play ''The Foreigner''] in New York. Then I played it in New York after him, although we're quite different as actors." Shue played the smaller role of Froggy, and Brooks had something to say about that, as well: "I know damn well he wrote Charlie for himself. As an actor, he was such a cut-up. When I saw him, he was wonderful. I remember thinking a couple of times that he's doing things that if he were the playwright sitting out here, he'd be saying, 'Oh, stop that. Cut that out.' But he was having so much fun inventively in the role."<ref name= "Atla" />

'''Reinaldo Arenas''' (July 16, 1943 – December 7, 1990) was a  [[Cubans|Cuban]] [[poet]], [[novelist]], and [[playwright]] who despite his early sympathy for [[Fidel Castro]] and the [[Cuban Revolution|1959 revolution]], grew critical of and then rebelled against the [[Politics of Cuba|Cuban government]].

== Life ==
Arenas was born in the countryside, in the northern part of the Province of [[Oriente Province|Oriente]], [[Cuba]], and later moved to the city of [[Holguín]]. In 1963, he moved to [[Havana]] to [[matriculation|enroll]] in the School of Planification and, later, in the Faculty of Letters at the [[Universidad de La Habana]], where he studied philosophy and literature without completing a degree. The following year, he began working at the Biblioteca Nacional José Martí.<ref>[http://www.cubacenter.org/media/arenas.html Cuba Center]  {{Wayback|url=http://www.cubacenter.org/media/arenas.html|date =20060215050518}}</ref>  While there, his talent was noticed and he was awarded prizes at Cirilo Villaverde National Competition held by [[UNEAC]] (National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists).<ref>(Soto 1998)</ref> His ''Hallucinations''  was awarded "first Honorable Mention" in 1966 although, as the judges could find no better entry, no First Prize was awarded that year.

His writings and openly gay lifestyle were, by 1967,  bringing him into conflict with the Communist government. He left the Biblioteca Nacional and became an editor for the Cuban Book Institute until 1968. From 1968 to 1974 he was a journalist and editor for the literary magazine ''La Gaceta de Cuba''. In 1974, he was sent to prison after being charged and convicted of 'ideological deviation' and for publishing abroad without official consent. He escaped from prison and tried to leave Cuba by launching himself from the shore on a tire inner tube. The attempt failed and he was rearrested near Lenin Park and imprisoned at the notorious [[Morro Castle (fortress)|El Morro Castle]] alongside murderers and rapists. He survived by helping the inmates to write letters to wives and lovers. He was able to collect enough paper this way to continue his writing. However, his attempts to smuggle his work out of prison were discovered and he was severely punished. Threatened with death, he was forced to renounce his work and was released in 1976.<ref>[http://myweb.lsbu.ac.uk/stafflag/reinaldoarenas.html (dead link)]  {{Wayback|url=http://myweb.lsbu.ac.uk/stafflag/reinaldoarenas.html|date =20061211163025}}</ref>
In 1980, as part of the [[Mariel Boatlift]], he fled to the United States.<ref>[http://libweb.princeton.edu/libraries/firestone/rbsc/aids/arenas.html Reinaldo Arenas Papers at Princeton Libraries] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5v9ASxD2Y|date =2010-12-21}}</ref> He came on the boat ''San Lazaro'' captained by Cuban immigrant Roberto Aguero.

== Writings ==
Despite his short life and the hardships imposed during his imprisonment, Arenas produced a significant body of work. In addition to significant poetic efforts ("El Central", "Leprosorio"), his ''[[Pentagonia]]'' is  a set of five novels that comprise a "secret history" of post-revolutionary [[Cuba]]. It includes ''Singing from the Well'' (in Spanish also titled "Celestino before Dawn"), ''[[Farewell to the Sea]]'' (whose literal translation is "The Sea Once More"), ''[[Palace of the White Skunks]]'', the [[Rabelais]]ian ''[[Color of Summer]]'', and ''The Assault''. In these novels Arenas’ style ranges from a stark realist narrative and high modernist experimental prose to absurd, satiric humor.  His second novel, ''Hallucinations'' ("El Mundo Alucinante"), rewrites the story of the colonial dissident priest [[Servando Teresa de Mier|Fray Servando Teresa de Mier]].

In interviews, his autobiography, and in some of his fiction work itself, Arenas draws explicit connections between his own life experience and the identities and fates of his protagonists.  As is evident and as critics such as Francisco Soto have pointed out, the "child narrator" in "Celestino", Fortunato of "The Palace...", Hector of "Farewell..", and the triply named "Gabriel/Reinaldo/Gloomy Skunk" character in "Color" appear to live progressive stages of a continuous life story that is also linked to Arenas's own.<ref>Soto, Francisco.  "Reinaldo Arenas." Twayne Publishers:  London, 1998.</ref>  In turn, Arenas consistently links his individual narrated life to the historical experience of a generation of Cubans.   A constant theme in his novels and other writing is the condemnation of the [http://lacomunidad.elpais.com/nicolasaguila/2012/12/7/carta-despedida-reinaldo-arenas Castro government], although Arenas also critiques the Catholic Church, US culture and politics, and a series of literary personalities in Havana and internationally, particularly those who he believed had betrayed him and suppressed his work ([[Severo Sarduy]] and [[Ángel Rama]] are notable examples). His "Thirty truculent tongue-twisters", which he claims circulated in Havana and which are reprinted in "The Color of Summer", mock everyone from personal friends who he suggests may have spied on him to figures such as Nicolás Guillén, Alejo Carpentier, Miguel Barnet, Sarduy and of course Fidel himself.

His autobiography, ''[[Before Night Falls]]'' was on the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' list of the ten best books of the year in 1993. In 2000 this work was made into a [[Before Night Falls (film)|film]], directed by [[Julian Schnabel]], in which Arenas was played by [[Javier Bardem]].  An opera based on the autobiography with libretto and music by Cuban-American composer [[Jorge Martin]] was premiered by the [[Fort Worth Opera]] on May 29, 2010, with baritone Wes Mason singing the role of Reinaldo Arenas.

== Death ==
In 1987, Arenas was diagnosed with [[AIDS]], but he continued to write and speak out against the Cuban government. He mentored many [[Cuban exile]] writers, including John O'Donnell-Rosales.   After battling AIDS, Arenas died of an intentional overdose of drugs and alcohol on December 7, 1990, in [[New York, New York|New York]].  In a [[suicide]] letter written for publication, Arenas wrote: <blockquote>Due to my delicate state of health and to the terrible depression it causes me not to be able to continue writing and struggling for the freedom of Cuba, I am ending my life.  . . .  I want to encourage the Cuban people out of the country as well as on the Island to continue fighting for freedom. . . Cuba will be free.  I already am.<ref>[http://picard.montclair.edu/witness/Arenas.html Reinaldo Arenas' Last Letter; [[Montclair University]]] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5v9AT25FU|date =2010-12-21}}</ref></blockquote>

His first name is also given as '''Mathis''' and his surname as '''Gothart''' or '''Neithardt'''. Only ten paintings&mdash;several consisting of many panels&mdash;and thirty-five drawings survive, all religious, although many others were lost at sea in the Baltic on their way to Sweden as war booty. His reputation was obscured until the late nineteenth century, and many of his paintings were attributed to [[Albrecht Dürer]], who is now seen as his stylistic antithesis. His largest and most famous work is the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] created 1506 to 1515 or perhaps 1512 to 1516.{{fact|date=June 2013}}

== Life ==
[[Image:Grunewald Self Portrait.jpg|thumb|Grünewald's ''[[John the Evangelist]]''. This work was long thought to be a self-portrait.]]

The details of his life are unusually unclear for a painter of his significance at this date, despite the fact that his commissions show that he had reasonable recognition in his own lifetime. The first source for his biography is the German art historian [[Joachim von Sandrart]], who describes him around 1505 working on the exterior decoration of an altarpiece by [[Albrecht Dürer]] in [[Frankfurt]]. This is the sort of work typically performed by apprentices and therefore an estimate of his age can be reached, suggesting he was born in 1480-83.<ref>Siglind Bruhn, ''The temptation of Paul Hindemith: Mathis der Maler as a spiritual testimony''. Pendragon: 1998. pp 25-27</ref> Sandrart records that Grünewald had as an apprentice the painter [[Hans Grimmer]], who would become famous in his time, but most of whose works were lost in the [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Joachim von Sandrart|title=''Teutsche Academie'', TA 1675, II, Buch 3 (niederl. u. dt.

Künstler), S. 237 |url=http://ta.sandrart.net/edition/text/view/455|publisher=Sandrart.net|accessdate=2012-11-28}}</ref>

More recent investigations have provided further information on Grünewald's life. In 1511 he became court artist of [[Uriel von Gemmingen]], [[Archbishop of Mainz]], and he also worked for the next archbishop, [[Albert of Brandenburg]]. In 1512 he settled in nearby [[Frankfurt]] where records indicate he bought a house and married Anna, a converted Jew, then probably aged 18. The marriage was not happy and in 1523 she would be institutionalised with what is variously described as mental illness and demonic possession.<ref>Siglind Bruhn, ''The temptation of Paul Hindemith: Mathis der Maler as a spiritual testimony''. Pendragon: 1998. pp. 28–29</ref>

From 1512 to 1514 or 1515 he worked on the Isenheim altarpiece, apparently in partnership with another Mathis, variously surnamed Nithart, Neithart, von Würzburg (after his [[Würzburg|place of birth]]), or Gothardt. Grünewald seems to have left Isenheim in a hurry, returning to Frankfurt, and his subsequent poverty suggests he was not fully paid for the altarpiece. In 1527 he entered the services of the wealthy and noble von Erbach family, apparently with a child (whether his own or adopted, is unclear). He most probably died in 1532, although sources vary.<ref>Siglind Bruhn, ''The temptation of Paul Hindemith: Mathis der Maler as a spiritual testimony''. Pendragon: 1998. pp. 29–31</ref>

There has been considerable uncertainty about the details of his life. In 1938 Walter Karl Zülch published the theory that Grünewald and his partner Nithart/Gothardt were the same person; this Nithart/Gothardt was a painter, engineer, and "water artist" born in Würzburg in the 1460s or maybe 1470s and probably dying in 1528. This theory is now generally discredited, although more recent historians believe Nithart/Gothardt may have pretended to be Grünewald for business reasons.<ref>Siglind Bruhn, ''The temptation of Paul Hindemith: Mathis der Maler as a spiritual testimony''. Pendragon: 1998. pp. 34–35</ref>

Grünewald's first dated painting is probably in Munich, dated 1503 on a much later note which apparently records an older inscription.{{cite-needed|date=February 2012}} There is much speculation about Grünewald's politics, with some people associating him with the [[Reformation]] or support for the lower classes. He may have left the Archbishop of Mainz because of sympathies either with the [[German Peasants' War]], or [[Lutheranism]] (he had some Lutheran pamphlets and papers at his death).{{cite-needed|date=February 2012}}

== Works ==
[[File:Grünewald Heilige Dorothea 01.jpg|thumb|left|Sketch for a lost ''[[Dorothea of Caesarea|Saint Dorothy]]'' (Berlin). The [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] purchased a [[Art forgery|forged]] painting based on this drawing.]]
Only religious works are included in his small surviving corpus, the most famous being the ''[[Isenheim Altarpiece]]'', completed 1515, now in the [[Musée d'Unterlinden]], [[Colmar]]. Its nine images on twelve panels are arranged on double wings to present three views (rather than just the open and closed states of [[triptych]] [[altarpiece]]s), according to the season or occasion. The first view with the outer wings closed shows a Crucifixion flanked by [[Saint Sebastien]] and [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony]], with a [[predella]] showing the entombment. When the first set of wings is opened, the ''Annunciation'', ''Angelic Concert'' (sometimes interpreted as the ''Birth of [[Christian Church|Ecclesia]]'') ''Mary bathing Christ'', and ''Resurrection'' are displayed. The third view discloses a carved and gilded wood altarpiece by [[Nikolaus Hagenauer]], flanked by the ''Temptation of St. Anthony'' and ''Anthony's visit to [[Paul of Thebes|Saint Paul]]''. As well as being by far his greatest surviving work, the altarpiece contains most of his surviving painting by surface area, being 2.65 metres high and over 5 metres wide at its fullest extent.

His other works are in Germany, except for a small Crucifixion in [[National Gallery of Art|Washington]] and another in [[Kunstmuseum Basel|Basel]], Switzerland. Around 1510 he was asked to paint four saints in [[grisaille]] for the outside of the wings of [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s {{Ill|de|Heller Altarpiece|Heller-Altar}} in Frankfurt. Dürer's work was destroyed by fire and survives only in copies, but fortunately the wings have survived, one pair of saints being displayed in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt's]] [[Städel|Municipal Art Gallery]] and the other in [[Karlsruhe]]'s, [[Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe|Staatliche Kunsthalle]]. There are also the late ''Tauberbischofsheim altarpiece'' in the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, and the ''Establishment of the Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome'' (1517–1519), [[Augustiner Museum]], [[Freiburg]]. A large panel of [[Saint Erasmus]] and [[Saint Maurice]] in [[Alte Pinakothek|Munich]] probably dates from 1521–24, and was apparently part of a larger altarpiece project, the rest of which has not survived. Other works are in Munich, Karlsruhe, [[Aschaffenberg]] and [[Bad Mergentheim|Stuppach]] ([[:de:Stuppacher Madonna|:de]]). Altogether four somber and awe-filled [[Crucifixion]]s survive. The visionary character of his work, with its expressive colour and line, is in stark contrast to Dürer's works. His paintings are known for their dramatic forms, vivid colors, and depiction of light.

== Reputation ==
[[File:Frankoniabrunnen2.JPG|thumb|19c depiction of Grünewald on the Franconiabrunnen by [[Ferdinand von Miller]] (1824) now in front of the [[Würzburg Residenz]].]]
The Protestant theologian [[Philipp Melanchthon]] is one of the few contemporary writers to refer to Grünewald, who is rather puzzlingly described as "moderate" in style, when compared with Dürer and Cranach; what paintings this judgement is based on is uncertain. By the end of the century, when the [[Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph II]], embarked on his quest to secure as many Dürer paintings as possible, the Isenheim Altarpiece was already generally believed to be a Dürer. In the late 19th century he was rediscovered, and became something of a cult figure, with the angst-laden expressionism—and absence of any direct classicism—of the Isenheim Altarpiece appealing to both German [[Nationalist]]s and [[Modernism|Modernists]]. [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] promoted his art enthusiastically in both novels and journalism, rather as [[Proust]] did that of [[Vermeer]]. His apparent sympathies with the peasants in the Peasants' War also brought him admiration from the political left.

The composer [[Paul Hindemith]] based his 1938 opera ''[[Mathis der Maler (opera)|Mathis der Maler]]'' on the life of Grünewald during the [[German Peasants' War]]; scene Six includes a partial re-enactment of some scenes from the Isenheim Altarpiece.

[[Elias Canetti]] wrote his novel ''Auto-da-Fé'' surrounded by reproductions of the Isenheim altarpiece stuck to the wall.

German author [[W.G. Sebald]] traces the life story of Grünewald in his first literary work, ''After Nature''. This book-length prose-poem uses the preoccupations of Grünewald and especially his creation of the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] to communicate an intensely apocalyptic vision of a world that has abandoned nature.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eva Hoffman |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E5D81331F931A1575AC0A9649C8B63 |title=Curiosity and Catastrophe |publisher=New York Times |date=2002-09-22 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}</ref> The Isenheim Altarpiece also features in the last chapter of Sebald's novel ''The Emigrants'', in which the painter Max Ferber describes his intuition of the extreme power of pain after seeing Grünewald's work.

=== Veneration ===
He is commemorated as an artist and saint by the [[Lutheran Church]] on April 6, along with Dürer and Cranach. The [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] remembers the three German artists on August 5.

Cuneiform characters were imprinted on a wet clay tablet with a [[stylus]] often made of [[Reed (plant)|reed]] ([[reed pen]]). Once written upon, many tablets were dried in the sun or air, remaining fragile. Later, these unfired clay tablets could be soaked in water and recycled into new clean tablets.

In the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]/[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] civilizations, writing has not been observed for any use other than accounting. Tablets serving as labels, with the impression of the side of a wicker basket on the back, and tablets showing yearly summaries, suggest a sophisticated accounting system. In this cultural region the tablets were never fired deliberately, as the clay was recycled on an annual basis. However, some of the tablets were "fired" as a result of uncontrolled fires in the buildings where they were stored. The rest are still tablets of unfired clay, and extremely fragile; some modern scholars are investigating the possibility of firing them ''now'', as an aid to preservation.

== Scribes ==

The clay tablet was used by scribes who took down the events of what was happening during his time. Tools that these scribes used were styluses with sharp triangular tips, making it easy to leave<ref name="ancient1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu.com/cuneiform/ |title=Cuneiform - Ancient History Encyclopedia |publisher=Ancient.eu.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-16}}</ref> markings on the clay. Clay tablets were among one of the essential components for this type of writing, and it came in a variety of<ref name="factsanddetails.com">[http://factsanddetails.com/world.php?itemid=1525 ]{{dead link|date=June 2014}}</ref> colors such as bone white, chocolate and charcoal. Pictographs were then beginning to appear on clay tablets during 4000 BC Syllabic script around 2500 BC was interpreted to show of native language used.

Language and writing have come a long way since times of early human evolution. Writing was not as we see it today, for it started out as signs and characters. These special characters at the time had their own meaning and were used to take account of what was going on. This all began when people developed agriculture, started towns with population and when the trading market began to grow.<ref>"http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/educator/modules/gutenberg/books/early/</ref> Above mentioned things being traded, which were sheep’s, grain, and bread loafs. Each and every one of these items was recorded by clay tokens. Clay tokens were then used all the way until pre-historic Mesopotamia.

Historically writing and the use of clay tablets began around the time period of<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/educator/modules/gutenberg/books/early/ |title=Early Writing |publisher=Hrc.utexas.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-16}}</ref> 3000 BC when Sumerians decided they were going to start writing. Sumerians used what is referred to as “pictograms”. Pictograms are symbols that express a picture rooting from the sound of a word. Early writing was then also seen in Ancient Egyptians using what they called “hieroglyphs”; hieroglyphs and modern Chinese characters represent an example of pictographs. The Sumerians than shifted their writing to<ref name="ancient1"/> Cuneiform defined as “Wedge writing” in Latin.

== Uses of clay tablets ==
Clay tablets took the forms of myths, fables, essays, hymns, proverbs, epic poetry, laws, plants, and animals.<ref name="factsanddetails.com"/> Basically we are seeing the future of writing, as it becomes very useful and handy. What these clay tablets allowed was for individuals to record who and what was significant. An example of these great stories was The Story of Gilgamesh. This story would tell of the great flood that destroyed Sumer. Remedies and recipes that would have been unknown were then possible because of the clay tablet. Some of the recipes were stew, which was made with goat, garlic, onions and sour milk.

By the end of the 3rd Millennium BC, (2200-2000 BC), even the ''"[[short story]]"'' was first attempted, as independent scribes entered into the philosophical arena, with stories like: ''[[Debate between bird and fish|The Debate between Bird and Fish]]'', and other topics, ([[Sumerian disputations|List of Sumerian debates]]).

== Communication ==

Communication grew faster as now there was a way to get messages across just like mail. Important and private clay tablets were coated with an extra layer of clay, that no one else would read it. This means of communicating was used for over<ref name="factsanddetails.com"/>  3000 years in fifteen different languages. Sumerians, Babylonians and Eblaites all had their own clay tablet libraries.

== Evolution in clay tablet writing ==

As Sumerian writing on clay tablets became main-stream, others began to complain that the Sumerian word-signs, were indeed too complicated to master. Not everyone could interpret the signs and they wanted a writing system that was simple yet got the message across. Elamites, Hurrians and Ugaritans then eliminated this from their style or form of writing. Tablets that were found south of Baghdad were made up of literary works, dictionaries, prayers, omens and astronomical recordings that were still in their own positions. Ugarites took advantage and created the first of the Alphabets.<ref name="factsanddetails.com"/> The tablet was said to have 32 cuneiform letters which was discovered in Syria about 1450 B.C. Egyptians took it to the next level by becoming the earliest individuals to have their very own writing system. Mentioned earlier they used “hieroglyphics” instead of the normal alphabets. Defining hieroglyphics you get the Greek phrase “sacred writing” because of the early belief, that knowledge was a gift from their gods. The two main types of hieroglyphics were logograms and phonograms. Logograms were usually representing a certain ideas while phonograms focused on sounds that were closely alike to the alphabet.

==Proto-writing==
The [[T?rt?ria tablets]],  the [[Vin?a culture|Danubian civilization]], may be still older, having been dated by indirect method (bones found near the tablet were [[carbon dating|carbon dated]]) to before 4000 BC, and possibly dating from as long ago as 5500 BC, but their interpretation remains controversial because the tablets were fired in a furnace and the properties of the carbon changed accordingly.<ref name="Tartaria Tablets">{{cite web

{{Dutch colonial campaigns}}
The '''Padri War''' (also called the '''Minangkabau War''') was fought from 1803 until 1837 in [[West Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]] between the so-called ''Padris'', [[Islam|Muslim]] clerics from [[Sumatra]] who, inspired by [[Wahabism]] and after returning from [[Hajj]], wanted to impose [[sharia]] in [[Minangkabau Highlands|Minangkabau]] country in [[West Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], and the Minangkabau nobility and traditional chiefs. The latter asked for the help of the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army|Dutch]], who intervened from 1821 and helped the nobility defeat the Padri faction.

==Background==
It can be considered that the Padri War actually began in 1803, prior to Dutch intervention, and was a conflict that had broken out in Minangkabau country when the Padris started to suppress what they saw as unislamic customs, i.e. the ''[[adat]]''. But after occupation of the [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] by Tuanku Pasaman, one of Padri leaders in 1815, on February 21, 1821, the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] nobility made a deal with Dutch in [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]] to help them to fight the Padris.<ref>Sjafnir Aboe Nain, 2004, ''Memorie Tuanku Imam Bonjol (MTIB), transl., Padang: PPIM.</ref>

''Adat'', as customary law is called in Indonesia, includes indigenous, pre-Islamic religious practices and social traditions in local custom. The Padris, like contemporaneous jihadists in the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] of West Africa, were [[Islamist]] reformers who had made the ''[[hajj]]'' to Mecca and returned<ref>The port where they embarked and disembarked, Pedir, Sumatra, gave them their name.</ref> inspired to bring the Qur'an and ''[[shariah]]'' to a position of greater influence in Sumatra. The Padri movement had formed during the early 19th century and sought to purify the culture of traditions and beliefs its partisans viewed as un-Islamic, including syncretic folk beliefs, [[cockfighting]] and Minangkabau matrilineal traditions.

In the 1820s, the Dutch had yet to consolidate their possessions in some parts of the [[Netherlands East Indies|Dutch East Indies]] (later Indonesia) after re-acquiring it from the [[United Kingdom|British]]. This was especially true on the island of Sumatra, where some areas would not come under Dutch rule until the 20th century.

==Skirmishes and the Masang Treaty==
Dutch involvement in the war came about because it was "invited" by the Adat faction, and on April 1821, Dutch troops attacked Simawang and Sulit Air under captains Goffinet and Dienema on the orders of James du Puy, the Dutch Resident in Padang. Between 1821–1824, skirmishes broke out throughout the region, ended only by the Masang Treaty. The war cooled down during the next six years, as the Dutch faced larger-scale uprisings in [[Java War|Java]].<ref>G. Kepper, 1900, ''Wapenfeiten van het Nederlands Indische Leger; 1816-1900'', M.M. Cuvee, Den Haag.</ref>

==Dutch advances==
The conflict broke out again in the 1830s with the Dutch gaining early victories. Soon after, the war centered on Bonjol, the fortified last stronghold of the Padris. It finally fell in 1837<ref name="Abdullah2009">{{cite book|author=Taufik Abdullah|title=Indonesia: Towards Democracy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=c39TDpLki8wC&pg=PA5|accessdate=2013-08-25|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=978-981-230-366-0|page=5}}</ref> after being besieged for three years, and along with the exile of Padri leader [[Tuanku Imam Bonjol]], the conflict died out.

==Impact==
With the victory, the Dutch tightened their hold on West Sumatra. Yet there was a positive legacy for the native Minangs: after the war, the traditional and religious leaders increasingly reconciled their visions. This helped promulgating the new view of "''adat basandi syara', syara' basandi Kitabullah''" ("tradition founded upon [[Islam]]ic law, Islamic law founded upon the [[Qur'an]]").

==Description==
[[Image:Muffelwild12.4.2008 007.jpg|thumb|A European mouflon male in the German forest]]
Mouflon have red-brown, short-haired coats with dark back-stripes and light-colored saddle patches. The males are [[Horn (anatomy)|horned]]; some females are horned, while others are [[Polled livestock|polled]].  The horns of mature rams are curved in almost one full revolution (up to 85&nbsp;cm). Mouflon have shoulder heights of about 0.9 m and body weights of 50&nbsp;kg (males) and 35&nbsp;kg (females).<ref name= macdonald>{{cite book | last = MacDonald | first = David|author2=Priscilla Barret |title = Mammals of Britain & Europe |volume= 1| year = 1993| publisher = HarperCollins |location = London  | isbn =0-00-219779-0| pages = 220–221 }}</ref>

==Range==
[[File:Ovis orientalis LC0267.jpg|thumb|Mouflon ram]]
Today, mouflon inhabit the [[Caucasus]], northern and eastern [[Iraq]], and northwestern [[Iran]]. The range originally stretched further to [[Anatolia]], the  [[Crimean]] peninsula and the [[Balkan]]s, where they had already disappeared 3,000 years ago. Mouflon were introduced to the islands of [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]], [[Rhodes]], and [[Cyprus]] during the [[neolithic]] period, perhaps as feral domesticated animals, where they have naturalized in the mountainous interiors of these islands over the past few thousand years, giving rise to the subspecies known as European mouflon (''O. aries musimon'').

On the island of Cyprus, the mouflon or ''agrino'' became a different and endemic species only found there, the Cyprus mouflon (''O. o. ophion''). The Cyprus mouflon population contains only about 3000 animals. They are now rare on the islands, but are classified as feral animals by the [[IUCN]].<ref>{{cite web |url={{IUCNlink|15739}} |title=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species |author=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources | date=April  2009 |publisher=IUCN |accessdate=2009}} More specifically, in the island of [[Cyprus]] they became a new endemic species only found there, the "Cyprus mouflon" (''Ovis orientalis ophion'')</ref> They were later successfully introduced into continental [[Europe]], including [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Germany]], central [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Hungary]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], the [[Canary Islands]], and even some northern European countries such as [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]].

A small colony exists in the remote [[Kerguelen Islands]] in the southern [[Indian Ocean]], and on the [[Veliki Brijun]] Island in the [[Brijuni| Brijuni Archipelago]] of the [[Istrian Peninsula]] in [[Croatia]]. In [[South America]], mouflon have been introduced into central [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Mouflon hunting in Chile and Argentina |url=http://www.huntingchile16.50megs.com/about_11.html}}</ref> Since the 1980s, they have also been successfully introduced to game ranches in [[North America]] for the purpose of hunting; however, on game ranches, purebreds are rare, as mouflon interbreed with [[domestic sheep]] and [[Bighorn Sheep|bighorn sheep]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Mouflon have been introduced into the Hawaiian islands of Lanai and Hawaii as game animals, and a small population escaped from an animal enclosure owned by [[Thomas Watson, Jr.]] on the island of [[North Haven, Maine]] in the 1990s and still survive there.

Their normal habitats are steep mountainous woods near tree lines. In winter, they migrate to lower altitudes.<ref name= macdonald />

== Subspecies ==
[[Image:Ovis musimon 04.jpg|200px|thumb|Ewe]]
The scientific classification of the mouflon is disputed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Ovis_ammon.html |author= Tonda, J. |year=2002 |title=Ovis ammon |publisher= Animal Diversity Web |accessdate= November 19, 2005}}</ref> Five [[subspecies]] of mouflon are distinguished by [[Mammal Species of the World|MSW3]]:<ref name="Don E.

* The [[Iranian red sheep]] or Armenian mouflon, ''Ovis orientalis gmelini'' <span class="Person">(Blyth, 1851)</span>, northwestern Iran, eastern and central Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan. It has been introduced in Texas, USA.
* The [[European mouflon]], ''O. o. musimon'' <span class="Person">(Pallas, 1811)</span> was introduced about 7,000 years ago in Corsica and Sardinia for the first time. It has since been introduced in many parts of Europe.
* The [[Cypriot mouflon]], ''O. o. ophion'' <span class="Person">(Blyth, 1841)</span>, also called ''agrino'', from the Greek ''[[:el:??????|??????]]'' was nearly extirpated during the 20th century. In 1997, about 1,200 of this subspecies were counted. The television show ''[[Born to Explore with Richard Wiese]]'' reported 3,000 are now on the island.
* The [[Esfahan mouflon]], ''O. o. isphahanica'' <span class="Person">(Nasonov, 1910)</span>, is from the [[Zagros Mountains]], Iran.
* The [[Laristan mouflon]], ''O. o. laristanica'' <span class="Person">(Nasonov, 1909)</span>, is a small subspecies; its range is restricted to some desert reserves near [[Lar, Iran|Lar]] in southern Iran.

A mouflon was cloned successfully in early 2001 and lived at least seven months, making it the first clone of an endangered mammal to survive beyond infancy.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=11581663|year=2001|last1=Loi|first1=P|last2=Ptak|first2=G|last3=Barboni|first3=B|last4=Fulka Jr|first4=J|last5=Cappai|first5=P|last6=Clinton|first6=M|title=Genetic rescue of an endangered mammal by cross-species nuclear transfer using post-mortem somatic cells|volume=19|issue=10|pages=962–4|doi=10.1038/nbt1001-962|journal=Nature biotechnology}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/10/1025_TVsheepclone.html |author=Trivedi, Bijal P. |year=2001 |title=Scientists Clone First Endangered Species: a Wild Sheep |publisher=National Geographic Today |accessdate= February 21, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/10_01/cloned_sheep.shtml |author=Winstead E |date=October 12, 2001 |title=Endangered wild sheep clone reported to be healthy |publisher=Genome News Network |accessdate=April 10, 2007}}</ref> This demonstrated a common species (in this case, a domestic sheep) can successfully become a surrogate for the birth of an exotic animal such as the mouflon.

==Mouflon in culture==
* The mouflon were mentioned to be on Lincoln Island in [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''.
* The mouflon is featured on the symbol of [[Cyprus Airways]], as well as on the 1-, 2-, and 5-cent [[Cypriot euro coins]].
* The mouflon is featured both on the symbol and as the nickname of the [[Cyprus national rugby union team]].
* The mouflon is featured on the historic flag of the [[Armenia]]n [[Marz (country subdivision)|kingdom]] of [[Syunik (historic province)|Syunik]], as well as on the tombstones.
* The similarity of the mouflon to domestic sheep, combined with its threatened status, has made it a subject of interest, both scientific and popular, in the use of biotechnology in species preservation.<ref>''E.g.'' {{cite journal|pmid=11870088|year=2002|last1=Ptak|first1=G|last2=Clinton|first2=M|last3=Barboni|first3=B|last4=Muzzeddu|first4=M|last5=Cappai|first5=P|last6=Tischner|first6=M|last7=Loi|first7=P|title=Preservation of the wild European mouflon: The first example of genetic management using a complete program of reproductive biotechnologies|volume=66|issue=3|pages=796–801|journal=Biology of reproduction|doi=10.1095/biolreprod66.3.796}}</ref>

== Reproduction ==
Mouflon rams have a strict dominance hierarchy. Prior to mating season or “rut”, which is from late autumn to early winter , rams attempt to create a dominance hierarchy to determine access to ewes ( female Mouflon) for mating.  Mouflon rams participate in intrasexual competition in which, males fight one another to prove their dominance and get opportunity to females. Moulfons reach sexual maturity at the age of 2 to 4 years. Young rams need to prove  dominance before they get a chance to mate , which takes another 3 years for them to start mating.  Mouflon Ewes, also go through a similar hierarchy process , in terms of social status in the first 2 years. Pregnancy in females last 5 months, in which they produce 1 to 2 offspring.

'''''Portrait of an American Family''''' is the debut full-length studio album by American [[rock music|rock]] band [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]. It was released on July 19, 1994 in the US through [[Nothing Records|Nothing]] and [[Interscope Records]]. It was produced by the band's [[Marilyn Manson|frontman]] and [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]]. The album was initially known as ''The Manson Family Album'' – a direct reference to serial killer [[Charles Manson]]'s own band – but was retitled prior to release.

It is the first and only Marilyn Manson studio album that bassist [[Gidget Gein]] plays on. Gein was fired from the band after its production following a very public and destructive heroin addiction and [[Twiggy Ramirez]], the band's roadie and friend of Gein and Manson, was put as a temporary replacement while Gein got clean and sober. He eventually took over Gein's place and briefly adopted his image. Contrary to popular belief, Ramirez did not play bass on the album. Though [[Sara Lee Lucas]] was the featured drummer on the album, Nine Inch Nails live keyboardist [[Charlie Clouser]] used a drum machine to replace the work Lucas did. [[Daisy Berkowitz]] helped compose music for all of the songs except "Prelude (The Family Trip)" and "Sweet Tooth."

The album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] on May 29, 2003 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in the United States.<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=Portrait%20Of%20An%20American%20Family&artist=Marilyn%20Manson&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |title=RIAA Database Search for Marilyn Manson |publisher=''Recording Industry Association of America'' |date= |accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref> It spawned three singles ("[[Get Your Gunn]]", "[[Lunchbox (Marilyn Manson song)|Lunchbox]]" and "[[Dope Hat]]").

==Background==

===''The Manson Family Album''===
{{Quote box|quote="When we were finally finished, [[Roli Mosimann|Roli]] had done the opposite of what I'd expected. I thought he was going to bring out some sort of darker element. But he was trying to polish all the rough edges and make us more of a rock band, a pop band, which at the time I wasn't interested in at all. I thought the record we did with him came out bland and lifeless. [[Trent Reznor|Trent]] thought the same thing so he volunteered to help us repair what had been damaged."<ref name="TLHROH 144">{{harvnb|Manson|Strauss|1998|p=144}}</ref> |source=—Marilyn Manson discussing the aftermath of the album's initial recording sessions. |salign=center |width=25% |align=right |style=padding:8px;}}

Recording sessions for its national debut, ''Portrait of an American Family'', began in July 1993. Working with producer [[Roli Mosimann]] at [[Criteria Studios]] in [[Miami, Florida]],<ref name="TLHROH 144" /> the band recorded a selection of new songs along with reworked material from their Spooky Kids repertoire and, by the end of Autumn 1993, had completed the first version of their debut, a full album's worth of material collectively known as ''[[The Manson Family Album]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Manson|Strauss|1998|p=123}}</ref> At the time, "Snake Eyes and Sissies" was on track to be the band's first single, with a single edit having already been made. However the band was simply not satisfied with the output of these recording sessions and shelved the album for a short time.<ref>{{harvnb|Manson|Strauss|1998|p=128}}</ref>

Within a few months, the band convinced rising star [[Trent Reznor]] to produce the album instead.<ref>{{harvnb|Manson|Strauss|1998|p=134}}</ref> The abrasive sonic "rawness" that Mosimann's production had brought to such groups as [[Swans (band)|Swans]] had failed to materialize on ''The Manson Family Album''; Reznor and all the band's members thought it "sucked", and was poorly representative of Marilyn Manson's dynamic live performances.<ref name="TLHROH 144" /><ref name="MiamiNewTimes">{{cite news |title=Manson Family Values |first=Baker |last=Greg |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/issues/1994-07-20/music/music3.html |format=[[Tabloid (newspaper format)|Tabloid]] |newspaper=[[Miami New Times]] |publisher=[[Village Voice Media]], Inc. |date=1994-07-20 |page= |pages= |accessdate=2006-09-09}}</ref> In October 1993, Reznor agreed to fully commit to the project, taking them and their tapes to various studios in [[Los Angeles]]. With the help of Reznor and numerous live members of his band, [[Nine Inch Nails]], Marilyn Manson re-recorded and reworked their old material until they were satisfied and released it under the name ''Portrait of an American Family''.<ref name="ReganBooks. 1999. pp. 147">{{harvnb|Manson|Strauss|1998|p=147}}</ref> "Snake Eyes and Sissies" would never see a single release and in the album's credits Mosimann is credited as an engineer with no mention of his production work.

Years later, former guitarist [[Daisy Berkowitz]] was asked about these original recordings in an interview and gave the interviewer a cassette tape featuring the unused recordings. The interviewer then released them to the Internet where they are now widely available, usually labeled as ''Portrait of an American Family (Pre-Reznor Mix)'' or ''Portrait of an American Family Demos''.

===Track listing===
''The Manson Family Album'' is composed of the original takes and alternate mixes of songs that would later be found on the complete version of the band's debut and due to the many differences between it and its final form, can be considered an album unto itself. Aside from the major differences listed below, most songs presented on the two versions are essentially the same yet mixed differently or have different tempos. Because of this, different instruments are moved to the front or back of the mix and/or may be sped up or slowed down creating a different overall mood while leaving much of the composition the same. The following track list is taken from the order the songs appeared in on Berkowitz's cassette tape. It is unclear if this was intended to be the final track order.

====Differences from ''The Manson Family Album''====
There are many minor and major differences between ''Portrait of an American Family'' and its unreleased predecessor, ''The Manson Family Album'':

* "Prelude (The Family Trip)" is not present on the original album and was recorded solely for ''Portrait of an American Family''.

* "Snake Eyes and Sissies" is 62 seconds longer on the version that was finally released and featured extra alternate lyrics. It was also considered as a single and a radio edit was prepared for it that was never released.

* "[[Lunchbox (Marilyn Manson song)|Lunchbox]]" now contains an opening sample of a child saying "Next motherfucker's gonna get my metal" and an opening "bionic guitar" contributed by Reznor, but is otherwise the same.

* "[[Get Your Gunn]]" repeats the chorus and bridge more in the original version than in the released version and runs 50 seconds longer because of it.

* "Citronella" was later renamed to "Dogma" for its official release, though the two versions are close to the same.

* "Filth" is exclusive to the original release and was scrapped when the band changed producer.

* "Wrapped in Plastic" was not initially planned to be released and was recorded exclusively for ''Portrait of an American Family''.

* "Sweet Tooth" now contains 59 seconds of introductory ambient noise on the final mix.

* "My Monkey" has significantly more Charles Manson samples than the released mix (many from the initial demo versions) and some different horn sections in the background. Robert Pierce's singing is much clearer and placed higher in the mix on the original version as well. The original version lacks a chorus and uses the Manson samples where the chorus would later go.

==Themes==
The band's frontman has discussed his thoughts in retrospect on ''Portrait of an American Family'' with Empyrean Magazine, circa May/June 1995:

{{quote|Well, the whole point of [''Portrait of an American Family''] was that I wanted to say a lot of the things I've said in interviews [...] But I wanted to address the hypocrisy of talk show America, how morals are worn as a badge to make you look good and how it's so much easier to talk about your beliefs than to live up to them. I was very much wrapped up in the concept that as kids growing up, a lot of the things that we're presented with have deeper meanings than our parents would like us to see, like [[Willy Wonka]] and the [[Brothers Grimm]]. So what I was trying to point out was that when our parents hide the truth from us, it's more damaging than if they were to expose us to things like Marilyn Manson in the first place."<ref>{{harvnb|Manson|Strauss|1998|p=151}}</ref>}}

==Music==

===Songs===
"Cake and Sodomy" is the second track on the album. In 1990, Manson met a woman at a [[McDonald's]] restaurant in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] who invited him to spend a weekend with her in [[New York City]]. Upon discovering that the girl was using her sister's ID because she was too young to work, Manson abandoned her, shortly after which he ran into two clubbers from [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]]. Manson spent the remainder of his stay in New York at the clubbers' hotel room, where he stumbled on [[Public-access television]] [[cable television]] channels, which were "a completely new phenomenon" to him. Manson "spent hours flipping through the station, watching [[Pat Robertson]] preach about society's evils and then ask people to call him with their credit card number," while "on the other channel, a guy was greasing up his cock with [[Vaseline]] and asking people to call and give him their credit card number." This inspired Manson to grab the hotel notepad and begin penning the song's lyrics. Manson explains in his autobiography ''[[The Long Hard Road Out of Hell]]'' that "I had written other songs I thought were good, but "Cake and Sodomy" was more than just a good song. As an anthem for the hypocritical America slobbering on the tit of [[Christianity]], it was a blueprint for our future message."<ref>{{harvnb|Manson|Strauss|1998|p=95}}</ref>

"Lunchbox" is the second single and the third track of the album. It was inspired by a piece of legislation dating back to 1972, which makes it illegal to have metal lunchboxes in schools. The song tells the story of a school age child who is bullied and uses his own lunchbox as a weapon in retaliation, waiting for the day he can "grow up to be a big rock and roll star" who is never intimidated by others. The earliest recording of this song dates back to the band's ''After School Special'' cassette tape, released in December 1991. The album version of "Lunchbox" samples [[The Crazy World of Arthur Brown]] song "Fire".

"[[Dope Hat]]" is the third and final single and the sixth track of the album. The earliest recording of this song dates back to the band's ''The Family Jams'' cassette, released in 1992. Whilst the band's keyboardist [[Madonna Wayne Gacy]] was given a music credit for the song on ''Portrait of an American Family'', curiously his name is absent from the credits of ''The Family Jams'' and ''Refrigerator'', two cassettes a demo of "Dope Hat" had appeared on beforehand. The single's release was accompanied by a [[music video]] which featured Manson in the role of [[Willy Wonka]] in a shock-horror version of ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''.


"[[Get Your Gunn]]" is the first single and the seventh track of the album. The song was inspired by the [[Murder of David Gunn|abortion provider]] [[David Gunn (doctor)|David Gunn]] who was killed in Florida by a self-proclaimed [[Abortion debate|pro-life]] activist. The frontman later described his murder as "the ultimate hypocrisy I witnessed growing up: that these people killed someone in the name of being 'pro-life'".<ref name="RS Columbine: Whose Fault Is It?">{{cite journal |author= Marilyn Manson |title= Columbine: Whose Fault Is It? |format=op-ed essay |edition= |issue=815 |series= |volume= |date=1999-05-28 |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Wenner Media LLC}}</ref>

"Wrapped in Plastic" is the eighth track on the album. The earliest recording of this song dates back to the band's ''Refrigerator'' cassette tape, released in 1993. It recycles lyrics from an earlier Spooky Kids song, "I.V.-T.V.". The frontman has stated that "Wrapped in Plastic" is about his past at his grandfather's basement. The version on ''[[The Family Jams (Marilyn Manson album)|The Family Jams]]'' cassette gives the listener better detail of this fact.

"Sweet Tooth" is the tenth song on the album, and the only song that former bassist [[Gidget Gein]] wrote both guitar and bass parts for. However, of all the album tracks, "Sweet Tooth" was the only one not regularly played live.

"Snake Eyes and Sissies" is the eleventh track on the album. Though "Snake Eyes and Sissies" was once considered important enough to be a potential single, it was never given a proper release and has not been played by the band since the [[Smells Like Children Tour]] in 1995/1996.

"My Monkey" is the twelfth track on the album. Several verses were taken from "Mechanical Man" written and performed by Charles Manson in 1968; the lyrics of "My Monkey" are credited simply to "Manson". The earliest recording of this song dates back to the band's ''The Beaver Meat Cleaver Beat'' cassette tape, released in 1990.

"Misery Machine" is the thirteenth and final track on the album, and is a direct reference to the Mystery Machine from the animated television series ''[[Scooby-Doo]]''. Imagery from the cartoon was prevalent in the early years of the band, having been used in various flyers among other similar cartoon characters.

===Samples===
{{Quote box|quote="One strange thing that happened was we were mixing the song "Wrapped in Plastic". [...] We were using a computer because we had a lot of samples and sequencing. While we were working on that song the [[Charles Manson]] samples from "My Monkey" started appearing in the mix. All of a sudden we'd hear in the song, 'Why does a child reach up and kill his mom and dad?' And we couldn't figure what was going on. The chorus of "Wrapped in Plastic" is, 'Come into our home/Won't you stay?' And we're in the [[Sharon Tate]] [[10050 Cielo Drive, Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles|house]], just me and [[Sean Beavan]] [the record's assistant producer]. We totally got scared and we're like, 'We are done for the night.' We came back the next day and it was fine. The Charles Manson samples weren't even on the tape anymore. There's no real logical or technological explanation for why they appeared. It was a truly [[supernatural]] moment that freaked me out.<ref name="ReganBooks. 1999. pp. 147"/> |source=—Marilyn Manson discussing [[paranormal]] behavior during the album's production. |salign=center |width=40% |align=right |style=padding:8px;}}

''Portrait of an American Family'' contains an especially wide array of cultural references:

* The poem recited in "Prelude (The Family Trip)" comes from [[Roald Dahl|Roald Dahl's]] book ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''. Also, the printing of the Marilyn Manson logo on various promotional items during this time, the opening titles of the "[[Dope Hat]]" music video, and the remix album ''[[Smells Like Children]]'' resemble the printing of the title to the [[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory|1971 film version]] of the novel.

* The words "Go on and smile, you cunt!" at the beginning of "Cake and Sodomy" are spoken by [[Marlon Brando]] in the film ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]''.

* "Lunchbox" contains the sample "I bring you fire!" from the song "[[Fire (Arthur Brown song)|Fire]]" by [[The Crazy World of Arthur Brown]].

* "Organ Grinder" features the sample "Lollipops for the kiddie winkies," spoken by the [[Child Catcher]] from the film ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]''.

* At the start of "Cyclops" there is a very slowed down and distorted sample of the preacher from ''[[Poltergeist II: The Other Side]]'' singing "God is in His holy temple".

* "[[Dope Hat]]" contains the samples "The great Hoodoo!", and "Prepare to meet your doom" taken from the [[Sid and Marty Krofft]] cult television series ''[[Lidsville]]''. These words are spoken by the actor [[Charles Nelson Reilly]].

* After the third verse of "[[Get Your Gunn]]", there is a sample of a crowd murmuring and a gunshot. This is the audio from the press conference in which [[Budd Dwyer]] committed suicide in front of a live audience.

* "Wrapped in Plastic" is influenced by the pilot episode of [[David Lynch]]'s television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', referencing the image of character [[Laura Palmer]] wrapped in plastic, which was one of the show's most enduring images. It also featured the distorted words "Hallelujah", "Come here, Laura", and "Meanwhile" from the scenes with [[The Man from Another Place]] in the [[Black and White Lodge]]. This is followed by Palmer's distinctive scream.

* In the song "Dogma", there is a sample from the [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] film ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', when [[Mink Stole]]'s character says "Burn, you fucker!" before setting fire to a trailer. Although the clip from ''[[Desperate Living]]'' is credited in the liner notes, this audio clip is not. Furthermore, Waters was thanked in the liner notes.

* "Killing is killing, whether done for duty, profit or fun" is a quote by [[Richard Ramirez]] taken from a court appearance that is an audio clip at the start of "Snake Eyes and Sissies".

* The introduction to "My Monkey" contains multiple Charles Manson interview audio clips. The first of these is "Why are the children doing what they're doing? Why does a child reach up and kill his mom and dad and murder his two little sisters and then cut his throat?" in the beginning, and both "Raise up children, kill your moms and dads?" and "Where nothing is real but the medication and their numbers and then they cut their wrists and write 'I love you God' all over the walls and hang themselves on the ventilators." during the song's ending.

* The phrase "We're gonna ride to the Abbey of Thelema" in the song "Misery Machine" is a reference to [[Aleister Crowley]]'s Abbey of Thelema, which was used as the Headquarters from which the doctrines of [[Thelema]] would be spread throughout the world. The song also contains a sample from "Beep Beep" by [[The Playmates]]. A few seconds after the track, the sample, "Go home to your mother! Doesn't she ever watch you!? Tell her this isn't some [[Communism|Communist]] daycare center! Tell your mother I hate her! Tell your mother I hate you!" is spoken by Stole from the Waters film ''Desperate Living''. After this, a telephone can be heard ringing very quietly for several minutes, which is then followed by an irate answering machine message, presumably from a mother of a Manson fan.

==Promotion==
To promote the album, Interscope held two separate release parties for music journalists and fan club members – the first of these was held less than a month before its commercial release in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] on June 29, 1994, whilst the second took place a day before the record's scheduled date in [[Plantation, Florida]] on July 18, 1994.

==Release==

===Singles===

''Portrait of an American Family'' was anchored by two singles, "[[Get Your Gunn]]" and "Lunchbox", along with "[[Dope Hat]]" which was issued to radio and music video channels without a commercial single release. A total of three singles were spawned from the album.

The music video for "Get Your Gunn", directed by Rod Chong, features the band performing in a damp "attic-like" scene, intertwined by footage of two feisty teenage girls. It did not receive much airplay.

The music video for "Lunchbox" directed by [[Richard Kern]], features a boy being bullied by two older students. The boy goes home, fed up with the way he is treated, and shaves his head into a [[mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] hairstyle and prepares for any future retaliation against the bullies with his metal lunchbox. The boy later goes to the rollerskating rink where the band is performing. The boy gives Manson his lunchbox, which Manson lights on fire and parades around. The video ends with the boy staring into the burning lunchbox. It is one of the few music videos with Manson performing without wearing makeup, alongside "Get Your Gunn" and "[[Tourniquet (Marilyn Manson song)|Tourniquet]]".

The music video for "Dope Hat", directed by [[Tom Stern (director)|Tom Stern]], features the band riding a boat through a psychedelic tunnel directly inspired by the 1971 film ''Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory'', which happens to be one of Manson's favorite films. In the video, the band members perform with many children and people resembling the Oompa-Loompas from the film aboard the boat.

===Cover and packaging===
{{Quote box|quote="I wanted to use a photo in [the album]'s booklet of me naked on a couch when I was a kid. When you hold up something to people, usually what they see in it is what's inside them in the first place. And that's what happened because the lawyers at [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] said, 'First off, that picture's going to be considered [[child pornography]], and not only will no stores carry the album but we're subject to legal retribution from it.' They said if a judge were to look at it, the law states that if a photograph of a minor elicits sexual excitement then it's considered child pornography. I said, 'That's exactly my point. This is a photograph that was taken by my mother, and it's extremely innocent and very normal. But if you see it as pornography, why am I the guilty person? You're the person who's got a hard-on. Why aren't '''you''' punished? That's still a point I'd like to make. People's morality is so ridiculous: If they get excited by it, then it's wrong."<ref name="ReganBooks. 1999. pp. 150">{{harvnb|Manson|Strauss|1998|p=150}}</ref> |source=—Marilyn Manson discussing Interscope's objection to his initial vision of the album's cover art. |width=40% |align=left |style=padding:8px;}}

The album's original cover art featured no text, simply a painting of a clown by [[John Wayne Gacy]]. The interior photography included [[Instant film|Polaroid]] pictures (faked by Manson and friends) apparently of a mutilated female body, and a photo of what Manson described as "one of those dolls from the '60s and you pull a string on the back of it and the eyes get really big and they change colors."<ref name="ReganBooks. 1999. pp. 150"/>

In the early stages of the album's conception, Manson intended to use a picture of himself as a child sitting nude on a couch in the album's interior artwork. Though no [[genitalia]] is shown in the picture, and it was taken by his own parents with no vulgar intent, the label rejected the idea on the grounds that it could constitute as [[child pornography]], so Manson instead created the clay sculpture present on the final cover artwork of the album. On the table on this sculpture, there are little models of [[The Beatles]] next to the lamp. The boy in the photograph on the back cover is Ramirez's half-brother Wes Brown. He's holding an ear-piercing needle rather than a syringe. ''Portrait of an American Family'' is notable for being the band's only studio album not to feature an image of Manson on the cover. However, Manson did eventually use a nude photo of himself as an adult for the inside flap photo for the [[CD single]] for "Lunchbox" but did not expose his genitals.

By the time the album became ''Portrait of an American Family'', the ideas of using Gacy's clown artwork and the nude photograph was dropped completely.

Upon its release, the album met with mixed reviews from music critics. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[allmusic]] gave the album a favorable review but noted that "even a few years on from its 1994 release, ''Portrait of an American Family'' began to sound a little dated, especially since its [[Nine Inch Nails]]-meets-[[W.A.S.P.]]-meets-[[Alice Cooper]] formula was fully realized on Manson's follow-up album, ''[[Antichrist Superstar]]''. Here, it's in sketch form, and by the end of the album it's clear that Warner, Manson, whatever you want to call him, needs a full canvas to truly wreak havoc."<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|last=Erlewine |first= Stephen Thomas|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=portrait-of-an-american-family-r204446/review|pure_url=yes}} |title=Portrait of an American Family review |work=[[allmusic]] |publisher=All Media Guide (Rovi) |date= |accessdate=2011-06-28}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album a negative review and said that "Manson's debut [...] isn't the sharply rendered cultural critique of America he'd like you to think it is.

==Re-Release==

===2009===
In late 2009, it was re-released by Interscope and sold through [[Hot Topic]] stores as a special edition boxset combination of a T-shirt bearing the album artwork and colored vinyl LP record of the album. The color of the disc is green, matching most of the bands fonts at the time of the albums original 1994 release, however this reissue featured some imagery from ''[[The High End of Low]]'' on its label, much to the dismay of fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00336KECM |title=Portrait of an American Family <nowiki>[Limited Edition Vinyl Box set with T-Shirt]</nowiki> |publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon]] |accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref>

==Portrait of an American Family Tour==
[[File:Marilyn Manson at 1994 Slammie Awards.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jeordie White|Twiggy Ramirez]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] performing at the ''Slammie Awards'' show at The Edge in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], USA on July 3, 1994.]]
Nine Inch Nails' [[Self Destruct Tour]] was the first tour Marilyn Manson embarked on, now under management of major record label Interscope Records. They were an opening act for Nine Inch Nails. The band was on the tour from April 24, 1994 until December 11, 1994.

The Portrait of an American Family Tour was the second tour Marilyn Manson embarked on. It was also the band's first headlining tour under a major label. The band was on the tour from December 27, 1994 until March 11, 1995. During these concerts, the stage usually was arranged like a living room, much like the one on the album cover artwork. A table with a lamp, candy canes and multiple six-sided dice were the most commonly seen props.

They were named so because [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry]] publicly endorsed the code,<ref>Harris, Brian (2008) ''Intolerance: divided societies on trial'' p.182.

In popular culture the term is sometimes used to refer to a sense of [[Sportsmanship|sportsmanship and fair play]].

==History==
The boxing code was written by [[John Graham Chambers]], a Welshman, and drafted in London in 1865, before being published in 1867 as "the Queensberry rules for the sport of boxing".<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Queensberry_Rules.aspx#1-1O214:QueensberryRules-full "Queensberry Rules"] at ''The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable''</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Baker |first= William Joseph | title= Sports in the Western World | year=1998 | url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rkuAiv3LoR4C&pg=PA172&dq=queensbury+rules&hl=en&ei=fTYCTYTDDoOEOsKotKYB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&q=queensbury%20rules&f=false | accessdate= 2010-12-10}}</ref> This code of rules superseded the [[Revised London Prize Ring rules]] (1853), which had themselves replaced the original [[London Prize Ring rules]] (1743) of [[Jack Broughton]]. This version persuaded boxers that "you must not fight simply to win; no holds barred is not the way; you must win by the rules".<ref>17, sect. 5, pt. 1</ref>

One early prize fighter who fought under Marquess of Queensberry rules was [[Jem Mace]], former English heavyweight champion, who defeated Bill Davis in [[Virginia City, Nevada]] under these rules in 1876. In 1889, the Queensberry rules came into use in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite journal| work=[[Black Belt (magazine)|Black Belt]] |date= October 1999| accessdate= 10 December 2010}}</ref>

==Rules==

# To be a fair stand-up boxing match in a 24-foot ring, or as near that size as practicable.
# No wrestling or hugging allowed.
# The rounds to be of three minutes' duration, and one minute's time between rounds.
# If either man falls through weakness or otherwise, he must get up unassisted, 10 seconds to be allowed him to do so, the other man meanwhile to return to his corner, and when the fallen man is on his legs the round is to be resumed and continued until the three minutes have expired. If one man fails to come to the scratch in the 10 seconds allowed, it shall be in the power of the referee to give his award in favour of the other man.
# A man hanging on the ropes in a helpless state, with his toes off the ground, shall be considered down.
# No seconds or any other person to be allowed in the ring during the rounds.
# Should the contest be stopped by any unavoidable interference, the referee to name the time and place as soon as possible for finishing the contest; so that the match must be won and lost, unless the backers of both men agree to draw the stakes.
# The gloves to be fair-sized boxing gloves of the best quality and new.
# Should a glove burst, or come off, it must be replaced to the referee's satisfaction.
# A man on one knee is considered down and if struck is entitled to the stakes.
# That no shoes or boots with spikes or sprigs be allowed.
# The contest in all other respects to be governed by revised London Prize Ring Rules.

==Differences From Modern Rules==

Current modern rules per the [[Association of Boxing Commissions]] are as follows.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Boxing Match===

A boxing match  consists of a determined number of three-minute rounds, a total of up to 12 rounds (formerly 15). A minute is typically spent between each round with the fighters in their assigned corners receiving advice and attention from their coaches. The fight is controlled by a referee who works in the ring to judge and control the fight rule on the ability of the fighters to fight safely, count knocked-down fighters, and rule on fouls. There are three judges at ringside to score the fight and assign points to the boxers, based on punches that connect, defense,knockdowns, and other, more subjective, measures. Because of the open-ended style of boxing judging, many fights have controversial results. Each fighter has an assigned corner of the ring, where his or her coach, as well as one or more “seconds” may administer to the fighter at the beginning of the fight and between rounds.

Each boxer enters into the ring from their assigned corners at the beginning of each round and must cease fighting and return to their corner at the signaled end of each round.

===Deciding the Winner===

If the fight goes to the conclusion of the scheduled number of rounds without a stoppage, the fighter with the higher score at the end of the fight is ruled the winner and the three judges rule it as, a. unanimous decision  b. split decision and c. draws. A boxer may win the bout before a decision is reached through a knockout.

===Win by Knockout (KO)===

If a fighter is knocked down during the fight, determined by whether the boxer touches the canvas floor of the ring with any part of their body other than the feet as a result of the opponent’s punch and not slip, as determined by the referee, the referee begins counting until the fighter returns to his or her feet and can continue. Should the referee count to ten, then the knocked-down boxer is ruled “knocked out” (whether unconscious or not) and the other boxer is ruled the winner by knockout (KO).

===Win by Technical Knockout (TKO)===

A “technical knockout” (TKO) is possible as well, and is ruled by the referee, fight doctor, or a fighter’s corner if a fighter is unable to safely continue to fight, based upon injuries or being judged unable to effectively defend themselves. There is also the “three-knockdown rule”, in which three knockdowns in a given round result in a TKO. A TKO is considered a knockout in a fighter’s record.

===Standing Eight Count===

A “standing eight” count rule may also be in effect. This gives the referee the right to step in and administer a count of eight to a fighter that he feels may be in danger, even if no knockdown has taken place. After counting the referee will observe the fighter, and decide if he is fit to continue. For scoring purposes, a standing eight count is treated as a knockdown.

===Violations===

Violations of these boxing rules may be ruled a “foul” by the referee, who may issue warnings, deduct points, or disqualify an offending boxer, causing an automatic loss, depending on the seriousness and intentionality of the foul. An intentional foul that causes injury that prevents a fight from continuing usually causes the boxer who committed it to be disqualified. A fighter who suffers an accidental low-blow may be given up to five minutes to recover, after which they may be ruled knocked out if they are unable to continue. Accidental fouls that cause injury ending a bout may lead to a “no contest” result, or else cause the fight to go to a decision if enough rounds (typically four or more, or at least three in a four-round fight) have passed.

===Other Rules===

Boxers are prohibited from hitting below the belt, holding, tripping, pushing, biting, spitting on or wrestling their opponent. The boxer’s shorts are raised so the opponent is not allowed to strike the groin area. They also are prohibited from kicking, head-butting, or hitting with any part of the arm other than the knuckles of a closed fist (including hitting with the elbow, shoulder or forearm, as well as with open gloves, the wrist, the inside, back or side of the hand). They are prohibited as well from hitting the back, the back of the neck or head (commonly called a “rabbit-punch”) or the kidneys. They are prohibited from holding the ropes for support when punching, holding an opponent while punching, or ducking below the belt of their opponent (dropping below the waist of your opponent, no matter the distance between). If a “clinch” – a defensive move in which a boxer wraps his or her opponents arms and holds on to create a pause – is broken by the referee, each fighter must take a full step back before punching again (alternatively, the referee may direct the fighters to “punch out” of the clinch). When a boxer is knocked down, the other boxer must immediately cease fighting and move to the furthest neutral corner of the ring until the referee has either ruled a knockout or called for the fight to continue.

The '''Countess Pillar''' is a 17th-century [[monument]] near [[Brougham, Cumbria]], [[England]], between [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] and [[Appleby-in-Westmorland|Appleby]]. It is two miles east of Penrith on the [[A66 road (England)|A66]]. The square top of the pillar is brightly painted and carries [[sundial]]s on its sides.
It was erected by [[Lady Anne Clifford]] in 1656 to mark the place where she said goodbye for the last time to her mother, [[Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland]].<ref>[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/countess-pillar-brougham/history-and-research/ The history of the Countess Pillar], English Heritage</ref><ref>Jean Wilson, "The Countess' Pillar, Westmoreland", ''History Today'', Vol. 48, July 1998</ref>

Anne Clifford, countess of Pembroke, Dorset and Montgomery (1590-1676), spent much of her life in a long and complex legal battle to obtain the rights of her inheritance. Her mother was one of the few people who supported Anne's claim to the family estates.  In 1616 Anne travelled north to see 'her' estates and visit her mother at [[Brougham Castle]]. On her departure from the castle, Anne travelled with her mother a quarter of a mile to where the castle drive meets the main road, where they had "a grievous and heavy parting". Margaret died a month later. <ref>[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/people-and-places/womens-history/anne-clifford/ Lady Anne Clifford's story], English Heritage</ref>
The inscription on the pillar describes Anne as "Sole Heire" of her father [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland|George Earl of Cumberland]]".  It also refers to a bequest in memory of Margaret which was made to the poor of the parish of Brougham.<ref>[http://www.visitcumbria.com/pen/countess-pillar/ Countess Pillar page on Visit Cumbria]</ref> This is commemorated annually on 2nd April.<ref>{{cite web|title=Benefice Profile: Clifton & Brougham and Lowther & Askham in the Diocese of Carlisle|url=http://www.carlislediocese.org.uk/uploads/1205/013_Clifton_etc_Benefice_Profile_2012-pdf.html|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Cumberland and Westmorland Herald]]|date=4 April 2014|url=http://cwherald.com/a/archive/annual-dole-ceremony.425152.html|title=Annual dole ceremony}}</ref>

==Origin of the name==
Some natives stress the second syllable (de-ZERT), in the French fashion, although many others pronounce it in a fashion similar to the English name of a landscape devoid of vegetation (DEH-zert). French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]]'s observation that the summits of the island's mountains were free of vegetation as seen from the sea led him to call the island "île des Monts Déserts", or island of the Bare Mountains.

According to Acadia National Park movies shown to the public in the park's visitor center, the name means "Isle of the lonely mountains" because when you are out to sea, and approaching land, the mountain tops appear alone before any other land.

==Towns and villages==
There are four towns on Mount Desert Island:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acadiamagic.com/MountDesert.html |title=Acadiamagic.com |publisher=Acadiamagic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref>

* [[Mount Desert, Maine|Mount Desert]], with the villages of Hall Quarry, [[Northeast Harbor, Maine|Northeast Harbor]], Otter Creek, Pretty Marsh, Seal Harbor, and Somesville;
* [[Southwest Harbor, Maine|Southwest Harbor]], with the villages of Manset and Seawall;
* [[Tremont, Maine|Tremont]], with the villages of [[Bass Harbor, Maine|Bass Harbor]], Bernard, Gotts Island, Seal Cove, and West Tremont.

==History==
[[File:Mount Desert Island.JPG|thumb|left|View of the coast]]

Deep shell heaps indicate [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] encampments dating back 6,000&nbsp;years in Acadia National Park, but prehistoric records are scanty. The first written descriptions of Maine coast Indians, recorded 100&nbsp;years after European trade contacts began, describe American Indians who lived off the land by hunting, fishing, collecting [[shellfish]], and gathering plants and berries. The [[Abenaki|Wabanaki Indian]]s knew Mount Desert Island as Pemetic, "the sloping land". They built bark-covered conical shelters, and traveled in exquisitely designed [[birch]] bark [[canoes]]. Historical notes record that the Wabanaki wintered in interior forests and spent their summers near the coast. Archeological evidence suggests the opposite pattern; in order to avoid harsh inland winters and to take advantage of [[salmon]] runs upstream, American Indians wintered on the coast and summered inland.<ref>For a freely accessible digital text on Wabanaki culture and history, see ''Asticou's Island Domain: Wabanaki Peoples at Mount Desert Island 1500–2000'', by Harald E.L. Prins and Bunny McBride (National Park Service, 2007). [http://www.nps.gov/acad/historyculture/ethnography.htm NPS.gov]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/acad/historyculture/stories.htm |title=NPS history |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref>

===French colony===
The first meeting between the people of Pemetic and the Europeans is a matter of conjecture. But it was a Frenchman, [[Samuel de Champlain]], who made the first important contribution to the historical record of Mount Desert Island. Champlain led an expedition from the [[Saint Croix Island, Maine#St. Croix Settlement|St. Croix Settlement]]. He was tasked with exploring the coast in a [[patache]] with twelve sailors and two American Indian guides. They were in search of a mythical walled and wealthy American Indian city named [[Norumbega]]. On September 6, 1604 the expedition crossed [[Frenchman Bay]] and sailed towards Otter Creek, where smoke could be seen rising from an American Indian encampment. During high tide the ship hit a ledge off Otter Cliff and while repairing a hole two American Indians boarded the ship as guides.<ref name=morison>{{cite book|last1=Morison|first1=Samuel Eliot|title=The Story of Mount Desert Island|date=1960|publisher=Little, Brown & Company|location=Boston|pages=8–9}}</ref>

It is not clear whether Champlain sailed around the Island or was informed by the guides, but on that day, he wrote in his journal, "Le sommet de la plus part d’icelles est desgarny d’arbres parceque ce ne sont que roches. Je l’ay nommée l’Isle des Monts-déserts", which translates to "The mountain summits are all bare and rocky. I name it Isles des Monts Desert."<ref>{{cite book |title=Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |last= Stewart|first=George |authorlink=George R. Stewart |year=1945 |publisher= Random House|location=New York |pages= 29, 30}}</ref>

====Raid on Mount Desert Island (1613)====
[[File:Somes Sound Mount Desert Island.JPG|thumb|[[Somes Sound]]]]
In 1613, French [[Jesuit]]s, welcomed by Indians, established the first French mission in America—Saint Sauveur Mission—on what is now Fernald Point, near the entrance to [[Somes Sound]]. (St. Sauveur Mountain overlooking the point still bears the name of the mission.)

The French missionaries began to build a fort, plant their corn, and baptize the natives. Two months later, on 2 July 1613, Captain [[Samuel Argall]] of [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] arrived on board the ''Treasurer'' and destroyed their mission.<ref>Acadia National Park, Maine: Significance of St. Sauveur Mission, Established 1613, Mount Desert Island. Washington, D.C.: Office of History and Historic Architecture, Eastern Service Center, National Park Service, November 1970.</ref> Three of the missionaries were killed and three were wounded. The rest of the company, some twenty in all, were taken prisoner. Argall took many of the prisoners to [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]. He eventually returned to Saint-Sauveur and cut down the cross the Jesuits had planted, replacing it with a Protestant version. He then set fire to the few buildings that were there.<ref name="Griffiths, E 2005. pp. 23-24">Griffiths, E. ''From Migrant to Acadian''. McGill-Queen's University Press. 2005. pp. 23-24.</ref> He then went on to burn the remaining French buildings on [[St. Croix Island]] and [[Port Royal, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Port Royal, Nova Scotia]].<ref name="Griffiths, E 2005. pp. 23-24"/>

The English raid at Fernald Point signaled the dispute over the boundary between the French colony of [[Acadia]] to the north and the English colony of [[New England]] to the south. There is evidence that [[Claude de Saint-Étienne de la Tour|Claude de La Tour]] immediately challenged the English action by re-establishing a fur-trading post in the nearby village of [[Castine, Maine|Castine]] in the wake of Argall's raid.<ref>Griffiths, E. ''From Migrant to Acadian''. McGill-Queen's University Press. 2005. p. 31</ref>

There was a brief period when it seemed Mount Desert would again become a center of French activity. In 1688, [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac]], an ambitious young man who had immigrated to New France and bestowed upon himself the title ''Sieur de&nbsp;la Mothe Cadillac'', asked for and received {{convert|100000|acre|km2}} of land along the Maine coast, including all of Mount Desert. Cadillac's hopes of establishing a feudal estate in the New World, however, were short-lived. Although he and his bride resided here for a time, they soon abandoned their enterprise. Cadillac later gained lasting recognition as the founder of [[Detroit]]. The island's highest point, at {{convert|1528|ft}} the highest point on the eastern seaboard of the [[United States]], bears the name [[Cadillac Mountain]], and is notable for the fact that its summit is among the first points in the United States touched by the rays of the rising sun.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=6820 |name=Katahdin, Maine |accessdate=2010-06-16}} Analysis by Blanton C. Wiggin, published in the January 1972 issue of ''[[Yankee Magazine|Yankee]]'' magazine, determined that the first sunrise in the U.S. occurs at [[Cadillac Mountain]] in the fall and winter, from October&nbsp;7 to March&nbsp;6.</ref>

====Raid on Acadia (1704)====
[[File:Mount Desert Island, Maine.jpg|thumb|Shorefront at evening]]
During much of the seventeenth century, nearby [[Castine, Maine|Castine]] was the most southern settlement of Acadia. ([[Bristol, Maine]], was the most northern New England settlement.) No one settled in this contested territory, and for the next 150&nbsp;years Mount Desert Island's importance was primarily its use as a landmark for seamen, as for example when [[John Winthrop]], first governor of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], sketched the island's mountains on his voyage to the New World.

During [[Queen Anne's War]], in response to the French [[Raid on Deerfield]], New Englander Major [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] raided the Acadian village of Castine before gathering at Mount Desert Island with other ships to continue with the Raid on [[St. Stephen, New Brunswick|St. Stephen]], [[Raid on Grand Pré]], the [[Military history of the Mi’kmaq people#Raids on Piziquid (Fort Edward)|Raid on Piziquid]], and the Raid on [[Isthmus of Chignecto|Chignecto]].<ref>Benjamin Church, Thomas Church, Samuel Gardner Drake. ''The history of King Philip's war ; also of expeditions against the French and Indians in its Eastern parts of New England, in the years 1689, 1692, i696 AND 1704. With some account of the divine providence towards Col. Benjamin Church.'' p. 261</ref>

===British colony===
In 1759, after a century and a half of conflict, British troops triumphed in [[Quebec]], ending French dominion in [[Acadia]]. With Indians scattered and the [[fleur-de-lis]] banished, lands along the Maine coast opened for English settlement. Governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]] of Massachusetts obtained a royal land grant on Mount Desert Island. In 1760, Bernard attempted to secure his claim by offering free land to settlers. [[Abraham Somes]] and James Richardson accepted the offer and settled their families at what is now Somesville.

===American Revolution===
The onset of the [[American Revolutionary War]] ended Bernard's plans for Mount Desert Island. In its aftermath, Bernard, who had sided with the British government, lost his claim. Massachusetts, now free of British rule, granted the western half of Mount Desert Island to John Bernard, son of the governor, who, unlike his father, sided with the rebels. The eastern half of the island was granted to Marie Therese de&nbsp;Gregoire, granddaughter of Cadillac. Bernard and de&nbsp;Gregoire soon sold their landholdings to nonresident landlords.

Their real estate transactions probably made very little difference to the increasing number of settlers homesteading on Mount Desert Island. By 1820, when Maine separated from Massachusetts and became a separate state, farming and lumbering vied with fishing and shipbuilding as major occupations. Settlers converted hundreds of acres of trees into wood products ranging from [[schooner]]s and barns to baby cribs and hand tools. Farmers harvested wheat, rye, corn, and potatoes. By 1850, the familiar sights of fishermen and sailors, fish racks and [[shipyard]]s, revealed a way of life linked to the sea. [[Quarry]]ing of [[granite]], which could be cut from hills close to deep water anchorage for shipment to major cities on the east coast, was also a major industry.

==Rusticators==
It was the outsiders, artists and journalists, who revealed and popularized this island to the world in the mid 19th&nbsp;century. Painters of the [[Hudson River School]], including [[Thomas Cole]] and [[Frederic Church]], glorified Mount Desert Island with their brushstrokes, inspiring patrons and friends to flock here. These were the "rusticators". Undaunted by crude accommodations and simple food, they sought out local fishermen and farmers to put them up for a modest fee. Summer after summer, the rusticators returned to renew friendships with local islanders and, most of all, to savor the fresh salt air, beautiful scenery, and relaxed pace. Soon the villagers' cottages and fishermen's huts filled to overflowing, and by 1880, 30&nbsp;hotels competed for vacationers' dollars. Tourism was becoming the major industry.

For a select handful of Americans, the 1880s and the "Gay Nineties" meant affluence on a scale without precedent. Mount Desert, still remote from the cities of the East, became a retreat for prominent people of the time. The [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]], [[J. P. Morgan|Morgan]]s, [[Ford family tree|Fords]], [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]], [[Andrew Carnegie|Carnegies]], and [[Astor family|Astors]], chose to spend their summers here. Not content with the simple lodgings then available, these families transformed the landscape of Mount Desert Island with elegant estates, ironically called "cottages". The landscape architect [[Beatrix Farrand]], at the Cadwalder Rawle - Rhinelander Jones family summer home [[Reef Point Estate]], designed the gardens for many of these people. Projects included the Chinese inspired garden at "The Eyrie" for [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]] at [[Seal Harbor, Maine|Seal Harbor]] (1926–35), and the planting plans for subtle roads at [[Acadia National Park]] sponsored by [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] (c.1930).<ref>Nolan, David,  ''Beatrix. The Gardening Life of Beatrix Farrand, 1872–1959''. Viking, Penguin Group, 1995. ISBN 0-670-83217-0. pp. 208</ref> Luxury, refinement, and ostentatious gatherings replaced buckboard rides, picnics, and day-long hikes of an earlier era. Some rusticators also formed "Village Improvement Societies" which constructed hiking trails and walking paths connecting the Island's villages to its interior mountains. For over 40&nbsp;years, the wealthy held sway at Mount Desert, but the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] marked the end of such extravagance. The final blow came in 1947 when a fire of monumental proportions consumed many of the great estates.

==Acadia National Park==
In 1901, George B. Dorr, disturbed by the growing development of the Bar Harbor area and the dangers he foresaw in the newly invented gasoline powered portable sawmill, established along with others the Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservations. The corporation, whose sole purpose was to preserve land for the perpetual use of the public, acquired {{convert|6000|acre|km2}} by 1913. Dorr offered the land to the federal government, and in 1916, President Wilson announced the creation of Sieur de&nbsp;Monts National Monument. Dorr continued to acquire property and renewed his efforts to obtain full national park status for his beloved preserve. In 1919, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] signed the act establishing Lafayette National Park, the first national park east of the Mississippi. Dorr, whose labors constituted "the greatest of one-man shows in the history of land conservation", became the first park superintendent. In 1929, the park name was changed to [[Acadia National Park]].

[[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] endowed the park with much of its land area. Like many rusticators, Rockefeller, whose family fortune was derived from the petroleum industry, wanted to keep the island free of automobiles; but local governments allowed the entry of automobiles on the island's roads. Rockefeller constructed approximately {{convert|50|mi|-1}} of carriage roads around the eastern half of the island. These roads were closed to automobiles and included many scenic vistas and beautiful stone bridges. Approximately {{convert|40|mi}} of these roads are within Acadia National Park and open only to hikers, bicyclists, horseback riders, horse-drawn carriages and cross country skiers.

In 1950, [[Marguerite Yourcenar]] and Grace Frick bought a house, "Petite Plaisance", in [[Northeast Harbor]] on the island. Yourcenar wrote a large part of her novel ''[[Memoires d'Hadrien]]'' on the island, and she died there in 1987.<ref>George Rousseau, "Yourcenar", 2004.</ref> Their house is now a museum. Both ladies were cremated and their ashes are buried in the Brookside Cemetery in [[Somesville]].

In 1969, [[College of the Atlantic]], the island's first and only institution of higher education, was established in Bar Harbor.

In 1986, Friends of Acadia, the nonprofit organization that directs private philanthropy and volunteerism for the benefit of Acadia National Park, was founded.

==Geology==
[[File:Cadillac mtn summit view.jpg|thumb|View atop [[Cadillac Mountain]]]]
Mount Desert Island is rich in geological history dating back to approximately 550 million years ago. The earliest formation on the island is the Ellsworth Schist Formation, which was a sea-floor mud deposit created during the [[Cambrian]] period by volcanic ash. During the [[Ordovician]] period the collision of [[Laurentia]], [[Gondwanaland]], and [[Avalonia]], referred to as the [[Acadian orogeny]], caused the formation to fold, thrust, and uplift above sea level, where later layers were eroded away and the schist was exposed. The Bar Harbor Formation, which is made up predominantly of sands and silts, and Cranberry Island Formation, made up from volcanic ash and magmatic debris, occurred under similar circumstances in the [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]] periods, and were deposited on top of the Ellsworth Schist. However, due to less tectonic activity at that time, their deformation was less severe.<ref>Gilman, R.A., Chapman, C.A., Lowell, T.V., and Borns, H.W., 1988, Summary of the Bedrock Geologic History of Mount Desert Island, ''in'' The geology of Mount Desert Island: Augusta, Maine Geological Survey Bulletin 38.</ref>

As mentioned above, quarrying of granite was historically an important industry. Due to [[orogenic]] activity during the Devonian, Mount Desert Island has three [[granite]] units, the Cadillac Mountain granite, the fine grained Somesville granite, and the medium grained Somesville granite. Surrounding these granites (labeled "DCg" on geologic maps) is a zone of [[breccia]]ted material, known as DSz (Devonian Shatter Zone).<ref>Wiebe, R.A.: "Silicic magma chambers as traps for basaltic magmas: the Cadillac Mountain Intrusive Complex, Mount Desert Island", ''Journal of Geology'', 1994.</ref>

Most recently, Mount Desert Island was host to the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] as it extended and receded during the [[Pleistocene]] epoch. The glacier left a number of visible marks upon the landscape, such as Bubble Rock, a [[glacial erratic]] carried {{convert|19|mi}} by the ice sheet from a Lucerne granite outcrop and deposited precariously on the side of South Bubble Mountain in [[Acadia National Park]]. Other such examples are the [[moraine]]s deposited at the southern ends of many of the glacier-carved valleys on the Island such as the Jordan Pond valley, indicating the extent of the glacier; and the beach sediments located in a regressional sequence beneath and around Jordan Pond, indicating the rebound of the continent after the glacier's recession approximately 25,000 years ago.<ref>Gilman, R.A., Chapman, C.A., Lowell, T.V., and Borns, H.W., 1988, "Shaping of the Landscape by Glacial Erosion", ''The Geology of Mount Desert Island''. Augusta: Maine Geological Survey Bulletin 38.</ref>

==Ecology==
Excavations of old Indian sites in the Mount Desert Island region have yielded remains of the native mammals. Bones of wolf, [[North American beaver]] (''Castor canadensis''), deer, elk, [[gray seal]] (''Halichoerus grypus''), the [[Hare Indian Dog|Indian dog]], and [[sea mink]] (''Neovison macrodon'') have been uncovered, as well as large numbers of raccoon, lynx, wolf, muskrat, and deer.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Notes on the Mammals of Mount Desert Island, Maine |author=Richard H. Manville |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |date=November 1941 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=391–398 |jstor=1375049 |doi=10.2307/1375049}}</ref> Although beaver were trapped to extinction on the island, two pairs of beaver that were released in 1920 by George B. Dorr at the brook between Bubble Pond and Eagle Lake have repopulated it. A large fire in 1947 cleared the eastern half of the island of its coniferous trees and permitted the growth of aspen, birch, alder, maple and other deciduous trees which enabled the beaver to thrive.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Role of Scent Marking in Beaver |author=D.

'''Thomas Neilson Paulin''' (born 25 January 1949, [[Leeds]], England) is a Northern Irish poet and critic of film, music and literature. He lives in England, where he is the GM Young Lecturer in English Literature at [[Hertford College, Oxford]].

== Early life  ==
While he was still young, Paulin's Northern Irish [[Protestant]] mother and English father moved from Leeds to [[Belfast]] and Paulin grew up in a middle class area of the city. According to Paulin, his parents, a doctor and headmaster, held "vaguely socialist liberal views".  While still a teenager, Paulin joined the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] [[Socialist Labour League]].<ref name=guardian2002 >"[http://education.guardian.co.uk/academicexperts/story/0,,672518,00.html Profile: Tom Paulin]", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 23 March 2002</ref>

Paulin was educated at [[Annadale Grammar School]], [[Hull University]] and [[Lincoln College, Oxford]].<ref name=guardian2002/>

==  Work ==
From 1972 to 1994, he worked at the [[University of Nottingham]], first as a lecturer and then as a [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] of Poetry. In 1977, he won the [[Somerset Maugham]] prize for his poetry collection ''A State of Justice'' and later established his reputation as a [[literary criticism|literary critic]] with work such as ''Minotaur: Poetry and the Nation State'' (1992).{{cn|date=September 2014}} He has championed the work of literary and social critic [[William Hazlitt]] and has taken part in a successful campaign to have Hazlitt's gravestone refurbished.{{cn|date=September 2014}}

Paulin is considered to be among a group of writers from a [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] background "who have attempted to recover the radical Protestant [[Irish republicanism|republican]] heritage of the eighteenth century to challenge orthodox concepts" of Northern Irish Protestant identity.<ref>Cleary, Joe, ''Literature, Partition and the Nation State: Culture and Conflict in Ireland, Israel and Palestine'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002), p.75 ISBN 0-521-65732-6</ref>

Paulin is most widely known in [[UK|Britain]] for his appearances on the late-night [[BBC]] arts programmes ''[[The Late Show (BBC2 TV series)|The Late Show]]'', ''Late Review'' and ''[[Newsnight#Newsnight Review|Newsnight Review]]'', where he has established a reputation not only for his acerbic judgements but also for the unusual quality of some of his language.{{cn|date=September 2014}} He is also not averse to becoming involved in bad-tempered arguments with other regular guests such as [[Germaine Greer]].{{cn|date=September 2014}}

His appearances on ''Newsnight Review'' were parodied in an ''[[The Adam and Joe Show]]'''s ''Toymovie'' sketch titled Toy Review. It featured a stuffed-toy tortoise with an Irish accent called Tom Tortoise, who strongly resembled Paulin.{{cn|date=September 2014}}

Following the success of the [[Field Day Theatre Company]]'s tour of [[Brian Friel]]'s play ''Translations'' in late 1980, the two founding directors (Brian Friel and Stephen Rea) decided to make Field Day a permanent enterprise; thus, to qualify for financial support from both the Northern Irish and the Irish governments, they expanded the governing board from the original two members to six: Brian Friel, Stephen Rea, [[Seamus Deane]], [[Seamus Heaney]], David Hammond, and Tom Paulin. In 2009 he translated [[Euripedes]]'s [[Medea (play)|Medea]].<ref>"[http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsP/paulin-tom.html Tom Paulin – complete guide to the Playwright, Plays, Theatres, Agent]" doollee.com – The Playwrights Database</ref>

Paulin was a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], but resigned after declaring that the government of [[Tony Blair]] was "a Zionist government." <ref name=Weaselword/>

His poem ''Killed in Crossfire'' in the British newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'' aroused some controversy for referring to a Palestinian boy being "gunned down by the Zionist SS".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Paulin|first1=Tom|title=Killed in Crossfire|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/feb/18/poetry.features1|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=8 September 2014|quote=We're fed this inert // this lying phrase // like comfort food // as another little Palestinian boy // in trainers jeans and a white teeshirt // is gunned down by the Zionist SS // whose initials we should // - but we don't - dumb goys - // clock in that weasel word ''crossfire''}}</ref> According to Denis MacShane in his book ''Globalising Hatred: The New Antisemitism'',  it was Paulin's expression of his “anger and anguish at the behavior of Israeli troops.”<ref>{{cite book|last1=Denis|first1=MacShane|title=Globalising Hatred: The New Antisemitism’|date=2008|publisher=Orion Publishing Group}}</ref> An interview he gave to the state-owned Egyptian newspaper ''[[Al-Ahram|Al-Ahram Weekly]]'', Paulin described Israeli government actions in Palestine as "an historical obscenity."  When asked how he responds to accusations of anti-Semitism that follow such descriptions, he told the newspaper: "I just laugh when they do that to me. It does not worry me at all. These are the Hampstead liberal Zionists. I have utter contempt for them. They use this card of anti-Semitism." Regarding supporters of Israel, Paulin stated "You are either a Zionist or an anti-Zionist. Everyone who supports Israel is a Zionist."<ref name=Weaselword>[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/580/cu2.htm 'That weasel word'] Al-Ahram Weekly Online, 4–10 April 2002</ref> After his comments in Al-Ahram, appearing to wish  settlers to be shot dead, raised controversy, he said in a letter to ''[[The Independent]]'', that his views were "distorted", writing: "I have been, and am, a lifelong opponent of anti-Semitism ... I do not support attacks on Israeli civilians under any circumstances. I am in favour of the current efforts to achieve a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians"<ref>{{cite web|title=Paulin Likely To Speak in Spring|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/11/21/paulin-likely-to-speak-in-spring/|publisher=[[Harvard Crimson]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=MacLeod|first1=Donald|title=Paulin banned from Harvard poetry reading|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/nov/13/highereducation.israelandthepalestinians}}</ref><ref name=Paulinfuture>[http://www.inminds.com/boycott-news-0038.html Paulin's future at Oxford in balance after 'anti-Semitic' row] by Robert Mendick, ''[[The Independent]]'', 28 April 2002, page 7.

[[Scandium|Scandium (Sc)]] and [[yttrium|yttrium (Y)]] are always included, but the other two spaces are usually occupied by [[lanthanum|lanthanum (La)]] and [[actinium|actinium (Ac)]], or by [[lutetium|lutetium (Lu)]] and [[lawrencium|lawrencium (Lr)]]; less frequently, it is considered the group should be expanded to 32 elements (with all the [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s included) or contracted to contain only scandium and yttrium. The group itself has not acquired a [[trivial name]]; however, scandium, yttrium and the lanthanides are sometimes called [[rare earth metals]].

Three group 3 elements occur naturally, scandium, yttrium, and either lanthanum or lutetium. Lanthanum continues the trend started by two lighter members in general chemical behavior, while lutetium behaves more similarly to yttrium. This is in accordance with the trend for [[period 6 element|period 6]] transition metals to behave more similarly to their upper periodic table neighbors. This trend is seen from hafnium, which is almost identical chemically to [[zirconium]], to [[mercury (element)|mercury]], which is quite distant chemically from [[cadmium]], but still shares with it almost equal [[atomic size]] and other similar properties. They all are silvery-white metals under standard conditions. The fourth element, either actinium or lawrencium, has only radioactive [[isotopes]]. Actinium, which occurs only in [[Trace radioisotope|trace amounts]], continues the trend in chemical behavior for metals that form tripositive ions with a [[noble gas]] configuration; [[synthetic element|synthetic]] lawrencium is calculated and partially shown to be more similar to lutetium and yttrium. So far, no experiments have been conducted to [[synthetic element|synthesize]] any element that could be the next group 3 element. [[unbiunium|Unbiunium (Ubu)]], which could be considered a group 3 element if preceded by lanthanum and actinium, might be synthesized in the near future, it being only three spaces away from the current heaviest element known, [[ununoctium]].

Welsbach proposed the names ''cassiopeium'' for element 71 (after the constellation [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]) and ''aldebaranium'' (after the star [[Aldebaran]]) for the new name of ytterbium but these naming proposals were rejected, although many German scientists in the 1950s called the element 71 cassiopeium.

So far, no experiments were conducted to [[synthetic element|synthesize]] any element that could be the next group 3 element; if lutetium and lawrencium are considered to be group 3 elements, then the next element in the group should be element 153, unpenttrium (Upt).

Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in their electron configurations, especially the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior.

===Physical===
Elements that show tripositive ions with electronic configuration of a noble gas (scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, actinium) show a clear trend in their physical properties, such as hardness. At the same time, if group 3 is continued with lutetium and lawrencium, several trends are broken. For example, scandium and yttrium are both soft metals. Lanthanum is soft as well; all these elements have their outermost electrons quite far from the nucleus compared to the nuclei charges. Due to the [[lanthanide contraction]], lutetium, the last in the lanthanide series, has a significantly smaller atomic radius and a higher nucleus charge,<ref name="r"/> thus making the extraction of the electrons from the atom to form [[metallic bonding]] more difficult, and thus making the metal harder. However, lutetium suits the previous elements better in several other properties, such as [[melting point|melting]]<ref name="nn"/> and [[boiling point]]s.<ref name="n"/> Very little is known about lawrencium, and none of its physical properties have been confirmed.

==Group borders==
There is a dispute whether lanthanum and actinium or lutetium and lawrencium should be included into group 3. Other [[d-block]] groups are composed of four [[transition metals]],<ref group="note">However, the [[group 12 element]]s are not always considered to be [[transition metals]].</ref> and group 3 is sometimes considered to follow suit. Scandium and yttrium are always classified as group 3 elements, but it is controversial which elements should follow them in group 3, lanthanum and actinium or lutetium and lawrencium. Scerri has proposed a resolution to this debate on the basis of moving to a 32-column table and consideration of which option results in a continuous sequence of atomic number increase.  He thereby finds that group 3 should consist of Sc, Y, Lu, Lr.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scerri|first=Eric|title=Mendeleev's Periodic Table Is Finally Completed and What To Do about Group ?|journal=Chem. Int.|date=2012|volume=34|issue=4|pages=28–31|url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2012/3404/ud.html|doi=10.1515/ci.2012.34.4.28}}</ref>  The current [[IUPAC]] definition of the term "lanthanoid" includes fifteen elements including both lanthanum and lutetium, and that of "transition element"<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=T06456|title=transition element}}</ref> applies to lanthanum and actinium, as well as lutetium but ''not'' lawrencium, since it does not correctly follow the [[Aufbau principle]]. Normally, the 103rd electron would enter the d-subshell, but quantum mechanical research has found that the configuration is actually [Rn]7s<sup>2</sup>5f<sup>14</sup>7p<sup>1</sup><ref group="note">The expected configuration of lawrencium if it did obey the Aufbau principle would be [Rn]7s<sup>2</sup>5f<sup>14</sup>6d<sup>1</sup>, with the normal incomplete 6d-subshell in the neutral state.</ref> due to [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]].<ref name="7p"/><ref name="7p1/2"/> IUPAC thus has not recommended a specific format for the in-line-f-block periodic table, leaving the dispute open.

*Lanthanum and actinium are sometimes considered the remaining members of group 3.<ref name="ffff"/> In their most commonly encountered tripositive ion forms, these elements do not possess any partially filled [[f-block|f-orbitals]], thus continuing the scandium—yttrium—lanthanum—actinium trend, in which all the elements have relationship similar to that of elements of the calcium—strontium—barium—radium series, the elements' left neighbors in [[s-block]]. However, different behavior is observed in other [[d-block]] groups, especially in group 4, in which zirconium, hafnium and rutherfordium share similar chemical properties lacking a clear trend.

*In other tables, lutetium and lawrencium are classified as the remaining members of group 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com |title=WebElements Periodic Table of the Elements |publisher=Webelements.com |accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref> In these tables, lutetium and lawrencium end (or sometimes succeed) the [[lanthanide]] and [[actinide]] series, respectively. Since the f-shell is nominally full in the ground state electron configuration for both of these metals, they behave most similarly to other [[period 6 element|period 6]] and [[period 7 element|period 7]] transition metals compared to the other lanthanides and actinides, and thus logically exhibit properties similar to those of scandium and yttrium. (This behavior is expected for lawrencium, but has not been observed because sufficient quantities of lawrencium have not yet been [[synthetic element|synthesized]].)

* Some tables, including the official IUPAC table<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.iupac.org/reports/periodic_table/|title=Periodic Table of the Elements |publisher=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref> refer to ''all'' lanthanides and actinides by a marker in group 3. This sometimes is believed to be the inclusion of all 30 [[lanthanide]] and [[actinide]] elements as included in group 3. Lanthanides, as [[electropositive]] [[trivalent]] metals, all have a closely related chemistry, and all show many similarities to scandium and yttrium, but they also show additional properties characteristic of their partially filled f-orbitals which are not common to scandium and yttrium.

* Exclusion of all elements is based on properties of earlier actinides, which show a much wider variety of chemistry (for instance, in range of [[oxidation state]]s) within their series than the lanthanides, and comparisons to scandium and yttrium are even less useful.<ref name="visualelements" /> However, these elements are destabilized,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/ecc/samples/sample08.pdf |title=Lanthanides and Actinides |author=Dolg, Michael |work=Max-Planck-Institut für Physik komplexer Systeme, Dresden, Germany |publisher=CLA01 |accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref> and if they were stabilized to more closely match chemistry laws, they would be similar to lanthanides as well. Also, the later actinides from [[californium]] onwards behave more like the corresponding lanthanides, with only the valence +3 (and sometimes +2) shown.<ref name="visualelements">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemsoc/visualelements/index.htm|title=Visual Elements|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref>

==Occurrence==
Scandium, yttrium, and lutetium tend to occur together with other lanthanides (except promethium) tend to occur together in the Earth's crust, and are often harder to extract from their ores. The [[abundance of elements in Earth's crust]] for group 3 is quite low — all the elements in the group are uncommon, the most abundant being yttrium with abundance of approximately 30&nbsp;[[parts per million]] (ppm); the abundance of scandium is 16&nbsp;ppm, while that of lutetium is about 0.5&nbsp;ppm. For comparison, the abundance of copper is 50&nbsp;ppm, that of chromium is 160&nbsp;ppm, and that of molybdenum is 1.5&nbsp;ppm.<ref name="ffff">{{cite web|last = Barbalace|first = Kenneth|url = http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/periodic/|title = Periodic Table of Elements|publisher = Environmental Chemistry.com|accessdate = 2007-04-14}}</ref>

[[File:Monazit - Mosambik, O-Afrika.jpg|thumb|alt=Piece of a yellow-gray rock|[[Monazite]], the most important lutetium ore]]
The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth [[phosphate]] mineral [[monazite]], ([[cerium|Ce]],[[lanthanum|La]],etc.)[[phosphorus|P]][[oxygen|O]]<sub>4</sub>, which contains 0.003% of the element. The main mining areas are [[China]], [[United States]], [[Brazil]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Australia]].

==Production==
The most available element in group 3 is yttrium, with annual production of 8,900&nbsp;[[tonne]]s in 2010.

==Biological chemistry==
Group 3 elements are generally hard metals with low aqueous solubility, and have low availability to the biosphere. No group 3 element has any documented biological role in living organisms. The radioactivity of the actinides generally makes them highly toxic to living cells, causing [[acute radiation syndrome|radiation poisoning]].

Scandium has no biological role, but it is found in living organisms. Once reached a human, scandium concentrates in the liver and is a threat to it; some its compounds are possibly [[carcinogen]]ic, even through in general scandium is not toxic.<ref name="sc">{{cite web|year=1998|publisher=Lenntech|title=Scandium (Sc) — chemical properties of scandium, health effects of scandium, environmental effects of scandium|author=Lenntech|accessdate=2011-05-21|url=http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/sc.htm}}</ref> Scandium is known to have reached the food chain, but in trace amounts only; a typical human takes in less than 0.1&nbsp;micrograms per day.<ref name="sc"/> Once released into the environment, scandium gradually accumulates in soils, which leads to increased concentrations in soil particles, animals and humans. Scandium is mostly dangerous in the working environment, due to the fact that damps and gases can be inhaled with air. This can cause lung embolisms, especially during long-term exposure. The element is known to damage cell membranes of water animals, causing several negative influences on reproduction and on the functions of the nervous system.<ref name="sc"/>

Yttrium has no known biological role, though it is found in most, if not all, organisms and tends to concentrate in the liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and bones of humans.<ref>{{cite journal|journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry|year = 1952

Lutetium has no biological role as well, but it is found even in the highest known organism, the [[human]]s, concentrating in bones, and to a lesser extent in the liver and kidneys.<ref name="Emsley240"/> Lutetium salts are known to cause metabolism and they occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides.<ref name="Emsley240"/> Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content, so it is not known how much the average human takes in, but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year, all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants. Soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble ones are not.<ref name="Emsley240">[[#Emsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p. 240</ref>

The high radioactivity of lawrencium would make it highly toxic to living cells, causing radiation poisoning.

As originally conceived in the mid to late 1960s, rock festivals were held outdoors, often in open rural areas or open-air sports arenas, fairgrounds and parks, typically lasted two or more days, featured long rosters of musical performers, and attracted very large crowds - sometimes numbering several hundred thousand people.

Initially, some of the earliest rock festivals were built on the foundation of pre-existing jazz and blues festivals, but quickly evolved to reflect the rapidly changing musical tastes of the time. For example, the United Kingdom’s [[National Jazz Festival]] was launched in Richmond from August 26–27, 1961. The first three of these annual outdoor festivals featured only jazz music, but by the fourth “Jazz & Blues Festival” in 1964, a shift had begun that incorporated some blues and pop artists into the lineup. In 1965, for the first time the event included more blues, pop and rock acts than jazz, and by 1966, when the event moved to the town of Windsor, the rock and pop acts clearly dominated the jazz artists.<ref>[http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/nat-jazz-menu.html/ UKRockFestivals.com] Retrieved January 14, 2014.</ref>

A similar, though more rapid, evolution occurred with [[Jazz Bilzen]], a solely jazz festival that was inaugurated in 1965 in the Belgian city of Bilzen.  The 1966 festival still featured mostly jazz acts.  However, by the time of the third festival from August 25–27, 1967, rock and pop acts had edged out most of the jazz bands and become the main attraction.<ref>[http://www.jazzbilzen.be/65-81Default.htm/ Jazz Bilzen history] Retrieved January 14, 2014.</ref>

In the United States, rock festivals seemed to spring up with a more self-defined musical identity.  Preceded by several precursor events in the San Francisco area, the first two rock festivals in the US were staged in northern California on consecutive weekends in the summer of 1967:  the KFRC [[Fantasy Fair & Magic Mountain Music Festival]] on Mount Tamalpais (June 10–11) and the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]] (June 16–17).<ref>Santelli, Robert. ‘’Aquarius Rising – The Rock Festival Years’’. Pg. 16.</ref><ref>Browne, David.  (2014-06-05).  “The Birth of the Rock Fest”.  ''Rolling Stone''.</ref><ref>Kubernik, Harvey and Kubernik, Kenneth.  ''A Perfect Haze: The Illustrated History of the Monterey International Pop Festival''.  2011.  Santa Monica Press LLC.  Pg. 54.</ref>

The concept caught fire and spread quickly as rock festivals took on a unique identity and attracted significant media attention around the world.  By 1969, promoters were staging dozens of them.  According to Bill Mankin, in their dawning age rock festivals were important socio-cultural milestones:  “… it would not be an exaggeration to say that, over a few short years, rock festivals played a unique, significant – and underappreciated – role in fueling the countercultural shift that swept not only America but many other countries [during the 1960s]. It seems fitting… that one of the most enduring labels for the entire generation of that era was derived from a rock festival: the ‘[[Woodstock]] Generation’.”<ref>Mankin, Bill.  [http://likethedew.com/2012/03/04/we-can-all-join-in-how-rock-festivals-helped-change-america/ We Can All Join In: How Rock Festivals Helped Change America].  Like the Dew.  2012.</ref>

Reflecting their musical diversity and the then-common term ‘[[pop music]]’, for the first few years, particularly in the US, many rock festivals were called ‘pop festivals’.  This also served to distinguish them among the ticket-buying public from other, pre-existing types of [[music festival]]s such as jazz and folk festivals.  By the end of 1972, the term ‘pop festival’ had virtually disappeared as festival promoters adopted more creative, unique and location-specific names to identify and advertise their events.  While it was still in vogue, however, over-zealous promoters eager to capitalize on the festival concept made the most of it, with some using the term “Pop Festival” or “Rock Festival” to advertise events held on a single day or evening, often indoors, and featuring only a handful of acts.<ref>Santelli, Robert.  ''Aquarius Rising - The Rock Festival Years''.  1980.  Dell Publishing Co., Inc.  Pg. 259.</ref>

Today, rock festivals are still usually open air concerts spread out over several days.  Many are annual events sponsored by the same organization, and many feature a single type or closely related genres of music such as [[Dance music|dance]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].

'''''Crusade''''' is an American [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] TV show from [[J. Michael Straczynski]]'s ''[[Babylon 5]]''. Its plot is set in AD 2267, five years after the events of ''Babylon 5'', and just after the movie ''[[Babylon 5: A Call to Arms|A Call to Arms]]''.  The [[Drakh]] have released a [[grey goo|nanovirus plague]] on [[Earth (Babylon 5)|Earth]], which will destroy all life on Earth within five years if it is not stopped. To that end, the Victory class destroyer ''[[Excalibur (Crusade)|Excalibur]]'' has been sent out to look for anything that could help the search for a cure.

== Production background ==
Like ''Babylon 5'', ''Crusade'' was intended to have a five-year [[story arc]], although as Straczynski notes in the [[Audio commentary (DVD)|DVD commentary]] for ''A Call To Arms'', it was intended to resolve the Drakh plague after a season or two and move onto other arcs. However, conflicts arose between the producers and executives at [[Turner Network Television|TNT]], and production was cancelled before the first episode was broadcast.<ref>[http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=2060 Crisis on Babylon 5: Crusade], Ain't It Cool News. Retrieved July 13, 2006.</ref>

TNT's research had indicated that the audience for ''Babylon 5'' did not watch other TNT programming, and likewise TNT's main audience was not watching the show, making another related program unattractive to the network's management. Straczynski believes that the network's "interference"<ref>[http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/guide/501.html#JS War Zone], [[The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5]]. Retrieved July 13, 2006.</ref> with the production was an attempt to get out of their contract by allowing them to argue that he failed to deliver the series they wanted.

Thirteen episodes were made and broadcast by TNT, with at least four more scripted. The [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] attempted to pick up the show and continue production, but was unable to find room in its budget.<ref>[http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/guide/113.html The Babylon Project: Crusade], The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5. Retrieved July 13, 2006.</ref>

== Plot background ==

=== Drakh attack ===
{{main|Babylon 5: A Call to Arms}}
In 2267, six years after the end of the [[Shadow War]], the Drakh, a former ally of the [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadows]], attempt to destroy the Earth with a leftover [[Shadow Planet Killer]]. Interstellar Alliance president [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|John Sheridan]] takes command of the ''[[Excalibur (Crusade)|Excalibur]]'' and ''Victory'' and leads the [[EarthForce]] and ISA fleets to victory. During the battle, the Drakh released a viral weapon into Earth's atmosphere, infecting every living thing on the planet. In five years the virus will become active and kill everything. The ''Victory'' was destroyed in the battle, but the ''Excalibur'' survived. Command is turned over to Captain Matthew Gideon who is given a mission: explore the galaxy to find either a cure or an ally capable of producing one ("[[War Zone (Crusade episode)|War Zone]]").

=== Telepath War ===
{{main|Telepath War}}
At some point between 2262 and 2267 (most likely in 2264, and just before "To Live and Die in Starlight" which took place in 2265{{Or|date=March 2011}}), a civil war broke out on Earth between the [[Psi Corps]] and a group of rogue [[telepath]]s, with mundanes (non-telepaths) caught in the middle. As a result of the war, the Psi Corps (which all telepaths had been forced by law to join) was disbanded and the laws were rewritten; telepaths were given limited rights and allowed back into society, including the military (e.g. Lt. Matheson in ''Crusade''). Few telepaths have advanced very far because of how recent the war was and due to the common fear of telepaths. Telepaths are still banned from scanning others' thoughts without consent and are required to be "deep scanned" by powerful telepaths on a regular basis to ensure that they are not violating any laws ("[[The Well of Forever]]").

=== Mars independence ===
After the [[Earth Alliance Civil War]] in 2261, Earth joined the Interstellar Alliance. As promised by John Sheridan, Mars was granted independence since ISA laws required members to free any colony where the majority of colonists want independence ("[[Rising Star (Babylon 5)|Rising Star]]"). There is still resentment between the two sides ("[[Ruling from the Tomb]]"). Earth controls most of the information systems and resources in the solar system and Earth based corporations control much of the Mars economy ("[[Objects in Motion]]"). As a result there is some hostility among Mars-born humans towards Terrans and many in EarthForce do not feel obligated to risk their lives to help Earth fight the plague.

*[[Gary Cole]] as Captain [[Matthew Gideon]]: captain of the ''Excalibur''. He was specifically chosen by Interstellar Alliance president [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|John Sheridan]] because he would be willing to take chances and would not let diplomacy get in the way of completing the mission.
*[[Tracy Scoggins]] as Captain [[Elizabeth Lochley]]: commanding officer of ''Babylon 5''. She first encountered Gideon on Mars during an interstellar conference on the plague where she was heading security ("[[Ruling from the Tomb]]"). She and Gideon originally clashed due to similarities in personalities, but soon developed a relationship as casual lovers, ("[[The Rules of the Game (Crusade)|The Rules of the Game]]"). She returned to Babylon 5 after the conference and appeared infrequently.
*[[Daniel Dae Kim]] as Lieutenant [[John Matheson (Babylon 5)|John Matheson]]: second in command and P6<ref>''Value Judgements'' script, page 16.</ref> [[telepath]] (slightly stronger than a Commercial Telepath (P5)). He is considered to be a role model among human telepaths since no other has advanced so far in the [[EarthForce]] military. He served as Gideon's first officer on his previous assignment as well. He was assigned to the ''Excalibur'' at the insistence of Gideon.
*[[David Allen Brooks]] as [[Max Eilerson]]: a successful archaeologist from Interplanetary Expeditions. He was a [[child prodigy]] and has a gift for understanding alien languages. He was not originally assigned to the ''Excalibur'' but was recruited by Gideon during their encounter in "[[War Zone (Crusade episode)|War Zone]]".
*[[Peter Woodward]] as [[Technomage#Galen|Galen]]: a [[technomage]], who had saved Gideon's life 10 years prior to the series ("[[The Path of Sorrows]]"). He was exiled from the technomages' order <!-- Not really.  That was his cover story.  In reality, Galen's mission given to him by The Circle, was to keep an eye out for any shadowtech that may be a threat to the Technomages (in particular) and the rest of the galactic inhabitants, and mitigate or eliminate that shadowtech. --> in 2267 after he helped Earth and the Alliance fight the [[Drakh]] in the battle that resulted in Earth becoming infected with the plague (''[[Babylon 5: A Call to Arms]]'').
*[[Marjean Holden]] as Doctor [[Sarah Chambers]]: ship's medical officer. She was on Mars at the time of the Drakh attack and was willing to risk the plague to go home to Earth and be with her family and help, but was persuaded that her medical expertise could be put to better use by helping to find a cure.
*[[Carrie Dobro]] as [[Dureena Nafeel]]: a thief and last known survivor of her race (which was destroyed by the Drakh during the [[Shadow War]]). Along with Galen, she assisted the crew during the Drakh attack on Earth. After the attack she was held on Mars by EarthForce for further questioning, but was released when Gideon made her part of the crew.

== Episodes ==
{{main|List of Crusade episodes}}
The "correct" order of episodes is somewhat unclear, and the episodes contain conflicting evidence as to the in-universe chronological order. Series creator J. Michael Straczynski revised [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]'s ordering for re-broadcast on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] in April 2001, and the episodes have been repeated in this order a number of occasions since then.  "War Zone," an episode made halfway through the production as an opener, has been pushed near the end.  In particular, these episodes ignore a [[continuity (fiction)|discontinuity]] in uniforms &mdash; in the TNT order, the crew start out with the revised uniforms in production, and then in "Appearances and Other Deceits" were forced to change to the "new" uniforms used earlier in production.  The fourteenth episode would have featured a return to the older uniforms that the crew prefer.<ref>[http://midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/eplist.html#crusade Episode List], The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5. Retrieved July 13, 2006.</ref>

A third order was formally endorsed by Straczynski as the "true" chronological sequence of in-universe events for the filmed episodes, as it appeared in ''The Official Babylon 5 Chronology'' (published in the pages of ''The Official Babylon 5 Magazine'' in 1999-2000) and the book "Across Time and Space: The Chronologies of Babylon 5". Here "Babylon 5 Historical Database" author Terry Jones explains the running order was done to take into account Straczynski's desire to have the grey bellhop uniform stories incorporated within the black explorer uniform stories and the internal story continuity had the series continued. This also accounted for the various on-air dates given and the changes made to dialogue in "Each Night I Dream Of Home". This particular ordering supersedes Straczynski's own "preferred" sequence from a strictly chronological and causal standpoint. The original broadcast order as set by TNT was used for the DVD releases.

A fourth, continuity based order can be inferred by the events of the episodes themselves as several of the episodes make mini-arcs within the series; i.e. the continuity order of Gideon/Lochley meetings based on dialog is "Ruling from the Tomb"/"Each Night I Dream of Home"/"The Rules of the Game" which also requires "Ruling" to precede "Apearances and Other Deceits" while the continuity order of the nanite mask is "The Memory of War"/"Each Night I Dream of Home"/"Patterns of the Soul," etc.

=== Continuity problems ===
As a result of TNT showing the episodes out of their intended sequence, there are several continuity problems, including:
* In episode 10 ("The Memory of War"), Dr. Chambers reprogrammed the technomages' nanovirus to create a short term protection against the Drakh nanovirus. However, they had already used the device in episode 5 ("Patterns of the Soul").
* The Apocalypse Box warned Gideon not to trust Galen in episode 10 ("The Memory of War"), however Galen's "betrayal" occurred in episode 3 ("The Well of Forever"), according to aired episodes. However, it is possible that the betrayal the Apocalypse Box actually referred to the events of "To the Ends of the Earth", the unaired script by Straczynski. This revealed information on Galen and the rest of the Technomages that might have been seen by Gideon as a betrayal. (see the [[Babylon 5 Novels, novelizations, short stories, and comic books#The Technomage Trilogy|Technomage Trilogy]]). Additionally, the Apocalypse Box lies and distorts the truth on occasion, so it is possible that the events of episode 3 were unrelated to the Box's information.
* Gideon and Lochley met each other for the very first time in "Ruling from the Tomb", and they developed an intimate relationship in episode 7 ("The Rules of the Game"), however in the final episode ("Each Night I Dream of Home") they are merely on friendly (and slightly flirty) terms with each other, after Lochley's damaged Starfury is rescued by Excalibur. This episode, the fifth to be filmed, was originally to have introduced Lochley; a line of voice-over dialogue establishes that they had previously met.

==== Uniform switch ====
The crew received new uniforms in episode 8 ("[[Appearances and Other Deceits]]"), replacing the black uniforms, they have been wearing, with grey ones. While this doesn't pose a continuity problem in itself, it is noteworthy, that the "new" uniforms were the ones first used in production. After the first five episodes were produced using grey uniforms, there was a hiatus and the cast received new black uniforms. However, as the series resumed production, among the following episodes was the pilot ''War Zone'', a coming-together-episode, which took place before the previously produced grey-uniform episodes. In order to provide an explanation, why the crew first wears black uniforms in the pilot, then switches for five episodes to grey uniforms and then switches back to the black uniforms, two bookending episodes were written. The first was ''Appearances and other Deceits'', which was the last episode produced and the eighth shown. In episode 14 (intended as "To The Ends of the Earth") the grey uniforms would have been destroyed and the crew would have gone back to the black uniforms.<ref>[http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/guide/508.html#NO Appearances and Other Deceits], The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5. Retrieved July 14, 2006.</ref>

== DVD releases ==
The complete series was released as a four disc set in 2004, almost five years after the series ended and a few months after the final season and movie set of ''[[Babylon 5]]'' was released. ''Crusade'' was also included in ''Babylon 5: The Complete Universe'', a set of all B5 shows and movies released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on October 24, 2005. It was not included in ''Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series'', which was a set released in the [[United States|US]].

The episodes are in the original broadcast order. The set does not include the pilot movie, ''[[Babylon 5: A Call to Arms|A Call to Arms]]'', which was released earlier as part of the movie set. Unlike ''Babylon 5'', ''Crusade'' was not presented in widescreen on DVD. Initially the set included a commentary with Straczynski, however he got it removed from subsequent pressings when he learned that parts of it had been replaced with an entirely different interview to cover up his harsh criticism of TNT.<ref>[http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-17253 Re: "Crusade" DVDs in TNT order], JMSNews.com 2004-12-10</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-17279|title=Quickie from JMS 2005-01-30|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>

The [[cetacea]]n family '''Monodontidae''' comprises two unusual [[whale]] species, the [[narwhal]], in which the male has a long tusk, and the  dorsal fin-lacking, pure white [[beluga whale]]. They are native to coastal regions and pack ice around the [[Arctic Sea]], and the far north of the [[Atlantic]] and [[Pacific]] Oceans. 

Both species are medium-sized whales, between three and five metres in length, with a forehead [[melon (whale)|melon]], and a short or absent snout. They do not have a true dorsal fin, but do have a narrow ridge running along the back, which is much more pronounced in the narwhal. They are highly vocal animals, communicating with a wide range of sounds. Like other whales, they also use [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] to navigate.<ref name=EoM>{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Brodie, Paul|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 200–203|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}</ref>

Monodontids have a wide-ranging [[carnivore|carnivorous]] diet, feeding on fish, molluscs, and small crustaceans. They have reduced teeth, with the beluga having numerous simple teeth, and the narwhal having only two teeth, one of which forms the tusks in males. [[Gestation]] lasts 14-15 months in both species, and almost always results in a single calf. The young are not [[weaning|weaned]] for a full two years, and do not reach sexual maturity until they are five to eight years of age. Family groups travel as part of herds, or 'pods', which may contain several hundred individuals.<ref name=EoM/>

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Narwhal x Beluga.jpg|thumb|upright|Skull of a cross between a narwhal and a beluga whale, at the Zoological Museum, Copenhagen]] 
The monodontids, [[dolphins]] (Delphinidae) and [[porpoises]] (Phocoenidae) together comprise the [[Delphinoidea]] superfamily.  Genetic evidence suggests the porpoises are more closely related to the white whales, and these two families constitute a separate [[clade]] which diverged from the Delphinoidea within the past 11 million years.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Waddell, V.G. and Milinkovitch, M.C. and Bérubé, M. and Stanhope, M.J. | year = 2000 | title = Molecular Phylogenetic Examination of the Delphinoidea Trichotomy: Congruent Evidence from Three Nuclear Loci Indicates That Porpoises (Phocoenidae) Share a More Recent Common Ancestry with White Whales (Monodontidae) Than They Do with True Dolphins (Delphinidae)  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 314–318 | doi = 10.1006/mpev.1999.0751 | pmid=10837160}}</ref>

'''Balaenidae''' {{IPAc-en|b|?|?|l|i?|n|?|d|i?}} is a [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[whale]]s of the [[suborder]] [[Mysticeti|mysticete]] that contains two living genera. Historically, it is known as the right whale family, as it was thought to contain only species of [[right whale]]s.  Through most of the 20th Century, however, that became a much-debated (and unresolved) topic amongst the scientific community.<ref name=Muller>{{cite journal | author = Müller, J. | year = 1954 | title = Observations of the orbital region of the skull of the Mystacoceti | journal = Zoologische Mededelingen|volume = 32| pages = 239–90 |url=http://www.repository.naturalis.nl/document/149549 |format=PDF}}</ref> Finally, in the early 2000s, science reached a definitive conclusion: the [[bowhead whale]], once commonly known as the Greenland right whale, was not in fact a right whale.<ref name="iucn-bowhead">{{IUCN2012.1|assessors=Reilly, S.B., Bannister, J.L., Best, P.B., Brown, M., Brownell Jr., R.L., Butterworth, D.S., Clapham, P.J., Cooke, J., Donovan, G.P., Urbán, J. & Zerbini, A.N. |year=2008 |id=2467 |title=''Balaena mysticetus''|downloaded=18 September 2012}} "The taxonomy is not in doubt. ...

==Characteristics==
Balaenids are large whales, with an average adult length of 15 to 17 metres (45–50 feet), and weighing 50-80 tonnes. Their principle distinguishing feature is their narrow, arched, upper jaw, which gives the animals a deeply curved jawline. This shape allows for especially long [[baleen]] plates. The animals utilise these by floating at or near the surface, and straining food from the water, which they then scrape off the baleen with their tongues - a feeding method that contrasts with those of the [[rorqual]]s and the [[gray whale]]. Their diet consists of small [[crustacean]]s, primarily [[copepod]]s, although some species also eat a significant amount of [[krill]].<ref name=EoM>{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Gaskin, David E.|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 230–235|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}</ref>

Balaenids are also robustly built by comparison with the rorquals, and lack the grooves along the throat that are distinctive of those animals. They have exceptionally large heads in comparison with their bodies, reaching 40% of the total length in the case of the Bowhead Whale. They have short, broad, flippers, and lack a dorsal fin.

All species are at least somewhat migratory, moving into warmer waters during the winter, during which they both mate and give birth. [[Gestation]] lasts 10–11 months, results in the birth of a single young, and typically occurs once every three years.<ref name=EoM/>

:''[[Robert Poujade]] is an unrelated French politician.''

'''Pierre Poujade''' ({{IPA-fr|pj?? pu?ad}}; 1 December 1920 – 27 August 2003) was a French [[populism|populist]] politician after whom the '''Poujadist''' movement was named.<ref name="obit">Johnson, Douglas (2003-08-28). Obituary – Pierre Poujade: Shooting star of a 1950s small traders' revolt. The Guardian, 28 August 2003. Retrieved from http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/aug/28/guardianobituaries1.</ref>

==Biography==
Pierre Poujade was born in [[Saint-Céré]] (Lot), France, and studied at Collège Saint-Eugène d'Aurillac, a Roman Catholic private school. On the death of his father, an architect, in 1928, he was unable to afford the tuition and left school to work as a manual laborer. As a teenager{{When|date=September 2009}}, Poujade joined the [[Parti populaire français]] (PPF) of [[Jacques Doriot]].<ref name="obit" />

From 1940 to 1942, Poujade supported the [[Révolution nationale]] of [[Philippe Pétain]]. After the [[Case Anton|invasion of the free zone]] by German forces, he joined the [[Free French Forces]] in [[Algiers]], where he met his future wife, Yvette Seva, with whom he had five children.<ref name="obit" />

===Poujadism===
After the war, Poujade was the owner of a book and stationery store.<ref name="time">Time (1956-03-19). Foreign News: An Ordinary Frenchman. Time Magazine, 19 March 1956. Retrieved from http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,824029-1,00.html (http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,824029,00.html).</ref>

On 23 July 1953, with a group of about 20 persons, Poujade prevented inspectors of the tax board from verifying the income of another shopkeeper. This was the start of a [[tax protest]] movement by shopkeepers, first in the [[Lot (department)|Lot]], then in [[Aveyron]], and finally the whole south of  [[Massif Central]].<ref name="time" />

On 29 November 1953, Pierre Poujade created the [[Union de Defense Commercants et Artisans]] (UDCA), to organize the tax protesters. This movement would soon be called "Poujadism".<ref name="time" />  Poujadism flourished most vigorously in the last years of the [[French Fourth Republic]], and articulated the economic interests and grievances of shopkeepers and other proprietor-managers of small businesses facing economic and social change. The main themes of Poujadism were articulated around the defense of the [[commoner|common man]] against the elites.<ref name="time" />

In addition to the protest against the income tax and the price control imposed by [[Antoine Pinay]] to limit inflation, Poujadism was opposed to industrialization, urbanization, and American-style modernization, which were perceived as a threat to the identity of rural France.<ref>Serieys, Jacques (2009-07-23). "23 juillet 1953 : Pierre Poujade lance le poujadisme sur le Lot, l’Aveyron puis la France rurale entière. Remarques sur le mouvement des commerçants et artisans". Parti de Gauche: Midi-Pyrénées, 23 July 2009. Retrieved from http://www.prs12.com/spip.php?article3648.</ref> Poujadism denounced the French state as "rapetout et inhumain" ("thieving and inhuman"). The movement's "common man" populism led to [[antiparliamentarism]] (Poujade called the Chamber of Deputies "the biggest brothel in Paris" and the deputies a "pile of rubbish" and "pederasts")  a strong [[anti-intellectualism]] (Poujade denounced the graduates from [[École Polytechnique]] as the main culprits for the woes of 1950s France and boasted that he had no book learning), [[xenophobia]], and [[antisemitism]] especially aimed against [[Pierre Mendès-France]] (claiming "Mendès is French only as the word added to his name"), who was perceived as responsible for the loss of [[Indochina]].<ref name="video">Source Unknown (date unknown). Video of a speech of Poujade against Mendès-France. Uploaded to Dailymotion.com by MisteurCocktail on 2006-08-27. Retrieved from http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xbzln_poujade.</ref>  Poujadism also supported the cause of [[French Algeria]].<ref name="nyt03">The New York Times, 29 August 2003: Pierre Poujade obituary. http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/29/world/pierre-poujade-dies-at-82-rallied-france-s-rightists.html</ref>

===Political involvement===
In 1955, the UDCA was a strong political movement, with 400,000 members. Its adherents were encouraged to protest against taxes and withdraw their deposits from state-owned banks. The movement called for new [[French States-General|Estates General]] to re-found the French political regime, and published the ''Fraternité Française'' newspaper.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
The UDCA secured 52 seats in the [[French legislative election, 1956|1956 elections]].<ref name="nytobit">Riding, Alan (2003-08-29). Pierre Poujade Dies at 82; Rallied France's Rightists.

Bell|work=The Independent|date=29 August 2003|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/pierre-poujade-548666.html |title=Pierre Poujade, Political campaigner of the French right}}</ref> To justify his support to the [[Algerian War]], Poujade declared in 1956 to Time Magazine: <blockquote>"Big Wall Street syndicates found incredibly rich oil deposits in the Sahara, but instead of exploiting the discovery, they capped the wells and turned the Algerians against us...All this is a great diabolic scheme to dismember France. Already the Saar is gone, and soon the Italians will want Corsica...As for those who are against us, I need only say: let them go back to Jerusalem. We'll even be glad to pay their way."<ref name="time" /></blockquote>
 
After the [[French Fifth Republic]] began in 1958 under [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s presidency, Poujade and his party largely faded from view.<ref name="lmobit">Weill, Nicolas (2003-08-28). La mort de Pierre Poujade, précurseur d'un nouveau populisme. Le Monde, 28 August 2003. Retrieved from http://www.droitconstitutionnel.net/PierrePoujade.htm.</ref>  Poujade distanced himself from Le Pen and declared in 2002 that he would have preferred to break his own leg than to make him a deputy.<ref>Webster, Paul (2002-04-28). Le Pen's ex-mentor regrets rise of 'liar'. The Observer, 28 April 2002. Retrieved from http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/apr/28/france.paulwebster.</ref>

In 1965, Poujade supported [[Jean Lecanuet]] for president.<ref name="lmobit" />

In the 1981{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} and 1988<ref name="lmobit" /> presidential elections, Poujade favored [[François Mitterrand]], while in the 1995 election he voiced his support for [[Jacques Chirac]].<ref name="lmobit" /> 

In 1984, Pierre Poujade was appointed to the ''Conseil économique et social'' by Mitterrand. Poujade used this position to promote [[biofuels]].<ref>Benjamin Coriat ''[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rei_0154-3229_1981_num_18_1_1101 L'alcool carburant et son économie]'' Revue d'économie industrielle '''18''' 133 (1981).</ref>

==Legacy==
Although the UDCA has lost its influence, some of the ideas of Poujadism persist in modern French politics.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In 1969, Gérard Nicoud started the CID-UNATI (''Comité Interprofessionnel de Défense-Union Nationale des Travailleurs Indépendants''), a tax protest movement similar to the one of Poujade. Examples of current political groups with strong poujadist leanings include Le Pen's own [[National Front (France)|National Front]] (which has a strong anti-tax message), the ''[[Comité de Défense des Commerçants et Artisans]]'' of [[Christian Poucet]] (that encouraged French shopkeepers to declare their business in Britain in order to avoid paying the French Social Security taxes), and the ''[[Union des Contribuables Français]]''. The magazine ''[[Le Cri du Contribuable]]'' owned by Nicolas Miguet also maintains the poujadist tradition.

In France, ''Poujadisme'' is often used pejoratively to characterize any kind of ideology 
that declares itself ''anti-establishment'' or criticizes strongly the current French political system or political class, even when the anti-tax or anti-intellectual aspects of the original Poujadism are absent.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

For instance, [[Le Monde Diplomatique]] was accused of ''poujado-marxisme'' in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In February 2010, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' commentator Robert Zaretsky compared the American [[Tea Party movement]] with Poujadism.<ref name="zaretsky">{{cite news |title=The Tea Party Last Time |first=Robert |last=Zaretsky |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2 February 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/opinion/03zaretsky.html?sudsredirect=true&pagewanted=all }}</ref>

In a 2012 pamphlet, the late author [[Christopher Hitchens]] refers to a "...Poujadiste female with ideas above her station", presumably a reference to Margaret Thatcher and her humble origins as a Grantham grocer's daughter.<ref>[[Christopher Hitchens]] ''The Monarchy: A Critique of Britain's Favourite Fetish'' published by Vintage Digital (29 May 2012).</ref>

'''Ukrainian music''' ({{lang-uk|?????????? ??????}}) is a music which its content covers diverse and multiple component elements of the music that is found in Western and Eastern musical civilization. It also has a very strong indigenous [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Christian]] uniqueness whose elements were used among many neighboring nations.<ref>[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/alphasearch.asp?q=music Ukrainian Music Elements], Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, 2001.</ref><ref>[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/Culture.asp#Topic_2 The artistic tradition of Ukrainian wandering bards, the kobzars (kobza players), bandurysts (bandura players), and lirnyks (lira players) is one of the most distinctive elements of Ukraine's cultural heritage.], Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, 2001.</ref>

[[Ukraine]] is also the rarely acknowledged musical heartland of the former [[Russian Empire]], home to its first professional music academy, which opened in the mid-18th century and produced numerous early musicians and composers.<ref>[http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/country/content.country/ukraine/en_US Ukraine is the rarely acknowledged musical heartland of the former Russian Empire], National Geographic Society, 2012.</ref>

Modern [[Ukraine]] is situated north of the [[Black Sea]], previously part of the [[Soviet Union]]. Several of its ethnic groups living within Ukraine have their own unique musical traditions and some have developed specific musical traditions in association with the land in which they live.

== Traditional ethnic Ukrainian music ==
=== Traditional ethnic Ukrainian music – in general ===
Ukraine found itself at the crossroads of Asia and Europe and this is reflected within the music in a perplexing mix of exotic [[melisma]]tic singing with chordal harmony which does not always easily fit the rules of traditional Western European harmony.
The most striking general characteristic of authentic ethnic Ukrainian folk music is the wide use of minor modes or keys which incorporate augmented 2nd intervals. This is an indication that the major-minor system developed in Western European music did not become as entrenched or as sophisticated in Ukraine.

Rhythmically the music rarely uses complex time-signatures, but compound meters are encountered, and the music can be extremely complex harmonically.

Harmonically three and even four part harmony had developed and was recorded in the central steppe regions of Ukraine, but was not in popular use in the mountain regions by the late 19th century.

*Ritual songs show the greatest tendency to preservation. They are frequently in recitative style, essentially [[monody|monodic]], based on notes in the range of a third or a fourth. An example of this style is the theme for the Shchedrivka "[[Shchedryk (song)|Shchedryk]]" known in the West as "[[Carol of the Bells]]".

*A large group of Ukrainian ritual melodies fall within a perfect fourth with the main central tone as the lowest note. Many of the ritual Easter melodies known as [[Hayivky]] fall into this category. The [[tetrachord]]al system is also found in wedding and harvest songs. Folk dances often have melodies based on two tetrachords fused together.

*The pentatonic scale in [[anhemitonic]] form is common in spring songs known as [[Vesnianky]].

*The bulk of Ukrainian folk songs melodies are based on scales identical to m?dieval [[Modus (medieval music)|modes]], but differ in melodic structure. The [[Mixolydian]] and [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] modes are used more often than [[Ionian mode|Ionian]] and [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]] modes. This is a feature of traditional paraliturgical [[Koliadky]].

*The augmented 2nd interval is found, as well as the raising of the fourth and seventh degree of the scale. It is often used for melodic expression. This melodic manner gives an effect that is described as adding severe tension or sadness in some Ukrainian songs. The phenomenon is not found in Russian folk songs and is thought to have been introduced or developed in the 17th century.

=== Traditional ethnic Ukrainian vocal music and performers ===
Ukrainian folk song singing style can be divided into a number of broad aesthetic categories.

1. Solo singing – primarily ritual songs including [[holosinnya]] sung at wakes.

2. Solo singing with instrumental accompaniment by professional itinerant singers known as [[kobzari]] or [[lirnyky]]. The highest form of development of this style of singing can be seen in the lyric historical folk epics known as ''[[Duma (epic)|dumy]]'' sung to the accompaniment of the [[bandura]], [[kobza]] or lira ([[lirnyk]]). ''Dumy'' were sung primarily in the dorian mode

3. The third is an archaic type of modal "a cappella" vocal style in which a phrase sung by a soloist is answered by a choral phrase in 2- or 3- voice vertical [[polyphony]]/[[heterophony]]/harmony. The vocal inflection here is quite mediaeval in character, and some peculiarities of distinctly Ukrainian flavor are noticeable, such as parallel fifths and octaves, and several types of plagal cadences. This type of song, once dominant, after 1650 has ceded its hegemony to the newer tonal types, but can still be found in isolated villages. This style is evident in the "[[Kolyadka]]" and "[[Shchedryk (song)|Shchedryk]]".

4. *The other vocal styles are marked by the influences exerted by European music, by paraliturgical music of [[Danylo Tuptalo]] and his circle in the early 18th century, and later by classical music and urban culture.

Ukrainian vocal musics exhibit a wide variety of forms – monodic, heterophonic, homophonic, harmonic and polyphonic.

One of the most active proponents of these styles of Ukrainian vocal music is [[Nina Matviyenko]]. In recent time groups have been established dedicated to preservation to Ukrainian traditional polyphony, notably  "Bozhychi", "Hurtopravci", "Volodar", "Korali" and "Drevo".

=== Traditional ethnic Ukrainian instrumental folk music and performers ===
[[File:1989 CPA 6114.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Soviet postage stamp depicting traditional Ukrainian musical instruments]]
Common traditional instruments include: the [[kobza]] ([[lute]]), [[bandura]], [[torban]] (bass lute), [[violin]], [[basolya]] (3-string cello), the relya or [[lira]] ([[hurdy-gurdy]]) and the [[cimbalom|tsymbaly]]; the [[sopilka]] (duct flute), [[floyara]] (open, end-blown flute), [[trembita]] (alpenhorn), [[Fife (musical instrument)|fife]], [[volynka]] (bagpipes); and the [[buben]] (frame drum), tulumbas (kettledrum), [[resheto]] (tambourine) and [[drymba]]/[[varhan]] (Jaw harp). Traditional instrumental ensembles are often known as troïstï muzyki (literally ‘three musicians’ that typically make up the ensemble, e.g. violin, sopilka and buben). When performing dance melodies instrumental performance usually includes improvisation.

The traditional dances of Ukraine include: the [[Kozak]], [[Kozachok]], [[Tropak]], [[Hopak]], [[Hrechanyky]], [[Kolomyjka]] and [[Hutsulka]], [[Metelytsia]], [[Shumka]], [[Arkan (dance)|Arkan]], [[Kateryna]] ([[La Mantovana|Kadryl]]) and [[Chabarashka]]. Dances originating outside the Ukrainian ethnic region but which are also popular include: the [[Polka]], [[Mazurka]], [[Krakowiak]], [[Csárdás]], [[Waltz]], [[Kamarynska]] and [[Barynya]]. Ukrainian instrumental and dance music has also influenced Jewish ([[Hava Nagila]]-Let's rejoyce) and Gypsy music and much of it was included in the repertoire of itinerant [[Klezmer|klezmorim]].

Early in the 20th century, [[Pavlo Humeniuk]] of Philadelphia became famous in North America for his fiddle music.

=== Traditional vocal-instrumental folk music and performers ===
[[File:Veresai.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ostap Veresai, the most famous Ukrainian kobzar of the 19th century, and his wife Kulyna]]

Although most instrumental dance music in Ukraine can be sung to, there exist in Ukraine a group of professional folk musicians who sing to their own accompaniment. These itinerant musicians were generically called [[kobzar]]i (kobzar – singular), and accompanied their singing with the [[kobza]], [[bandura]], or [[lira]]. Although their origins stretch back to antiquity, their repertoire and customs directly date back to the 17th century in which they depict the period of the conflicts between the [[Cossacks|Kozaks]] and various foreign oppressors. There were many cases of those folk singers being blind which became a stereotype in the cultural memory.

;Kobzari
The kobzari organized themselves into regional professional guild-like structures, known as a "[[Kobzars'kyj Tsekh|Kobzar Guild]]".

During Soviet era almost all of the traditional kobzari were killed, the bulk perishing during Stalin's "purges" during 1930's. Even the instrument, kobza and bandura, were prohibited and confiscated. A practice of the Ukrainian [[ethnocide]] that continued after the fall of the [[Russian Empire]].

Under the inspiration of noted traditional bandurist [[Heorhy Tkachenko|Heorhiy Tkachenko]] a [[Kobzars'kyj Tsekh|Kobzar Guild]] was re-established in 1991 in Kiev by [[Mykola Budnyk]] in order to revive and foster the ancient kobzar traditions. The Guild unites many singer-musicians in Ukraine and the [[Ukrainian diaspora]]. Many of its members are not formally Conservatory trained.

;The most notorious songs and music
* Cossacks march

=== Ritual instrumental music ===
Although not precisely definable as music, there are signals played on the ''[[trembita]]'' (a type of alpenhorn, to signify death, birth, a marriage or another significant event) by the [[Hutsuls]] in the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] mountains.

=== Pseudo-folkloric music ===
With the establishment of the Soviet regime in Ukraine a policy based on [[state atheism]] was instituted which gradually grew to an intolerance to organized religion. Religious music was not supported by the regime and in time was purged from performance. Many aspects of classical music were also branded as being bourgeois and decadent.

A movement was started in the 20's for "Proletarian songs" – music of the working people. In time it was noticed that this music only catered for the working classes in the cities and did not take into account the large percentage of Ukrainian peasants living in village setting. As a consequence, songs of the village were also defined as being also from the working class. Resulting from this reclassification the Soviet government began to give significant support to this form of music. Hence, various "fakeloric" ensembles came into existence. After World War II huge resources continued to be given to support this style of music in order to displace the onslaught of mass culture from the West.

Numerous folk choirs were established such as the [[Veriovka folk choir]] directed by [[Hryhoriy Veriovka]]. A stylized dance troupe was established by [[Pavlo Virsky]] based on a synthesis of ethnographic dance and ballet. Particularly popular were the numerous Bandurist Capellas. These particular pseudo-folk forms blending ethnographic materials in an art setting have also become popular in the [[Ukrainian diaspora]] in North America.

=== Traditional music and the Bandura ===
In North America pseudo-folk or "reconstructive" bandurists such as [[Zinoviy Shtokalko]], [[Hryhory Kytasty|Hryhoriy Kytasty]], [[Julian Kytasty]], [[Victor Mishalow]], et al. have played a significant role in defining Ukrainian ethnicity in the New World, while fusing traditional musical material with new possibilities offered by contemporary instruments.

=== Traditional music of non-Ukrainian ethnic minorities in Ukraine ===
Of the traditional musics of non-Ukrainian ethnic minorities living in Ukraine possibly the richest and most developed is that of Jewish [[Klezmer]] music which can trace most of its origins to the Jewish [[Pale of Settlement]] and to South-western Ukraine. It is estimated that one third of the total Jewish population of Europe lived on Ukrainian ethnic territory at the turn of the 19th century

[[Russian music]] has also had a strong base for development in Ukraine. Many of the early performers on [[Russian folk instruments]] came from Ukraine and these performers often included Ukrainian melodies in their repertoire. The 4 string Russian [[domra]] continues to be used and taught in Ukraine despite the fact that it has been replaced by the 3 string [[domra]] in Russia proper.

=== Ukrainized versions and borrowed music ===
* [[Polonaise]]
* [[The Hills of Manchuria]] ({{lang-uk|?? ?????? ???????i? – ?? ???'?????}})

=== Popular Ukrainian folk songs ===
*"[[Ikhav Kozak za Dunaj]]"
*"[[Pidmanula Pidvela]]"
*"[[Nich Yaka Misyachna]]"
*"[[Shchedryk (song)|Shchedryk]]" – originally an ancient folk chant arranged by [[Mykola Leontovych]]
*''[[Zaporozhets za Dunayem]]'' – comic opera based on popular folk song
*"[[Oi ne khody Hrystiu]]" – by popular folk artist [[Marusia Churai]]
*"[[Rospryagayte Chloptzi Koney]]" – originally Ukrainian folk song

== Art (Classical) music ==
Ukrainian art (classical) music can be divided up into ethnic sub-categories:

*1) Composers and performers of Ukrainian ethnicity living in Ukraine.
*2) Composers and performers of non-Ukrainian ethnicity who were born or at some time were citizens or were active in Ukraine.
*3) Ethnic Ukrainian composers and performers living outside of Ukraine within the Ukrainian [[diaspora]].

The music of the above groups differs considerably, as did the audiences for whom they cater.

The first category is closely tied with the Ukrainian national school of music spearheaded by [[Mykola Lysenko]]. It includes such composers as [[Kyrylo Stetsenko]], [[Mykola Leontovych]], [[Levko Revutsky]], and [[Sydir Vorobkevych]]. Most of their music contains Ukrainian folk figures and are composed to Ukrainian texts.

The second category is of particular importance and international visibility, because of the large percentage of ethnic minorities in urban Ukraine. This category includes such composers as [[Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart|Franz Xavier Mozart]], [[Isaak Dunayevsky]], [[Rheinhold Gliere]], [[Yuliy Meitus]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev]], performers [[Vladimir Horowitz|Volodymyr Horovyts]], [[David Oistrakh]], [[Sviatoslav Richter]] and [[Isaac Stern]]. The music of these composers rarely contains Ukrainian folk motives and more often is written to the texts of Russian or Polish poets.

In the third category we have a number of prominent individuals who are often not part of the mainstream Ukrainian culture but who have made a significant impact on music in Ukraine, while living outside of its borders. These include historic individuals such as: [[Dmytro Bortniansky|Bortniansky]], [[Maksym Berezovsky|Berezovsky]], [[Artemy Vedel|Vedel]], [[Tuptalo]] and [[Titov]]. It also contains Soviet composers such as [[Mykola Roslavets]] and [[Isaak Dunayevsky]] who were born in Ukraine but who moved to other cultural centres within the Soviet Union. In North America we have [[Mykola Fomenko]], [[Yuriy Oliynyk]], [[Zinoviy Lawryshyn]] and [[Wasyl Sydorenko]].

=== Baroque and classical music ===
During the Baroque period, music was an important discipline for those that had received a higher education in Ukraine. It had a place of considerable importance in the curriculum of the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]]. Much of the nobility was well versed in music with many Ukrainian Cossack leaders such as (Mazepa, Paliy, Holovatyj, Sirko) being accomplished players of the [[kobza]], [[bandura]] or [[torban]].

In the course of the 18th century in the Russian Empire court musicians were typically trained at the music academy in [[Hlukhiv]], and largely came from Ukraine. Notable performers of the era include [[Timofiy Bilohradsky|Tymofiy Bilohradsky]] who later studied [[lute]] under [[Sylvius Leopold Weiss]] in Dresden, his daughter [[Yelizabetha Bilohradska|Yelyzaveta]] who was a famous operatic soprano, and [[Alexey Razumovsky|Oleksiy Rozumovsky]], a court bandurist and the [[morganatic]] husband of Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]].

The first professional music academy was set up in [[Hlukhiv music academy|Hlukhiv]], Ukraine in 1738 and students were taught to sing, play violin and bandura from manuscripts. As a result many of the earliest composers and performers within the Russian empire were ethnically Ukrainian, having been born or educated in Hlukhiv, or had been closely associated with this music school.

=== Romantic and nationalist schools ===
[[Mykola Lysenko]], [[Mykola Leontovych]], [[Kyrylo Stetsenko]], [[Yakiv Stepovy]]

=== Soviet Romantic school ===
[[Rheinhold Gliere]], [[Borys Lyatoshynsky]], [[Lev Revutsky]], [[Mykola Vilinsky]], [[Anatoliy Kos-Anatol'sky]], [[Andriy Shtoharenko]], [[Mykola Dremliuha]], [[Samuel Maykapar]], [[Oleksandr Bilash]], [[Ivan Karabyts]].
*''See also:[[Soviet music]]''

=== Soviet modernist school ===
[[Myroslav Skoryk]], [[Yevhen Stankovych]], [[Ivan Karabyts]],

=== Avant garde music ===
Ukraine and its diaspora have also produced a great number of fine avant-garde composers with widely varying degrees of affinity with the folk idioms, such as
* [[Virko Baley]],
* [[Valentin Silvestrov]],
* [[Leonid Hrabovsky]].
There are also musicians that are difficult to categorize, such as
* [[Mariana Sadovska]] – avantgarde and folk singer and composer
* [[Roman Turovsky]] – [[Musical historicism|historicist]] lutenist-composer

=== Early music revival ===
There are also musicians in Ukraine (Kostyantyn Chechenya, Vadym Borysenko) and in diaspora (Volodymyr Smishkevych, [[Julian Kytasty]], [[Roman Turovsky]]) who have been preserving Ukrainian music of the Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque Eras.

The '''music of [[Belize]]''' has a mix of [[Belizean Creole people|Kriol]], [[Mestizo]], [[Garifuna music|Garifuna]], and [[Maya people|Maya]] influences. After many centuries of Maya habitation, British colonizers arrived in the area in the 17th century. Belize was Britain's only colony in Spanish-dominated Central America until self-government in 1964 and gaining full Independence in 1981. Belize is still part of the Commonwealth of Nations. Far more influential than this presence, however, was the importation of African slaves.

==European and African influences==
Europeans brought [[polka]]s, [[waltz]]es, [[schottische]]s and [[quadrille]]s, while Africans brought numerous instruments and percussion-based musics, including [[marimba]]. African culture resulted in the creation of [[brukdown]] music in interior logging camps, played using [[banjo]], [[guitar]], [[drum]]s, dingaling [[bell (instrument)|bell]], [[accordion]] and an [[donkey|ass]]'s [[jaw]] [[bone]] played by running a stick up and down the teeth.

==Mestizo music==
Mestizo culture in north and west Belize, and also [[Guatemala]], is characterised by [[marimba]], a [[xylophone]]-like instrument descended from an African [[musical instrument|instrument]]. Marimba bands use [[drum set]]s, [[double bass]] and sometimes other instruments. Famous performers include Alma Belicena and the Los Angeles Marimba Band. In Benque Viejo Del Carmen, the Los Angeles Marimbas were owned by the Castellanos family, whose patriarch, Ernesto Castellanos was both musician and master marimba maker. They gave scheduled weekend performances at the Los Angeles Club (also owned by the Castellanos Family) on Church Street in Benque Viejo Del Carmen.

[[Cumbia]] music is mostly performed by bands in the northern region of the country where Mestizos are abundant. Cumbia is a genre of music with similar qualities to the salsa and merengue.

==Kriol Music==
{{main|Brukdown}}

Among the most popular styles created by [[Belizean Kriol people|Kriol]] musicians is [[brukdown]]. [[Brukdown]] evolved out of the music and dance of loggers, especially a form called [[buru]]. Buru was often satirical in nature, and eventually grew more urban, accompanied by a donkey's jawbone, [[drum]]s and a [[banjo]]. The word ''brukdown'' may come from ''broken down calypso'', referring to the similarities between brukdown and [[Trinidad]]ian [[calypso music]]; the presence of large numbers of [[Jamaica]]ns in Belize also led to an influence from [[mento]] music.

In modern forms, new instruments have been added to brukdown. The "boom and chime groups" use [[bass guitar]], [[electric guitar]] and [[conga]]s, for example. Popular brukdown groups include The Tigers, The Mahogany Chips, Mimi Female Duet and Brad Pattico. Brukdown remains a rural, rarely recorded genre.

==Garifuna music==
{{main|Garifuna music}}
The [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] (also called Garinagu) are descended from escaped [[Island Carib]]s who were deported from [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] to Central America (especially [[Honduras]] and also [[Belize]]) in 1802 by the [[United Kingdom|British]] when they conquered St. Vincent. The Garifunas kept themselves apart from the social system then dominant, leading to a distinctive culture that developed throughout the 20th century.

Forms of Garifuna folk music and dance encompass many styles including: punta, hungu-hungu, combination, wanaragua, abaimahani, matamuerte, laremuna wadaguman, gunjai, charikanari, sambai, charikanari, eremuna egi, paranda, berusu, punta rock, teremuna ligilisi, arumahani, and Mali-amalihani. [[Punta]] and [[Punta rock]] are the most popular forms of dance music in Garifuna culture. Punta is performed around holidays and at parties, and other social events. Punta lyrics are usually composed by the women. [[Chumba]] and [[hunguhungu]] are circular dances in a three beat rhythm, which are often combined with punta. There are other songs typical to each gender, women having [[eremwu eu]] and abaimajani, rhythmic [[a cappella]] songs, and laremuna wadaguman, men's [[work song]]s.

Drums play an important role in Garifuna music. These drums are typically made of hollowed-out hardwood such as mahogany or mayflower, with the skins coming from the peccary (wild bush pig), deer, or sheep. Also used in combination with the drums are the sisera. These shakers are made from the dried fruit of the gourd tree, filled with seeds, then fitted with hardwood handles.

In contemporary Belize there has been a resurgence of Garifuna music, popularized by musicians such as [[Andy Palacio]], Mohobub Flores, & Adrian Martinez. These musicians have taken many aspects from traditional Garifuna music forms and fused them with more modern sounds in a style described as a mixture of punta rock and paranda. One great example is Andy Palacio's album Watina released on the Belizean record label "Stone Tree Records."

==Modern music==
Belize's musical base has expanded considerably in recent years with the addition of local [[reggae]], [[reggaeton]], [[Punta music|punta]], [[Soca music|soca]], [[dancehall]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[rock music|rock]], and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] acts. 

However, despite growing local scenes, modern music from other [[Caribbean]] nations (primarily [[Jamaica|Jamaican]] dancehall and [[Trinidad & Tobago|Trinidadian]] soca ), as well as commercial [[pop music]] from the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] still remain the most popular genres of music among young Belizeans.

The '''sine-Gordon equation''' is a nonlinear hyperbolic [[partial differential equation]] in 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 dimensions involving the [[d'Alembert operator]] and the [[sine function|sine]] of the unknown function. It was originally introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=Edmond|last=Bour|authorlink=Edmond Bour|year=1862}} in the course of study of [[pseudosphere|surfaces of constant negative curvature]] as the [[Gauss–Codazzi equation]] for surfaces of curvature –1 in 3-space,<ref name="Bour1862">{{cite journal

== Origin of the equation and its name ==

There are two equivalent forms of the sine-Gordon equation. In the ([[real number|real]]) ''space-time coordinates'', denoted (''x'',&nbsp;''t''), the equation reads:<ref name="Rajaraman1989">{{cite book

Passing to the ''light cone coordinates'' (''u'',&nbsp;''v''), akin to ''asymptotic coordinates'' where

: <math> u=\frac{x+t}2, \quad v=\frac{x-t}2, </math>

the equation takes the form:<ref name="Polyanin2004">{{cite book

:<math>\varphi_{uv} = \sin\varphi.\,</math>

This is the original form of the sine-Gordon equation, as it was considered in the nineteenth century in the course of investigation of [[differential geometry of surfaces|surfaces]] of constant [[Gaussian curvature]] ''K''&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;1, also called [[pseudospherical surface]]s. Choose a coordinate system for such a surface in which the coordinate mesh ''u''&nbsp;=&nbsp;constant, ''v''&nbsp;=&nbsp;constant is given by the [[asymptotic curve|asymptotic line]]s parameterized with respect to the arc length. The [[first fundamental form]] of the surface in these coordinates has a special form

: <math> ds^2 = du^2 + 2\cos\varphi \,du\, dv + dv^2,\, </math>

where <math> \varphi </math> expresses the angle between the asymptotic lines, and for the [[second fundamental form]], ''L''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. Then the [[Codazzi-Mainardi equation]] expressing a compatibility condition between the first and second fundamental forms results in the sine-Gordon equation. The study of this equation and of the associated transformations of pseudospherical surfaces in the 19th century by [[Luigi Bianchi|Bianchi]] and [[Albert Victor Bäcklund|Bäcklund]] led to the discovery of [[Bäcklund transformation]]s.

The name "sine-Gordon equation" is a pun on the well-known [[Klein–Gordon equation]] in physics:

:<math> \varphi_{tt}- \varphi_{xx} + \varphi\ = 0.\,</math>

The sine-Gordon equation is the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] of the field whose [[Lagrangian density]] is given by

:<math>\mathcal{L}_\text{SG}(\varphi) = \frac{1}{2}(\varphi_t^2 - \varphi_x^2) - 1 + \cos\varphi.</math>

Using the Taylor series expansion of the [[cosine]] in the Lagrangian,

:<math>\cos(\varphi) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-\varphi ^2)^n}{(2n)!},</math>

it can be rewritten as the [[Scalar_field_theory#Linear_.28free.29_theory|Klein–Gordon Lagrangian]] plus higher order terms

:<math>
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_\text{SG}(\varphi) & = \frac{1}{2}(\varphi_t^2 - \varphi_x^2) - \frac{\varphi^2}{2} + \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{(-\varphi^2)^n}{(2n)!} \\
& = \mathcal{L}_\text{KG}(\varphi) + \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{(-\varphi^2)^n}{(2n)!}.
\end{align}
</math>

== Soliton solutions ==

An interesting feature of the sine-Gordon equation is the existence of [[soliton]] and multisoliton solutions.

=== 1-soliton solutions ===
The sine-Gordon equation has the following 1-[[soliton]] solutions:

:<math>\varphi_\text{soliton}(x, t) := 4 \arctan e^{m \gamma (x - v t) + \delta}\,</math>

where

: <math>\gamma^2 = \frac{1}{1 - v^2}.</math>

and the slightly more general form of the equation is assumed:

:<math>\, \varphi_{tt}- \varphi_{xx} + m^2 \sin\varphi = 0.</math>

The 1-soliton solution for which we have chosen the positive root for <math>\gamma</math> is called a ''kink'', and represents a twist in the variable <math>\varphi</math> which takes the system from one solution <math>\varphi=0</math> to an adjacent with <math>\varphi=2\pi</math>. The states <math>\varphi=0(\textrm{mod}2\pi)</math> are known as vacuum states as they are constant solutions of zero energy. The 1-soliton solution in which we take the negative root for <math>\gamma</math> is called an ''antikink''.  The form of the 1-soliton solutions can be obtained through application of a Bäcklund transform to the trivial (constant vacuum) solution and the integration of the resulting first-order differentials:

:<math>{\varphi^\prime}_u = \varphi_u + 2\beta\sin\left(\frac{\varphi^\prime + \varphi}{2}\right),</math>

:<math>{\varphi^\prime}_v = -\varphi_v + \frac{2}{\beta} \sin\left(\frac{\varphi^\prime - \varphi}{2}\right)\text{ with }\varphi = \varphi_0 = 0</math>

for all time.

The 1-soliton solutions can be visualized with the use of the elastic ribbon sine–Gordon model as discussed by ''Dodd and co-workers''.<ref name="Dodd1982">{{cite book

The alternative counterclockwise ([[Right-hand rule|right-handed]]) twist with topological charge <math>\vartheta_{\textrm{AK}}=+1</math> will be an antikink.

=== 2-soliton solutions ===

Multi-[[soliton]] solutions can be obtained through continued application of the [[Bäcklund transform]] to the 1-soliton solution, as prescribed by a [[Bianchi lattice]] relating the transformed results.<ref name="Rogers2002">{{cite book

}}</ref> The 2-soliton solutions of the sine-Gordon equation show some of the characteristic features of the solitons. The traveling sine–Gordon kinks and/or antikinks pass through each other as if perfectly permeable, and the only observed effect is a [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]]. Since the colliding solitons recover their [[velocity]] and [[shape]] such kind of [[interaction]] is called an [[elastic collision]].

| [[Image:Sine gordon 4.gif|frame|''Kink-kink'' collision.<ref name="Georgiev2004"/><ref name="Georgiev2007"/>]]
|}

Another interesting 2-soliton solutions arise from the possibility of coupled kink-antikink behaviour known as a ''[[breather]]''. There are known three types of breathers: ''standing breather'', ''traveling large amplitude breather'', and ''traveling small amplitude breather''.<ref name = "mir">Miroshnichenko A, Vasiliev A, Dmitriev S. ''[http://homepages.tversu.ru/~s000154/collision/main.html Solitons and Soliton Collisions].''</ref>

|-
| [[Image:Sine gordon 7.gif|frame|''Small-amplitude moving breather'' &mdash; looks exotic but essentially has a breather envelope.<ref name="Georgiev2004"/><ref name="Georgiev2007"/>]]
|}

=== 3-soliton solutions ===

3-soliton collisions between a traveling kink and a standing breather or a traveling antikink and a standing breather results in a phase shift of the standing breather. In the process of collision between a moving kink and a standing breather,
the shift of the breather <math>\Delta_{\textrm{B}}</math> is given by:

: <math>\Delta_B =\frac{2\textrm{arctanh}\sqrt{(1-\omega^{2})(1-v_\text{K}^2)}}{\sqrt{1-\omega^{2}}}</math>

where <math>v_\text{K}</math> is the velocity of the kink, and <math>\omega</math> is the breather's frequency.<ref name = "mir"/> If the old position of the standing breather is <math>x_{0}</math>, after the collision the new position will be <math>x_0 + \Delta_\text{B}</math>.

==Related equations==

The '''{{visible anchor|sinh–Gordon equation}}''' is given by 

:<math>\varphi_{xx}- \varphi_{tt} = \sinh\varphi.\,</math>

This is the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] of the [[Lagrangian]]

:<math>\mathcal{L}={1\over 2}(\varphi_t^2 - \varphi_x^2) - \cosh\varphi.\,</math>

Another closely related equation is the '''elliptic sine-Gordon equation''', given by

:<math>\varphi_{xx} + \varphi_{yy} = \sin\varphi,\,</math>

where <math>\varphi</math> is now a function of the variables ''x'' and ''y''. This is no longer a soliton equation, but it has many similar properties, as it is related to the sine-Gordon equation by the [[analytic continuation]] (or [[Wick rotation]]) ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;i''t''.

The '''elliptic sinh–Gordon equation''' may be defined in a similar way.

A generalization is given by [[Toda field theory]].

==Quantum version==

In quantum field theory the sine–Gordon model contains a parameter, it can be identified with [[Planck constant]]. The particle spectrum consists of a soliton, an anti-soliton and a finite (possibly zero) number of breathers. The number of the breathers depends on the value of the parameter. Multi particle productions cancels on mass shell. Vanishing of two into four amplitude  was explicitly checked in one loop approximation. 

Semi-classical quantization of the sine–Gordon model was done by [[Ludwig Faddeev]] and [[Vladimir Korepin]].<ref name="Faddeev1978">{{cite journal

|bibcode = 1978PhR....42....1F }}</ref> The exact quantum scattering matrix was discovered by [[Alexander Zamolodchikov]].
This model is [[S-duality|S-dual]] to the [[Thirring model]].

==In finite volume and on a half line==

One can also consider the sine–Gordon model on a circle, on a line segment, or on a half line. It is possible to find boundary conditions which preserve the integrability of the model. On a half line the spectrum contains [[boundary bound state]]s in addition to the solitons and breathers.

==Supersymmetric sine–Gordon model==

A supersymmetric extension of the sine–Gordon model also exists. Integrability preserving boundary conditions for this extension can be found as well.

'''Michael John "Mike" McCarthy''' (born November 10, 1963) is a professional [[American football]] coach, currently serving as the head coach of the [[National Football League]]'s [[Green Bay Packers]].

==Early life==
McCarthy was born and raised in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].  His father was a [[Pittsburgh Fire Bureau|firefighter]] and [[Pittsburgh Police]] officer as well as a bar owner, who raised McCarthy as a [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] fan.<ref>{{Cite news|last=King|first=Peter|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/peter_king/01/23/championships/index.html|title=Super Bowl XLV, pitting Packers vs. Steelers, is one for history books|publisher=SportsIllustrated.com|date=January 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Branch|first=John|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/sports/football/26mccarthy.html?_r=2|title=Packers’ Coach Has Fans in a Small Slice of Steelertown|publisher=NewYorkTimes.com|date=January 25, 2011}}</ref>

==Playing career==
McCarthy was a [[tight end]] at [[Baker University]], a [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] school located in [[Baldwin City, Kansas]].

==Coaching career==
===College===
After serving as a [[graduate assistant]] at [[Fort Hays State University|Fort Hays State]] from 1987 to 1988, McCarthy returned home to Pittsburgh and was hired in 1989 to work under [[Paul Hackett (American football)|Paul Hackett]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where he served as quarterbacks coach for three seasons before coaching wide receivers during the 1992 season.  At first and during the off season he also worked on the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] to supplement his income.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/peter_king/01/23/championships/index.html | work=CNN | title=Super Bowl XLV, pitting Packers vs. Steelers, is one for history books | date=January 24, 2011}}</ref>

===NFL===
====Assistant coach====
In 1993, McCarthy began a stint with the NFL's [[Kansas City Chiefs]]; after working two years as an offensive quality control assistant, McCarthy became quarterbacks coach, overseeing the work of [[Rich Gannon]], [[Elvis Grbac]], and [[Steve Bono]]. McCarthy spent the 1999 season in the same position with the Packers, coaching [[Brett Favre]] in a season when Favre threw for 4,091 yards, the fourth-best total of his career.

After the Packers released the entire coaching staff following the 1999 season, McCarthy became the offensive coordinator of the [[New Orleans Saints]]. He would remain in that position for five seasons and was selected as NFC Assistant Coach of the Year by [[USA Today]] in 2000.  He would largely be the reason behind the successful development of talents such as QB [[Aaron Brooks (American football)|Aaron Brooks]], RB [[Deuce McAllister]], and WR [[Joe Horn]].  New Orleans would finish 10th, 13th, 3rd in 2002, 14th, and 14th in points scored during his tenure as offensive coordinator.  In his first two years, RB [[Ricky Williams]] would run for 2,245 yards with 14 TD under McCarthy's guidance before being traded to the [[Miami Dolphins]].

In [[2005 NFL season|2005]], McCarthy served as offensive coordinator for the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. His unit, beset by injuries and led by a rookie quarterback ([[2005 NFL Draft|top draft pick]] [[Alex Smith]]), finished the season ranked last in the NFL in points scored and yards gained.  Despite this, RB [[Frank Gore]] would emerge to run for over 600 yards with a 4.8 YPC and WR [[Brandon Lloyd]] had 733 yards receiving and 5 TD.

====Head coach====
=====Return to Green Bay=====
[[File:Mike McCarthy - San Francisco vs Green Bay 2012 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|McCarthy in 2012 with the Packers.]]

In 2006, the Packers started with a 4–8 record, but managed to win their last four games to finish the season 8–8, ending with a win against their archrival Chicago Bears, but missing the playoffs for the second straight year.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pro Football Reference | title = 2006 Green Bay Packers | url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/gnb/2006.htm| accessdate = 2007-01-12 }}</ref>

In 2007, McCarthy guided the Packers to an 8–1 record in the first 9 games of the [[2007 Green Bay Packers season|2007 season]]. McCarthy recorded the best win-loss ratio to start the first 25 games of a career among active coaches, setting the record for the best coaching start in Packers' history (Vince Lombardi went 15–10) and tying Washington's [[Joe Gibbs]] at 16–9.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fly | first=Colin | title = McCarthy stays true to Packers' plan, sits atop NFC with best start among active coaches | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-11-12-3091823810_x.htm| accessdate = 2007-11-12 | work=USA Today | date=November 12, 2007}}</ref> McCarthy led the Packers to a 13–3 record and made it to the [[NFC Championship]] game, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl-winning [[New York Giants]] in overtime.

In 2008, McCarthy became embroiled in a major controversy involving the future of their franchise quarterback, [[Brett Favre]]. The controversy started when Favre, after having announced his retirement, changed his mind, deciding to play again. Favre had assumed that he would be given the starting quarterback job again. McCarthy and Packers' general manager [[Ted Thompson]] had stated their desire to move forward with new starter [[Aaron Rodgers]]. Favre was offered the opportunity to be the back up to Rodgers, an offer which Favre refused. Favre was ultimately traded to the [[2008 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] for a conditional fourth-round draft pick.<ref>{{cite web |last=ESPN.com | title = Jets set for Brett: Packers legend headed to New York | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/trainingcamp08/news/story?id=3522971| accessdate = 2008-08-07 }}</ref>

The [[2008 Green Bay Packers season|2008 season]] was McCarthy's worst to date with the Packers.  Despite a solid showing by Rodgers, who threw for over 4,000 yards and posted a 93.8 [[passer rating]],<ref>{{cite web |last=ESPN.com | title = Aaron Rodgers stats | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/stats?playerId=8439| accessdate = 2009-08-07 }}</ref> the Packers started with a 5–5 record, proceeding to lose five consecutive close games until they ended the disappointing season with a 31–21 victory over the [[2008 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]. (The Lions are only the second team in the NFL's post-merger (the NFL and original AFL [[AFL-NFL merger|merged]] prior to the [[1970 NFL season|1970 season]]) history to go winless in a single season, and the first to go 0–16 in one season after the NFL's transition to a 16-game schedule in [[1978 NFL season|1978]].)<ref>{{cite web |last=Pro Football Reference | title = 2008 Detroit Lions | url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/det/2008.htm| accessdate = 2009-08-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Pro Football Reference | title = 2008 Green Bay Packers | url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/gnb/2008.htm| accessdate = 2009-08-07 }}</ref> At 6–10, the Packers finished 3rd in the NFC North, only ahead of the Lions, and did not make the playoffs.

In [[2009 Green Bay Packers season|2009]], the Packers showed some signs of improvement, but also had struggles. Rodgers improved on 2008's statistics, but was sacked 50 times, more than any other QB in the NFL. The Packers dominated teams with losing records, but were swept by their rival [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], led by former Packers franchise QB [[Brett Favre]]. The Packers lost to the previously winless [[2009 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], but then came back to beat the NFC East-leading [[2009 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Pro Football Reference | title = 2009 Green Bay Packers | url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/gnb/2009.htm| accessdate = 2009-11-19 }}</ref> They then began a five-game winning streak, and the Packers qualified for the playoffs with a Week 17 win over the [[2009 Arizona Cardinals season|Cardinals]], finishing at 11–5, the second playoff berth in McCarthy's tenure.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dougherty | first=Pete | title = Green Bay Packers rout Seattle Seahawks 48–10, clinch playoff berth | url=http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/20091227/PKR01/91227024/1954/PKR03| accessdate = 2009-12-27 }}</ref>  The Packers lost the Wild Card round  to the [[Arizona Cardinals]] in overtime, 51–45, .<ref>{{cite web |last=Dougherty |first=Pete |title=Green Bay Packers lose to Arizona Cardinals 51–45 in NFC playoff game | url=http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/20100110/PKR01/100110040/1954/PKR03 |accessdate=2010-01-10}}</ref>

In [[2010 Green Bay Packers season|2010]], McCarthy led the Packers to a 10–6 finish, never losing by more than four points and never trailing by more than 7 throughout the entire season. This record was good for 2nd in the NFC North, behind the arch-rival [[2010 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], with whom they split victories in the regular season. They finished as the sixth seed in the NFC.<ref>{{Packers.com 2010 schedule | url=http://www.packers.com/gameday/schedule.html| accessdate = 2011-01-18 }}</ref>  The Packers went on to defeat the number three-seeded [[2010 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] and then the number one-seeded [[2010 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]].  In the [[NFC Championship game]] they played the second-seeded Chicago Bears for the third time that season.  They won 21–14 and advanced to [[Super Bowl XLV]] where they played the [[2010 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]].  [[Super Bowl XLV]] was the first time these two storied franchises played each other in the postseason. The Green Bay Packers defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 31–25 to win their fourth [[Super Bowl]] and 13th [[List of NFL Championships won|NFL title]] overall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=310206009|title=Aaron Rodgers tosses 3 TD passes as Packers drop Steelers to win Super Bowl XLV|date=February 6, 2011|work=ESPN|accessdate=2011-02-07}}</ref>

McCarthy signed a 3-year contract extension on March 4, 2011.<ref>http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/03/04/mike-mccarthy-signs-contract-extension/</ref>

With a victory over the [[Washington Redskins]] in week 2 of the 2013 season, McCarthy passed [[Mike Holmgren]] for third on the Packers' all-time wins list, behind only Hall of Famers [[Curly Lambeau]] and [[Vince Lombardi]].

In November 2014,  McCarthy signed a contract extention through 2018.

The '''Nimzo-Indian Defence''' is a [[chess opening]] characterised by the moves:
:1. [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4|d4]] [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...Nf6|Nf6]]
:2. [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...Nf6/2. c4|c4]] [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...Nf6/2. c4/2...e6|e6]]
:3. [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...Nf6/2. c4/2...e6/3. Nc3|Nc3]] [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...Nf6/2. c4/2...e6/3. Nc3/3...Bb4|Bb4]]

Other move orders, such as 1.c4 e6 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.d4 Bb4, are also feasible. In the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]]'', the Nimzo-Indian is classified as E20–E59.

This [[hypermodernism (chess)|hypermodern]] opening was developed by [[International Grandmaster|Grandmaster]] [[Aron Nimzowitsch]] who introduced it to master-level [[chess]] in the early 20th century. Unlike most [[Indian Defence|Indian openings]], the Nimzo-Indian does not involve an immediate [[fianchetto]], although Black often follows up with ...b6 and ...Bb7. By pinning White's [[knight (chess)|knight]] Black prevents the threatened 4.e4 and seeks to inflict [[doubled pawns]] on White. White will attempt to create a pawn centre and develop his pieces to prepare for an assault on the Black position.

Black's delay in committing to a [[pawn structure]] makes the Nimzo-Indian (sometimes colloquially referred to as the "Nimzo") a very flexible defence to [[1.d4]]. It can also transpose into lines of the [[Queen's Gambit]] or [[Queen's Indian Defense|Queen's Indian Defence]]. The Nimzo-Indian is a highly respected defence to 1.d4, is played at all levels and has been played by every world champion since [[José Raúl Capablanca|Capablanca]]. White often plays 3.g3 or 3.Nf3 to avoid the Nimzo-Indian, allowing him to meet 3.Nf3 Bb4+ (the [[Bogo-Indian Defence]]) with 4.Bd2 or 4.Nbd2, rather than 4.Nc3.

In the Nimzo-Indian, Black is generally prepared to concede the bishop pair by playing Bxc3. As dynamic compensation, he often doubles White's c-pawns, which represent a static weakness, and gains play against the central light squares d5 and e4, even in those instances where White is able to recapture with a piece after ...Bxc3. Black will aim to close the position to reduce the scope of White's bishops. To this end, Black must blockade the white pawn centre from advancing and neutralise White's attacking chances on the kingside. An example of Black's strategy carried out successfully is the [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1032174 game] [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] versus [[Samuel Reshevsky]] from the [[World Chess Championship 1948|1948 World Chess Championship]], which reached the position in the diagram after White's 24th move.

Earlier in the game, Reshevsky was able to block White's [[kingside]] attack by playing Nf6–e8 and f7–f5. Now, both White's bishops are reduced to defence, and White's queen is reduced to passivity at the a2-square to defend the pawns on a3 and c4. Without prospects for counterplay, White's game is strategically hopeless, and Black ultimately exchanged queens and won the [[endgame (chess)|endgame]].

The '''Rubinstein System''' (named after [[Akiba Rubinstein]]) is White's most common method of combating the Nimzo-Indian. [[Svetozar Gligori?]] and [[Lajos Portisch]] made great contributions to the theory and practice of this line at top level during their careers. White continues his development before committing to a definite plan of action. In reply, Black has three main moves to choose from: '''4...0-0''', '''4...c5''', and '''4...b6'''.

In addition, Black sometimes plays '''4...d5''' or '''4...Nc6'''. '''4...d5''' can transpose to lines arising from 4...0-0, but White has the extra option of 5.a3 (known as the '''[[Mikhail Botvinnik|Botvinnik]] Variation'''). This forces Black to retreat the bishop to e7 or capture on c3, which transposes to a line of the Sämisch Variation long considered good for White because he will undouble his pawns at some point by playing cxd5, eliminating the weak pawn on c4, then prepare the e4 pawn break, backed by the bishop pair, which will gain force in the more open type of position which will ensue. 4...Nc6 is the '''Taimanov Variation''', named after Russian GM [[Mark Taimanov]]. Black prepares to play ...e5, which may be preceded by...d5 and ...dxc4, or ...d6. The variation was tried several times by the young [[Bobby Fischer]], and has long been favoured by GM [[Nukhim Rashkovsky]].

Black's most flexible and frequently played response is 4...0-0. The main line continues 5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 c5 7.0-0, reaching the position in the diagram.

White has completed his kingside development, while Black has claimed his share of the centre. At this point, the most important continuations are:

:7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nbd7 (Parma Variation)
:7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 cxd4 9.exd4 b6 (Karpov Variation)
:7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nc6 9.a3 Ba5 (Larsen Variation)
:7...Nc6 8.a3 Bxc3 9.bxc3 dxc4 10.Bxc4 Qc7 (Main Variation)
:7...Nc6 8.a3 Bxc3 9.bxc3 Qc7 (Khasin Variation)
:7...Nbd7 (Averbakh Variation)

* The '''Parma Variation''' (7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nbd7) is named after Slovenian grandmaster [[Bruno Parma]], and can sometimes transpose to the Karpov Variation if pawns are exchanged on d4. White usually continues with 9.Qe2, clearing the d1-square for the rook, which will assist in the advance of the d-pawn. Black then faces an important decision. He may play 9...b6, with the intention of playing ...cxd4 at some point to isolate the d-pawn and blockade it, or exchange on c3 as well to play against the isolated c3–d4 pawn couple. Or, he can consider 9...a6 to grab space on the [[queenside]] with ...b5. In this case, Black will usually retain his dark-squared bishop. Black also has two rare alternatives on his eighth move worth mentioning: 8...Qe7 intending ...Rd8 is the Smyslov Variation, invented by former World Champion [[Vasily Smyslov]], and 8...Bd7 followed by ...Bc6 is the Bronstein Variation, the brainchild of two-time world championship finalist [[David Bronstein]].

* The '''Karpov Variation''', (7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 cxd4 9.exd4 b6) named after former World Champion [[Anatoly Karpov]], is one of Black's most reliable defences to the Rubinstein System. For the moment, White has an [[isolated pawn]] in the d-file, even so, Black plans to play ...Bxc3 at some point and follow up with ...Bb7, ...Nbd7, ...R(a)c8 and ...Qc7 to restrain White's c- and d-pawns. After 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 cxd4 9.exd4 b6 the game usually continues 10.Bg5 Bb7, when 11.Ne5, 11.Re1, 11.Rc1 and 11.Qe2 are all good moves for White.

* The '''Larsen Variation''' (named after GM [[Bent Larsen]]) can be reached by either 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nc6 9.a3 Ba5 or 7...Nc6 8.a3 dxc4 9.Bxc4 Ba5, but the latter move order gives White the extra option of 9.axb4. The idea is to wait until White plays dxc5 before playing ...Bxc3. If White does not oblige, then Black will play ...Bb6 with pressure on the d-pawn. The point of inserting ...dxc4 before ...Ba5 is to prevent White from inflicting an isolated queen's pawn (IQP) on Black by playing cxd5.

* The '''Main Variation''' was enormously popular in the 1950s, but the name has become increasingly inappropriate ever since. This is not because the line is bad for Black – on the contrary, Black equalises in all variations – but because White has a huge selection of moves to choose from, and Black must be familiar with all of them. After 7...Nc6 8.a3 Bxc3 9.bxc3 dxc4 10.Bxc4 Qc7, White has tried 11.Be2, 11.Bd3, 11.Ba2, 11.Bb2, 11.Bb5 (trying to provoke ...a6 before retreating the bishop), 11.h3, 11.a4, 11.Re1, 11.Qc2, and 11.Qe2. Regardless of the move chosen, however, the basic strategic ideas remain similar: Black will play a quick ...e5 to pressurize d4. If White has a bishop on d3, then Black also threatens ...e4 forking it and the knight on f3. White will try to advance his centre pawns to free his bishops: c4, d5, and f3 followed by e4 are all possible. If Black can prevent White from achieving this, then he will enjoy the better game. There are several move orders to reach the Main Variation besides the one given above; 4.e3 0-0 5.Bd3 d5 6.a3 Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 dxc4 8.Bxc4 c5 9.Nf3 Nc6 10.0-0 is one worth noting, because White may try 9.Ne2 instead.

[[File:Khasin 1995 Bad Liebenzell.jpg|thumb|Abram Khasin, 1995]]
* 7...Nc6 8.a3 Bxc3 9.bxc3 Qc7 is the '''Khasin Variation''', named after [[International Master]] [[Abram Khasin]]. 10.cxd5 exd5 is the usual continuation. White will try to build up a strong centre with f3 and e4, or he may play for a kingside attack with f3 and g4. Black will try to restrain White's centre as well as he can, ideally blockading it, before mobilising his queenside [[pawn majority]].

* The '''Averbakh Variation''' (7...Nbd7) was popularized by Grandmasters [[Viacheslav Ragozin]] and [[Yuri Averbakh]]. The idea is to exchange pawns on c4 and d4 and then bring the d7-knight to b6 and d5. The same knight may also move to f8 to defend the black king. This line has gone out of fashion since the 1960s due to GM [[Svetozar Gligori?]]'s gambit idea 8.cxd5 exd5 9.a3 Ba5 10.b4! cxb4 11.Nb5! with pressure along the queenside files and a potential square for the knight on d6.

===4...0-0: lines with Ne2===
In general, the main line of the Rubinstein has held up very well for Black, so since the 1980s White has begun to look elsewhere for chances of obtaining an advantage. In the Rubinstein, White has often resorted to playing Ne2 rather than Nf3 at some point to be able to recapture on c3 with the knight, thus avoiding the doubled pawns. Two lines where White does this (following 4.e3 0-0) are:

:5.Nge2 (Reshevsky Variation)
:5.Bd3 d5 6.Ne2 (Modern Variation)

* The '''Reshevsky Variation''' was a specialty of GM [[Samuel Reshevsky]]. White will first play a3 to kick the bishop away, before moving his knight on e2 to a more active square. The main line runs 5.Ne2 d5 6.a3 Be7 7.cxd5, when both 7...exd5 and 7...Nxd5 are possible, the latter move leading to livelier play. GM [[Mikhail Gurevich (chess player)|Mikhail Gurevich]] is currently the foremost expert in the Reshevsky Variation.

* 5.Bd3 d5 6.Ne2 and the closely related variant 5.Bd3 d5 6.cxd5 exd5 7.Ne2 were collectively dubbed the '''Modern Variation''' by FM Carsten Hansen in his book on the Rubinstein Nimzo-Indian.<ref name="hansen">{{cite book | author=Hansen, Carsten | title=The Nimzo-Indian: 4 e3 | publisher=Gambit Publications Ltd | year=2002 | isbn=1-901983-58-7}}</ref> White again avoids the doubled pawns, but develops his bishop to d3 first so that it isn't blocked in by the knight on e2. Black usually continues 6...c5, putting more pressure on White's centre. While 7.a3 and 7.0-0 are playable, the main line is 7.cxd5 cxd4 8.exd4 Nxd5 9.0-0 Nc6, leading to an IQP position with White's knight on e2 rather than f3, as is normally the case. This gives Black the possibility of playing ...e5 at some point to completely liquidate the centre, although the resulting positions are rather drawish. White's main options on his tenth move are 10.a3, putting the question to the bishop, and 10.Bc2, intending 11.Qd3 with an attack on h7.

===4...c5===

Black puts pressure on d4 and leaves open the option of playing ...d5, or ...d6 and ...e5. The game can still transpose to the main line mentioned above after moves such as 5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0, but there are two major variations particular to 4...c5:

* '''5.Bd3 Nc6 6.Nf3''' (6.Ne2 will likely transpose to the Modern Variation) '''6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6''' is the '''Hübner Variation''', popularized by GM [[Robert Hübner]] in the late 1960s and '70s and utilised by [[Bobby Fischer]] in his world championship match with [[Boris Spassky]] in 1972 with great effect in [[World Chess Championship 1972#Game 5: Spassky 0 Fischer 1 (Nimzo–Indian Hübner)|Game 5]]. It is slightly unusual in that Black captures on c3 without waiting for White to play a3, but this is because Black intends to immediately set up a blockade on the dark squares with ...d6 and ...e5. This is feasible because White's knight is on f3; if it were on e2 (as in some lines of the Sämisch), White could quickly advance his kingside pawns, but in the current line the knight must be moved away first. By closing the position, Black is able to make his knights superior to White's bishops, and the doubled c-pawns deprive White of any pawn breaks on the queenside. It was the success of this variation that motivated the current tendency for White players to choose lines where the doubled pawns are avoided. When he does play into this line, White has two main setups to choose from: he may immediately close the centre by playing 8.e4 e5 9.d5 Ne7, or play more flexibly with 8.0-0 e5 9.Nd2 0-0, but Black has full equality in both lines.

* '''5.Ne2''' the '''Rubinstein Variation''' (this is why 4.e3 is properly referred to as the Rubinstein "system" or "complex" to avoid confusion) is similar in spirit to the Reshevsky Variation: White prevents Black from doubling his pawns. After 5.Ne2, Black opens a path of retreat for his bishop with 5...cxd4 6.exd4, and now chooses between 6...d5 and 6...0-0. 6...d5 allows 7.c5, a typical continuation being 7...Ne4 8.Bd2 Nxd2 9.Qxd2 a5 10.a3 Bxc3 11.Nxc3 a4. White's c4–c5 push created a queenside pawn majority, which Black neutralized by playing a7–a5–a4. Black will now try to destroy the rest of White's pawn formation by playing ...b6 or ...e5, while White will try to use his lead in development to create attacking chances on the kingside. The alternative is 6...0-0 7.a3 Be7. Here Kasparov played 8.d5 exd5 9.cxd5 a few times early in his career, increasing his space advantage further but falling behind in development. A safer move for White is 8.Nf4.

Favoured by Nimzowitsch, 4...b6 is a move in accordance with the spirit of the Nimzo-Indian: Black [[fianchetto]]es his light-squared bishop to increase his control over e4. White usually continues 5.Ne2, avoiding the doubled pawns, or 5.Bd3, continuing his development (5.Nf3 usually transposes to 5.Bd3). The main variations emerging from this move are:

:5.Ne2 Ba6 (Fischer Variation)
:5.Ne2 c5 (Romanishin–Psakhis Variation)
:5.Ne2 Ne4 (American Variation)
:5.Ne2 Bb7
:5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 d5 (Classical Fianchetto Variation or Tal Variation)
:5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 c5 (Keres Variation)
:5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 Ne4 (Dutch Variation)

* The '''Fischer Variation''' (5.Ne2 Ba6) aims to exchange light-squared bishops after ...d5 so that Black can play on the light squares. Keres, Bronstein and Smyslov were early contributors to the theory of this line, and [[Bobby Fischer|Fischer]] used it several times successfully. White may play 6.a3, which was favoured by [[Mikhail Botvinnik|Botvinnik]] and asks the bishop on b4 to clarify its intentions, or 6.Ng3, which was invented by Reshevsky and prepares e4.

* 5.Ne2 c5 6.a3 Ba5!? was dubbed the '''Romanishin–Psakhis Variation''' by Carsten Hansen<ref name="hansen" /> because [[Oleg Romanishin]] and [[Lev Psakhis]] were the two grandmasters who were primarily responsible for reviving the line and infusing it with new ideas. It can also arise via the move order 4.e3 c5 5.Ne2 b6 6.a3 Ba5. Black dares White to try and trap the bishop on a5, a challenge White usually takes up, but rarely successfully.

* The '''American Variation''' is another name invented by Hansen<ref name="hansen" /> for the line 5.Ne2 Ne4, as it was pioneered by GM [[Isaac Kashdan]] and then developed by GM [[Arthur Bisguier|Bisguier]], IM [[Anthony Santasiere]] and currently GM [[Nick de Firmian]]. Black will exchange off two minor pieces and play ...f5 to keep e4 under control.

* 5.Ne2 Bb7 is a rather passive line: White seems to obtain a slight advantage by continuing 6.a3 Be7 7.d5, blocking in the bishop on b7 and making e3–e4 possible.

* The '''Classical Fianchetto Variation''', also known as the '''[[Mikhail Tal|Tal]] Variation''', can be reached through two move orders: 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 d5 or 4.e3 0-0 5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 b6 7.0-0 Bb7. It is a solid variation where White often holds the initiative early on, but Black usually equalises in the end. White has two ways to attack Black's setup. The first is to play 8.cxd5 exd5 9.Ne5 followed by 10.f4 and transferring the queen or f1-rook to h3 via f3. This formation, known as the [[Harry Nelson Pillsbury|Pillsbury]] Attack, blocks in the dark-squared bishop and appears rather crude, but is actually quite dangerous. Black must create immediate pressure on White's centre by playing ...c5, and ...Ne4 may be a handy move at some point to block the b1–h7 diagonal and perhaps exchange some pieces. The main alternative for White is 8.a3 Bd6 9.cxd5 exd5 10.b4, which gains space on the queenside and makes it harder for Black to free his position with ...c5.

* The '''Keres Variation''', characterised by the moves 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 c5, is named after Estonian GM [[Paul Keres]], although Smyslov and Bronstein were also early practitioners of this line. If allowed, Black will play ...cxd4 and ...d5 in the hope of leaving White with an isolated queen's pawn. Nowadays, White's most testing continuation is reckoned to be 8.Na4, ducking the exchange on c3 and threatening 9.a3. The knight will often stay on a4 for quite some time to assist in a potential c4–c5 push. After 8...cxd4 9.exd4, Black often sets up a [[Hedgehog Defence|Hedgehog]] formation (pawns on a6, b6, d6 and e6), while White will try to pursue a strategy of gaining queenside space with b4 and c5.

* The '''Dutch Variation''' is so-called because after 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 Ne4, Black usually follows up with 7...f5, with a position that resembles the [[Dutch Defence]] (1.d4 f5). It is not a very common line, probably because White obtains good chances by playing 7.0-0 f5 8.d5, sacrificing a pawn to open up lines for his bishops.

The '''Classical''' or '''[[José Raúl Capablanca|Capablanca]] Variation''' was popular in the early days of the Nimzo-Indian, and though eventually superseded by 4.e3 it was revived in the 1990s; it is now just as popular as the Rubinstein. White aims to acquire the two bishops without compromising his pawn structure. The drawback is that the queen will move at least twice within the opening moves and that White's kingside development is delayed. Thus, even though White possesses the bishop pair, it is usually advisable for Black to open the game quickly to exploit his lead in development. Black has four common replies to 4.Qc2. These include '''4...0-0''', '''4...c5''', '''4...d5''', and '''4...Nc6'''  (4...d6 intending ...Nbd7 and ...e5 is a rarer fifth option).

* '''4...0-0 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.Qxc3 b6 7.Bg5''' is nowadays the main line of the Classical Variation (although 6...b5!? is a gambit invented by [[Alvis Vitolinš]]). Black's usual choice is 7...Bb7, but 7...Ba6 is also possible to target the c-pawn, and 7...h6 8.Bh4 c5 and 7...c5 are sometimes played as well. After 7...Bb7, White's most straightforward move is 8.f3 preparing e4, but Black can counter with 8...h6 9.Bh4 d5, when the pawn grab 10.cxd5 exd5 11.Bxf6 Qxf6 12.Qxc7 Ba6 is very dangerous for White because of Black's better development. Therefore, White has sometimes tried 8.e3 instead, when after 8...h6 9.Bh4 d5?! 10.cxd5 exd5? 11.Bxf6 Qxf6 12.Qxc7 Ba6 White has 13.Bxa6 Nxa6 14.Qb7. Thus Black should prefer 8.e3 d6, planning ...Nbd7 and ...c5. <br>Both players can deviate from the main line. Instead of 7.Bg5, White can play 7.Nf3 Bb7 8.e3, intending to develop the dark-squared bishop to b2. Another possibility is 4.Qc2 0-0 5.e4, although this is somewhat inconsistent with 4.Qc2 as Black might be able to double White's c-pawns at some point (the queen must guard e4), something 4.Qc2 was supposed to prevent. After 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.Qxc3, Black can also try 6...Ne4 7.Qc2 f5, which is similar to the Dutch Variation (see 4.e3 b6), but without the doubled pawns for White.

* '''4...c5''' exploits the fact that on c2, the queen no longer defends the d-pawn. If White defends the pawn, then Black gets an easy game by keeping the pressure on d4, so White almost always plays 5.dxc5. Black can choose to recapture on c5 with the bishop (e.g. 5...Bxc5 or 5...0-0 6.a3 Bxc5), or with the knight (after 5...Na6 or 5...0-0 6.Nf3 Na6). In the former case, the bishop will eventually retreat to e7 and Black will set up a [[Hedgehog Defence|Hedgehog]] formation (pawns on a6, b6, d6 and e6). If Black recaptures with the knight, he will often have to give up the bishop pair at some point with ...Bxc3, but the knight is useful on c5 and can later go to e4, attacking the queen on c3. '''4...c5 5.dxc5 0-0''' (the '''Pirc Variation''') was one of the reasons why 4.Qc2 was not popular during the mid-20th century, because the lines where Black eventually recaptures with the knight was reckoned to give Black easy equality, while the line which prevented this maneuver, 6.a3 Bxc5 7.Nf3 Nc6 8.Bg5 Nd4 9.Nxd4 Bxd4 10.e3 Qa5 11.exd4 Qxg5, left the Black queen active, while White still needs to secure the king. It was the discovery of 12.Qd2! which revived this line for White, because the endgame after 12...Qxd2+ 13.Kxd2 offers White a slight edge. Indeed, [[Edmar Mednis]]'s remark was that the entire Pirc Variation had become unplayable at the highest level,<ref>''[[Chess Life]], June 1991, Opening Forum, [[Edmar Mednis]]</ref> while [[Modern Chess Openings]] (MCO) cites this variation as the main problem with 4...c5. However, players like Kramnik have been willing to defend the Black side of this line against players like Kasparov.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1070950 Kasparov–Kramnik] Tilburg 1997</ref>

* '''4...d5''' is another move that strikes immediately in the centre, and was a favourite of [[Mikhail Botvinnik]]. After 5.cxd5, Black can either recapture with the queen or pawn. 5...Qxd5 is the '''[[Oleg Romanishin|Romanishin]] System''': the idea is that after 6.Nf3 Qf5 7.Qxf5 exf5, Black strengthens his grip on e4 and makes e6 available for the bishop, which is enough for him to obtain equality. White can avoid this with 6.e3 so that 6...Qf5 can be met with 7.Bd3, but the e3-pawn blocks in White's c1-bishop. The older alternative is 5...exd5 6.Bg5 h6, which tends to be a rather sharp line. After 4...d5, White can also play 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.Qxc3 Ne4 7.Qc2, when Black may play 7...c5 or 7...Nc6 intending ...e5. Even though White possesses the pair of bishops, Black still strives for a quick opening of the position to exploit his lead in development. The usual result of this is a dynamically balanced position.

* '''4...Nc6''' is the '''[[Zürich]]''' or '''Milner-Barry Variation''' (named after British chess player [[Stuart Milner-Barry]]). Black gives up the dark-squared bishop, but places his central pawns on d6 and e5 so that his remaining bishop is unimpeded. To avoid moving his queen, White will play Bd2 at some point so that when Black takes the knight, White can recapture with the bishop. 4...Nc6 is out of fashion because most players prefer to avoid blocking their c-pawn. A topical line would go 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Qc2 Nc6 5.Nf3 (better than 5.e3) d6, with the idea of playing e5. Black often prepares this with castling and ...Re8 or by playing Qe7. After Black plays ...e5, White usually responds with d5. Black is willing to lose a tempo moving the Knight back to b8 (or e7, which is often better) because the position is closed. White usually plays on the Queenside in this variation, while Black will try to play on the Kingside with ...f5 and possibly transferring the c6 Knight over to the Kingside after White's d5. Today, the line arises quite often by transposition from the [[Black Knights Tango]], e.g. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 Nc6 3.Nf3 e6 4.Nc3 Bb4 5.Qc2.

4.Nf3 is known as the '''Kasparov Variation''', since [[Garry Kasparov]] used it to great effect against [[Anatoly Karpov]] in their 1985 World Championship match. Kasparov played 4.Nf3 six times, scoring three wins and three draws.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=55016.com www.chessgames.com]</ref> Today as White, this is a favourite weapon of GM [[Alexei Barsov]] and former Women's Champion [[Nona Gaprindashvili]].

White develops the knight to a natural square and waits to see Black's reply. 4...d5 transposes to the Ragozin Defence of the Queen's Gambit Declined and 4...b6 5.Bg5 Bb7 transposes to the Nimzo/Queen's Indian hybrid line, so 4...c5 is the most common move that stays within Nimzo-Indian territory. Now 5.e3 transposes to the Rubinstein System, but the main move is 5.g3, which leads to a position that also arises from the Fianchetto Variation. 5.g3 cxd4 6.Nxd4 0-0 7.Bg2 d5 8.cxd5 Nxd5 can be considered the main line. Black has dissolved White's centre, but the bishop on g2 exerts pressure on the black queenside, which White may augment with 9.Qb3.

This line can also arise from the [[Bogo-Indian Defence]] (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Bb4+) if White blocks the check with 4.Nc3.<ref>Gambit Guide to the Bogo-Indian, Steffen Pedersen, Gambit Chess, 1999, ISBN 1-901983-04-8</ref>

==Other variations==
*'''4. f3''' – This line has no generally accepted name, so is usually just referred to as the '''4.f3 Variation'''. It has previously been called the '''Gheorghiu Variation''' (a name given by Gligori?), named after [[Florin Gheorghiu]] who often played it early in his career, even defeating Fischer, and sometimes the '''Shirov Variation''', after [[Alexei Shirov]] who used it with great success in the early 1990s, before he lost three consecutive games with the line and abandoned it. According to 365chess.com it is called the '''Kmoch Variation'''. It is a straightforward attempt to seize control of e4, though at the cost of delaying development, and therefore attempts to refute Black's plan, which has been to play for control of the e4-square. Black can play ...d5 or ...c5. After ...d5, the game may go 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 c5 7.cxd5 Nxd5, a position also reached from the Sämisch Variation. Black's pressure on c3 and d4 compels White to play 8.dxc5, trying to open the position for his two bishops. White will follow up with e4, and Black will counter with ...e5 at some point to prevent White from pushing his e- and f-pawns further up the board. Another approach for Black is to play 4...c5, after which White plays 5.d5 to keep his central pawns together reaches a Benoni-style position, and Black's main replies are 5...b5, 5...0-0, 5...Bxc3+ and 5...Nh5. 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 is a direct transposition to the Sämisch Variation below.

*'''4. Bg5''' – The '''Leningrad Variation''' received its name because its theory was developed extensively by players from that city, such as [[Boris Spassky]]. Black can play ...h6 or ...c5. After ...h6, the game may go 5. Bh4 c5 6. d5. Now Black has some choices. With move ...d6, follows 7. e3 Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 e5, when Black has achieved a Hübner Variation-like blockade, the difference being that White's dark-squared bishop is outside the pawn chain. The pin on the f6-knight is very annoying, and Black often finds himself compelled to break it by playing the drastic g7–g5, which also clamps down on a potential f2–f4 break by White. This move weakens Black's kingside, so he often will not castle, walking his king to c7 via d8. An alternative to 6...d6 or ...Bxc3+ is 6...b5, much played in the 1970s after [[Mikhail Tal]] scored a crushing win over Spassky at [[Tallinn]] 1973.

*'''4.a3''' – The '''Sämisch Variation''' (named after [[Friedrich Sämisch|Fritz Sämisch]]) is a direct attempt to refute Black's strategic concept, as White gives up a tempo and concedes doubled c-pawns to gain the bishop pair. After '''4...Bxc3+ 5.bxc3''', Black has several possibilities, the most common of which is that he immediately begins to blockade the doubled pawns with 5....c5 and applies  more pressure on the (often doomed) pawn at c4 with the moves Ba6, Nc6–a5 and Rc8. In the early days of this line, 5....d5 was frequently played, though it was soon realised that this enabled White to liquidate the weakness at c4, so the idea fell from favour, particularly after the game [[Botvinnik versus Capablanca, AVRO 1938]], and has never been revived at top level. As compensation, White establishes a powerful centre, in order to play for a kingside attack before Black can make use of his static advantages. White has two main options for playing: he can move slowly into the centre with 6.e3, or he can play 6.f3, followed by 7.e4 to take a quick hold in the centre. In practice, however, Black has demonstrated that White's structural weaknesses are more serious than the attacking chances he gets, so this variation is rarely seen nowadays. The Sämisch Variation was employed five times by [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] against [[Mikhail Tal|Tal]] in the [[World Chess Championship 1960|1960 World Chess Championship]], with five draws resulting, and once in the [[World Chess Championship 1961|1961 rematch]], with a win for White.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?yearcomp=exactly&year=&playercomp=white&pid=11207&player=&pid2=14380&player2=&movescomp=exactly&moves=&opening=&eco=&result= List over Botvinnik–Tal games] chessgames.com</ref>

*'''4. g3''' – The '''Fianchetto Variation''' resembles the [[Catalan System]], where White [[fianchetto]]es his king's bishop to put pressure on the centre squares from the flank. Black can play 4...c5 5.Nf3 with a position also reached from the Kasparov Variation (see above), but 4...d5 is possible as well. This is considered the strongest response, since if allowed, Black can take the pawn on c4 and often keep it. This is not usually possible in the Catalan, where White's knight is developed to d2 and can simply recapture on c4.

*'''4. Qb3''' – The '''Spielmann Variation''' is named after [[Rudolf Spielmann]] who played it at Carlsbad, 1929, and was played at GM level in the early 1930s, though soon eclipsed in popularity by 4.Qc2. Like the Classical Variation, it avoids the doubling of White's pawns. However, unlike 4.Qc2, the queen has no control over e4, which Black can exploit by playing 4...c5 5.dxc5 Nc6 6.Nf3 Ne4, for example. Thus, despite the occasional revival by GMs [[Vladimir Akopian]], [[Vladimir Malaniuk]] and [[Jeroen Piket]], this variation is also unusual.

*'''4. e4''' – The '''Dilworth Gambit''', named for Vernon Dilworth, who contributed an article on the variation to the March 1949 issue of ''[[CHESS magazine]]''. Dilworth's idea was 4...Nxe4 5.Qg4 Nxc3 6.Bd2. However, White's compensation for the pawn is nebulous at best, and the line accordingly never developed a following beyond Dilworth himself. [http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter10.html] (No. 3762) [[Chris Ward (chess player)|Chris Ward]] called the gambit "critical, but basically rubbish".<ref name="ward_ch8">Offbeat Nimzo-Indian, Chris Ward. ch. 8 (Very Rare Fourth Moves for White)</ref>

*'''4. Bd2''', unpinning the knight, is a move that is common among amateurs who have no theoretical knowledge when they face the Nimzo-Indian. Although the move is not bad, it is unambitious. The strategic aim of obtaining the bishop pair without conceding the doubled pawns fails, for after e.g., 4...Bxc3 5.Bxc3 Ne4, White does not get to keep both bishops, and fair trades are usually not in White's interests since White has an advantage in space.<ref name="ward_ch8"/>

*'''4. Qd3''' – The '''Mikenas Variation''' is named after [[Vladas Mik?nas]]. It supports the knight and brings the queen to a central location, but the queen is exposed on d3, making this variation rare.<ref name="ward_ch8"/>

'''Mielikki''' is the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[goddess]] of forests and the hunt.  She is referred to in various tales as either the wife or the daughter-in-law of [[Tapio (spirit)|Tapio]], and the mother of [[Nyyrikki]].  She is said to have played a central role in the creation of the [[bear]].

In the [[Kalevala]], the Finnish national epic based on [[Karelia]]n folklore, the hero Lemminkäinen offers her and Tapio prayers, gold and silver so he can catch the [[Hiisi]] elk. In another passage, Mielikki is asked to protect cattle grazing in the forest. In a country where the forest was central to providing food through hunting, gathering and cattle grazing, it was thought very important to stay on her good side. She is also offered prayers by those who hunt small game and those who gather mushrooms and berries.

Mielikki is known as a skillful healer who heals the paws of animals who have escaped traps, helps chicks that have fallen from their nests and treats the wounds of [[Western capercaillie|wood grouse]]s after their mating displays. She knows well the healing herbs and will also help humans if they know well enough to ask her for it. Her name is derived from the old Finnish word ''mielu'' which means luck.

==Popular culture==
Black metal composer Gleb Poro has a track named "Mielikki".
Referenced in the Nightwish song ''Elvenpath'' as "Mielikki, blue cloak, healer of the ill and sad."

'''Duck Edgar Dumas Aloysius Eoghain Dodgers''' is the [[metafiction]]al star of a series of cartoons produced by [[Warner Bros.]]  He is the famous  cartoon star [[Daffy Duck]], cast in the role of an intergalactic future hero.

[[1953 in film|1953]] cartoon short ''[[Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century]],'' directed by [[Chuck Jones]].  Jones created a spoof of the popular ''[[Buck Rogers|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]]'' and ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' [[science fiction]] [[serial (radio and television)|serial]]s of the 1930s, casting the brash, egomaniacal Daffy Duck as the hero of the story.  {{As of|2003}} it is available in the DVD compilation ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1]]'', and is also available for download on the iTunes Store in the Daffy Duck collection.

The plot of the cartoon involves Duck Dodgers' search for the rare [[Chemical element|element]] Illudium Phosdex, "the [[shaving cream]] [[atom]]", the only remaining supply of which is on the mysterious "[[Planets in science fiction#P|Planet X]]." Just after Dodgers has claimed Planet X in the name of the Earth, [[Marvin the Martian]] lands on the same planet and claims it in the name of [[Mars]]. The stage is set for a battle of wits, not to mention various forms of weaponry, most of which tend to backfire hilariously on Dodgers.

Considering the period in which the cartoon was produced (the [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare]] was in full swing during the 1950s era), some scholars have used the cartoon to parallel the supposed futility of the [[Cold War]] and the [[arms race]].

==Duck Dodgers sequels==
The first sequel, also produced by Chuck Jones, was titled ''[[Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24½th Century]]'' and was released in 1980.<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Duck Dodgers' Flies Again|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1979-09-03|url= http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/650995022.html?dids=650995022:650995022&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Sep+03,+1979&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc='Duck+Dodgers'+Flies+Again&pqatl=google|accessdate=2010-11-01|first=Chuck|last=Champlin Jr}}</ref> The plot of this sequel cartoon was nearly a carbon copy of the original though this time, Marvin says he is trying to solve the Earth's energy crisis (by blowing up the Earth); Marvin succeeds in launching his missile and at the end of the cartoon reminds everyone that it's only a cartoon.

The second short, titled [[Marvin the Martian in the Third Dimension]], was a 3D cartoon released in 1996 to select venues. These included the flagship [[Warner Bros. Studio Store]] in [[Manhattan]], and [[Warner Bros. Movie World]] theme parks on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Australia]] and in [[Bottrop|Bottrop-Kirchhellen]], [[Germany]]. It included a range of interactive effects including a splash with water. Unlike the other Dodgers cartoons, Porky Pig did not appear.

A third short, titled "Attack of the Drones" was made in 2003 and was part of a series of new shorts, but because of the failure of ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'', they were not released theatrically. The shorts sometimes air on Teletoon in Canada and as of now can be seen on [[YouTube]].

==Further appearances==
* Duck Dodgers also made an appearance in a ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' segment titled "Duck Dodgers Jr." (in the episode "The Return of the Acme Acres Zone"), where Daffy Duck's pint-sized protégé and student [[Plucky Duck]] also visited the futuristic world of Duck Dodgers. Here [[Marvin the Martian]], appears with another humanoid Martian, Marcia. Duck Dodgers also makes an appearance in ''Star Warners.''

* An [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and [[Game Boy]] game called ''[[Daffy Duck: The Marvin Missions]]'', as well as a [[Nintendo 64]] video game, entitled ''Duck Dodgers'', have also been produced.<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Girl' Dangerously Cool, but Dodge the 'Duck'|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=2000-10-26|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/26/news/tt-42073/2|accessdate=2010-10-20|first=Aaron|last=Curtiss}}</ref> He also appeared in the game ''[[Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal]]''.

* The original cartoon also appeared in a 1994 episode of the science fiction series ''[[Babylon 5]],'' (also produced by WB) where it was revealed that ''Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century'' was Security Chief [[Michael Garibaldi]]'s "second favorite thing in the universe". One episode shows Garibaldi laughing uproariously at the cartoon, as Ambassador [[Delenn]] watches it with him, appearing totally bewildered.

* Portions of this cartoon can be seen and heard in the background in a scene from the 1977 movie ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''.

* Duck Dodgers appears in the 2003 feature ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'' when Daffy notes that the only character that could save the film's proverbial day was Duck Dodgers; he then realizes that Dodgers is his [[alter ego]]. He ends up defeating Marvin and saving humanity, after several jet packs exploded when he said his name.

In reality, he was only a water-boy for the Midstate University football team, and "Quarterback Quack" shows that he only carried out this façade at the insistence of a time-traveling Martian Commander X-2, who unwittingly made Dodgers into the hero he was known as. Dodgers is arrogant, selfish, greedy, lazy, cowardly, gullible, and not particularly intelligent. However, he occasionally displays surprisingly high levels of heroism and competence, suggesting that he is not quite as daft as he appears to be, although he mostly succeeds through sheer dumb luck and the work of the Eager Young Space Cadet. Ironically, Martian Commander X-2 actually caused Dodgers to become a minor football star in the final game of the season, which is what he used to parlay himself into captaincy in the Protectorate, meaning that he is, technically, not lying when he claims he won a championship football game in his own time. It is implied that he can't read, though this is contradicted several times. He also has shown to have quite the ego, when he caused the energy core of his ship to explode while using the lasers to carve his name on a nearby planetoid for example, and burning out the auxiliary core to make toast. In "The Green Loontern," Duck Dodgers accidentally got his costume mixed up with [[Hal Jordan]]'s [[Green Lantern]] costume at the dry cleaners where the rest of the [[Green Lantern Corps]] mistook him for Hal Jordan. He ended up fighting [[Sinestro]] until Hal Jordan arrived and regained his costume to help defeat Sinestro. Though he doesn't show it often, Dodgers cares deeply for his Cadet, even though he often demeans and puts him through humiliating situations. In "Of Course You Know, This Means War and Peace" Pt. 1, he is described by Psy Q. Hi as an ego-maniacal, bipolar, narcissist, and pathological liar with sociopathic tendencies.

* Duck Dodgers' Green Loontern appearance will appear as a playable character in the video game ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]''.

==Use by the US Air Force and NASA==
In 2003, both Duck Dodgers and Marvin the Martian were featured on separate [[1st Space Launch Squadron]] mission patches for that year's [[Mars Exploration Rover]] missions.<ref>[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=11681 Marvin The Martian and Daffy Duck as Duck Dodgers Prepare for Upcoming NASA Missions to Mars], press release from [[Warner Bros.]], Monday, June 2, 2003</ref>

==Dragon Con ==
The original ''Duck Dodgers'' cartoon is played during the Masquerade contest while the judges make their decisions annually.  [[Dragon*Con]] occurs every [[Labor Day]] weekend in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].  2013 was the 27th year of the [[science fiction|sci-fi]]/[[fantasy (genre)|fantasy]]/[[anime]] [[fan convention|convention]].  The tradition was taken on by Dragon*Con when Dixie Trek, a preceding Atlanta convention, became defunct.

'''Jean-Pierre Léaud''' ({{IPA-fr|???pj?? le.o|lang}}; born 28 May 1944) is a French actor, best known for playing [[Antoine Doinel]] in [[François Truffaut]]'s series of films about that character, beginning with ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' in 1959. He also worked several times with [[Jean-Luc Godard]], making him a notable figure of the [[French New Wave]].

==Early life==

Born in [[Paris]], Léaud made his major debut as an actor at the age of 14 as [[Antoine Doinel]], a semi-autobiographical character based on the life events of French [[film director]] [[François Truffaut]], in ''[[The 400 Blows]]''. To cast the two adolescents, Truffaut published an announcement in ''[[France-Soir]]'' and auditioned several hundred children in September and October 1958. Jean Domarchi, a critic at ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'', had earlier recommended the son of an assistant scriptwriter, Pierre Léaud, and the actress [[Jacqueline Pierreux]].

Truffaut was immediately captivated by the fourteen-year-old adolescent,{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} who had already appeared the previous year with [[Jean Marais]] in [[Georges Lampin]]'s ''La Tour prends garde!'' He recognized traits they both shared, "for example a certain suffering with regard to the family...With, however, this fundamental difference: though we were both rebels, we hadn't expressed our rebellion in the same way. I preferred to cover up and lie. Jean-Pierre, on the contrary, seeks to hurt, shock and wants it to be known...Why? Because he's unruly, while I was sly. Because his excitability requires that things happen to him, and when they don't occur quickly enough, he provokes them."{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Jean-Pierre Léaud, then in the eighth grade at a private school in Pontigny, was far from an ideal student. The director of the school wrote this to Truffaut, "I regret to inform you that Jean Pierre is more and more 'unmanageable'. Indifference, arrogance, permanent defiance, lack of discipline in all its forms. He has twice been caught leafing through pornographic pictures in the dorm. He is developing more and more into an emotionally disturbed case."<ref name="BaecqueToubiana2000">{{cite book

Extremely cultured for his age,{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} he was already very good at writing, and he even claimed to Truffaut that he had written a "verse tragedy", ''Torquatus''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Acting career==
Léaud starred in four more Truffaut films depicting the life of Doinel, spanning a period of 20 years &mdash; after the short-film ''[[Antoine et Colette]]'' in 1962 &mdash; beside actress [[Claude Jade]] as his girlfriend, and then wife, Christine. Those films are ''[[Stolen Kisses]]'' (1968), ''[[Bed and Board (1970 film)|Bed and Board]]'' (1970) and ''[[Love on the Run (1979 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1979). He also collaborated with Truffaut on non-Antoine Doinel films like ''[[Two English Girls]]'' and ''[[La Nuit américaine]]'' and became the actor most commonly affiliated with him. Although Antoine Doinel is his most famous character, he often found his performances in other films to be compared to his Doinel character whether there were legitimate similarities or not.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/8/lightness.html | title = Essay on Léaud's career }}</ref>

He is one of the most visible and well-known actors to be associated with the [[French New Wave]] film movement and, aside from his work with Truffaut, collaborated with [[Jean-Luc Godard]] (nine films), [[Jean Eustache]], [[Jacques Rivette]] and [[Agnes Varda]]. 1973 was perhaps the peak of his professional career when he had three critically acclaimed films released: Truffaut's ''[[La Nuit américaine]]'', Bertolucci's ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' and Eustache's ''[[The Mother and the Whore]]''.

In 1966, he won the [[Silver Bear for Best Actor]] at the [[16th Berlin International Film Festival]] for his role in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Masculin, féminin]]''.<ref name="berlinale 1966">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1966/03_preistr_ger_1966/03_Preistraeger_1966.html |title=Berlinale 1966: Prize Winners |accessdate=2010-02-24 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> He was nominated for a [[César Award]] for Best Supporting Actor in 1988 for [[Les Keufs]] and was awarded an [[Honorary César]] for lifetime achievement in 2000.

Léaud acted in films by other influential directors, such as [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], [[Jerzy Skolimowski]], [[Bernardo Bertolucci]], [[Aki Kaurismäki]] and more recently [[Olivier Assayas]] and [[Tsai Ming-liang]]. He appeared with a hero of his, [[Marlon Brando]] in the Bertolucci film ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'', although the two never met, since all of Léaud's scenes were shot on Saturdays and Brando refused to work on Saturdays.<ref name="Monaco1978">{{cite book

[[File:TublarWoodBlock.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Tubular wood block]]
A '''wood block''' (also spelled as a single word, '''woodblock''') is a small, two-toned [[slit drums|slit drum]] made from a single piece of [[wood]] and used as a [[percussion instrument]]. The term generally signifies the Western orchestral instrument, though it is related to the time-beaters used by the Han Chinese and called ''ban''. For this reason, the Western instrument is sometimes referred to as "Chinese woodblock". Alternative names sometimes used in ragtime and jazz are '''clog box''' and '''tap box''' {{harv|Blades and Holland|2001}}.

The orchestral wood-block instrument of the West is generally made from teak or another hardwood. The dimensions of this instrument vary, although it is either a rectangular or cylindrical block of wood with one or sometimes two longitudinal cavities {{harv|Blades and Holland|2001}}. It is played by striking it with a stick, which produces a sharp crack {{harv|Montagu|2002b}}.

In a [[drum kit]], a woodblock was traditionally mounted on a clamp fixed to the top of the rear rim of the [[bass drum]].

==Related instruments==
[[Log drums]] made from hollowed logs, and [[slit drums]] made from bamboo, are used in Africa and the Pacific Islands.

The [[muyu]] ({{zh|t=??|s=??|p=mùyú}}) is a rounded woodblock carved in the shape of a fish and struck with a wooden stick. It is made in various sizes and is often used in Buddhist chanting, in China as well as in other Asian nations including Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Also in China, a small, rectangular, high-pitched wood block called ''[[bangzi]]'' ([[wikt:??|??]]) is used. This instrument is called a [[temple block]] in a Western orchestral context.

'''Deflagration''' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hutchisonrodway.co.nz/Auckland/Technical/Glossary-D-H |title=Glossary D-H |publisher=Hutchisonrodway.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-12-29}}</ref> (Lat: ''de + flagrare'', "to burn down") is a term describing subsonic [[combustion]] propagating through [[heat transfer]]; hot burning material heats the next layer of cold material and ignites it. Most "[[fire]]" found in daily life, from [[flame]]s to [[explosion]]s, is deflagration.  Deflagration is different from [[detonation]], which is [[supersonic]] and propagates through [[shock wave|shock]].

==Applications==
In engineering applications, deflagrations are easier to control than detonations. Consequently, they are  better suited when the goal is to move an object (a [[bullet]] in a gun, or a piston in an [[internal combustion engine]]) with the force of the expanding gas. Typical examples of deflagrations are the [[combustion]] of a gas-air mixture in a [[gas stove]] or a fuel-air mixture in an [[internal combustion engine]],  and the rapid burning of [[gunpowder]] in a firearm or of pyrotechnic mixtures in [[firework]]s.
Deflagration systems and products can also be used in mining, demolition and stone quarrying via [[gas pressure blasting]] as a beneficial alternative to high explosives.

==Oil/wax fire and water==
Adding water to a burning [[hydrocarbon]] such as oil or wax produces a deflagration. The water boils rapidly and ejects the burning material as a fine spray of droplets. A deflagration then occurs as the fine mist of oil ignites and burns extremely rapidly. These are particularly common in [[chip pan]] fires, which are responsible for one in five household fires in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].<ref>[http://www.fireservice.co.uk/safety/chip-pans UK Fire Service advice] on chip pan fires</ref>

==Flame physics==
The underlying flame [[physics]] can be understood with the help of an idealized model consisting of a uniform one-dimensional tube of unburnt and burned gaseous fuel, separated by a thin transitional region of width <math>\delta\; </math> in which the burning occurs. The burning region is commonly referred to as the [[flame]] or [[flame front]]. In equilibrium, thermal diffusion across the flame front is balanced by the heat supplied by burning.

There are two characteristic timescales which are important here. The first is the thermal diffusion timescale{{explain}} <math>\tau_d\;</math>, which is approximately equal to

:<math>\tau_d \simeq \delta^2 / \kappa</math>,

where <math>\kappa \;</math> is the [[thermal diffusivity]]. The second is the burning timescale{{explain}} <math>\tau_b</math> that strongly decreases with temperature, typically as

:<math>\tau_b\propto \exp[\Delta U/(k_B T_f)]</math>,

where <math>\Delta U\;</math> is the activation barrier for the burning reaction and <math>T_f\;</math> is the temperature developed as the result of burning; the value of this so-called "flame temperature" can be determined from the laws of thermodynamics.

For a stationary moving deflagration front, these two timescales must be equal: the heat generated by burning is equal to the heat carried away by [[heat transfer]]. This makes it possible to calculate the characteristic width <math>\delta\;</math> of the flame front:

:<math>\tau_b = \tau_d\;</math>,

thus

:<math> \delta \simeq \sqrt {\kappa \tau_b} </math>.

Now, the thermal flame front propagates at a characteristic speed <math>S_l\;</math>, which is simply equal to the flame width divided by the burn time:

:<math>S_l \simeq \delta / \tau_b \simeq \sqrt {\kappa  / \tau_b} </math>.

This simplified model neglects the change of temperature and thus the burning rate across the deflagration front. This model also neglects the possible influence of [[turbulence]]. As a result, this derivation gives only the [[laminar flame speed]] -- hence the designation <math>S_l\;</math>.

==Damaging deflagration events==

Damage to buildings, equipment and people can result from a large-scale, short-duration deflagration.  The potential damage is primarily a function of the total amount of fuel burned in the event (total energy available), the maximum flame velocity that is achieved, and the manner in which the expansion of the combustion gases is contained.

In free-air deflagrations, there is a continuous variation in deflagration effects relative to the maximum flame velocity.  When flame velocities are low, the effect of a deflagration is to release heat. Some authors use the term [[flash fire]] to describe these low-speed deflagrations.  At flame velocities near the [[speed of sound]], the energy released is in the form of pressure and the results resemble a [[detonation]].  Between these extremes both heat and pressure are released.

When a low-speed deflagration occurs within a closed vessel or structure, pressure effects can produce damage due to expansion of gases as a secondary effect. The heat released by the deflagration causes the combustion gases and excess air to expand thermally.  The net result is that the volume of the vessel or structure must expand to accommodate the hot combustion gases, or the vessel must be strong enough to withstand the additional internal pressure, or it fails, allowing the gases to escape. The risks of deflagration inside waste storage drums is a growing concern in storage facilities.

'''Detonation''' ({{ety|la|detonare|to expend thunder}}) involves a [[supersonic]] exothermic front accelerating through a medium that eventually drives a [[shock front]] propagating directly in front of it. Detonations occur in both conventional solid and liquid explosives,<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Fickett|last2= Davis|title=Detonation|publisher= Univ. California Press|year=1979|isbn= 978-0486414560}}</ref> as well as in reactive gases. The [[detonation velocity|velocity of detonation]] in solid and liquid explosives is much higher than that in gaseous ones, which allows the wave system to be observed with greater detail (higher [[Image resolution|resolution]]).

An extraordinary variety of fuels may occur as gases, droplet fogs, or dust suspensions. Oxidants include halogens, ozone, hydrogen peroxide and oxides of nitrogen. Gaseous detonations are often associated with a mixture of fuel and oxidant in a composition somewhat below conventional flammability ratios. They happen most often in confined systems, but they sometimes occur in large vapor clouds. Other materials, such as [[acetylene]], [[ozone]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]] are detonable in the absence of [[oxygen]]; a more complete list is given by both Stull<ref>{{cite book|last=Stull|title= Fundamentals of fire and explosion|publisher= A.I.Chem.E.|series= Monograph Series |volume=10|page=73|year=1977|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Fundamentals_of_fire_and_explosion.html?id=zcBTAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> and Bretherick.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bretherick|title=Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards|publisher=Butterworths|location= London|year=1979|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780123725639|isbn=9780123725639}}</ref>

==Theories==
The simplest theory to predict the behavior of detonations in gases is known as [[Chapman-Jouguet condition|Chapman-Jouguet]] (CJ) theory, developed around the turn of the 20th century.  This theory, described by a relatively simple set of algebraic equations, models the detonation as a propagating shock wave accompanied by exothermic heat release.  Such a theory confines the chemistry and diffusive transport processes to an infinitely thin zone.

A more complex theory was advanced during World War II independently by [[Zel'dovich]], [[von Neumann]], and [[W. Doering]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zel'dovich |last2= Kompaneets|title=Theory of Detonation|publisher=Academic Press|location= New York|year=1960|asin= B000WB4XGE}}</ref><ref>{{cite report|last=von Neumann|title=Progress report on the theory of detonation waves, OSRD Report No. 549}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Doring|journal= Annalen der Physik|volume=43|pages=421|year=1943|doi=10.1002/andp.19434350605|title=Über den Detonationsvorgang in Gasen|first1=W.|issue=6–7|bibcode = 1943AnP...435..421D }}</ref>  This theory, now known as [[ZND theory]], admits finite-rate chemical reactions and thus describes a detonation as an infinitely thin shock wave followed by a zone of exothermic chemical reaction.  With a reference frame of a stationary shock, the following flow is subsonic, so that an acoustic reaction zone follows immediately behind the lead front, the [[Chapman-Jouguet condition]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Chapman |first=David Leonard |title=On the rate of explosion in gases |journal=Philosophical Magazine |location=London |publisher=Taylor & Francis |series=Series 5 |volume=47 |issue=284 |pages=90–104 |date=January 1899 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=N4u8y0Kf8NQC&pg=PA90#v=onepage&f=false |issn=1941-5982 |lccn=sn86025845 |doi=10.1080/14786449908621243  }}</ref><ref>

Both theories describe one-dimensional and steady wave fronts.  However, in the 1960s, experiments revealed that gas-phase detonations were most often characterized by unsteady, three-dimensional structures, which can only in an averaged sense be predicted by one-dimensional steady theories. Indeed, such waves are quenched as their structure is destroyed.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Edwards, D.H., Thomas, G.O., and Nettleton, M.A.|title=The Diffraction of a Planar Detonation Wave at an Abrupt Area Change|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|volume= 95|issue=1|pages =79–96|year= 1979|doi=10.1017/S002211207900135X|bibcode = 1979JFM....95...79E }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2514/5.9781600865497.0341.0357 |volume=75 |journal=Progress in Astronautics & Aeronautics|year=1981|title=Diffraction of a Planar Detonation in Various Fuel-Oxygen Mixtures at an Area Change|isbn=978-0-915928-46-0|pages=341|editors=A.

Experimental studies have revealed some of the conditions needed for the propagation of such fronts.

==Applications==

When used in explosive devices, the main cause of damage from a detonation is the supersonic blast front (a powerful [[shock wave]]) in the surrounding area. This is a significant distinction from [[deflagration]]s where the exothermic wave is subsonic and maximum pressures are at most one quarter{{Citation needed|date = February 2010}} as great. Therefore, detonation is most often used for explosives and the acceleration of projectiles.  However, detonation waves may also be used for less destructive purposes, including deposition of coatings to a surface<ref>{{cite journal|author=Nikolaev, Yu.A., Vasil'ev, A.A., and Ul'yanitskii, B.Yu.|title=Gas Detonation and its Application in Engineering and Technologies (Review)|journal=Combustion, Explosion, and Shock Waves|volume= 39|issue= 4|pages=382–410|year= 2003|doi=10.1023/A:1024726619703}}</ref> and cleaning of equipment (e.g. slag removal<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Huque, Z., Ali, M.R., and Kommalapati, R.|title=Application of pulse detonation technology for boiler slag removal|journal=Fuel Processing Technology|volume= 90|issue= 4|pages=558–569|year= 2009|doi=10.1016/j.fuproc.2009.01.004}}</ref>).

==In engines and firearms==
Unintentional detonation when [[deflagration]] is desired is a problem in some devices.  In internal combustion engines it is called [[engine knocking]] or pinging, and it causes a loss of power and excessive heating of certain components.  In firearms, it may cause catastrophic and potentially lethal failure.

'''Santa Cruz Futebol Clube''' is a [[Brazil]]ian [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Recife]], [[Pernambuco]].

==History==

===Early history===

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}

On February 3, 1914, eleven young men aging from 14 to 16 years founded a football society. Because the boys used to play football on the streets by the yard of the ''Santa Cruz'' Church, the club was named after that church, which is situated on Santa Cruz Street in Recife.

The first official meeting of the members was at 2 Mangueira St. At this meeting they decided the position of each member, the name of the club "Santa Cruz Foot-Ball Club", and the society's colors.

The original colors were black and white. Some time after, the color pattern was changed because another local team ([[Sport Club Flamengo]]) already had those colors. Therefore the club included the red color by suggestion of Teófilo Batista de Carvalho, also known as ''Lacraia''. ''Lacraia'' has participated in all major early events of Santa Cruz's history, except the foundation.

The first ball was bought with the financial support of José Luiz Vieira and cost 8,500 ''réis''.

Many people came to see the first match at ''Derby plains''. The "''team of boys''" as Santa Cruz was called at the time beat ''Rio Negro'' (Black River) by 7–0. ''Rio Negro'' demanded revenge in another match. Curiously, the terms of the revenge stated that Sílvio Machado (he scored five goals in the first match) could not play. Despite that, Santa Cruz accepted the challenge. Carlindo, who substituted Sílvio Machado, scored six goals and Santa Cruz won again by 9–0. A subsequent victory over the ''Western Telegraph Company'' team, very famous at the time, made the popularity of Santa Cruz increase even more.

The club was almost closed in its very first year. Some members proposed to use the club funds to buy a [[sugarcane]] juice extractor. Alexandre Carvalho (see members above) violently disapproved of such an offensive proposal and saved the club. "Santa Cruz was born to live forever", he would have said.

In early 20th century Recife, football was regarded as an elite sport. It was played mostly by upper class boys and by the workers of English companies that operated in Recife. At that time [[racism]] was common and Afro-Brazilians were not allowed to play football. Santa Cruz, however, was the first team in Pernambuco to accept them. ''Lacraia'', was the first one. This fact contributed to the popularity of the team, as black people are numerous in [[Demographics of Brazil|Brazilian population]].

In 1915, there was the greatest comeback ever seen in a football match in [[Brazil]]. At the [[Estádio dos Aflitos|Aflitos]] stadium, Santa Cruz was trailing by a 5 – 1 score against [[América Futebol Clube do Recife|América]] (Pernambuco), however it scored six goals in the final 15 minutes.

In 1917, the club was accepted into the Pernambucan Sport League, the old name of the [[Federação Pernambucana de Futebol|Pernambucan Football Federation]].

On January 30, 1919, Santa Cruz beat [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]] team of [[Rio de Janeiro]] on the Malaquias field by 3–2. [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], the [[airplane]] pioneer, was in [[Recife]], but was unnoticed: Santa Cruz's victory took everyone's attention. On January 31, the ''Jornal Pequeno'' (Small Newspaper) printed in the headlines: "Botafogo Futebol Clube is beaten by the home ''boys'' by 3–2." It was the first time that a northern-northeastern team beat a team from the south-eastern region of Brazil.

On December 13, 1931, beating Torre by 2–0, Santa Cruz won its first state championship. Tará and Sherlock were the most important players.

On October 10, 1934, the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian National team]], which had just arrived home from the 1934 [[Football World Cup]] in [[Italy]], played some friendly matches against the major teams of Pernambuco. [[Sport Club do Recife]] was defeated 4–2; [[Clube Náutico Capibaribe]] was beaten 8–3. Santa Cruz also was defeated 3–1. Because of a ship delay, the Brazilian team could not continue its trip back to [[Rio de Janeiro]]. So Santa Cruz asked for a return match. This time, Santa Cruz won by 3–2.

On May 13, 2012, Santa Cruz won the match against Sport Clube do Recife, 3 x 2, and is the Pernambuco Champion in 2012.

===1960s and 70s===

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}

During the late 1960s and the 1970s, Santa Cruz achieved greater popularity.
Much of that was due to the State Penta-championship that Santa Cruz had won.
Moreover, since Santa Cruz's impressive performances in the National championship, the importance of the club was finally recognized beyond the state of Pernambuco.

The participation of Santa Cruz in the National competition lead the club to gain some credibility in 1965 after beating [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]] by 3-1 in the [[Estádio do Maracanã|Maracanã]] stadium. The club obtained first place in the National Championship's first stage.

In 1972, [[Pelé]] played his 1000th match against Santa Cruz.

In 1975, Santa Cruz reached the semifinals of the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Brazilian National Championship]], a first for a northeastern team. The controversial semi-final against [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]] on December 7 end with Cruzeiro winning 3-2. The club achieved fourth place (their best performance in the National Championship).

In 1978 and 1979, Santa Cruz went unbeaten for 48 games in a row in the Brazilian Championship, the fourth greatest unbeaten run in the national competition. In the same year, Santa Cruz was the first team to qualify for the 2nd Stage of the National Championship, gaining 20 points. By the end of the competition, Santa Cruz was in fifth place.

A Santa Cruz had the top scoring player of the [[Campeonato Pernambucano|Pernambucan Championship]] 25 times up to 2011.

===1980s to present===

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}

During the 1980s, Santa Cruz was demoted to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série B|Second Division]] of the National Championship twice, in 1982 and 1989. Since then the club's performance in national competitions has declined.

In the early 1990s, Santa Cruz won three state championships: 1990, 1993, and 1995. However being in the second division of the National Championshiop often eclipsed such achievements.

Moreover, in the following years, Santa Cruz had to share the status of champion 5 times in a row with an arch-rival. Santa Cruz was not able to stop [[Sport Club do Recife|Sport]] winning their 5th successive championship.

Nevertheless, in 1996, Maurício was the top scorer of the 2nd Division Brazilian Championship with 13 goals.

Since the final match in [[Campeonato Pernambucano]] 2006 vs. Sport, with which Sport won the championship, the team has experienced a new decline. It was demoted to [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série B|Second Division]] in 2006 and then to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série C|Third Division]] in 2007 after a weak campaign. That latest decline also included elimination from [[Copa do Brasil]] 2007 and 2008 by weaker teams at the first round and the downfall into ''Hexagonal da Morte'', the bottom six, in Campeonato Pernambucano 2008, escaping relegation in the seventh match.

Continuing the fall, in September 2008, after another weak campaign, this time in the Third Division, Santa Cruz was relegated to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série D|Fourth Division]] becoming the first club to fall from First Division to Fourth in three years.

But, in 2011, Santa Cruz started a reaction. The club was eliminated from [[Copa do Brasil]] by [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]]. Santa Cruz won the first game 1–0, but lost in the second game 2–0. On May 15, Santa Cruz won the [[Campeonato Pernambucano]]. The final was 2–0 against [[Sport Club do Recife|Sport Recife]], and the [[Estádio do Arruda|Arruda]] had the highest attendance in 2011 in Brazilian football, beating teams like Flamengo, from Rio de Janeiro, and Corinthians, from São Paulo.

==Symbols==

===Colors===

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}

The original colors of the club were black and white. However, at that time, the Pernambucan Sport League did not allow the participation of different clubs with the same colors. Thus, the red color was introduced to differentiate from the color pattern of Flamengo of [[Arcoverde]].

Santa Cruz is also known as ''O Tricolor'' (The Tricolor) and its fans
as ''Tricolores''.

===Badge===

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}

The original badge(not depicted here) was designed by Teófilo Batista de Carvalho aka ''Lacraia''.
The inclusion of red colour in the club patterns is also due to ''Lacraia''.

[[Image:santa cruz 90years coat.png|thumb|100px|90-years Commemorative badge]]

As time passed, the badge design was modified and updated. However the ''Lacraia'' 's original concept was not much modified.

The current badge contains several [[Star (football badge)|stars]]. The top three-colored stars represent the three Super-championships that Santa Cruz won. The bottom golden stars represent the Penta-championship.

===Mascot===

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}

With the adoption of three colors, the striped jersey of Santa Cruz resembled a [[Coral snake]]. Due to this, the team is known by the fans as ''Coral''.

===Anthem===

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}

The official anthem of the club is widely unknown by the fans. However, a march named ''O Mais Querido'' (The Dearest One) by Lourenço da Fonseca Barbosa ([[Capiba]]) is very popular and is the ''de facto'' anthem.

==Stadium==

The team's stadium is in [[Estádio do Arruda|Arruda]], a borough of [[Recife]]. The official name of the stadium is ''Estádio José do Rego Maciel'', after the name of a former mayor of Recife. However, it is widely known as ''Estádio do Arruda'' (Arruda Stadium). The fans call it ''Arrudão'' (Big Arruda) or ''Mundão do Arruda'' (Great Land of Arruda).

On April 1, 1982 the stadium was re-inaugurated after improvements and enlargement. From the original capacity of 64,000 people, the maximum capacity was then estimated at 110,000. However, due to safety reasons, the maximum audience so far is 90,200 in a [[Brazil]] vs [[Argentina]] match on March 23, 1994. Since then the official stadium capacity has been reduced to 60,044.<ref name="capacity">{{cite web|title=Arruda|url=http://mavalem.sites.uol.com.br/pe/Recife1.htm|accessdate=2008-12-01|publisher=Templos do Futebol|language=Portuguese}}</ref>

The stadium is also known as the ''Repúblicas Independentes do Arruda'' (Independent Republics of Arruda).

===The Super-Championship===
The [[Campeonato Pernambucano|Pernambucan Football Championship]] is usually divided into three turns. Each turn is a small championship itself. If a team wins all the three turns then it is automatically declared as champion. If a team wins two turns and another team wins the remaining turn, the championship has a final playoff. Generally, the playoff consists of two matches or three matches. However, if three different teams win each one a turn, the championship has a playoff named Super-championship. The Super-championship consists of a playoff among the three winners of each turn. Super-championships are rare and very prestigious.

A '''quiz''' is a form of [[game]] or [[sport]] of the mind in which the players (as individuals or in teams) attempt to answer questions correctly. In some countries, a quiz is also a brief [[Educational assessment|assessment]] used in education and similar fields to measure growth in knowledge, abilities, and/or skills.

Quizzes are usually scored in points and many quizzes are designed to determine a winner from a group of participants - usually the participant with the highest score.
{{wiktionary}}

==Etymology==
The first attested use of the word is from 1781<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, Third Edition</ref> and means an odd person. This sense survives today in the word ''quizzical''. It was also used in the term ''[[monocle|quizzing glass]]'', a common accoutrement of [[British Regency]] [[dandy|dandies]].  It later acquired a meaning of to make fun of, or to mock. How it acquired its current meaning of a test is unknown, but that sense did not appear until 1867 and then it was in the United States.{{cn|date=November 2012}}

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' attests the use of the verb ''quiz'' to mean "to question or interrogate", with a reference from 1843: "She com back an' ''quiesed'' us", which could be a clue to its origin. Quiz as a test could be a corruption of the Latin ''qui es'', meaning "Who are you?" [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|The ''American Heritage Dictionary'']] says it may be from the English dialect verb ''quiset'', meaning "to question". In any case it is probably from the same root as ''question'' and ''inquisitive''.{{fact|date=July 2014}}<!-- seems to contradict earlier sentences -->

There is a well-known myth about the word ''quiz'' that says that in 1791 a Dublin theater owner named James Daly made a bet that he could introduce a word into the language within twenty-four hours. He then went out and hired a group of [[street urchin]]s to write the word "quiz", which was a [[nonsense word]], on walls around the city of [[Dublin]]. Within a day, the word was common currency and had acquired a meaning (since no one knew what it meant, everyone thought it was some sort of test) and Daly had some extra cash in his pocket. However, there is no evidence to support the story, and the term was already in use before the alleged bet in 1791.<ref>[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-qui1.htm Worldwidewords.org]</ref>

==As competitions==
Quizzes may be held on a variety of subjects (general knowledge, 'pot luck') or subject-specific. The format of the quiz can also vary widely.  Popularly known competition quizzes include
*[[Pub quiz]]zes
*Team [[Quizbowl]]s
*in [[Australia]]:
**[[Music for the Mission (quiz night)|Music for the Mission]]
*in [[Belgium]]:
**[[Quizzing in Belgium|Belgian Style Quizzing]]

==World record==
The largest quiz, according to Guinness, was the "Quiz for Life", held at the Flanders Expo Halls in Ghent, Belgium, on 11 December 2010 with 2,280 participants. The winning team ''Café De Kastaar'' from Leuven was composed of Marnix Baes, [[Erik Derycke (quiz player)|Erik Derycke]], Eric Hemelaers, Bart Permentier and [[Tom Trogh]].

==In education==
In an educational context, a quiz is usually a form of a student assessment, but often has fewer questions of lesser difficulty and requires less time for completion than a [[Test (student assessment)|test]].<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/10/01/global.connections.quiz/index.html Quiz: How much do you know about China and Turkey?] CNN, 2010</ref> This use is typically found in the [[US]], [[Canada]], and some colleges in [[India]].
For instance, in a mathematics classroom, a quiz may check comprehension of a type of [[mathematical exercise]].  A "pop quiz" is a quiz that students are given no time to prepare for; they are simply surprised with it in class.

==Other quizzes==
Additionally, a [[personality quiz]] may be a series of multiple-choice questions about the respondent without right or wrong answers.  The responses to these questions are tallied according to a key, and the result purports to reveal some quality of the respondent.  This kind of "quiz" was originally popularized by women's magazines such as ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''.  They have since become common on the [[Internet]], where the result page typically includes code which can be added to a [[blog]] entry to publicize the result.  These postings are common on [[LiveJournal]].

There are also many [[online quiz]]zes. Many webmasters have quiz sections on their websites and forums; for instance, [[phpBB2]] has one MOD (modification) which allows users to submit quizzes, called the ''Ultimate Quiz MOD''.<ref>[http://www.cmxmods.net/quiz.php]</ref>

The results of online quizzes are generally to be taken lightly, as they do not often reflect the true personality or relationship.  They are also rarely [[psychometrics|psychometric]]ally [[validity (statistics)|valid]]. However, they may occasion reflection on the subject of the quiz and provide a springboard for a person to explore his or her emotions, beliefs, or actions.

'''Elihu Thomson''' (March 29, 1853&nbsp;– March 13, 1937) was an English [[electrical engineering|engineer]] and [[inventor]] who was instrumental in the founding of major [[electricity|electrical]] companies in the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Manchester]] ([[England]]) on March 29, 1853, but his family moved to [[Philadelphia]] in 1858.<ref name="nrhpinv2">{{Cite journal|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/76002002.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Elihu Thomson House / Elihu Thomson Administration Building|date=1975-07-30 |format=PDF |author=James Sheire |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2009-06-22|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Thomson took a teaching position at Central, and in 1876, at the age of twenty-three, held the Chair of Chemistry. In 1880, he left Central to pursue research in the emerging field of electrical engineering.<ref>http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Elihu_Thomson</ref>

==Electrical innovations==
With [[Edwin J. Houston]], a former teacher and later colleague of Thomson's at Central High School, Thomson founded the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]]. Notable inventions created by Thomson during this period include an arc-lighting system, an automatically regulated three-coil dynamo, a magnetic lightning arrester, and a local power transformer.<ref name="ElihuThomson">"Elihu Thomson Eightieth Birthday Celebration at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology" (The Technology Press: 29 March 1933)</ref> In 1892 the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] merged with the [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] General Electric Company to become the [[General Electric|General Electric Company]].<ref name="amphilsoc">Fitti, Charles J., [http://www.amphilsoc.org/bulletin/20011/elihu.pdf "Elihu Thomson"], ''APS Library Bulletin'', Winter 2001.</ref>

The historian [[Thomas P. Hughes]] writes that Thomson "displayed methodological characteristics in the workshop and the laboratory as [an] inventor and in the business world as [an] entrepreneur. He also chose to solve problems in the rapidly expanding field of electric light and power."<ref name="HughesThomas">Hughes, Thomas "American Genesis" (Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 2004).</ref> Thomson's name is further commemorated by the [[British Thomson-Houston Company]] (BTH), and the French companies [[Thomson SA|Thomson]] and [[Alstom]].

Thomson was notable both for his emphasis on models and for the singular focus with which he pursued his research, with Thomson referring to his workshop as a "model room" rather than a laboratory. Between 1880 and 1885, Thomson averaged twenty-one patent applications annually, doubling that average between 1885 and 1890. 

Upon the merger of [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] (his namesake company) to form [[General Electric]] in 1892, Thomson chose to keep his laboratory at [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] near Boston away from GE's New York headquarters to ensure his control over his research.<ref name="HughesThomas" /> At the Lynn GE plant, he worked with [[Edwin Rice]] (later President of GE in 1913) and [[Sanford Moss]] (developer of the [[turbocharger]]) and [[Charles Steinmetz]] (who was located at GE headquarters in [[Schenectady, New York]]). After being asked to become a director of GE, Thomson rejected the offer preferring continued research to management.

==Honors==
Thomson was the first recipient of the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers|AIEE]] (now [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)]]) [[Edison Medal]], bestowed upon him in 1909 "For meritorious achievement in electrical science, engineering and arts as exemplified in his contributions thereto during the past thirty years."; Thomson was also president of the organization from 1889-90.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Presidents_of_the_American_Institute_of_Electrical_Engineers_%28AIEE%29 |title=Presidents of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref> Near the end of his life, Thomson's second wife Clarissa Hovey Thomson  is reported to have said that she had to carry a basket with her to carry all of Thomson's awards and honors.<ref name="amphilsoc" />

In 1889 he was decorated by the French Government for his electrical inventions, being made [[Legion of Honour|Chevalier et Officier de la Légion d'honneur]].<ref name="IEEEBIO"/> He received the honorary degree of A.M. from Yale (1890). Tufts College in 1892 gave him the degree of Ph.D., and in 1899 he received a D.Sc. from Harvard.<ref name="IEEEBIO"/>
 
==Later life==
He was a founding member, as well as the second president, of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]].

He served as acting president of [[MIT]] from 1920-1923.<ref name=ElihuThomsonPapers>[http://www.amphilsoc.org/mole/search?text=thomson&text-join=&text-exclude=&text-prox=&title=&creator=&identifier=&subject=&year=&year-max=&smode=advanced Elihu Thomson Papers], American Philosophical Society</ref> Thomson, overcoming his distaste for management accepted this role during a critical period for the university when it could not otherwise find a president.<ref name="ElihuThomson" />

Thomson died at his estate in [[Swampscott, Massachusetts]]. The [[Elihu Thomson House]] in Swampscott was designated a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1976.

==Patents==
Thomson held more than 700 patents. Thomson used his patents to bolster his company, Thomson-Houston Company, later  General Electric.

{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Formulations}}
In [[physics]], the '''Heisenberg picture''' (also called the '''Heisenberg representation'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Heisenberg representation|url=http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Heisenberg_representation|publisher=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref>) is a formulation (largely due to [[Werner Heisenberg]] in 1925) of [[quantum mechanics]] in which the [[Operator (physics)|operators]] ([[observables]] and others) incorporate a dependency on time, but the [[quantum state|state vector]]s are time-independent, an arbitrary fixed basis rigidly underlying the theory.

It stands in contrast to the [[Schrödinger picture]] in which the operators are constant, instead, and the states evolve in time. The two pictures only differ by a basis change with respect to time-dependency, which corresponds to  the difference between [[active and passive transformation]]s. The Heisenberg picture is the formulation of [[matrix mechanics]] in an arbitrary basis, in which the Hamiltonian is not necessarily diagonal.

It further serves to define a third, hybrid, picture, the [[Interaction picture]].

==Mathematical details==
In the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics the state vectors, {{ket|''?''}}, do not change with time, while  observables {{mvar|A}} satisfy
{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation =
<math>\frac{d}{dt}A(t)=\frac{i}{\hbar}[H,A(t)]+\frac{\partial A}{\partial t},</math>
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F9FFF7}}
where {{mvar|H}} is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] and <nowiki>[•,•]</nowiki> denotes the [[commutator]] of two operators (in this case {{mvar|H}}  and {{mvar|A}}). Taking expectation values automatically yields the [[Ehrenfest theorem]], featured in the [[correspondence principle]].

By the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]], the Heisenberg picture and the Schrödinger picture are unitarily equivalent, just a [[transformation theory (quantum mechanics)|basis change]] in [[Hilbert space]].  In some sense, the  [[Heisenberg]] picture is more natural and convenient than the equivalent Schrödinger picture, especially for [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] theories. [[Lorentz invariance]] is manifest in the Heisenberg picture, since the state vectors do not single out the time or space.

This approach also has a more direct similarity to [[classical physics]]: by simply replacing the commutator above by the [[Poisson bracket]], the '''Heisenberg equation''' reduces to an equation in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]].

==Derivation of Heisenberg's equation==
For pedagogical reasons, the Heisenberg picture is introduced here from the subsequent, but more familiar,  [[Schrödinger picture]].
The [[expectation value]] of an observable ''A'', which is a [[Hermitian]] [[linear operator]], for a given Schrödinger state {{math|{{ket|''?''(''t'')}}}}, is given by
:<math> \lang A \rang _t = \lang \psi (t) | A | \psi(t) \rang.</math>

In the Schrödinger picture, the state {{math|{{ket|''?''(''t'')}}}} at time {{math|''t''}} is related to the state {{math|{{ket|''?''(0)}}}} at time 0 by a unitary [[time-evolution operator]], {{math|''U''(''t'')}},
: <math> |\psi(t)\rangle = U(t) |\psi(0)\rangle.</math>
If the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] does not vary with time, then the time-evolution operator can be written as
:<math> U(t) = e^{-iHt / \hbar} ,</math>
where {{mvar|H}} is the Hamiltonian and {{mvar|?}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]]. Therefore,

:<math> \lang A \rang _t = \lang \psi (0) | e^{iHt / \hbar} A e^{-iHt / \hbar} | \psi(0) \rang .</math>

Peg all state vectors to a rigid basis of {{math|{{ket|''?''(0)}}}} then, and define 
:<math> A(t) := e^{iHt / \hbar} A e^{-iHt / \hbar} .</math>

It now follows that
:<math>\begin{align}
 {d \over dt} A(t) 
 & = {i \over \hbar} H e^{iHt / \hbar} A e^{-iHt / \hbar} + e^{iHt / \hbar} \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial t}\right) e^{-iHt / \hbar} + {i \over \hbar} e^{iHt / \hbar} A \cdot (-H) e^{-iHt / \hbar} \\
 & = {i \over \hbar} e^{iHt / \hbar} \left( H A - A H \right) e^{-iHt / \hbar} + e^{iHt / \hbar} \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial t}\right) e^{-iHt / \hbar} \\
 & = {i \over \hbar } \left( H A(t) - A(t) H \right) + e^{iHt / \hbar} \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial t}\right)e^{-iHt / \hbar} .
\end{align}</math>

Differentiation was according to the [[product rule]], while  ?''A''/?''t'' 
is the time derivative of the initial ''A'', not the ''A''(''t'') operator defined. The last equation holds since {{math|exp(&minus;''iHt''/''?'')}} commutes with {{math|''H''}}.

Thus
:<math> {d \over dt} A(t) = {i \over \hbar } [H, A(t)] + e^{iHt / \hbar} \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial t}\right)e^{-iHt / \hbar} ,</math>
and hence emerges the above Heisenberg equation of motion, since the convective functional dependence on ''x''(0) and ''p''(0) converts to the ''same'' dependence on ''x''(''t''), ''p''(''t''), so that the last term converts to  ?''A(t)''/?''t'' .   [''X'',&nbsp;''Y''] is the [[commutator]] of two operators and is defined as [''X'',&nbsp;''Y''] := ''XY''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''YX''.

The equation is solved by the ''A(t)'' defined above, as evident by use of the 
[[BCH formula#An important lemma|standard operator identity]],
:<math> {e^B A e^{-B}} = A + [B,A] + \frac{1}{2!} [B,[B,A]] + \frac{1}{3!}[B,[B,[B,A]]] + \cdots .</math>
which implies
:<math> A(t) = A + \frac{it}{\hbar}[H,A] - \frac{t^{2}}{2!\hbar^{2}}[H,[H,A]] - \frac{it^3}{3!\hbar^3}[H,[H,[H,A]]] + \dots </math>

This relation also holds for [[classical mechanics]], the [[classical limit]] of the above, given the [[Moyal bracket|correspondence]] between [[Poisson bracket]]s and [[commutators]],
:<math> [A,H] \leftrightarrow  i\hbar\{A,H\} </math>
In classical mechanics, for an ''A'' with no explicit time dependence,
:<math> \{A,H\} = {d\over dt}A~, </math>
so, again, the expression for ''A(t)'' is the Taylor expansion around ''t'' = 0.

In effect, the arbitrary rigid Hilbert space basis |''?(0)''?has receded from view, and is only considered at the very last step of taking specific expectation values or matrix elements of observables.

==Commutator relations==
Commutator relations may look different than in the Schrödinger picture, because of the time dependence of operators. For example, consider the operators {{math|''x''(''t''<sub>1</sub>), ''x''(''t''<sub>2</sub>), ''p''(''t''<sub>1</sub>)}} and {{math|   ''p''(''t''<sub>2</sub>)}}. The time evolution of those operators depends on the Hamiltonian of the system. Considering the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator,
:<math>H=\frac{p^{2}}{2m}+\frac{m\omega^{2}x^{2}}{2} </math> ,
the evolution of the position and momentum operators is given by:
:<math>{d \over dt} x(t) = {i \over \hbar } [ H  , x(t) ]=\frac {p}{m}</math> ,
:<math>{d \over dt} p(t) = {i \over \hbar } [ H  , p(t) ]= -m \omega^{2} x</math> .

Differentiating both equations once more and solving for them with proper initial conditions,
:<math>\dot{p}(0)=-m\omega^{2} x_0 ,</math>
:<math>\dot{x}(0)=\frac{p_0}{m} ,</math>  
leads to
:<math>x(t)=x_{0}\cos(\omega t)+\frac{p_{0}}{\omega m}\sin(\omega t) </math> ,
:<math>p(t)=p_{0}\cos(\omega t)-m\omega\!x_{0}\sin(\omega t) </math> .

Direct computation yields the more general commutator relations,

:<math>[x(t_{1}), x(t_{2})]=\frac{i\hbar}{m\omega}\sin(\omega t_{2}-\omega t_{1}) </math> ,
:<math>[p(t_{1}), p(t_{2})]=i\hbar m\omega\sin(\omega t_{2}-\omega t_{1}) </math> ,
:<math>[x(t_{1}), p(t_{2})]=i\hbar \cos(\omega t_{2}-\omega t_{1}) </math> .

For <math>t_{1}=t_{2}</math>, one simply recovers the standard canonical commutation relations valid in all pictures.

After Christianity came to Finland, the reputation of Lempo worsened: (s)he is portrayed in the folklore usually as erratic spirit, as love can be capricious, even dangerous, and it could even take control of a being and turn them to destruction.

The words "lempo" and "hiisi" are also used as very mild [[profanity|swear words]] in the [[Finnish language]]. "Piru" is a slightly stronger swear word. This too is work of Christians, they weren't originally bad words.

Since we do security work, that's an area of great concern – you know, another anthrax attack, a smallpox attack, chemical agents. She knows all of that."<ref name="nymag"/>

==Fundraising and charitable work==
In March 2001, desiring less travel and reduced public visibility, Nathan left Bristol-Myers and became a fund-raiser and later the managing director of [[Changing Our World]],<ref name="TimesStunned"/> an international fundraising and philanthropic services company headquartered in New York that helps not-for-profit groups raise money for causes such as juvenile [[blindness]] and [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]].<ref name="nydn042907"/>  She left the organization in 2006 and continues to serve as a pro bono adviser.<ref name="nydn042907"/> Contributions to the fund also created the TTF Scholarship Fund and America’s Camp for victims' children.

Further, she had wide-ranging scientific knowledge and research expertise."<ref name="nymag"/>   In addition, he said that he "put her to work helping me organize the hospitals" to assist those injured in the attacks.<ref name="nymag"/>

She became a founding member of the Board of Trustees of the [[Twin Towers Fund]], appointed by Giuliani,<ref name="nymag"/> which raised and distributed $216 million to over 600 families and individuals.<ref name="bw2020"/> Contributions to the fund also created the TTF Scholarship Fund and America’s Camp for victims' children.

[[File:Concerto on stage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Performance of a piano concerto involves a piano on stage with the orchestra]]
A '''piano concerto'''  is a [[concerto]] written for a [[piano]] accompanied by an [[orchestra]] or other large [[musical ensemble|ensemble]].

Keyboad concerti were common in the time of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. Occasionally, Bach's [[harpsichord concerti]] are played on piano.

==History==
===Classical and romantic===
As the piano developed and became accepted, [[composer]]s naturally started writing [[concerti]] for it. This happened in the late 18th century, during the [[Classical period (music)|Classical music era]]. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was the most important composer in the early development of the form. Mozart's body of masterly piano concerti put his stamp firmly on the genre well into the Romantic era.

Mozart wrote many piano concertos for himself to perform (his [[Mozart piano concertos|27 piano concertos]] also include concerti for two and three pianos). With the rise of the [[pianist|piano]] [[virtuoso]], many composer-pianists did likewise, notably [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], and [[Robert Schumann]]—and also lesser-known musicians like [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], [[Joseph Wölfl]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], [[John Field (composer)|John Field]], [[Ferdinand Ries]], and [[Franz Xaver Mozart|F. X. Mozart]].

Well known examples from the middle to late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era include concerti by [[Edvard Grieg]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]. [[Antonín Dvo?ák]] and [[Franz Xaver Scharwenka]] wrote some lesser-known concerti during this time. [[Edward Elgar]] made sketches for a piano concerto but never completed it.

In the 19th century, [[Henry Litolff]] blurred the boundary between piano concerto and symphony in his five works entitled ''Concerto Symphonique'', and [[Ferruccio Busoni]] added a male choir in the last movement of his hour-long [[Piano Concerto (Busoni)|concerto]]. [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]] wrote his [[Piano Concerto (Furtwängler)|Symphonic Concerto for Piano and Orchestra]], which lasts more than one hour, in 1924-1937. In a more general sense, the term "piano concerto" could extend to the numerous often programmatic concerted works for piano and orchestra from the era – Beethoven's ''[[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy]],'' Liszt's ''[[Totentanz (Liszt)|Totentanz]]'' and ''Ruins of Athens'' Variations, and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Burleske]]'' are only a few of the hundreds of such works.

The few well-known piano concerti that dominate today's concert programs and discographies comprise only a small part of the repertoire that proliferated on the European music scene during the 19th century.

===20th century and contemporary===
The piano concerto form survived through the [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] into [[Contemporary classical music|the 21st]], with examples being written by [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Béla Bartók]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Nikolai Medtner]], [[Alexander Tcherepnin]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Michael Tippett]], [[Charles Wuorinen]], [[York Bowen]], [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]], [[Bohuslav Martin?]], [[Peter Mieg]], [[Heinrich Sutermeister]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Samuel Barber]], [[Witold Lutos?awski]], [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]], [[Peter Mennin]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Elliott Carter]], [[Dora Peja?evi?]], [[Selim Palmgren]], [[Leroy Anderson]], [[Behzad Ranjbaran]], [[Ferde Grofe]], [[Emma Lou Diemer]], and others.

Parts of other 20th century symphonic works give the piano occasional prominence like any other instrument of the orchestra, as in the ''[[Symphony in Three Movements (Stravinsky)|Symphony in Three Movements]]'' by [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Samuel Barber]]'s violin concerto, and the ''Symphony No.3'' by [[Michael Tippett]].

====Works for piano left-hand and orchestra====
The German [[Paul Wittgenstein]] lost his right arm during [[World War I]], and on resuming his musical career asked a number of composers to write pieces for him that required the left hand only. The Czech [[Otakar Hollmann]], whose right arm was injured in the war, did likewise but to a lesser degree. The results of these commissions include [[List of works for piano left-hand and orchestra|concertante pieces for orchestra and piano left hand]] by [[Sergei Bortkiewicz|Bortkiewicz]], [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]], [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], [[Leoš Janá?ek|Janá?ek]], [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold|Korngold]], [[Bohuslav Martin?|Martin?]], [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Franz Schmidt]], [[Richard Strauss]],  and others.

===Works for two and more pianos and orchestra===
Concertos and concert works for two pianos were written by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] (two to four pianos, BWV 1060-65, actually harpsichord concertos, but often performed on pianos), [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (two, K 242 (originally for three pianos and orchestra) and K 365), [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] (two, 1823-4), [[Max Bruch|Bruch]] (1912), [[Béla Bartók]] (1927/1932, a reworking of his Sonata for two pianos and percussion), [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]] (1932), [[Arthur Benjamin]] (1938), [[Peter Mieg]] (1939-41), [[Darius Milhaud]] (1941 and 1951), [[Bohuslav Martin?]] (1943), [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] (c. 1946), [[Roy Harris]] (1946), [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]] (two works, both 1957), [[Walter Piston]] (1959), [[Luciano Berio]] (1973), and [[Harald Genzmer]] (1990). Apart from the Bach and Mozart examples, works for more than two pianos and orchestra are considerably rarer, but have been written by [[Carl Czerny]] (''Quatuor Concerto'' for four pianos, op. 230), [[Morton Gould]] (''Inventions'' for four pianos and orchestra, 1954), [[Peter Racine Fricker]] (''Concertante'' for three pianos, timpani, and strings, 1956), and [[Wolfgang Fortner]] (''Triplum'' for three pianos and orchestra, 1966)<ref>Maurice Hinson, Music for Piano and Orchestra, an annotated guide, Indiana University Press, 1993</ref>

==Characteristics==
===Form===
A classical piano concerto is often in three movements.

#A quick opening movement in [[sonata form]] including a [[cadenza]] (which may be [[improvisation|improvised]] by the soloist).
#A slow, free expressive movement
#A faster [[rondo]]

Examples by Mozart and Beethoven follow this model, but many others do not. Beethoven's fourth concerto includes a last-movement cadenza, and many composers introduced innovations.  Liszt's concerti are played without a break, though separate movements are clearly evident.

One example of a concerto in only one discrete movement (''Allegro brillante'') is Tchaikovsky's [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Concerto No. 3 in E-flat major]] (1893).

{{Politics of Jamaica}}
The '''Prime Minister of Jamaica''' is [[Jamaica]]'s [[head of government]], currently [[Portia Simpson Miller]]. Simpson Miller, as leader of the governing [[People's National Party]] (PNP), was sworn in as Prime Minister on 5 January 2012, succeeding [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP) leader [[Andrew Holness]]. This was a result of the PNP's victory in [[Jamaican general election, 2011|Jamaica's 29 December 2011 general election]].

The Prime Minister is formally appointed into office by the [[Governor General of Jamaica]], who represents [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], the [[Monarchy in Jamaica|Queen of Jamaica]] (Jamaica's [[Head of State]]). Portia Lucretia Simpson-Miller, ON, MP (born 12 December 1945) is a Jamaican politician who has been the seventh Prime Minister of Jamaica since 5 January 2012. Simpson-Miller, who leads the People's National Party, previously served as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2007; she was Leader of the Opposition from 2007 to 2012.[1]
 
While serving as Prime Minister, Simpson-Miller also chose to hold the positions of Minister of Defence, Development, Information and Sports. She previously served as Minister of Labour, Social Security and Sport, Minister of Tourism and Sports and Minister of Local Government throughout the years.[2][3] Simpson-Miller defeated Prime Minister Andrew Holness of the Jamaica Labour Party in the December 2011 general election

He is best known for his time with [[WWE]] under the [[ring name]] '''Edge'''.

Copeland was trained by professional wrestlers [[Sweet Daddy Siki]] and [[Ron Hutchinson]]. Throughout the 1990s, he wrestled in various U.S. [[Independent circuit|independent promotions]]. During his time in these promotions, he competed in singles and tag team competition, the latter with long-time friend [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]. In 1997, Copeland signed a developmental deal with the WWF and began competing for the company later that year; he made his televised debut the following June under the ring name Edge. In July 1999, he won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] at a house show in [[Toronto]], making it his first title reign with the company. [[Edge and Christian|He and Christian]], billed as brothers and later childhood friends in WWF/WWE [[Kayfabe|storylines]], went on to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] on seven different occasions. During this time, they gained notoriety in the tag team division, partly due to their participation in [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match]]es.

Edge won 31 championships in WWE overall, including 11 [[World Heavyweight Championship (professional wrestling)|world championships]] (the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWE Championship]] [[List of WWE World Heavyweight Champions|four times]] and the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] a record [[List of World Heavyweight Champions (WWE)|seven times]]), five Intercontinental Championships, one [[WWE United States Championship|United States Championship]], and 14 Tag Team Championships (a record 12 [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]]s and two [[WWE Tag Team Championship]]s).

He won the 2001 [[King of the Ring]] tournament, was the first [[Money in the Bank ladder match]] winner in 2005 and again in 2007 (also being the winner of a match to reclaim and cash in the contract, thus becoming the first to cash in and win both world titles), and won the [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]] in [[Royal Rumble (2010)|2010]], making him the only wrestler in history to achieve all three of those accomplishments.<ref>{{cite web|last=Murphy |first=Ryan |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/edge-career-history |title=WWE "Living on the Edge: The Career of Adam Copeland"|publisher=Wwe.com |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref> He headlined many major [[pay-per-view]] events for WWE, including [[WrestleMania XXIV]].

He has made guest appearances on television shows such as ''[[The Weakest Link]]'', ''[[Mind of Mencia]]'', ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'', and ''[[MADtv]]''.

==Professional wrestling career==
[[File:Edge WHC Chile.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Edge during a WWE Live event as the [[World Heavyweight Champion (WWE)]].]]

===Early career===
During Copeland's training, he trained one weekday and all weekend. The school's practice ring was actually a 12-by-14-foot [[boxing ring]] with a harder mat than that of a typical [[wrestling ring]]. The ceiling above it was low, with exposed pipes, preventing top-rope moves from being performed. Copeland later credited this environment with forcing him to drill and improve his technical mat-based wrestling. His classmates included [[Johnny Swinger]], [[Joe E. Legend]], and Rob Etcheverria (who later became notable for training wrestlers such as [[Gail Kim]], [[Angelina Love]], and [[Taylor Wilde]]).<ref>[http://podcastone.com/Talk-Is-Jericho ''Talk is Jericho'', EP03 "Edge Pt. 1" (around 32:00)]</ref>

Throughout the 1990s, Copeland wrestled on the [[independent circuit]] in Ontario and the [[Great Lakes]] region of the United States under the [[ring name]] '''Sexton Hardcastle'''.<ref name="lamont" /> He became a part of the tag team Sex and Violence with [[Joe Hitchen|Joe Legend]]. In the mid-1990s, he wrestled as '''Adam Impact''' for Tony Condello's [[Winnipeg]] promotion. In 1997, Sex and Violence became part of a larger [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] called Thug Life, joining [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian Cage]] (Copeland's childhood friend), Zakk Wyld, Bill Skullion, and [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhino Richards]].<ref name="SLAMbio">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/edge.html|accessdate=2009-02-01|title=Edge bio|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref> During his independent career, he won the MWCW Tag Team Championship twice with Legend and the ICW Street Fight Tag Team Championship twice (once each with Legend and Cage).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/indy/mwcw-icw/mwcwtitles.html#mwcwtag|title=Midwest / Insane Championship Wrestling|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2009-10-23}}</ref>

The duo of Hardcastle and Cage were known as Hard Impact before changing their name to The Suicide Blondes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingEdge/copeland_interview.html|title=Edge speaks|last=Powell|first=John|work=Slam!

Impressed, he suggested Copeland send an audition tape to the [[WWE|WWF]]. Copeland did not hear back from WWF, but some time later, De Marco was appointed President of WWF Canada and told Copeland that he'd put in a good word. On May 10, 1996, Copeland (as Sexton Hardcastle) replaced [[Bob Holly]]'s opponent on short notice in the opening match of a WWF house show in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].<ref name="nemeth 14">{{cite book|last=Nemeth|first=Jason D.|title=Edge|publisher=Capston Press|year=2010|page=14|isbn=978-1-4296-3346-8}}</ref>

After a [[Grand Prix Wrestling]] tour in the summer of 1997, De Marco urged Copeland to go to [[Calgary]], where Hart was informally training wrestlers while recovering from knee surgery. He spent his tour earnings on a plane ticket, and landed with no money or place to stay. He called [[Johnny Smith (wrestler)|Johnny Smith]], whom he'd met twice, and Smith agreed to give him food and shelter. Smith also drove Copeland to and from the gym and Hart's house, where he trained alongside [[Ken Shamrock]], [[Test (wrestler)|Test]], [[Mark Henry]], and [[Kurrgan]]. Copeland returned to the [[Maritimes]] for another Grand Prix tour before going back to Hart's house, bringing Christian with him. After this camp, Hart was impressed enough to put in a good word for both men at the WWF.

The two were unable to continue the match and were removed from ringside on stretchers. After This Edge and Orton also became rivals in their goals of achieving the WWE Championship.

====La Familia and championship reigns (2007–2009)====
{{Main|La Familia (professional wrestling)}}
On the May 7, 2007 episode of ''Raw'', Edge interrupted an in-ring promo by the winner of the 2007 Money in the Bank contract, [[Mr. Kennedy]]. Kennedy had said for weeks that he would not cash in the contract until the following WrestleMania, but Edge decided to goad him into a match for his briefcase. Edge attacked Kennedy before the match even started, severely injuring his shoulder, and took advantage of the injury to beat Kennedy and take the briefcase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2007/dec/02/mr_kennedy_endures_pitfalls23762/|title='Mr. Kennedy' endures pitfalls|last=Mooneyham|first=Mike|work=[[The Post and Courier]]|date=2007-12-02|accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref> Edge thus became the first person to gain the Money in the Bank contract twice and the first not to do so in the ladder match.<ref name="EdgeMitB2">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/05072007/mainarticle|accessdate=2008-07-09|last=DiFino| first=Lennie|title=Gold digging|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> (This was done to give Kennedy time to recuperate from what was originally thought to be a completely torn triceps tendon, but later turned out to be a much less severe injury.)

It did not take Edge long to take advantage of his newly won opportunity. On the May 11 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', the main event was to feature [[Dave Batista|Batista]] facing the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[The Undertaker]] in a steel cage match for the title. The match ended in a draw when both Undertaker and Batista were ruled to have hit the floor simultaneously. Afterward, a returning [[Mark Henry]] came to ringside and attacked the champion, leaving him a bloody, broken mess in the ring. Edge chose that time to strike, entering the scene as Henry was leaving. He strode to the ring, handed the briefcase to referee [[Jim Korderas]], and demanded that he be given a match as per his contract. As soon as the bell rang, Edge went to cover the champion, but Undertaker kicked out at two. Edge again covered, but only got two. Edge then waited for the spent Undertaker to struggle to his feet, then speared him and covered him for the pin and the World Heavyweight Championship.<ref>{{cite journal|title=WWE hits the buffers|first=Patrick|last=Lennon|date=2007-05-11|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]}}</ref> As a result of this victory, Edge became a part of the SmackDown! brand.

On June 29, 2008, Edge faced Batista in a match for his title at [[Night of Champions (2008)|Night of Champions]]. Due to interference from La Familia and a belt shot from Edge, he was able to defeat Batista. The next night on ''Raw'', which happened a week after that year's [[WWE Draft|draft lottery]], Edge came out to gloat about his victory as well as the fact that, thanks to the draft, both the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship were both ''SmackDown'' property ([[Triple H]], who was the reigning WWE Champion at the time, was drafted to ''SmackDown'' and had retained his title at Night of Champions as well). As Edge was leaving the ring, an angry Batista (who had been drafted back to ''Raw'' after three years as a ''SmackDown'' wrestler) came out and chased Edge back to the ring. He proceeded to assault Edge, finishing with a [[Powerbomb#Sitout powerbomb|Batista Bomb]] in the ring. Just as Batista was leaving, [[CM Punk]] ran to the ring carrying the Money in the Bank briefcase he had won at [[WrestleMania XXIV]], with referee [[Mike Chioda]] tagging along with him. Since Edge was still out of it from the attack, he did not see Punk come into the ring and therefore was unaware that Punk was cashing in his contract. Once the bell rang, Punk simply hit Edge with a Go To Sleep and pinned him to win the World Heavyweight Championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/results/|title=A Draft Disaster|date=2008-07-01|last=Sitterson|first=Aubrey|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-07-01}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Copeland used to play hockey with retired [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) player [[Aaron Downey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiens.com/eng/magazine/thelastword.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061024073510/http://www.canadiens.com/eng/magazine/thelastword.html|archivedate=2006-10-24|title=WWE Superstar Edge goes one on one with canadiens.com|author=J.S.

His [[autobiography]], ''[[Adam Copeland on Edge]]'', was published on November 4, 2004. Unlike most wrestlers who used "[[ghostwriter]]s" to write their biographies, Copeland wrote the entire book himself, in longhand. [[Mick Foley]], who also wrote his wrestling autobiography himself in longhand, wrote the foreword to his book.<ref>{{cite book|last=Copeland|first=Adam|title=Adam Copeland on Edge|publisher=[[WWE Books]]|date=November 2004|page=7|isbn=0-7434-8347-2}}</ref> Copeland does not smoke.

All of Copeland's tattoos represent a stage in his career. His sun, which Copeland got while recovering from his neck injury, represents "looking towards brighter days." The cross tattoo represents his time with the Brood, and his star and skull tattoos represent his Rated-R Superstar persona and his self-proclaimed status as the "[[Guns N' Roses]] of wrestling". He is close friends with fellow wrestler Jason Reso, otherwise known as [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/superstarink/articles/edge|title=Edge: A history in ink|accessdate=2007-12-06|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> Copeland's favorite band is the [[Foo Fighters]], as he revealed during his Hall of Fame induction.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPoscHIGi70</ref>

Copeland has been married two times.

==Controversy==
In March 2007, Copeland became a key figure in an alleged steroid ring and drug investigation. On March 19, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' posted an article on its website in its continuing series investigating a steroid and [[Growth hormone treatment|HGH]] ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Copeland, who was alleged to have obtained HGH.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/more/03/19/wrestlers/index.html|title=Wrestlers allegedly tied to drug ring|accessdate=2007-03-21|date=2007-03-19|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|publisher=CNN}}</ref> Copeland has previously admitted to using steroids in April 2004 after neck surgery as an experiment on TSN's ''Off The Record with Michael Landsberg'' in January 2005. He said he felt it slowed him down, so he quickly got off the substance.<ref name="liveaudiowrestling">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefightnetwork.com/news/wrestling?nid=1336|author=John Pollack|title=Pro Wrestlers Tied to Steroid Ring|accessdate=2007-03-21|date=2007-03-20|publisher=The Fight Network}}</ref> According to Copeland, he took HGH after returning from a spinal fusion neck surgery. He was told by doctors that it would help the bones grow back around the screws and plate that were inserted into his neck. He claims to have taken blood tests, consulted doctors, studied the drug, and got prescriptions before deciding to take them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=107643765&blogID=243887243|last=Copeland|first=Adam|title=My new blog (this is the controversial one!!!!)|accessdate=2007-03-21|date=March 2007|publisher=MySpace}}</ref>

According to a ''Sports Illustrated'' article rotated on August 30, 2007, Copeland was named one of 10 superstars found to have purchased steroids and other drugs from an online pharmacy, a violation of the WWE Talent Wellness program. Copeland was said to have received [[Growth hormone|somatropin, genotropin]], and [[stanozolol]] between September 2004 and February 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/more/08/30/wrestlers/|title=Fourteen wrestlers tied to pipeline|publisher=CNN|date=2007-08-30|accessdate=2007-08-31|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/31/AR2007083101961.html|title=Pro Wrestling Suspends 10 Linked to Steroid Ring|first=Paul|last=Farhi|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2007-09-01|accessdate=2007-09-02}}</ref>

In the [[United States]],<ref name="WCW"/> Guerrero wrestled in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), and in [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE). Guerrero's [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] was that of "Latino Heat", a crafty, resourceful wrestler who would do anything to win a match. His [[catchphrase]] became "I Lie! I Cheat! I Steal!,"  which was used in one of his entrance themes. Guerrero partly used this phrase in his autobiography ''Cheating Death, Stealing Life''.

Despite being a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] for most of his career, he got [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Over|over]] in and outside the ring being the youngest, yet most popular, athletic and successful of the Guerrero brothers. Guerrero was widely regarded as one of the most respected and gifted technical wrestlers in history. Guerrero experienced various [[substance abuse]] problems outside of wrestling, including [[alcoholism]] and an addiction to [[Analgesic|painkillers]]. These real-life issues were sometimes incorporated into his [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|storylines]]. Guerrero won 23 titles during his career, which encompassed the [[Grand Slam Championship#WWE|WWE Grand Slam Championship]].

==Early life==
Eddie Guerrero was born and raised in [[El Paso, Texas]] where he graduated from Jefferson High School and attended the [[University of New Mexico]] as [[New Mexico Highlands University]] on an [[athletic scholarship]]. It was there that Guerrero entered [[collegiate wrestling]] before moving to Mexico to train as a professional wrestler.<ref name=rfecw71>{{cite book|title=The Rise & Fall of ECW: Extreme Championship Wrestling|last=Loverro| first=Thom|coauthors=Paul Heyman, Tazz, Tommy Dreamer|year=2006|publisher=mon and Schuster|isbn=1-4165-1058-3|page=71}}</ref>

Guerrero followed in the footsteps of his uncle [[Enrique Llanes|Enrique Llanes (Yañez)]] and cousin Javier Llanes (Yañez), who also wrestled in Mexico. As a boy, Eddie would attend the wrestling promotions held by his father [[Gory Guerrero]] at the [[El Paso County Coliseum]]. Guerrero's father allowed him and his nephew [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo]] to wrestle one another during intermissions.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (1992–1994)===
In Mexico, he wrestled mainly for [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA), teaming with [[El Hijo del Santo]] as the new version of La Pareja Atómica (The Atomic Pair), the [[tag team]] of Gory Guerrero and [[Santo|El Santo]].

After Guerrero [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|turned]] on Santo and allied with [[Art Barr]] as La Pareja del Terror (The Pair of Terror), the duo became arguably the most hated tag team in [[lucha libre]] history.<ref name="OWOW"/> Along with Barr, [[Konnan]], Chicano Power, and [[Louie Spicolli|Madonna’s Boyfriend]], Guerrero formed [[Los Gringos Locos]] (The Crazy Americans), a villainous [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]].<ref name="OWOW"/><ref name="losgringoslocos">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/l/los-gringos-locos.html|title=Los Gringos Locos' Profile|accessdate=2008-03-23|publisher=Online World Of Wrestling}}</ref> Guerrero later said that no matter how many people joined Los Gringos Locos, the stable was all about Art. Locos feuded mostly with El Hijo del Santo and his partner [[Octagón]], eventually ending in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|Hair vs. Mask match]] at the first lucha [[pay-per-view]] in America, ''[[AAA When Worlds Collide|When Worlds Collide]]'', which they lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/la.html#1194|title=When Worlds Collide results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref>

Guerrero and Barr's first break would come when they were noticed in late 1994 by the owner of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), [[Paul Heyman]], and were approached about wrestling for him in 1995. Barr, however, died before he could join ECW with Guerrero.

===New Japan Pro Wrestling (1993–1996)===
In 1993, Guerrero began wrestling in Japan for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW), where he was known as the second incarnation of [[Black Tiger (professional wrestling)|Black Tiger]]. He became more successful upon his return when he won the [[Best of the Super Juniors]] 1996 tournament of [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|junior heavyweights]]. He received a shot at the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship|IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion]] The Great Sasuke at NJPW Skydiving J but lost the match.<ref name="wcw96">{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/eguerrero.html#1996|title=Eddie Guerrero's WCW Career (1996)|publisher=Accelerator's Wrestling Rollercoaster}}</ref>

====Latino World Order (1998)====
{{Main|Latino World Order}}
Despite his success and popularity, Guerrero had been one of many wrestlers who were frustrated at never being given a chance to be main event stars in WCW. These frustrations came to a head when Guerrero requested that WCW President [[Eric Bischoff]] either [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] his character or give him a raise for family reasons. Bischoff responded by allegedly throwing [[coffee]] at Guerrero (however, in his autobiography, Guerrero states that Bischoff accidentally knocked his coffee off the table and that it was a complete accident that he was hit). Furious, Guerrero demanded Bischoff release him from his contract on a live episode of ''Nitro''. Guerrero then left the company for a period of months, angry at Bischoff for what he had done. Guerrero later returned to WCW, leading to the belief that maybe Guerrero's angry speeches against Bischoff were actually a [[List of professional wrestling terms#W|work]] (Guerrero later confirmed it to be a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|worked shoot]]). Guerrero would later contradict himself on WWE's [[DVD]] ''Monday Night War'' claiming that he tried to put personal differences aside for the good of the company, yet found himself angry and outraged once more because of Bischoff's supposed continued refusal to elevate Guerrero and other similar wrestlers. He let [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Brian Adams]] pin him and get an upset victory in a match.<ref name="wcw98"/>

On-screen, Guerrero responded to Bischoff's actions by forming the ''Latino World Order'' (LWO), which was a take-off of Bischoff's [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]].<ref name="lwo">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/l/lwo.html|title=Latino World Order (lWo) Profile|publisher=[[Cauliflower Alley Club|Online World of Wrestling]]|accessdate=2008-02-15}}</ref> The group was an answer to Bischoff's "refusal" to push Latino wrestlers in ways they felt they deserved.<ref name="lwo"/> The LWO was formed in October when Guerrero returned to WCW, with [[Héctor Garza]] and [[Leonardo Carrera|Damien]].<ref name="wcw98"/> The group eventually grew to encompass almost all the Mexican wrestlers working for WCW at the time. They mainly feuded with Rey Mysterio, Jr. and [[Billy Kidman]] because they wanted Mysterio to join the group. He faced Kidman in a match for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship but Mysterio interfered and helped Kidman win the match and keep the title.<ref name="wcw98"/> However, Guerrero was involved in a serious car accident on New Year's Day, 1999 that cut short the LWO storyline. Guerrero survived the accident and returned to wrestling in a matter of months.

In March 2000, Guerrero, who was wrestling as a villain, began pursuing the affections of [[Chyna]], who he referred to as his "Mamacita". At the time Chyna was allies with [[Chris Jericho]] and initially rejected his advances. The night after [[WrestleMania 2000]], on the April 3, 2000 edition of ''Raw Is War'', Guerrero faced off against Jericho for the [[WWE European Championship|European Championship]] that Jericho had defeated [[Kurt Angle]] for the previous night. During the match Chyna turned on Jericho and helped Guerrero win, and later explained her actions by declaring that she could not resist his "Latino Heat."<ref name="wwf2000"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm16/results/|title=WrestleMania 2000 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/euro/358878|title=Eddie Guerrero's first European Championship reign|publisher=WWE| accessdate=2008-02-15}}</ref><ref name="raw2000">{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_2000/|title=RAW is WAR results, 2000|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-15}}</ref> After Chyna abandoned [[Amy Dumas|Lita]] to be attacked by the [[Dudley Boyz]], he and Chyna began a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Mr. Águila|Essa Rios]] and Lita, ending in a European title defense at [[WWE Backlash#2000|Backlash]], which was also billed as the night of Guerrero's [[prom]] (he was said to have just earned a [[General Educational Development|GED]]). Guerrero defeated Rios after arriving at ringside in a 1957 [[Chevrolet]], even wrestling in his tuxedo pants and a [[bow tie]].<ref name="wwf2000"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/history/backlash2000/results/|title=Backlash 2000 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-15}}</ref> Guerrero successfully retained the title against former Radicalz friends Saturn and Malenko in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]] at [[WWE Judgment Day#2000|Judgment Day]],<ref name="wwf2000"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/judgmentday2000/results/|title=Judgment Day 2000 official results|publisher=WWE| accessdate=2008-02-15}}</ref> before finally losing the title to Saturn at [[WWF Fully Loaded#2000|Fully Loaded]].<ref name="wwf2000"/> The two slowly began to become popular with the fans but over the next few months, friction began to build between Guerrero and Chyna.

Chyna was upset when Guerrero pinned her to advance in the [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring]] tournament.<ref name="wwf2000"/> Then at [[SummerSlam (2000)|SummerSlam]] that August, Guerrero and Chyna wrestled a mixed tag team match against [[Trish Stratus]] and [[Val Venis]], who at the time was the reigning [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]]. The Intercontinental Championship was on the line in the match, and whoever scored the pin would win the title. Guerrero's team won the match, but Chyna scored the pin on Trish and became a two-time Intercontinental Champion.<ref name="wwf2000"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/2000/results/|title=SummerSlam 2000 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate= 2008-02-15}}</ref> Although Guerrero said he didn't mind that his partner was the champion, on the September 4 ''Raw is War'' he went to WWF Commissioner [[Mick Foley]] and asked to be inserted into Chyna's title defense against [[Kurt Angle]] claiming that he did not want Angle to hurt his "mamacita". During the course of the match Angle knocked down Chyna with the title belt and Guerrero laid on top of her to try to revive her. However, this resulted in Guerrero "accidentally" [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinning]] Chyna as her shoulders were still on the mat, and thus Guerrero won the match and his first Intercontinental Championship.<ref name="wwf2000"/><ref name="raw2000"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322640|title=Eddie Guerrero's first Intercontinental Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref> Chyna became visibly uncomfortable as Guerrero began to cheat in order to retain his title, while Guerrero was upset that Chyna was posing for ''[[Playboy]]'' [[magazine]], even trying to invade the [[Playboy Mansion]] to stop the photo shoot.<ref name="wwf2000"/> Just when it appeared that Chyna would leave Guerrero, he proposed to her and she accepted.<ref name="wwf2000"/> At [[WWE Unforgiven#2000|Unforgiven]], Chyna helped Guerrero in retaining his title against [[Solofa Fatu|Rikishi]].<ref name="wwf2000"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/unforgiven/history/2000/results/|title=Unforgiven 2000 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref> The engagement was called off when Guerrero was caught showering with two of [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Godfather's]] [[Prostitution|hos]] (one was [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]]) claiming that "Two Mamacitas are better than one!"<ref name="wwf2000"/>

====The Radicalz reunion and departure (2000–2001)====
Guerrero turned into a villain as a result of the incident. Then, the Radicalz reunited and feuded with the reformed [[D-Generation X]] (Chyna, [[Billy Gunn]], [[Road Dogg]], and [[Ron Killings|K-Kwik]]). They defeated DX at [[Survivor Series (2000)|Survivor Series]] in an elimination tag team match and assisted Triple H in his match with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]].<ref name="wwf2000"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2000/results/|title=Survivor Series 2000 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref> Guerrero was later defeated by Gunn for the Intercontinental Championship on the Thanksgiving edition of Smackdown.<ref name="wwf2000"/> At [[WWE Rebellion#2000|Rebellion]], Guerrero and Malenko lost to Gunn and Chyna.<ref name="wwf2000"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/rebel.html#2000|title=Rebellion 2000 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref> Benoit left the group to focus on a singles career while the rest of the Radicalz feuded with Lita and the [[Hardy Boyz]] ([[Matt Hardy|Matt]] and [[Jeff Hardy|Jeff]]). At [[Armageddon (2000)|Armageddon]], the Radicalz defeated the Hardyz and Lita in an elimination tag team match.<ref name="wwf2000"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/armageddon/history/2000/results/|title=Armageddon 2000 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref>

In early 2001, Guerrero feuded with Chris Jericho, Benoit, and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] over Jericho's Intercontinental Championship. At [[No Way Out (2001)|No Way Out]], the four men faced each other in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Fatal Four-Way match]], which Jericho won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2001/results/|title=No Way Out 2001 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref> Guerrero focused on the European Championship, feuding with the champion [[Test (wrestler)|Test]] defeating him at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] to win his second European Championship with help from Saturn and Malenko.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm17/results/|title=WrestleMania X-Seven official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/euro/358838|title=Eddie Guerrero's second European Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref> In April, Radicalz feuded with Test and his partners. Guerrero eventually left the Radicalz, siding with the Hardy Boyz and Lita. At this point, Guerrero developed an addiction to pain medication stemming from his 1999 car accident and in May 2001 was sent to [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]]. To explain his absence, a storyline was created where Guerrero was "injured" by [[Matt Bloom|Albert]] in a match.<ref name="wwf2001">{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/eguerrero.html#2001|title=Eddie Guerrero's WWF Career (2001)|publisher=Accelerator's Wrestling Rollercoaster|accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref> On November 9, 2001, he was arrested for [[Drunk driving (United States)|drunk driving]] and was subsequently released by the WWF three days later.

[[Image:Eddie Guerrero on a corner.jpg|thumb|Guerrero lies on a corner, one of his characteristic traits]]
On August 1, 2002, Guerrero and Benoit began to wrestle exclusively for WWE's [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]]. Guerrero feuded with [[Adam Copeland|Edge]], to whom he lost at [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/2002/results/|title=SummerSlam 2002 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate= 2008-02-16}}</ref> Guerrero continued his feud with Edge, whom he defeated at [[Unforgiven (2002)|Unforgiven]]; they then had a No Disqualification match two weeks after Unforgiven on ''SmackDown'' which Edge won thus ending the rivalry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/unforgiven/history/2002/results/|title=Unforgiven 2002 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref> With Benoit focusing on [[Kurt Angle]], Guerrero aligned himself with his nephew Chavo, forming the tag team Los Guerreros.<ref name="smackdown02"/><ref name="losguerreros">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/l/los-guerreros.html|title=Los Guerreros Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref> In contrast to a previous WCW storyline with his nephew, Chavo fully agreed with his uncle as their slogan stated "We lie, we cheat, and we steal, but at least we're honest about it." In order to push the new tag team, [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignettes]] were produced, which included things such as the two finagling their way into a rich lady's house and throwing a pool party.<ref name="smackdown02">{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/eguerrero.html#sd|title=Eddie Guerrero's ''SmackDown!''

====Teaming with Tajiri and United States Champion (2003–2004)====
Five days prior to [[Judgment Day (2003)|Judgment Day]], Chavo tore his biceps, forcing Guerrero to look for another partner. He chose [[Yoshihiro Tajiri|Tajiri]].

[[File:Eddie Guerrero on SmackDown cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Guerrero in 2004]]
In July 2003, Guerrero competed in a tournament for the United States Championship.

Guerrero tried to get Benoit in trouble by placing the title belt on top of the unconscious Benoit. It did not work, however, since he knocked out the referee earlier with a belt shot to the kidneys. The match ended with interference and a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|Gore]] from [[Terry Gerin|Rhyno]], Benoit's own partner, who was furious at the team's failure. Guerrero himself said that this was a major point in the character of Latino Heat, since he himself realized that the fans wanted to see him lie, cheat, and steal.

[[File:EddieandBenoitWMXX.jpg|thumb|360px|right|Guerrero, with close friend [[Chris Benoit]] celebrating as reigning World Champions at [[WrestleMania XX]].]]
When Chris Benoit jumped to ''Raw'' after winning the [[Royal Rumble (2004)|Royal Rumble]], using his title shot to go for [[Triple H]]'s [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]], Guerrero won a 15-man Royal Rumble style match on the January 29, 2004 episode of ''SmackDown!'' to earn a shot at the WWE Championship.<ref name="smackdown04"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/040129.html|title=SmackDown! results - January 29, 2004|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> After becoming the number one contender, Guerrero elevated himself to main event status and began feuding with the WWE Champion [[Brock Lesnar]]. At [[No Way Out (2004)|No Way Out]], Guerrero defeated Lesnar in the main event to win the WWE Championship.

====Final storylines (2005)====
At the [[Royal Rumble (2005)|Royal Rumble]], Guerrero entered at #1 and lasted 28:11 before being eliminated. In a humorous skit before the Rumble, he drew his number the same time Ric Flair drew his. In an attempt to get a better draw, Guerrero switched his number with Flair's (and stole Flair's wallet in the process). Theodore Long made him return both items before the match. Flair would enter at #30.
At [[No Way Out (2005)|No Way Out]], Guerrero teamed up with longtime friend and sometimes rival, [[Rey Mysterio]] and defeated The Basham Brothers to win his final title, the WWE Tag Team Championship for a fourth time, with it being Mysterio's third reign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2005/results/|title=No Way Out 2005 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwetag/329962|title=Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio's first Tag Team Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> Many expected the new champions to defend their title at [[WrestleMania 21]], but after encouragement from Chavo,<ref name="smackdown05">{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/eguerrero.html#2005|title=Eddie Guerrero's ''SmackDown!''

[[Image:ReyAndEddie.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Guerrero and Mysterio with the [[WWE Tag Team Championship]] belts.]]
At the end of one episode of ''SmackDown!'', he attacked his former tag team partner, Mysterio, leaving him bruised and bloody after [[suplex]]ing him onto a set of steel steps thus completing his heel turn. Guerrero, having turned heel, then adopted a new, somewhat [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] gimmick. During this time, he also stopped driving his low-riders down the ring and walked to the ring slowly with a frown on his face, gained a new theme which was a darker remix of "Lie, Cheat, And Steal" and reverted to using the [[Professional wrestling holds#Cloverleaf|Lasso from El Paso]] as his finishing move (He still used the Frog Splash).<ref name="smackdown05"/> At [[Judgment Day (2005)|Judgment Day]], Guerrero lost to Mysterio by disqualification after hitting Mysterio with a chair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/judgmentday2005/results/|title=Judgment Day 2005 official results| publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref>

On the June 30 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Guerrero threatened to reveal a secret about Mysterio and his son Dominick. The storyline grew to involve the families of both men, with both sides pleading for Guerrero not to reveal the secret.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/06302005/|title=Jackpot!|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> Mysterio defeated Guerrero again at [[The Great American Bash (2005)|The Great American Bash]], a match with a stipulation that if Guerrero lost, he would not tell the secret.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/thegreatamericanbash/history/2005/results/|title=The Great American Bash 2005 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071211021901/http://www.wwe.com/shows/thegreatamericanbash/history/2005/results/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-11}}</ref> Yet Guerrero revealed the secret anyway on the following episode of ''SmackDown!'' – telling Dominick and the audience that Guerrero was his real father. In the following weeks, Guerrero revealed the details of the secret in a series of what he called "Eddie's Bedtime Stories".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/07282005/|title=JBL going to SummerSlam|publisher=WWE|accessdate= 2008-02-17}}</ref> During that time he now had a dark comical gimmick. He claimed that he had a child out of wedlock (Dominick) while his marriage was going through hard times. He claimed he then allowed Mysterio and his wife, who were "having trouble conceiving", to adopt the child as their own.<ref name="smackdown05"/> At [[SummerSlam (2005)|SummerSlam]], Guerrero lost a ladder match over Dominick's custody to Mysterio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/2005/results/|title=SummerSlam 2005 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate= 2008-02-17}}</ref> Their feud ended when Guerrero gained a victory over Mysterio in a steel cage match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/09092005/|title=Changing Friday Nights|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref>

Following his feud with [[Rey Mysterio Jr.|Rey Mysterio]], Guerrero was named number one contender to the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] and given a title match with [[Dave Batista|Batista]]. Despite this, Guerrero quickly proclaimed himself to be Batista's friend. Batista was well aware of Guerrero's sneaky reputation, and despite eventually accepting his friendship (initially to keep an eye on him), Batista would continually play mind games with Guerrero to expose his true intentions. A series of matches with MNM only supported Batista's suspicions that Guerrero was up to no good, as Guerrero appeared to have reverted to his cheating ways.<ref name="smackdown05"/> In response to Batista's suspicions, Guerrero helped Batista win a match against his tag team partners, [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield]] and [[Christian Cage|Christian]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/10072005/|title=Friend or foe?|publisher=WWE| accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> Batista defeated Guerrero at [[No Mercy (2005)|No Mercy]] to retain the World Heavyweight Championship in what would be Guerrero's last pay-per-view match. During the match, Guerrero struggled with a decision about whether or not to use a steel chair to secure the victory, eventually opting not to use it and losing as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nomercy/history/2005/mainevent/|title=Batista vs. Eddie Guerrero for the World Heavyweight Championship|publisher=|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> Though the two demonstrated mutual respect after the match, Guerrero seemed displeased by the loss. Guerrero told Batista that he realized how low he had sunk since losing the WWE Championship in 2004, having attacked his best friend Rey Mysterio. Guerrero told Batista that shaking his hand at No Mercy had returned his respect to him. After the match, Batista called Guerrero back out and sang "Happy Birthday" and, along with the crowd, celebrated Guerrero's 38th birthday.  He would make his entrance, once again using his signature low rider, old theme (Although his titantron still showed him attacking Rey Mysterio) turning face once again. He wrestled his last match, airing November 11, defeating [[Mr. Kennedy]] using his signature lie, cheat, and steal tactics, which allowed him to advance to the [[Survivor Series 2005|Survivor Series]] team.  On the date of his death, a triple threat match between himself, Batista, and [[Randy Orton]] was supposed to take place to air on the next episode of Smackdown for the World Heavyweight Championship.  Some reports say Guerrero had been scripted to win the title so Batista could take time off to heal from an injured back.

==Other media==
On March 13, 2004, Guerrero ([[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]]), along with [[Big Show]], [[Trish Stratus]] and [[Chris Jericho]], made a guest appearance on ''[[MADtv]]'' as he and the other wrestlers "beat up" [[Frank Caliendo]] (portraying [[Jay Leno]]) while [[Aries Spears]] (portraying [[The Tonight Show Band|''The Tonight Show'' Band]] leader [[Kevin Eubanks]]) watched on. There have also been several DVDs and books released about his life and career, including ''Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story'' (DVD, 2004), ''Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story'' (book, 2005), and ''Viva La Raza: The Legacy of Eddie Guerrero'' (DVD 2008). In addition, the song "We Lie, We Cheat, We Steal" that he performed with Chavo was released on the ''[[WWE Originals]]'' CD.

Guerrero's catch phrase during the later part of his career with WWE was "Viva La Raza" (which is Spanish for "Long Live the Race"). In the mid parts of his career, Guerrero took the title of "Latino Heat", which was also his theme song in the early 2000s.

[[File:ToukonRetsuden3blackTigerEddieGuerrero.jpg|thumb|Guerrero, as Black Tiger, in ''Toukon Retsuden 3''.]]

==Personal life==
Guerrero is survived by his widow [[Vickie Guerrero]]. The two married on April 24, 1990<ref>[http://searches1.rootsweb.com/usgenweb/archives/tx/elpaso/vitals/marriages/1990/elpam90c.txt VITAL RECORDS - EL PASO COUNTY, TX - MARRIAGE 1990 - Eduardo G.

''Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story'', p. 67.</ref> and Sherilyn Amber Guerrero (born July 8, 1995). Guerrero also has another daughter, Kaylie Marie Guerrero (born 2002). During his two year separation from Vickie, Eddie had a relationship with a woman named Tara Mahoney. After the two broke up, he reconciled with Vickie. Eddie & Tara remained close friends until his death in 2005. Guerrero was a [[born again Christian]].

==Death==
On November 13, 2005, Guerrero was found unconscious in his hotel room (The Marriott City Center) in [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, Minnesota]], by his nephew, [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo]]. Chavo attempted [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]], but Guerrero was pronounced dead when paramedics arrived at the scene. He was 38 years old. An [[autopsy]] revealed that Guerrero died as a result of acute [[heart failure]] due to underlying [[Atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] [[cardiovascular disease]]. Guerrero's wife [[Vickie Guerrero]] claimed that he had been unwell in the week preceding his death. On the November 30 episode of ''WWE Byte This!'', Chavo said that Guerrero had been working hard and was at peak [[physical fitness]] as a result, doing [[circulatory system|cardiovascular]] and [[weight training]] exercises every day.

The episodes of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' on November 14, 2005 and ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' on November 18, 2005 each aired as tributes to Guerrero. All storylines were put on hold, and no WWE employees were forced to perform, although several matches took place, including one featuring Chavo, who finished the match with his uncle's frog splash. ''Raw'' started off with all the superstars and several personnel on stage, as [[Vince McMahon]] addressed the live crowd before finishing with a [[ten-bell salute]]. In addition to the ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'' tribute shows, [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] dedicated the [[pay-per-view]] [[TNA Genesis#2005|TNA Genesis]] (which aired the evening of his death) to Guerrero.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tnappv/genesis05.html|title=Genesis 2005 results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-02-17|quote=An "In Memory of Eddie Guerrero" screen was shown at the beginning of the show.}}</ref> while [[Ring of Honor]] named their next show "Night of Tribute."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/roh/051119.html|title=Night of Tribute results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-02-17|quote=Show began with a 10-bell salute to Eddie Guerrero with the ROH roster present.}}</ref> [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW), WWE's former developmental territory, also paid tribute to Guerrero on their television taping following his death. Many of the wrestlers there wore arm bands with "E.G." on them. Eventually, other wrestlers, primarily his nephew Chavo and friends Mysterio and [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]], paid tribute to him in their matches by using the Frog Splash, Guerrero's finisher. [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] also paid tribute to Guerrero with a ten-bell salute during one of their cards. Wrestlers [[CM Punk]] and Rey Mysterio dedicated some of their matches to Guerrero. The [[3 Doors Down]] song "[[Here Without You]]" was used as a tribute song for Guerrero, as was [[Johnny Cash]]'s version of the song "[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]".

===Hall of Fame and legacy===
Guerrero was posthumously inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 1, 2006 by Rey Mysterio, his nephew Chavo Guerrero, and [[Chris Benoit]] in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]] on the night before [[WrestleMania 22]].<ref name="WWESupers">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/eddieguerrero/| title=Eddie Guerrero Hall of Fame profile|accessdate=2011-03-29|work=WWE Hall of Fame|publisher=WWE}}</ref> His widow, Vickie Guerrero, accepted the honor. The next night at Wrestlemania, Rey Mysterio won the World Heavyweight Championship, and dedicated the victory and the title to Guerrero.

There have been several tributes made to honor Guerrero since his induction into the Hall of Fame, including a package that featured not only his time on ''SmackDown!'', but expanded to his life outside the ring; a special titantron feature of WWE Hall of Famers who had competed in the Royal Rumble, which aired before the [[Royal Rumble (2011)|2011 event]], included Guerrero; and a place on the WWE Top 50 Superstars of All Time DVD, as voted by fellow superstars, who placed him 11th.

Guerrero has also been featured in the game ''[[WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006]]'', which was completed during mid-2005 and Guerrero provides his own voice. The game attracted some minor controversy due to an in-game story where Guerrero is placed into a coffin by The Undertaker. The coincidence was more resounding in the United Kingdom, where the game was released during the week of Guerrero's death. He also appeared as a legend in the games [[WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2007]], [[WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2008]] (PSP only), [[WWE '12]], [[WWE '13]] and [[WWE 2K14]] and is included on the WWE Legends roster in the [[THQ]] video game "[[WWE All Stars]]."

Guerrero's family members within the business have also made numerous references to Guerrero, ranging from simple gestures and anecdotes to the adaptation of his signature moves and mannerisms in the ring. When his brother Hector signed with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]], Hector looked up to the sky and mentioned how his father and brother have inspired him and he thanked them. On the October 2, 2009 episode of ''SmackDown!'', a special episode celebrating the show's ten-year anniversary, a video tribute to Guerrero was played on the TitanTron, set to the song "[[Hear Me Now (Boyce Avenue song)|Hear Me Now]]" by [[Boyce Avenue]]. At [[WrestleMania XXVI]], Vickie Guerrero competed in a ten-Diva tag team match, in which her team was victorious after she climbed the turnbuckle, pointed to the sky and performed a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frog splash|frog splash]] to secure the victory. And on the November 15, 2010 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', WWE Legend and Guerrero's older brother [[Chavo Guerrero, Sr.]] (aka Chavo Classic) gestured to the sky and shouted "Eddie!" as he was introduced.

During the [[Royal Rumble (2011)|2011 Royal Rumble]] match itself. Guerrero's nephew [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]] paid tribute to him by the doing one of Guerrero's signature moves "The Three Amigos" (triple vertical suplex), and followed up by pointing to the sky and doing the dance Guerrero used to do. At [[Bound for Glory (2012)|Bound for Glory 2012]], Chavo dedicated his win of the [[TNA World Tag Team Championship]] to Guerrero.

On September 24, 2011 [[CM Punk]] paid tribute to Eddie after RAW in El Paso Texas he then asked the crowd to chant his name and left the ring. CM Punk then used the smoking gun in 2012 in a match against [[Alberto Del Rio]].

In his match with [[CM Punk]] at [[SummerSlam 2013]], fellow [[WWE]] superstar [[Brock Lesnar]] paid tribute to Eddie by doing "The Three Amigos" (triple vertical suplex), followed by the crowd erupting with "Eddie" chants.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lesnar|first=Brock|title=Brock Lesnar - 3 Amigos (Summerslam 2013) followed by 'Eddie' chants|url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHGfs6EkD4A|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=February 19, 2014}}</ref> On an episode of [[WWE Raw]] [[Seth Rollins]] paid tribute Eddie by performing the "Three Amigos" (triple vertical suplex) in a tag match against [[Antonio Cesaro]] and [[Jack Swagger]].

On the June 23, 2014 episode of RAW Vickie Guerrero paid tribute to Eddie by using his theme song "We Lie, We Cheat We Steal" and taunting like him after dumping Stephanie McMahon in the mud. The theme song was used during his time teaming with nephew Chavo Guerrero as Los Guerreros. She can be seen mouthing "I love you" and blowing a kiss to the sky to him.

'''Wallerfangen''' (French: ''Vaudrevange''/''Valdrevange'') is a municipality of [[Saarlouis (district)|Saarlouis district]], [[Saarland]], [[Germany]].  Located west of Saarlouis and along the [[France|French]] border, it is the seat of the villages of Ittersdorf, Ihn, Leidingen, St. Barbara, Kerlingen, Gisingen, Rammelfangen, Oberlimberg, Bedersdorf, and Düren. Formerly called Walderfinga, it was established by the [[Duchy of Lorraine]], and belonged to the Duchy until the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in the late 18th century, at which time it came under French control. Up until 1687, Wallerfangen possessed town privileges. In that year, the fortifications and most of the buildings were destroyed and the inhabitants were moved to the newly found town-fortress of [[Saarlouis]].

In 1815, under the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]], [[Prussia]] assumed control of the area. For all intents and purposes, it remained in the possession of the German Federation of States until 1919. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] created an independent and autonomous territory of [[Saargebiet]], administered by France and the [[League of Nations]] until 1935. Under the terms of Versailles, the citizens of the ''Saargebiet'' voted to become part of Germany, doing so in spite of [[Adolf Hitler]] having assumed power in 1933.

[[World War II]] brought much despair and bloodshed for Wallerfangen and its citizens. Being the western border of the German Reich, the area became battleground in 1944/45, and the area was evacuated ''en masse'' twice. After WWII, Wallerfangen belonged to the newly independent, but French controlled, [[Saarland]].

'''''Bitches Brew''''' is a studio double album by [[jazz]] musician [[Miles Davis]], released in April 1970 on [[Columbia Records]]. The album continued his experimentation with electric instruments previously featured on his critically acclaimed ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' album. With the use of these instruments, such as the [[electric piano]] and [[electric guitar|guitar]], Davis rejected traditional jazz rhythms in favor of a looser, [[Rock music|rock]]-influenced [[Musical improvisation|improvisation]]al style.

''Bitches Brew''  was Davis's first [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]];<ref>[http://www.columbiajazz.com/newsletter2/brew.html Bitches Brew: Miles Davis' Shot Heard 'Round the Jazz World – ColumbiaJazz]. Columbia. Retrieved on 2008-08-30.</ref> it sold more than half a million copies.<ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/16181/davismiles-mileselectricdvd Miles Electric: A Different Kind of Blue (DVD) – PopMatters]. PopMatters. Retrieved on 2008-08-30.</ref> Upon release, it received a mixed response, due to the album's unconventional style and revolutionary sound. Later, ''Bitches Brew'' gained recognition as one of jazz's greatest albums and a progenitor of the [[jazz rock]] genre, as well as a major influence on rock and [[funk]] musicians.<ref name="Jurek"/> The album won a [[Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=miles+davis&field_nominee_work_value=bitches+brew&year=All&genre=All |title=Past Winners Search &#124; GRAMMY.com |first= |last=|work=grammy.com |accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref> In 1998, [[Columbia Records]] released  ''[[The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions]]'', a four-disc [[box set]] that included the original album as well as the studio sessions through February 1970.

==Recording sessions==
Recording sessions took place at Columbia's 30th Street Studio over the course of three days in August 1969. Davis called the musicians to the recording studio on very short notice. A few pieces on ''Bitches Brew'' were rehearsed before the recording sessions, but at other times the musicians had little or no idea what they were to record. Once in the recording studio, the players were typically given only a few instructions: a [[tempo]] count, a few [[Chord (music)|chord]]s or a hint of [[melody]], and suggestions as to mood or tone. Davis liked to work this way; he thought it forced musicians to pay close attention to one another, to their own performances, or to Davis's cues, which could change at any moment. On the quieter moments of "Bitches Brew", for example, Davis's voice is audible, giving instructions to the musicians: snapping his fingers to indicate tempo, or, in his distinctive whisper, saying, "Keep it tight" or telling individuals when to solo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jazztimes.com/articles/20243-miles-davis-and-the-making-of-bitches-brew-sorcerer-s-brew|title=Miles Davis and the Making of Bitches Brew: Sorcerer's Brew|publisher=Jazz Times|last1=Tingen|first1=Paul|date=May 2001|accessdate=11 Nov 2014}}</ref>

Davis composed most of the music on the album.  The two important exceptions were the complex "Pharaoh's Dance" (composed by [[Joe Zawinul]]) and the ballad "Sanctuary" (composed by [[Wayne Shorter]]).  The latter had been recorded as a fairly straightforward ballad early in 1968, but was given a radically different interpretation on ''Bitches Brew''.  It begins with Davis and [[Chick Corea]] improvising on the standard "[[I Fall in Love Too Easily]]" before Davis plays the "Sanctuary" theme.  Then, not unlike Davis's recording of Shorter's "Nefertiti" two years earlier, the horns repeat  the melody over and over while the rhythm section builds up the intensity.  The issued "Sanctuary" is actually two consecutive takes of the piece.{{cn|date=April 2012}}

[[Image:BitchesBrewGatefold.jpg|thumb|right|375px|[[Mati Klarwein]] created this artwork for ''Bitches Brew'''s [[gatefold]] cover.]]

Despite his reputation as a "cool", melodic improviser, much of Davis's playing on this album is aggressive and explosive, often playing fast runs and venturing into the upper [[Register (music)|register]] of the trumpet. His closing solo on "Miles Runs the Voodoo Down" is particularly noteworthy in this regard. Davis did not perform on the short piece "John McLaughlin".{{cn|date=April 2012}}

==Post-production==
There was significant editing done to the recorded music. Short sections were spliced together to create longer pieces, and various effects were applied to the recordings. [[Paul Tingen]] reports:

<blockquote>''Bitches Brew'' also pioneered the application of the studio as a musical instrument, featuring stacks of edits and studio effects that were an integral part of the music. Miles and his producer, Teo Macero, used the recording studio in radical new ways, especially in the title track and the opening track, "Pharaoh's Dance". There were many special effects, like tape loops, tape delays, reverb chambers and echo effects. Through intensive tape editing, Macero concocted many totally new musical structures that were later imitated by the band in live concerts. Macero, who has a classical education and was most likely inspired by '50s et '60s french [[musique concrète]] experiments, used tape editing as a form of arranging and composition.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Pharaoh's Dance" contains 19 edits&nbsp;– its famous stop-start opening is entirely constructed in the studio, using repeat loops of certain sections. Later on in the track there are several micro-edits: for example, a one-second-long fragment that first appears at 8:39 is repeated five times between 8:54 and 8:59. The title track contains 15 edits, again with several short tape loops of, in this case, five seconds (at 3:01, 3:07 and 3:12). Therefore, ''Bitches Brew'' not only became a controversial classic of musical innovation, it also became renowned for its pioneering use of studio technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miles-beyond.com/bitchesbrew.htm|title=The Making of Bitches Brew}} by [[Paul Tingen]] and Enrico Merlin.

Though ''Bitches Brew'' was in many ways revolutionary, perhaps its most important innovation was [[rhythm]]ic. The [[rhythm section]] for this recording consists of two bassists (one playing [[bass guitar]], the other [[double bass]]), two to three [[drummer]]s, two to three [[electric piano]] players, and a [[Percussion instrument|percussionist]], all playing at the same time.<ref name=tanner>{{cite book|last=Tanner|first=Paul O.

Brown, College Division|location=Dubuque, IA|isbn=0-697-03663-4|pages=135–136|chapter=Crossover&nbsp;— Fusion}}</ref> As [[Paul Tanner]], Maurice Gerow, and David Megill explain, "like rock groups, Davis gives the rhythm section a central role in the ensemble's activities. His use of such a large rhythm section offers the soloists wide but active expanses for their solos."<ref name=tanner />

Tanner, Gerow and Megill further explain that <blockquote>"the harmonies used in this recording move very slowly and function modally rather than in a more tonal fashion typical of mainstream jazz.... The static harmonies and rhythm section's collective embellishment create a very open arena for improvisation.  The musical result flows from basic rock patterns to hard bop textures, and at times, even passages  that are more characteristic of free jazz."<ref name=tanner /></blockquote> The solo voices heard most prominently on this album are the trumpet and the [[soprano saxophone]], respectively of Miles and [[Wayne Shorter]]. Notable also is [[Bennie Maupin]]'s ghostly [[bass clarinet]], which was perhaps the first use of the instrument in jazz not heavily indebted to pioneer [[Eric Dolphy]].

The technology of recording, analog tape, disc mastering and inherent recording time constraints had, by the late sixties, expanded beyond previous limitations and sonic range for the stereo, vinyl album and ''Bitches Brew'' reflects this. In it are found long-form performances which encompass entire improvised suites with [[rubato]] sections, [[tempo]] changes or the long, slow crescendo more common to a symphonic orchestral piece or [[India]]n [[raga]] form than the three-minute rock song. Starting in 1969, Davis' concerts included some of the material that would become ''Bitches Brew''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plosin.com/milesAhead/Sessions.aspx?s=691026|title=Session Details|accessdate=2007-08-04|last=Losin|first=Peter|work=Miles Ahead|quote=October 26, 1969...

''Bitches Brew'' was a turning point in modern jazz. Davis had already spearheaded two major jazz movements&nbsp;– [[cool jazz|cool]] and [[modal jazz]]&nbsp;– and was about to initiate another major change (like Davis' album ''[[Filles de Kilimanjaro]]'', the album's cover also sports the phrase "Directions In Music By Miles Davis" above the title). Some critics at the time characterized this music as simply obscure and "outside", which recalls [[Duke Ellington]]'s description of Davis as "the [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] of jazz." Some jazz enthusiasts and musicians felt the album was crossing the limits, or was not jazz at all. One critic writes that "Davis drew a line in the sand that some jazz fans have never crossed, or even forgiven Davis for drawing."<ref name=meyer>{{cite web|url=http://www.inkblotmagazine.com/rev-archive/Miles_Davis_Bitches_Complete.htm|title=Miles Davis: ''The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions'' (August 1969 – February 1970)|accessdate=2007-08-04|last=Meyer|first=Bill|work=Ink Blot Magazine |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070630164719/http://www.inkblotmagazine.com/rev-archive/Miles_Davis_Bitches_Complete.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-30}}</ref> [[Bob Rusch]] recalls, "this to me was not ''great Black music''<!-- Rusch's emphasis -->, but I cynically saw it as part and parcel of the commercial crap that was beginning to choke and bastardize the catalogs of such dependable companies as [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]] and [[Prestige Records|Prestige]]....

On the other hand, many fans, critics, and musicians view the records as an important and vital release. In a 1997 interview, [[drummer]] [[Bobby Previte]] sums up his feelings about ''Bitches Brew'': "Well, it was groundbreaking, for one.  How much groundbreaking music do you hear now?  It was music that you had that feeling you never heard quite before.  It came from another place.  How much music do you hear now like that?"<ref name=snyder>{{cite web|url=http://users.bestweb.net/~msnyder/writings/previte.htm|title=An Interview with Bobby Previte|accessdate=2007-08-04|last=Snyder|first=Matt|date=December 1997|work=5/4 Magazine|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060112205326/http://users.bestweb.net/~msnyder/writings/previte.htm|archivedate=2006-01-12}}</ref> 

''[[The Penguin Guide to Jazz]]'' gave ''Bitches Brew'' a four-star rating (out of four stars), describing the recording as "one of the most remarkable creative statements of the last half-century, in any artistic form.

[[Thom Yorke]], lead singer of English band [[Radiohead]], noted the album as an influence on their 1997 album ''[[OK Computer]]'': "It was building something up and watching it fall apart, that's the beauty of it.

'''Francis Cabot Lowell''' (April 7, 1775<ref name=FrancisCabotLowellDates/> – August 10, 1817) was an [[United States|American]] [[businessman]] for whom the [[city]] of [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], is named. He was instrumental in bringing the [[Industrial Revolution]] to the [[United States]].

==Early life==
Lowell
was born in the city of [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]].<ref name=FrancisCabotLowellDates/> His father was [[John Lowell|John Lowell II]], member of the [[Continental Congress]] and judge for the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]]. His mother was Susanna [[Cabot family|Cabot]].<ref name=FrancisCabotLowellDates/>

In 1786, Lowell graduated from [[Phillips Academy]].<ref name=FrancisCabotLowellAndover>{{cite web|url=http://www.andover.edu/About/NotableAlumni/LongList/Pages/1700s.aspx|title=Notable Alumni Long List: 1700s|publisher=[[Phillips Academy]]|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref> In 1793, he graduated from [[Harvard College]].

==Career==
[[File:BMC Mill Waltham.jpg|thumb|Boston Manufacturing Company, Waltham, Massachusetts]]
After graduation, Lowell set out on a merchant ship carrying cargo to the port of [[Bordeaux, France]]. Despite the anxieties of his family, he spent a year touring France, gripped in its bloody revolution. In July 1796, he returned to Boston and with his father's financial support, set up as a merchant on Long Wharf.

From 1798 to 1808 Lowell was engaged in overseas trade, especially importing silks and tea from China and hand-spun and hand-woven cotton textiles from India.  Starting in 1802, with Uriah Cotting, [[Harrison Gray Otis (politician)|Harrison Gray Otis]] and others, Francis Cabot Lowell developed India Wharf and its warehouses on Boston harbor, which became the center of the trade with the Orient.  Later, the same group of investors developed the Broad Street area for the retail trade.  To  enlarge his fortune, Lowell bought a rum distillery, importing [[molasses]] from the Caribbean sugar-producing islands.  Lowell spent  months improving on the machinery of his rum distilling process. He also acquired many properties in and around Boston, which he rented out or resold at a profit.

Despite political independence, the United States remained dependent on imports for manufactured goods. The conflicts between the European Powers and the Embargo of 1807 severely disrupted trade between the United States, Great Britain, France and the Orient.  Lowell reached the conclusion that to be truly independent, the United States needed to manufacture goods at home. In June 1810, he went on a two-year visit with his family to [[Scotland]] and [[England]]. The trip was not due to a decline in health as many have falsely claimed, but a result of a love for travel, trying to expose his four children to Europe, and a desire to copy a trip his brother John Jr. went on in 1803 to 1805. After visiting them, Lowell developed an interest in the textile industries of Lancashire and Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving machines, which were operated by water power or steam power. He found that he was not able to buy drawings or a model of a power loom and secretly began studying the machines. As the War of 1812 begun, Lowell and his family left Europe and on their way home, the boat and all their personal belongings were searched at the Halifax port to ensure that no manufacturing plans were being smuggled out of Great Britain. This proved ineffective as Lowell had memorized all the workings of British power looms without writing anything down.<ref>Rosenberg, p. 214.</ref>

===Textiles===
In 1814, he enlisted the support of his brothers-in-law, Charles, James and [[Patrick Tracy Jackson]], and obtained the financial backing of the merchant [[Nathan Appleton]] to establish the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]]<ref name=FrancisCabotLowellPBS>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica/whomade/lowell_hi.html|title=Who Made America? Pioneers: Francis Cabot Lowell|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref> at [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], using the power of the [[Charles River]]. The BMC was the first "integrated" textile mill in America in which all operations for converting raw [[cotton]] into finished [[cloth]] could be performed in one mill building.  Lowell hired the gifted machinist [[Paul Moody (inventor)|Paul Moody]] to assist him in designing  efficient cotton spinning and weaving machines, based on the British models, but with many technological improvements suited to the conditions of [[New England]].

To raise capital for their mills, Lowell and partners Aidan and Merquack pioneered a basic tool of modern corporate finance by selling $1000 shares of stock to a select group of wealthy investors, such as Senators James Lloyd Jr. and [[Christopher Gore]], [[Israel Thorndike|Israel Thorndike Sr.]] and [[Harrison Gray Otis (politician)|Harrison Gray Otis]]. This form of shareholder corporation quickly became the method of choice for structuring new American [[businesses]], and endures to this day in the well-known form of public stock offerings.

In 1814, the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]] built its first mill beside the [[Charles River]] in Waltham, housing an integrated set of technologies that converted raw cotton all the way to finished cloth. [[Patrick Tracy Jackson]] was the first manager of the BMC with Paul Moody in charge of the machinery. The Waltham mill, where raw cotton was processed into finished cloth, was the forerunner of the 19th century American factory. Lowell also pioneered the employment of women, from the age of 15-35 from [[New England]] farming families, as textile workers, in what became known as the [[Lowell system]]. He paid these "mill girls" (also known as Lowell girls) lower wages than men, but offered attractive benefits including well-run company boardinghouses with chaperones, cash wages, and benevolent religious and educational activities.  The Waltham Machine Shop attached to the BMC made power looms for sale to other American cotton mills   Nathan Appleton established a region-wide system to sell the cloth manufactured by the BMC.

The end of the [[War of 1812]] was a severe threat to the budding domestic textile industry as the British dumped cheap cotton cloth on the American market. In 1816, Francis Cabot Lowell traveled to Washington to lobby  for  protective tariffs on cotton products that they were included in the Tariff of 1815.

Although he died early at age 42, only three years after building his first mill, Lowell left the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]] in superb financial health. In 1821, dividends were paid out at an astounding 27.5% to shareholders.   The success of the BMC at Waltham exhausted the water power of the [[Charles River]].  To expand the enterprise, in 1822, Lowell's partners moved north to the more powerful [[Merrimack River]] and named their new mill town at the [[Pawtucket Falls (Massachusetts)|Pawtucket Falls]] on the [[Merrimack River]] "Lowell," after their visionary leader.  Many textiles mills were built in [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]], using the power of the fast-flowing [[Merrimack River]].  The Lowell Machine Shop built power looms for sale, and later expanded to build locomotives.   With the introduction of steam power, the importance of a river site for the mills began to decline. The Lowell System, first introduced at Waltham, was expanded to the new industrial city of Lowell and soon spread to the Midwest and the South.  The mechanized textile system, introduced by Francis Cabot Lowell, remained dominant in [[New England]] for a century until the industry shifted to the Midwest and the South.  By the close of the nineteenth-century the United States had a thriving textile industry for home consumption and for export.

==Personal life==
In 1798, Lowell married Hannah Jackson, daughter of Jonathan Jackson and Hannah Tracy. They had four children: [[John Lowell, Jr. (philanthropist)|John Lowell Jr.]], benefactor of [[Lowell Institute]]; businessman Francis Cabot Lowell, Jr.; Edward Lowell, a lawyer; and Susanna Lowell, who married her first cousin John Amory Lowell.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

'''Thomas Docwra''' (1458? &ndash; 1527) was Grand Prior of the [[England|English]] [[Knights Hospitaller]].

Thomas Docwra, the son of Richard Docwra and Alice Greene, the daughter of Thomas Greene of [[Gressingham]], [[Lancashire]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Transactions|1905|p=324}}; {{Harvnb|Chibi|2004}}.</ref> was admitted to the [[Knights Hospitaller]] at the age of 16, spending about four years as a novitiate. In 1480 he was in [[Rhodes]] with Sir Thomas Greene during the unsuccessful [[Turkey|Turkish]] siege of the island. He later became [[preceptor]] of the Order's holdings in [[Dinmore Manor|Dinmore]], [[Herefordshire]]. In 1494 Sir Thomas became Prior of [[Ireland]] and then a year later [[Turcopolier]] of the  English tongue. By 1499 he became captain of the [[Bodrum castle|castle of St. Peter]] in [[Bodrum]]. In 1501 he succeeded Sir [[John Kendal]] as Grand Prior in England, taking responsibility for all their property in England. He reversed the policy of leasing out property to secular tenants, most noticeably with [[Temple Balsall]] in [[Warwickshire]]. He terminated the lease of Sir [[Robert Throckmorton]] and attempted to gain the arrears of rent. When Sir Lancelot Docwra arrived to reclaim the property, Throckmorton had fortified the manor house and refused to allow the Hospitallers entry.

Nevertheless Thomas let out [[Temple Dinsley]] in [[Hertfordshire]] to his nephew John Docwra in 1519. Another transaction was the leasing of land in [[Hampton, London|Hampton]], [[Middlesex]] to [[Thomas Wolsey]], the [[Archbishop of York]]. This is where Wolsey built [[Hampton Court]] of which [[Henry VIII of England]] took possession when Wolsey fell from favour. Overall the Order had over 40 preceptories spread out from [[Cornwall]] to [[Northumberland]], the majority of which retained their concentual status. Docwra would have had to visit them all once a year.

As the Lord of St John, Docwra was a senior lay baron with a seat in the [[House of Lords]]. He was one of the peers who tried the [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] for treason in 1521. He was a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and Admiral of the English Fleet, which may have been an honorary title.

As Grand Prior of St John he served on a number of commissions: he was involved with drainage in [[Lincolnshire]], where the order had substantial holdings and was brought in on a commission to investigate irregularities by the Masters of the Mint. he was also connected with the "search for suspicious characters in London" in 1520. But perhaps it was his diplomatic activities on behalf of [[Henry VII, of England|Henry VII]] and Henry VIII for which he is most remembered. He engaged in marriage negotiations as well as financial and commercial matters. When in 1510 the Grand Master of the Order in Rhodes requested that he come and help defend the order against the Turks, the King refused to allow him leave to go. But in 1512 he was expected to turn up with 300 men at arms and a 200 ton ship when the King had a military adventure to pursue in [[France]]. In 1520 he accompanied the King to France to the "[[Field of the Cloth of Gold]]".

Docwra died in May, 1527 at [[Clerkenwell]] and was buried in the [[Clerkenwell Priory|priory church]]. His estate passed to his nephew, another Thomas Docwra, who was High Sheriff of Hertfordshire.

He was succeeded as Grand Prior by Sir William Weston, the last Grand Prior of the Knights Hospitaller in England before the dissolution.

The '''Football Conference''' is a [[association football|football]] league in [[Football in England|England]] consisting of three divisions, the [[Conference Premier]], [[Conference North]] and [[Conference South]]. Around half the [[Conference Premier]] clubs are fully professional, whilst most [[Conference North]] and [[Conference South]] clubs are [[semi-professional]]. The professional clubs are usually clubs who have been in the Football League in the past as opposed to those who have always been in '[[Non-League]]'. The Conference Premier is the lowest of the five nationwide football divisions in England, below the [[Premier League]] and the three divisions of [[the Football League]], and is the top tier of the [[National League System]] of [[non-League football]]. The Conference North and Conference South form the sixth tier of English football. The Football Conference consisted of only one division up until 2004, but expanded as part of an extensive restructuring of the National League System which took effect beginning with the 2004–05 season.

As part of a sponsorship deal with [[Vanarama]], the Conference Premier is now known as the Vanarama Conference, and the tiers below as the Vanarama Conference South and the Vanarama Conference North until the end of the 2016–17 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonleaguebets.co.uk/conference-announces-vanarama-new-league-sponsor/|title=Vanarama announced as new Football Conference sponsor|publisher=Non-League Bets|date=30 July 2014}}</ref>

==Organisation==
The Football Conference stands at the top of the [[National League System]] (NLS), a comprehensive structure linking together over 50 different leagues under the auspices of [[The Football Association]] (FA). Conference Premier is at ''Step 1'' of the NLS, and Conference North and Conference South make up ''Step 2''. Above the Conference are the 92 [[List of football clubs in England|clubs]] which together make up the highest levels of English football, the [[Premier League]] and [[The Football League]]; below the Conference are the ''Step 3'' and lower leagues of the NLS.

The Conference Premier has 24 clubs and the North and South divisions have 22 clubs each. Each club plays the others in its division twice during a season, once at home and once away. Clubs earn three points for a win, one for a draw, and none for a defeat.

At the end of each season two clubs are promoted from Conference Premier to [[Football League Two]] and two teams from League Two are relegated to Conference Premier to take their place. The two promotion places are awarded to the Conference Premier champions and to the winners of a playoff between those clubs finishing second to fifth in the standings.

At the other end of the table, the bottom four clubs in Conference Premier are relegated to either Conference North or Conference South. The decision as to which division the relegated club joins is made by the FA's NLS Committee, but is largely determined by geography. The four relegated teams are replaced by four promoted teams, two from Conference North and two from Conference South. For each of these two leagues this will be the champions and the winners of playoffs between the second to fifth place clubs.

At the bottom of Conference North and Conference South, three clubs from each division are relegated and these six clubs are divided among the ''Step 3'' leagues of the NLS, the [[Northern Premier League]], the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], and the [[Isthmian League]]. Each of these ''Step 3'' leagues promotes their respective champions and second to fifth place playoff winners. The NLS Committee determines which ''Step 3'' leagues the relegated clubs will join, and whether the promoted clubs will join Conference North or Conference South.

Clubs are not always relegated from the national division in a geographically balanced manner. Thus, should it be deemed necessary the NLS Committee will order one or more [[The Midlands, England|Midlands]] or [[East Anglia]]n-based clubs in the sixth tier to switch divisions (to move "horizontally" through the leagues so to speak) so as to maintain numerical balance between North and South. The most recent example of this sort of movement came in [[2008–09 Football Conference|2008]] when the clubs relegated from the National division were all based in northerly locales and the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] was won by one of its northernmost clubs, compelling [[Worcester City F.C.|Worcester City]] to play the following season in the South to make way for them. [[Redditch United F.C.|Redditch United]] was also to be transferred to the South but this move was cancelled due to the expulsion of [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] and [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]]. Conversely Bishop's Stortford spent the 2011/12 and 2013/14 seasons in the North despite being around 25 miles from London.

Due to financial constraints at this level of football, some clubs have escaped relegation despite finishing in a relegation position, due to the misfortune of others. For promotion to proceed, whether from The Football Conference to The Football League, within the Conference, or between the various leagues of the NLS, certain conditions concerning finances and facilities must be met. Failure to meet the requirements of the league concerned will prevent the eligible club from being promoted.

==History==
The Football Conference was formed in 1979 from leading teams in the Northern Premier League and Southern League and was originally known as the ''Alliance Premier Football League''. The founding members were:

{| style="width:100%;"
|
* [[Leamington F.C.|AP Leamington]]
* [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]]
* [[Bangor City F.C.|Bangor City]]
* [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]]
* [[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]]
* [[Bath City F.C.|Bath City]]
* [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]]
|
* [[Ebbsfleet United F.C.|Gravesend & Northfleet]]
* [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]]
* [[Maidstone United F.C. (1897)|Maidstone United]]
* [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]]
* [[Nuneaton Borough A.F.C.|Nuneaton Borough]]
* [[Redditch United F.C.|Redditch United]]
* [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]]
|
* [[Stafford Rangers F.C.|Stafford Rangers]]
* [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]]
* [[Wealdstone F.C.|Wealdstone]]
* [[Weymouth F.C.|Weymouth]]
* [[Worcester City F.C.|Worcester City]]
* [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]]
|}

Barrow and Northwich had previously been members of [[The Football League]]. Barrow failed re-election in [[1971–72 in English football|1972]], while Northwich resigned from the league in [[1893–94 in English football|1894]]. Yeovil are currently members of the Football League, while Scarborough, Maidstone (both now in new incarnations), Boston and Barnet have also tasted league football since the formation of the Football Conference, but are now back in non-league football.

Of the 20 founding members, the last to leave the fifth level were Northwich.  They were relegated in 2005, a year after the demise of Telford. Barnet are the only founding member who have remained in the top five levels continuously since 1979.

Bangor City has since moved to the [[Welsh football league system]], while AP Leamington, Maidstone, Nuneaton, Scarborough and Telford later collapsed and were reconstituted in lower English leagues. Gravesend & Northfleet changed its name to [[Ebbsfleet United F.C.|Ebbsfleet United]] in 2007.

Since 1984, the Conference has been publicly known by the names of a succession of official title sponsors. The name was officially changed from Alliance Premier to the ''Football Conference'' in 1986. Below is a list of sponsors and what they chose to call the league:
*1984–1986: [[Gola (manufacturer)|Gola]] (Gola League)
*1986–1998: [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] (GM [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] Conference)
*1998–2007: [[Nationwide Building Society]] (Nationwide Conference, and from 2004 additionally Nationwide Conference North / Nationwide Conference South)
*2007–2010: [[The Rank Group#Gaming|Blue Square]] (Blue Square Premier / Blue Square North / Blue Square South)
*2010–2013: [[The Rank Group#Gaming|Blue Square Bet]] (Blue Square Bet Premier / Blue Square Bet North / Blue Square Bet South) known by fans as the Blue Square Group
*2013–2014: [[Skrill]] (Skrill Premier/ Skrill North/ Skrill South)
*2014-: [[Vanarama]] (Vanarama Conference/ Vanarama Conference North/ Vanarama Conference South)

The Football Conference had a single division for the first 25 years of its existence, but since the 2004–05 season has consisted of three divisions. The original division was renamed ''Conference National'' (currently ''Conference Premier'') and two new regional divisions one level down were introduced, ''Conference North'' and ''Conference South''. The new clubs were drawn from the Northern Premier League, Southern League, and Isthmian League according to guidelines developed by the NLS Committee.

Only seven teams have had the honour of winning the Conference on two occasions; [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]] (1980, 1981), [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] (1991, 2005), [[Enfield F.C.|Enfield]] (1983, 1986), [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] (1994, 2000), [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] (1995, 1997), [[Maidstone United F.C.|Maidstone United]], (1984, 1989) and [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage Borough]] (1996, 2010). Kidderminster also finished second in 1997 and 2013. Of those sides only one, Barnet, was promoted to the Football League on both occasions; Maidstone's first title came before the era of automatic promotion, while Kidderminster Harriers, Macclesfield Town and Stevenage Borough were denied promotion because their grounds were not up to the required standard at the time of their first win. However, all three were promoted when they took their second title. Altrincham are the only team in history to retain the title, as at the time there was no automatic promotion to the Football League.

No former Conference club has yet reached the [[Premier League]], although four clubs did compete in its predecessor, the [[Football League First Division]]: [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]], [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]]. Luton, Carlisle and Oxford have since returned to the League, albeit by winning the promotion playoffs. Additionally, Luton and Oxford are the only clubs to play league matches against each other on all top five tiers of English football. Luton returned to the Football League in 2014 after a five-year exile by winning the Conference National title, having been defeated in the playoffs in their first three seasons at this level.

===Promotion and relegation===
Prior to 1987, in order for Conference clubs to enter [[The Football League]], they had to be elected by League members. As a consequence, there was no guarantee that winning the Football Conference would result in promotion, and none of the league's first eight champions were promoted. This changed in 1987, when automatic promotion and relegation between the [[Football League Fourth Division]] and the Conference was agreed. The first clubs to be affected by the new system were [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], who were relegated and replaced by [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]]. However, although the champions of the Conference were entitled to a place in the Football League, this was dependent on their stadium meeting the set criteria for membership. This meant that [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]], [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] and [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] all avoided relegation from the Football League, although Exeter and Torquay were both relegated to the Conference at a later date.

For three successive years in the mid-1990s, the Conference champions had been denied promotion to the Football League on these grounds. Since 1997, when [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] won the title for the second time in three years, every champion has been promoted.

Since 2003, the Conference has been awarded a second promotion place, which has been decided by a play-off system similar to that of the Football League. The four teams below the Conference champions play against each other over two legs, with second playing fifth and third playing fourth. The winners of these ties then play a single final game, with the winner gaining the second promotion place. [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] were the first team to win the Conference play-offs.

Prior to 2004, relegation from the Conference meant dropping to one of the three feeder leagues below. After [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] failed to avoid expulsion in 2010, 3 teams were relegated instead of 4, to either the [[Northern Premier League]], [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] or [[Isthmian League]], based on geographical criteria. In turn, the champions of these three leagues would be promoted to the Conference. The closure of Chester City during the later stages of the 2009-10 season was the first mid-season closure of a club in the division since [[Newport County F.C.|Newport County]] in the second half of the 1988-89 season; on both occasions, the records of both clubs were expunged.

In 2004, a restructuring of the National Football Pyramid saw the creation of a new level immediately below the Football Conference; two regional divisions named Conference North and Conference South were created, with the feeder leagues dropping below them. There are two promotion places to the Conference Premier from each regional division&nbsp;– the champions are promoted automatically, while the remaining place is again decided by play-offs. The four teams relegated from the Conference Premier are then allocated to one or other of the regional divisions dependent on their geographical location.

==Conference League Cup==
{{main|Conference League Cup}}
The Conference has organised a cup competition for its teams throughout its history, with occasional breaks when sponsors were not available. Known initially as the Bob Lord Trophy and then the Spalding Cup from 1995–96 until 2000–01, the League cup competition was reinstated in 2007–08 as the Conference League Cup, sponsored by [[Setanta Sports]]. Very much like the [[Football League Cup]] and [[Football League Trophy]] at the professional levels, it has not always proved popular with fans and is generally viewed as of secondary importance to the [[FA Trophy]]. It has not been held since 2009.

==Media coverage==
The Football Conference was available on [[Setanta Sports]]. The channel showed 79 matches each season. It also showed the [[Conference League Cup]]. The FA Trophy Final was also shown on Setanta Sports (after being shown on Sky Sports until 2008).

On 19 August 2010, [[Premier Sports]] announced that it had bought the live and exclusive UK television rights to thirty matches per season from the Conference Premier for a total of three seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcasting.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=7505416|title=Premeir Sports Secure Conference TV Rights|publisher=Vital Football|date=19 August 2010}}</ref> The thirty matches selected for broadcast will include all five Conference Premier play-offs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesqfootball.com/story/0,20970,13040_6325011,00.html|title=Football Conference Signs Unique TV Deal|publisher=Blue Square Bet Premier|date=20 August 2010}}</ref> The deal with the Football Conference is a revenue sharing arrangement whereby clubs receive 50% of revenue from subscriptions, on top of the normal rights fee paid by the broadcaster, once the costs of production have been met. The Conference will also earn 50% from all internet revenue associated with the deal and allow them to retain advertising rights allied to those adverts shown with their matches. During the 2010–11 season, Premier Sports failed to attract enough viewers to its Conference football broadcasts to share any revenue with the clubs beyond the £5,000 broadcast fee paid to home clubs and £1,000 to away clubs. [[BT Sport]] will cover the Football Conference from the 2013–14 season onwards in a deal worth £300,000.<ref name="BT Sport">{{cite web|url=http://www.cable.co.uk/news/bt-sport-signs-300k-football-conference-broadcasting-deal-801589412/ |title=BT Sport 'signs £300k Football Conference broadcasting deal' |publisher=Cable.co.uk |date=2013-05-23 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref>

[[File:Hitchin Church back.JPG|thumb|Hitchin Parish Church]]
'''Hitchin''' is a [[market town]] in [[North Hertfordshire]] [[Districts of England|District]] in [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]], with an estimated population as at 2011 of 33,350.<ref name="census 2011" />

==History==
Hitchin is first noted as the central place of the Hicce people mentioned in a 7th-century document,<ref name="ReferenceA">Gover, J E B, Mawer, A & Stenton, F M 1938 ''The Place-Names of Hertfordshire'' English Place-Names Society volume XV, 8</ref> the [[Tribal Hidage]]. The tribal name is [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] rather than [[Old English]] and derives from *''sicc?'', meaning 'dry', which is perhaps a reference to the local stream, the Hiz. It has been suggested that Hitchin was the location of ''[[Clofeshoh]]'', the place chosen in 673 by  [[Theodore of Tarsus]] the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] during the [[Synod of Hertford]], the first meeting of representatives of the fledgling [[Christian]] churches of [[Anglo-Saxon England]], to hold annual synods of the churches as Theodore attempted to consolidate and centralise Christianity in England.<ref>Hindley, ''The Anglo-Saxons - The beginnings of the English nation'', 47.</ref> By 1086 Hitchin is described as a [[Royal Manor]] in the [[Domesday Book]]: the feudal services of [[Avera and Inward]], usually found in the eastern counties, especially [[Cambridgeshire]] and [[Hertfordshire]],<ref name=ellis>{{cite book | title=A general introduction to Domesday Book: accompanied by indexes of the tenants in chief, and under tenants, at the time of the survey, as wall as of the holders of lands ...  Volume 1 | author=Sir Henry Ellis | authorlink=Henry Ellis (librarian) | year=1833 | page=263 | publisher=Commission on the Public Records }}</ref> were due from the [[sokemen]],<ref name=vch>{{cite book | chapter=Hitchin: Introduction and manors | title=A History of the County of Hertford | volume=3 | year=1912 | pages=3–12 | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43569 | accessdate=15 September 2010 }}</ref>  but the manor of Hitchin was unique in levying Inward.<ref name=vch/> Evidence has been found to suggest that the town was once provided with an earthen bank and ditch fortification,<ref>Saunders, G & Winter, M 2009 ''Brooker's Yard, Hitchin, Hertfordshire: Archaeological Assessment Report'' The Heritage Network (report 560), 7</ref> probably in the early tenth century<ref>Fitzpatrick-Matthews, K J & Fitzpatrick-Matthews T 2008 ''The Archaeology of Hitchin from Prehistory to the Present'' North Hertfordshire District Council Museums & Hitchin Historical Society</ref> but this did not last. The modern spelling 'Hitchin' first appears in 1618<ref name="ReferenceA"/> in the ''"Hertfordshire Feet of Fines"''.

[[File:Hitchin History - geograph.org.uk - 143243.jpg|thumb|Panel representing the foundational history of Hitchin mentioning: King Offa, the River Hiz and the Hicce tribe. Now on the front of Hitchin Library, it was on the Sainsburys on Brand Street until the supermarket relocated to the Bancroft area.]]
The name of the town also is associated with the small river that runs through the town, most picturesquely in front of the east end of [[St. Mary's Church, Hitchin|St. Mary's Church]], the town's parish church. The river is noted on maps as the [[River Hiz]]. Contrary to how most people now pronounce the name, that is to say phonetically, the 'z' was an abbreviated character for a 'tch' sound, as in the name of the town. It would have been pronounced 'River Hitch'.

Hitchin is notable for [[St. Mary's Church, Hitchin|St. Mary’s Church]], which is remarkably large for a town of its size. The size of the church is evidence of how Hitchin prospered from the wool trade. It is the largest parish church in [[Hertfordshire]] {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. Most of the church dates from the 15th century, with its tower dating from around 1190.
During the laying of a new floor in the church in 1911, foundations of a more ancient church building were found. In form, they appear to be a [[basilica]]n church of a 7th-century type, with a later enlarged [[chancel]] and [[transept]]s, perhaps added in the 10th century. This makes the church older than the story (not recorded before the 15th century) that the church was founded by [[Offa]], king of [[Mercia]] 757-796.

In 1697, Hitchin (and the nearby village of [[Offley]]) were subject to what is thought to have been the most severe [[hail]]storm in recorded British history. Hailstones over 4&nbsp;inches in diameter were reported<ref>Tailor, Robert (May 1697), “Account of a Great Hailstorm”, ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (Great Britain)''; vol. 19, pp. 577-578</ref>

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bucks Head sign.png|thumb|The Buck's Head pub sign, depicting Henry VIII's supposed escapade in Hitchin]] -->
The town flourished on the wool trade, and located near the [[Icknield Way]] and by the 17th century Hitchin was a staging post for coaches coming from [[London]]. By the middle of the 19th century the railway had arrived, and with it a new way of life for Hitchin. The [[corn exchange]] was built in the [[market place]] and within a short time Hitchin established itself as a major centre for grain trading.

The latter half of the 20th century has also brought great changes in communication to Hitchin. Motorways have shortened the journey time and brought [[Luton]], a few miles away on the [[M1 motorway|M1]], and the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 (M)]] even closer. By the close of the 20th century, Hitchin had become a satellite dormitory town for London. Hitchin also developed a fairly strong [[Sikh]] community based around the [[Walsworth]] area.

During the medieval period, both a priory (Newbigging, now known as The Biggin) and a friary (now known as Hitchin Priory) were established, both of which closed during [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. They were never reformed, although The Biggin was for many years used as [[almshouse]]s.

The [[British Schools Museum]] in Hitchin is home to the world’s only known complete [[Lancasterian Schoolroom]], which was built in 1837 to teach boys by the [[Lancasterian method]] ([[peer tutoring]]).

Girton College—a pioneer in women's education—was established on 16 October 1869 under the name of College for Women at Benslow House in Hitchin, which was considered to be a convenient distance from Cambridge and London. It was thought to be less 'risky' and less controversial to locate the college away from Cambridge in the beginning. The college moved to Cambridge a few years later and adopted its present name, Girton College.

==Government==
Hitchin is in the [[Non-metropolitan district|local government district]] of [[North Hertfordshire]] which was formed in 1974 by the amalgamation of rural and urban councils. There is now no town council in Hitchin,<ref>{{cite web|title=Councils and Politics|url=http://www.hitchinforum.org.uk/about-hitchin/council-mp/|publisher=Hitchin Forum|accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref>  and residents now elects 13 members to the [[North Hertfordshire District Council]]. There are five electoral wards in Hitchin: [[Bearton]], [[Highbury Ward|Highbury]], [[Hitchin Oughton|Oughton]], Priory and [[Walsworth]].

It is within the [[Hitchin and Harpenden (UK Parliament constituency)|Hitchin and Harpenden constituency]] for representation in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], [[Peter Lilley]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] was elected. Between 1983 and 1997 Hitchin was included in the [[North Hertfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Hertfordshire constituency]]. Before that it was in the [[Hitchin (UK Parliament constituency)|Hitchin constituency]].

Hitchin is within the [[East of England (European Parliament constituency)|East of England]] constituency of the [[European Parliament]] which currently elects 7 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]]. Prior to 1999 and the adoption of [[proportional representation]], Hitchin was in the [[Hertfordshire (European Parliament constituency)|Hertfordshire constituency]].

==Transport==
[[Hitchin railway station]] is on the [[East Coast Main Line|Great Northern Line]], to which the [[Cambridge Line]] connects just north of the station.  There are direct connections to London, [[Stevenage]], [[Peterborough]], and Cambridge. Journeys to London and Cambridge both last approximately 30 minutes on the Express services. Stevenage is 5 minutes away and Peterborough is typically 45 minutes distance in journey-time.

The [[A505 road|A505]], A600 and [[A602 road|A602]] roads intersect in Hitchin, which is about three miles from the [[A1(M) motorway]] and about ten miles from the [[M1 motorway]].

The short-lived '''Plymouth Road Runner Superbird''' was a highly modified version of the [[Plymouth Road Runner]] with well-known graphics and horn. It was the factory's follow up stock car racing design for the 1970 season to the [[Dodge Charger Daytona]] of 1969, and incorporated many engineering changes and modifications (both minor and major) garnered from the Daytona's season in competition on the track. The car's primary rival was the [[Ford Torino Talladega]], which in itself was a direct response to the [[Chrysler#Product line|Mopar]] [[Aero Warriors|aero car]]. It has also been speculated one motivating factor in the production of the car was to lure [[Richard Petty]] back to Plymouth.<ref>http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/11/03/plymouth-road-runner-superbird-auction/3349815/</ref> Both of the Mopar aero cars famously featured a protruding, aerodynamic nosecone, a high-mounted rear [[Automotive aerodynamics|wing]] and, in the case of the Superbird, a horn which mimicked the [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Road Runner]] cartoon character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z741/Plymouth_Road_Runner_Superbird.aspx |title=Plymouth Road Runner Superbird, 1970 Road Runner Superbird &#124; Conceptcarz.com - Pictures, Pricing, Information, Wallpaper, History |publisher=Conceptcarz.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>

==History==
Developed specifically for NASCAR racing, the Superbird, a modified Road Runner, was Plymouth's follow-on design to the Charger Daytona fielded by sister company Dodge in the previous season. The Charger 500 version that began the 1969 season was the first American car to be designed aerodynamically using a wind tunnel and computer analysis, and later was modified into the Daytona version with nose and tail. The Superbird's smoothed-out body and nosecone were further refined from that of the Daytona, and the street version's retractable headlights (made of fiberglass<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aerowarriors.com/sss.html |title=Street SuperBird Specifications |publisher=Aero Warriors |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>) added nineteen inches to the Road Runner's original length. The rear wing was mounted on tall vertical struts that put it into less disturbed air thus increasing the efficiency of the downdraft that it placed upon the car's rear axle. For nearly 30 years the mathematic formula used to determine the exact height of the enormous wing was thought to be a highly guarded Chrysler secret. However, in the 1990s a retired Chrysler project engineer admitted publicly that the height was determined in much simpler fashion: it was designed to provide clearance for the trunklid to open freely. The rear-facing fender scoops were to hide cut outs in the hood.  These cutouts were thought to allow wheel clearance due to the lowered height of the car for NASCAR, but in reality the NASCAR tire was wider than the cutout and the scoop itself. Therefore there was no room for tire clearance.  The scoops were actually for ventilating trapped air from the wheel wells in order to facilitate reduced under fender air pressure and lift. Ground clearance was 7.2".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aerowarriors.com/sss.html |title=Street SuperBird Specifications |publisher=Aero Warriors |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>

[[File:SuperbirdDecal.jpg|thumb|right|Plymouth Roadrunner Superbird decal]]

[[File:Moteur Superbird.JPG|thumb|Superbird engine.]]

NASCAR's [[homologation]] requirement demanded that vehicles to be raced must be available to the general public and sold through dealerships in specific minimum numbers. For 1970, NASCAR raised the production requirement from 500 examples to one for every two manufacturer's dealers in the United States; in the case of Plymouth, that meant having to build 1,920 Superbirds. Due to increasing emissions regulations, combined with insurance hikes for high performance cars, 1970 was its only production year.

"Superbird" decals were placed on the outside edges of the spoiler vertical struts featuring a picture of the [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Road Runner]] cartoon character holding a racing helmet. A smaller version of the decal appears on the driver side headlight door. Superbirds had three engine options: the [[Chrysler Hemi engine|426 Hemi]] [[V8 engine]], the [[Chrysler RB engine#440|440 Super Commando]] with a single 4-barrel [[carburetor]], or the [[Chrysler RB engine#440|440 Super Commando Six Barrel]] with three two-barrel carburetors. Only 135 models were fitted with the 426 Hemi. As the 440 was less expensive to produce, the "Street" version of the 426 Hemi engine used in competition was homologated by producing the minimum number required.

On the street, the nose cone and wing were very distinctive, but the aerodynamic improvements hardly made a difference there or on the drag strip. In fact, the 1970 Road Runner was actually quicker in the quarter mile and standard acceleration tests due to the increased weight of the Superbird's nose and wing. Only at speeds in excess of {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} did the modifications show any benefit.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Production numbers==
Chrysler memos of September 1969 show that the Sales Programming staff was preparing to handle 1,920 winged Plymouths for 1970, but published figures say as many as 2,783 were built. The current figure generally accepted is 1,935 SuperBirds built and shipped to United States dealers, with anywhere from 34 to 47 allegedly heading towards Canada. The engine option question is again a sticky one, although the most frequently seen numbers report 135 426ci. Hemi SuperBirds and 716 440ci. Six-Pack editions, with the remainder powered by 440ci. 4bbl. motors. It is believed that over 1,000 Plymouth SuperBirds exist today.<ref>SUPERCARS: The Story of the Dodge Charger Daytona and Plymouth SuperBird; Frank Moriarty: ISBN 1-57427-043-5, (1995), page 149.</ref>

==NASCAR==
[[File:RichardPettyRoadrunner.jpg|thumb|right|Petty's Road Runner Superbird on display at the [[Richard Petty Museum]]]]

In Autumn 1968, [[Richard Petty]] left the Plymouth NASCAR Racing Team for Ford's. Charlie Grey, director of the Ford stock car program felt that hiring Petty would send the message that "money rules none". However, the Superbird was designed specifically to lure Petty back to Plymouth for the 1970 season. Petty did reasonably well against strong Ford opposition on the NASCAR tracks that year, winning eight races and placing well in many more.

NASCAR's rules implemented for the 1971 season limited the "[[Aero Warriors|aero-cars]]" to an engine displacement of no greater than {{convert|305|cid|l|abbr=on}} or they had to carry much more weight compared to their competitors. While they were still legal to race, the power-to-weight consequences that would come with the smaller engine or the increased weight rendered the cars uncompetitive. This was the start of a trend of rules slowing down NASCAR, because the races were exceeding the technology of tires and safety over {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Ford in response also designed the 1970 [[Ford Torino#NASCAR Inspired Torinos|Torino King Cobra]] with a batmobile-like nose, but it was abandoned.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Petty's Superbird appears as a key character in the 2006 [[Pixar]] film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', with Petty as the voice of seven-time champion [[List of Cars characters#Strip .22The King.22 Weathers|Strip "The King" Weathers]]. The racing sponsor's branding in the film exactly matches the Superbird's paint as "[[List of Pixar film references#Dinoco|Dinoco]] blue".

==Market impact==

The Superbird's styling proved to be a little extreme for 1970 tastes (many customers preferred the regular Road Runner), and as a consequence, many of the 1,920 examples built<ref>Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960-1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), p.771.</ref> sat unsold on the back lots of dealerships as late as 1972. Some were converted into 1970 Road Runners to move them off the sales lot. Some manufacturers produce Superbird conversion kits for 1970 Road Runners and Satellites.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} Kits are also available for non produced 1971 and 1972 bodies for the Superbird.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} More recently they have been very steady in pricing, with them regularly fetching $100,000+ USD up to $200,000 however this does vary based on the engine, gearbox and other factory options on the car.<ref>RM Auctions http://rmauctions.com/results/result.cfm?feature=0&category=Cars&sort=year&view=list&SaleCode=&fromYear=&toYear=&lot=&make=plymouth&model1=superbird&submit=Search</ref><ref>Haggerty Classic Car values http://www.hagerty.com/price-guide/1970-Plymouth-Superbird</ref>

The Superbird and the Dodge Charger Daytona were each built for one model year only (1970 and 1969 respectively).

The '''''RedEye''''' is a daily publication put out by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' geared toward 18 to 34-year-olds. ''RedEye'' (not to be confused with '''''Red Eye''''', or '''''Red-Eye''''', or other popular international websites and business sharing the same name) was created due in part to the loss of readership among young people of the ''Chicago Tribune'' and other major newspapers.  [[Tribune Company]] began publishing the ''RedEye'' in an effort to pull readers back into readership and eventually migrate them into the big edition (''Tribune'').<ref name="ST01">{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=18000 |title=Sun-Times may end Red Streak tabloid |last=Mullman |first=Jerry |date=October 4, 2005 |work=Chicago Business |publisher=Crain's |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}</ref>

When ''RedEye'' appeared, it was in direct competition with another paper ''[[Red Streak]]'', which the ''Tribune's'' Chicago competitor the ''[[Sun Times]]'' began publishing at the same time. Initially, both papers were handed out for free by "hawkers" on street corners, usually with one vendor from each paper directly next to each other.<ref name="ST01"/> After about 6 months of the free papers, both companies placed vending boxes throughout the city with the papers thereafter costing 25 cents.

At the end of 2005, the ''Sun Times'' discontinued ''Red Streak''. According to ''Sun Times'' publisher John Cruickshank, ''Red Streak'' was only launched "to stop [the ''Tribune''] from gaining a foothold in the paid tabloid market...". Its only purpose was to undermine ''RedEye'''s attempt at drawing commuters, customers which have historically belonged to the ''Sun Times''.<ref name="ST01"/>

At the beginning of 2006, ''RedEye'' became a free paper once again, with vending boxes being unlocked and coin slots covered over.

In February 2007, after [[NewsCorp]] launched a late-night talk television program on [[Fox News]] entitled ''[[Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld|Red Eye]]'', the Tribune Company filed a federal trademark infringement lawsuit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/24hour/business/story/3556973p-12784930c.html |title=Tribune Sues Fox News Over 'Red Eye' |work=The News Tribune}}{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:EN-Chicago-Logo-Newspaper-R.jpg|left]] -->As compared with mainstream newspapers, ''RedEye'' strongly emphasizes [[pop culture]] and entertainment news; humorous or lighthearted rather than serious [[newspaper column|columns]], and flashy graphics and large pictures.  Like the ''Chicago Sun-Times'', ''RedEye'' is a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]-format newspaper, oriented vertically rather than horizontally and with a front page consisting only of a large picture and a banner headline.

'''Nachman of Breslov''' ({{lang-he|???? ??????}}), also known as '''Reb Nachman of Bratslav''', '''Reb Nachman Breslover''' ({{lang-yi|?? ???? ??????????}}), '''Nachman from Uman''' (April 4, 1772 – October 16, 1810), was the founder of the [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Breslov]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement.

Rebbe Nachman, a great-grandson of the [[Baal Shem Tov]], breathed new life into the Hasidic movement by combining the esoteric secrets of Judaism (the [[Kabbalah]]) with in-depth [[Torah]] scholarship. He attracted thousands of followers during his lifetime and his influence continues until today through many Hasidic movements such as Breslov Hasidism.<ref name="nadav">{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/984972.html |title=Singing a different tune |last=Shragai |first=Nadav |date=3 November 2008 |work=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=10 December 2010}}</ref> Rebbe Nachman's religious philosophy revolved around closeness to God and speaking to God in normal conversation "as you would with a best friend." The concept of ''[[hitbodedut]]'' is central to his thinking.<ref name="nadav"/>

==Biography==
{{See also|Baal Shem Tov family tree}}
Rebbe Nachman was born in the town of [[Medzhybizh]], [[Ukraine]]. His mother, Feiga, was the daughter of Adil (also spelled Udel), daughter of the Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidic Judaism. His father Simcha was the son of Rabbi Nachman of [[Horodenka]] (Gorodenka), one of the Baal Shem Tov's disciples, after whom Rebbe Nachman was named. Rebbe Nachman had two brothers, Yechiel Zvi and Yisroel Mes, and a sister, Perel.<ref>''Until the Mashiach'', p. 2.</ref>

Rebbe Nachman told his disciples that as a small child, he eschewed the pleasures of this world and set his sights on spirituality.<ref>''Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom'': His Praises #1.</ref> He paid his [[melamed]] (teacher) three extra coins for every page of Talmud that he taught him, beyond the fee that his father was paying the teacher, to encourage the teacher to cover more material.<ref>''Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom'': His Praises, #4.</ref> From the age of six, he would go out at night to pray at the grave of his great-grandfather, the Baal Shem Tov, and immerse in the [[mikveh]] afterward.<ref>''Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom'': His Praises, #19.</ref>

At the age of 13, he married Sashia, daughter of Rabbi Ephraim, and moved to his father-in-law's house in Ossatin (Staraya Osota today). He acquired his first disciple on his wedding day, a young man named Shimon who was several years older than he was.<ref>''Until the Mashiach'', p. 7.</ref> He continued to teach and attract new followers in the Medvedevka region in the years that followed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In 1798-1799 he traveled to [[Israel]], where he was received with honor by the Hasidim living in [[Haifa]], [[Tiberias]], and [[Safed]]. In Tiberias, his influence brought about a reconciliation between the Lithuanian and Volhynian Hasidim.<ref>''Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom'': His Pilgrimage to the Land of Israel #19.</ref>

Shortly before [[Rosh Hashana]] 1800, Rebbe Nachman moved to the town of [[Zlatopol]]. The townspeople invited him to have the final word on who would lead the [[Rosh Hashana]] and [[Yom Kippur]] prayer services. The man chosen to lead ''Neilah'', the final prayer service of Yom Kippur, did not meet the Rebbe's approval. Suddenly the man was struck dumb and forced to step down, to his great embarrassment. After the fast ended, Rebbe Nachman spoke in a light-hearted way about what the man's true intentions had been, and the man was so incensed that he denounced Rebbe Nachman to Rabbi Aryeh Leib of Shpola, known as the "Shpoler Zeide", a prominent Hasidic rabbi and early disciple of Rabbi Pinchas of Koretz, who was a leading figure in the first generation of Hasidut. Thus began the Shpoler Zeide's vehement campaign against Breslov Hasidism.<ref>''Until the Mashiach'', pp. 60-61.</ref> During this time he visited many synagogues, including the Great Synagogue in Dubno in Volhynia (now Rivne region), with the largest one in Ukraine and the graves of relatives in the same city.

===Move to Breslov===
[[File:Bratsalv.jpg|thumb|180px|right|River in [[Bratslav]], central-west [[Ukraine]]]]
In 1802, Rebbe Nachman moved to the town of [[Bratslav]], [[Ukraine]], also known as "Breslov". Here he declared, "Today we have planted the name of the Breslover Hasidim. This name will never disappear, because my followers will always be called after the town of Breslov."<ref>''Tzaddik'' #12.</ref>

His move to the town of Breslov brought him into contact with [[Nathan of Breslov|Nathan Sternhartz]] ("Reb Noson"), a 22-year-old Torah scholar in the nearby town of [[Nemirov]], eight miles north of Breslov.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Over the next eight years, Reb Noson became his foremost disciple and scribe, recording all of Rebbe Nachman's formal lessons as well as transcribing the Rebbe's [[masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''Likutey Moharan''.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} After Rebbe Nachman's death, Reb Noson recorded all the informal conversations he and other disciples had had with the Rebbe, and published all of Rebbe Nachman's works as well as his own commentaries on them.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Rebbe Nachman and his wife Sashia had six daughters and two sons. Two daughters died in infancy and the two sons (Ya'akov and Shlomo Efraim) both died within a year and a half of their births. Their surviving children were Adil, Sarah, Miriam, and Chayah.<ref>''Until the Mashiach'', pp. 330-341.</ref> Sashia died of [[tuberculosis]] on June 11, 1807, the eve of [[Shavuot]], and was buried in Zaslov just before the festival began.<ref>''Until the Mashiach'', p. 140.</ref> The following month, Rebbe Nachman became engaged to a woman from Brody whose father was the wealthy Joshua Trachtenberg. (In recent years, a descendant of the Trachtenberg family informed Rabbi Leibel Berger, formerly of the Breslov-Uman Vaad [Committee] of America, that this second wife's name was Devorah [Deborah]. However, this claim remains unverified.) Right after the engagement, Rebbe Nachman contracted tuberculosis.<ref>''Until the Mashiach'', pp. 143-144.</ref>

===Move to Uman===
In May 1810, a fire broke out in Bratslav, destroying Rebbe Nachman's home. A group of ''[[Haskalah|maskilim]]'' (Jews belonging to the secular ''Haskalah'' [Enlightenment] movement) living in [[Uman]], [[Ukraine]] invited him to live in their town, and provided housing for him as his illness worsened. Many years before, Rebbe Nachman had passed through Uman and told his disciples, "This is a good place to be buried."<ref>''Tzaddik'' #114.</ref> He was referring to the [[cemetery]] where more than 20,000 Jewish [[martyr]]s were buried following the [[Massacre of Uman|Haidamak Massacre of Uman]] of 1768. Rebbe Nachman died of tuberculosis at the age of 38 on the fourth day of [[Sukkot]] 1810, and was buried in that cemetery.<ref>''Until the Mashiach'', pp. 204-206.</ref>

==Pilgrimage tradition==
[[File:Nahmantomb.JPG|225px|right|thumb|Outside the modern-day [[synagogue]] which serves as the [[Ohel (grave)|ohel]] for the grave of Rebbe Nachman.]]
{{main|Rosh Hashana kibbutz}}
During the Rebbe's lifetime, thousands of Hasidim traveled to be with him for the [[Jewish holiday]]s of [[Rosh Hashana]], [[Chanuka]], and [[Shavuot]], when he delivered his formal lessons. On the last Rosh Hashana of his life, Rebbe Nachman stressed to his followers the importance of being with him for that holiday in particular. Therefore, after the Rebbe's death, Reb Noson instituted an annual pilgrimage to the Rebbe's gravesite on Rosh Hashana.

This annual pilgrimage, called the [[Rosh Hashana kibbutz]], drew thousands of Hasidim from all over Ukraine, [[Belarus]], [[Lithuania]] and even Poland until 1917, when the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] forced it to continue clandestinely. Only a dozen or so Hasidim risked making the annual pilgrimage during the [[Communism|Communist]] era, as the authorities regularly raided the gathering and often arrested and imprisoned worshippers. Beginning in the mid-1960s, Hasidim who lived outside Russia began to sneak into Uman to pray at Rebbe Nachman's grave during the year. After the fall of Communism in 1989, the gates were reopened entirely. In 2008, approximately 25,000 people from all over the world participated in this annual pilgrimage.<ref>[http://jta.org/news/article/2008/10/02/110639/umanroshhashana "Hasidic Jews celebrate holiday in Uman"] [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], 2008-10-02. Retrieved 2009-07-31.</ref>

In April 1810, Rebbe Nachman called two of his closest disciples, Rabbi Aharon of Breslov and Rabbi Naftali of Nemirov, to act as witnesses for an unprecedented vow:

<blockquote>"If someone comes to my grave, gives a coin to charity, and says these ten Psalms [the ''Tikkun HaKlali''], I will pull him out from the depths of [[Gehinnom]]!".<ref>Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom #141</ref> "It makes no difference what he did until that day, but from that day on, he must take upon himself not to return to his foolish ways".<ref>''Tzaddik'' #122.</ref></blockquote>

This vow spurred many followers to undertake the trip to Rebbe Nachman's grave, even during the Communist crackdown.

==Teachings==
In his short life, Rebbe Nachman achieved much acclaim as a teacher and spiritual leader, and is considered a seminal figure in the history of Hasidism. His contributions to Hasidic Judaism include the following:

*He rejected the idea of hereditary Hasidic dynasties, and taught that each Hasid must "search for the [[tzaddik]] ('saintly/righteous person')" for himself — and within himself. He believed that every Jew has the potential to become a tzaddik.<ref>''Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom'' #26.</ref>

*He emphasized that a tzaddik should magnify the blessings on the community through his [[mitzvah|mitzvot]]. However, the tzaddik cannot "absolve" a Hasid of his sins, and the Hasid should pray only to God, not to the Rebbe. The purpose of confiding in another human being is to unburden the soul as part of the process of repentance and healing. (Modern psychology supports this idea, which is the "Fifth Step" in many [[12-step program]]s for recovery.)

*In his early life, he stressed the practice of fasting and self-castigation as the most effective means of repentance. In later years, however, he abandoned these severe ascetisms because he felt they may lead to depression and sadness. He told his followers not to be "fanatics". Rather, they should choose one personal mitzvah to be very strict about, and do the others with the normal amount of care.<ref>''Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom'' #235.</ref>

*He encouraged his disciples to take every opportunity to increase holiness in themselves and their daily activities. For example, by marrying and living with one's spouse according to Torah law, one elevates sexual intimacy to an act bespeaking honor and respect to the God-given powers of procreation. This in turn safeguards the sign of the covenant, the [[brit milah]] ("covenant of [[circumcision]]") which is considered the symbol of the everlasting pact between God and the Jewish people.

*He urged everyone to seek out his own and others' good points in order to approach life in a state of continual happiness. If one cannot find any "good points" in himself, let him search his deeds. If he finds that his deeds were driven by ulterior motives or improper thoughts, let him search for the positive aspects within them. And if he cannot find any good points, he should at least be happy that he is a Jew. This "good point" is God's doing, not his.

*He placed great stress on living with faith, simplicity, and joy. He encouraged his followers to clap, sing and dance during or after their prayers, bringing them to a closer relationship with God.

*He emphasized the importance of intellectual learning and Torah scholarship. "You can originate Torah novellae, but do not change anything in the laws of the [[Shulchan Aruch]]!" he said. He and his disciples were thoroughly familiar with all the classic texts of Judaism, including the [[Talmud]] and its commentaries, [[Midrash]], and [[Shulchan Aruch]].

*He frequently recited extemporaneous [[prayer]]s. He taught that his followers should spend an hour alone each day, talking aloud to God in his or her own words, as if "talking to a good friend." This is in addition to the prayers in the [[siddur]]. Breslover Hasidim still follow this practice today, which is known as ''[[hitbodedut]]'' (literally, "to make oneself be in solitude"). Rebbe Nachman taught that the best place to do ''hitbodedut'' was in a field or forest, among the natural works of God's creation.

*He emphasized importance of [[music]] for spiritual development and religious practice.<ref>AZAMRA!

===Tikkun HaKlali===
{{main|Tikkun HaKlali}}
Another prominent feature of Rebbe Nachman's teachings is his ''[[Tikkun HaKlali]]'' ("General Rectification" or "General Remedy") for spiritual correction. This general rectification can override the spiritual harm caused by many sins, or one sin whose ramifications are many. On Shavuot 5566 (May 23, 1806) Rebbe Nachman revealed that ten specific [[Psalms]], recited in this order: Psalms 16, 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, 105, 137, and 150, constitute a special remedy for the sin of wasting seed, which defiles the sign of the [[brit milah|covenant]], and, by extension, all the other [[mitzvah|mitzvot]]. Most Breslover Hasidim try to say the ''Tikkun HaKlali'' daily.

==Controversy==
Rebbe Nachman lived at a time of controversy between Hasidim and more traditional Orthodox Jews, known as [[Misnagdim]] (opponents) for their opposition to hasidism. It was also a time of friction between Hasidim and proponents of Jewish emancipation and [[Haskalah]]. (In 1816, [[Joseph Perl]] wrote a denunciation of Hasidic mysticism and beliefs, in which he criticized many of the writings of Nachman, who had died six years earlier. Austrian imperial censors blocked publication of Perl's treatise, fearing that it would foment unrest among the empire's Jewish subjects.)

During his lifetime, Rebbe Nachman also encountered opposition from within the Hasidic movement itself, from people who questioned his new approach to Hasidut. One of these was Rabbi Aryeh Leib of [[Shpola]], known as the "Shpoler Zeide" (Grandfather/Sage of Shpola) (1725–1812), who, according to Breslov tradition, had supported Rebbe Nachman in his early years but began to oppose him after he moved to Zlatipola, near Shpola, in 1802.

The Shpoler Zeide saw Rebbe Nachman's teachings as deviating from classical Judaism and from the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov. Some postulate that the Zeide felt threatened because Rebbe Nachman was moving in on his territory and taking disciples away from him. Still others claim that Rebbe Nachman was a threat to other [[rebbe]]s because he opposed the institutional dynasties that were already beginning to form in the Hasidic world. (Rebbe Nachman himself did not found a dynasty; his two sons died in infancy and he appointed no successor.)

According to Breslov tradition, a number of prominent figures of Hasidut supported Rebbe Nachman against the Shpoler Zeide's opposition, including Rabbi [[Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev]], Rabbi Gedalia of Linitz, Rabbi Zev Wolf of Charni-[[Ostrov]]{{dn|date=May 2014}}, and Rabbi [[Avraham of Kalisk]]. Breslov traditions further relate, that at one point, a number of Hasidic rabbis gathered in [[Berdychiv|Berditchev]] to place the Shpoler Zeide in ''[[Herem (censure)|cherem]]'' (a rabbinic form of excommunication) for showing contempt to a true Torah scholar. Their effort was nixed, however, when someone convinced Rabbi Levi Yitzchok that it would give the city Barditcev a bad name.<ref>''Tzaddik'' #19.</ref>

===Did he believe he was the Messiah?===

====Secular academic view====
The [[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] and other secular academic sources claim that Rebbe Nachman saw himself as the [[Jewish messianism|Messiah]]. One proof that secular academics offer is that the messianic personality is expected to rectify errant souls. Rebbe Nachman did speak to his disciples about the principle of ''tikkun'' (rectification of souls), and even stated that he was capable of rectifying souls. However, this power was also claimed by Rebbes of other Hasidic sects. The principle of ''tikkun'' is also found throughout the teachings of (Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]]), who preceded Rebbe Nachman by several hundred years.

Some secular academics postulate that Rebbe Nachman was influenced by the teachings of [[Sabbatai Zevi]] and [[Jacob Frank]], false messiahs of the 17th and 18th centuries, respectively, but that he was not actually a Sabbatean or Frankist. As proof, they note that Rebbe Nachman's thinking on ''tikkun olam'', the Kabbalistic healing of the universe, bears similarities to the teachings of Sabbatai Zevi.  However in his writings, Rebbe Nachman refers to Sabbetai Zevi as ''SHaTZ'' (an acronym for his Hebrew name, ''SHabbetai TZvi'') and concludes the reference with the expression ''yimach shemo'' (may his name be obliterated). The latter expression is generally reserved for the worst enemies of the Jewish people.

====Breslov view====
Rebbe Nachman never claimed that he was the Messiah. He taught the general Hasidic concept of the ''tzaddik ha-dor'' ([[tzadik]] of the generation or era<ref>In [[s:The Seven Pillars of Faith]] by Rabbi Yitchak Breiter, it is explained that the Tzaddik referred to in Rabbi Nachman's writings is Moshe Rabbeinu-Rasbhi-The Arizal-Ba'al Shem Tov-Rabbi Nachman himself</ref>), which is the idea that in every generation, a special, saintly person is born who could potentially become the Jewish Messiah if conditions were right in the world. Otherwise, this tzaddik lives and dies the same as any other holy man. Toward the end of his life, he said, "My fire will burn until the coming of [[Jewish messianism|Mashiach]]"<ref>[[Chayey Moharan]] [[s:Chayey Moharan#360|#360]]</ref> — indicating that the Messiah had not yet arrived. Breslover Hasidim do not believe Rebbe Nachman was the Messiah, but they do believe that the light of his teachings continues to illuminate the paths of Jews from many disparate backgrounds.  [[Chayey Moharan]] [[s:Chayey Moharan#266|#266]] states that Rabbi Nachman said "All the benefits Messiah can do for Israel, I can do; the only difference is Messiah will decree and it will happen, but I -- (and he stopped and did not say more) [alternate version: I cannot finish yet]"

It should be noted that the Sabbateans based their teachings on the same [[Zohar]] and [[Isaac Luria|Lurianic kabbalah]] that are considered part of classical Judaism by Hasidism. Where the Sabbateans diverged from accepted teaching was in believing that Sabbatai Zevi was "the Messiah" and that the [[Halakha]] (Jewish law) was no longer binding. Rebbe Nachman did not do the same. He did not claim he was the Messiah, and when asked, "What do we do as Breslover Hasidim?" he replied, "Whatever it says in the [[Shulchan Aruch]] (Code of Jewish Law)."

==Published works==
{{wikisource|Author:Nachman of Breslov}}
Rebbe Nachman's Torah lessons and stories were published and disseminated mainly after his death by his disciple, Reb Noson:

*''Likutey Moharan'' ("Collected Teachings of Our Teacher, Rabbi Nachman") (vol. i., Ostrog, 1808; vol. ii., Moghilev, 1811; vol. iii., Ostrog, 1815)—Hasidic interpretations of the [[Tanakh]], [[Midrash]]im, etc. This work has been completely translated to English and annotated in fifteen volumes by Rabbis Chaim Kramer and Moshe Mykoff of the [[Breslov Research Institute]].

*''Sefer HaMidot'' (''The Aleph-Bet Book'') (Moghilev, 1821)—a collection of practical advice gleaned from Torah sources, presented as epigrams or maxims and arranged alphabetically by topic.<ref>Sears, Dovid (2010). ''Breslov Pirkey Avot''. Jerusalem:[[Breslov Research Institute]]. ISBN 978-1-928822-16-5. p. 36.</ref>

*''Tikkun HaKlali'' ("General Remedy")—Rebbe Nachman's order of ten Psalms to be recited for various problems, plus commentary by Reb Noson. Published as a separate book in 1821.

*''[[s:Tales of Rabbi Nachman|Sippurei Ma'asiyot]]'' (''Tales of Rabbi Nachman'' or ''Rabbi Nachman's Stories'') (n.p., 1816)—13 story tales in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] that are filled with deep mystical secrets. The longest of these tales is ''The Seven Beggars'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shuvubonim.org/storysb.html |title=The Story of the Seven Beggars, by Rabbi Nachman of Breslov |publisher=Yeshivat Shuvu Bonim |accessdate=10 December 2010 |year=2000}}</ref> which contains many kabbalistic themes and hidden allusions. Several fragmentary stories are also included in Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]]'s translation of the complete tales, ''Rabbi Nachman's Stories''.

Another mysterious document that Rebbe Nachman dictated to Reb Noson is the ''Megillat Setarim'' ("Hidden Scroll"), which was written in a cryptic combination of Hebrew initials and brief phrases. Prof. Zvi Mark has researched and attempted to decipher this document, based on disclosures from prominent members of the Breslov community. His findings have been published in Hebrew and in English translation, along with facsimiles of discrepant manuscript copies.

==Auto-destructed works==

Rebbe Nachman also wrote ''Sefer HaGanuz'' ("The Hidden Book") and the ''Sefer HaNisraf'' ("The Burned Book"), neither of which are extant. Rebbe Nachman told his disciples that these volumes contained deep mystical insights which few would be able to comprehend. While he dictated the ''Sefer HaNisraf'' to Reb Noson, the latter said that he did not understand it at all; later he said, "What I do remember is that it spoke about the greatness of the mitzvah of hospitality and preparing the bed for a guest".<ref>''Siach Sarfei Kodesh'' I-699, quoted in ''Through Fire and Water'', p. 144.</ref> Rebbe Nachman never showed the ''Sefer HaGanuz'' to anyone.

Rebbe Nachman first ordered a two manuscripts of a book ''Ha Nisraf'' to be destroyed in a bargain for his life during a phase of his tuberculosis which preceded his death by two years.<ref name="Greenbaum 1987 ISBN 0-930213-17-3">{{cite book|last=Greenbaum|first=Avraham|title=Tzaddik|year=1987|publisher=Breslov Research Institute|location=New York/Jerusalem|page=ISBN 0-930213-17-3|page=77}}</ref>   He believed that the illness was a "punishment from the upper-world--for writing a book."<ref>{{cite book|last=Kamenetz|first=Rodger|title=Burnt Books|year=2010|publisher=Nextbook/Schocken|location=New York|isbn=9780805242577|page=79}}</ref>

Two years later, from his deathbed, he ordered a chest full of his writings, presumably containing ''Sefer HaGanuz'', to be burnt.

"On the evening of the last day of his life, Rabbi Nachman gave his disciples the key to a chest.  "As soon as I am dead," he told them, "while my body is still lying here on the floor, you are to take all the writings you find the chest and burn them.  And be sure to fulfill my request."<ref name="Greenbaum 1987 ISBN 0-930213-17-3"/>

[[File:Fur bearing trout. Very rare. (3793949065).jpg|thumb|A mounted "fur-bearing trout", once displayed in the [[National Museum of Scotland]]]]
The '''fur-bearing trout''' (or '''furry trout''') is a [[legendary creature|fictional creature]] purportedly found in [[North America]] and [[Iceland]].  According to tales, the [[trout]] has [[evolution|evolved]] a thick coat of [[fur]] to maintain its body heat. Tales of furry fish date to the 17th-century and later the "shaggy trout" of  Iceland. The earliest known American publication dates from a 1929 ''Montana Wildlife'' magazine article by J.H. Hicken. A [[taxidermy]] furry trout produced by Ross C. Jobe is a specimen at the [[Royal Museum of Scotland]], it is a trout with white rabbit fur "ingeniously" attached. There are no real examples of any fur-bearing trout species, but two examples of hair-like growths on fish are known. The "cotton mold", ''[[Saprolegnia]]'', can infect fish, which can result in the appearance of fish covered in the white "fur".  A real fish, ''[[Mirapinna esau]]'', also known as the "Hairy Fish", has hair-like outgrowths and wings.

== Commonalities ==
Fur-bearing trout are [[legendary creature|fictional creatures]] that are purportedly found in [[Arkansas]], northern [[North America]], and [[Iceland]].<ref name="moh" /> The basic claim (or [[tall tale]]) is that the waters of lakes and rivers in the area are so cold that a species of [[trout]] has [[evolution|evolved]] which grows a thick coat of [[fur]] to maintain its body heat.<ref name="moh" /> Another theory says that it is due to four jugs - or two bottles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanfolklore.net/folklore/2010/08/furbearing_trout.html|title=Fur-Bearing Trout: From Tall tales at Americanfolklore.net|publisher=American Folklore|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> - of [[hair tonic]] being spilled into the [[Arkansas River]].<ref name="moh">{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/photos/furtrout.html|title=The Fur-Bearing Trout|publisher=The Museum of Hoaxes|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>

The origins vary, but one of the earlier claims date to a 17th-century Scottish immigrant's letter to his relatives referring to "furried animals and fish" being plentiful in the New World. It was followed by a request to procure a specimen of these "furried fish" and one was sent one home.<ref name="moh" /> A publication in 1900 recounts the Icelandic Lodsilungur, another haired trout, as being a common folklore.<ref name=type /> The earliest known American publication dates from a 1929 ''Montana Wildlife'' magazine article by J.H. Hicken.<ref name="fmca" />

The "cotton mold" ''[[Saprolegnia]]'' will sometimes infect fish, causing tufts of fur-like growth to appear on the body. A heavy infection will result in the death of the fish, and as the fungus continues to grow afterwards, dead fish that are largely covered in the white "fur" can occasionally be found washed ashore.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tdsfb.org/fungus.htm | title=Fish Fungus Saprolegnia & Ulcerative Dermal Necrosis (UDN) | publisher=Tay District Salmon Fisheries Board | accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> A real fish, ''[[Mirapinna esau]]'' known as the "Hairy Fish", has hair-like outgrowths and wings. It was fish discovered in the [[Azores]] in 1956.<ref name=type />

== Icelandic Lodsilungur ==
According to Icelandic legend, the Lodsilungur is a furry trout that is the creation of demons and giants. The Lodsilungur are described as inedible fish that overwhelm rivers and are a form of punishment for human wickedness.<ref name=type>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QNFR4xHHIegC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Beasts+that+Hide+from+Man:+Seeking+the+World%27s+Last+Undiscovered+Animals&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ILBiU4XHGYSdyQG7woCQBQ&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&q=trout&f=false | title=The Beasts That Hide from Man: Seeking the World's Last Undiscovered Animals | publisher=Cosimo, Inc. | author=Shuker, Karl | year=2003 | pages=130–131 | isbn=978-1-931044-64-6}}</ref> In 1900, ''The Scottish Review'' featured an account of the Lodsilungur as a poisonous "Shaggy trout" of northern Iceland.

== United States Furry trouts ==
An account of a furry trout appeared in 1929 in Montana Wildlife magazine and was first noted by J.H. Hicken. Hicken's account states that went the fish is caught "the change of temperature from this water to atmosphere is so great that the fish explodes upon being taken from the water, and fur and skin come off in one perfect piece, making it available for commercial purposes, and leaving the body of the fish for refrigerator purposes or eating, as desired."<ref name="fmca">{{cite web | url=http://www.fmca.com/conventions/past-conventions/gillette-2013/3649-roaming-wyoming-furry-fish-are-cool-very-cool?tmpl=component&print=1&page= | title=Roaming Wyoming: Furry fish are cool.

A fantastical story was recounted by S.E. Schlosser, it states that the hairy trout were the result of two bottles or four jugs of spilled hair tonic and fisherman would act as barbers to lure fish from the waters to have a free trim or shave.<ref name="moh">{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/photos/furtrout.html|title=The Fur-Bearing Trout|publisher=The Museum of Hoaxes|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.furbearingtrout.com/schlosser.html | title=The Fur-Bearing Trout As retold by S.E.

The fish would have to be released unless it was the same length, where the meat can be consumed and the outards made into furry [[slippers]].<ref name=odd />

== Canada ==
The Canadian Fur-bearing trout is another example of the furry trout hoax. According to the story, a trout with white fur was caught in [[Lake Superior]] off [[Gros Cap]] in Algoma, [[Ontario]], Canada and its taxidermist was Ross C. Jobe.<ref name=type /> The purchaser of the fish learned of the hoax after presenting it to the [[Royal Museum of Scotland]]. The white fur of a rabbit was described as being "ingeniously" attached to the fish.<ref name=type /> A fictional description of the Canadian "Hairy" Trout was published by Takeshi Yamada.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.furbearingtrout.com/hairytrout.html | title=The Canadian "Hairy" Trout Takeshi Yamada | publisher=Furbearingtrout.com | accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>

'''Preston''' is a [[village]] and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] about {{convert|3|mi|km}} south of [[Hitchin]] in Hertfordshire, England.

[[File:St Martin, Preston, Herts - geograph.org.uk - 471748.jpg|thumb|St Martin, Preston]]
The village grew up around the [[Knights Templar|Templar]] holdings at '''Temple Dinsley''', and [[Princess Helena College]] is now on the site. The first church was mentioned in 1252, when six acres (24,000&nbsp;m²) of land was given to nuns from [[Elstow]], Bedfordshire.

Temple Dinsley passed on to the [[Knights Hospitaller]] after the dissolution of the Templars. When the Hospitallers were in turn dissolved in 1542, the manor went to Sir [[Ralph Sadleir]].

In the 17th century the village became linked with [[John Bunyan]], who used to hold services in a natural [[amphitheatre]] now called Bunyan's Dell.

St Martin's, the local [[Anglican]] [[church (building)|church]], opened in 1900.

The ruined [[Minsden Chapel]], reputed to be haunted, is located near the village, though is actually in [[Langley, Hertfordshire|Langley]] civil parish.

'''Click of death''' is a term that became common in the late 1990s referring to the clicking sound in [[disk storage]] systems that signals a disk drive has [[failure mode|failed]], often catastrophically.<ref name="pcworld1">{{cite web|author=By &nbsp;&nbsp; Jan 15, 1999 12:00 AM |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/9378/the_click_of_death_ate_my_data.html |title=The Click of Death Ate My Data |publisher=PCWorld |date=1999-01-15 |accessdate=2011-09-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2014}}</ref> 

The clicking sound itself arises from the unexpected movement of the disk's [[Disk read-and-write head|read-write actuator]]. At startup, and during use, the disk head must move correctly and be able to confirm it is correctly tracking data on the disk. If the head fails to move as expected or upon moving cannot track the disk surface correctly, the [[disk controller]] may attempt to recover from the error by returning the head to its home position and then retrying, at times causing an audible "click". In some devices, the process automatically retries causing a repeated clicking sound.

== Origin of the term ==

The phrase "click of death" originated to describe a failure mode of the [[Iomega]] [[ZIP drive]]s, appearing in print as early as January 30, 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Click-of-death-strikes-Iomega/2100-1001_3-207628.html?tag=mncol |title="'Click of death' strikes Iomega." |publisher=News.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-12}}</ref> In his podcast of September 18, 2008, [[Macintosh|Mac]] journalist Tim Robertson claimed to have coined the phrase in the early '90s.<ref>[http://www.mymac.com/showarticle.php?id=3388 MyMac Podcast #201], 00:56:40 - 00:58:30.</ref>  The phrase was then applied to other drives exhibiting a similar unusual clicking sound usually associated with failure.

== Iomega Zip drives ==
{{more footnotes|section|date=February 2008}}

Iomega Zip drives were prone to developing misaligned heads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Click-of-death-strikes-Iomega/2100-1001_3-207628.html |title="Click of death" strikes Iomega |publisher=CNET News |date= |accessdate=2011-09-12}}</ref> Dust inside the Zip disks or dirty heads caused by oxide build-up could misalign the heads, but in newer devices it was due to poor quality control and manufacturing defects in the drive itself. Magnetic fields could also cause the drive heads to become misaligned, as the drives were not internally shielded from external magnetic fields. The heads caused the data on the cartridge to become misaligned, rendering it unreadable.  The Zip cartridges also wore out, grew defects,  or otherwise lost all four 'Z tracks'. If all four redundant 'Z tracks' were lost, the cartridge was unusable, since retail drives are unable to low-level format the disks.

With a malfunctioning drive or cartridge, the drive heads tried to read the Zip disk, but could not find a good Z track or hit a bad spot during a read operation. As part of the drive's retry program, the controller would quickly snap the head arm back into the drive and out again, producing a specific number of 'clicks'. This happens each time a data request fails: the drive parks the heads to calibrate them and presumably clean them. Parking and relaunching continued until the data had been read or a set number of attempts had been reached.

The Zip drive had a very low-cost and revolutionary linear [[actuator]] to move the read/write head back and forth on the Zip disk media. This actuator slid back and forth on a single thin steel rod using two sleeve bearings. Under normal drive use, the actuator was under the servo control of the drive. If the drive had its power removed inadvertently by being unplugged or [[Electric power|power]] outage, the read/write heads were pulled off the disk by a power-loss circuit. This was to prevent damage by the heads being left on the media. When the actuator was removed in this manner, it slammed to a stop at the end of its travel. This violent stopping of the actuator could damage the fragile suspension system of the read/write head. To protect from this damage, the drive designers placed a small doughnut shaped [[foam]] washer at the end of the thin steel bearing the actuator slid on.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} A cost reduction effort within Iomega manufacturing decided that to reduce cost, they would remove this part. Zip drives that followed for a several month period exhibited the click of death. Once this omission was discovered by the drive's original designers and put back into the design, the drive's click of death disappeared. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

In rare cases, a Zip cartridge with disk edge damage could rip off the heads in a Zip drive. The damaged disks could go on to damage the heads of any other drive they were used in. A previously good drive would click as if a mis-written cartridge had been inserted. Replacement drives had a warning about damaged ZIP cartridges on a peel off label and quick visual inspection instructions.

A lifetime warranty on the 100 MB cartridge was misleading as to the actual cartridge life, and future products like the 250 MB offerings carry a 5 year or less warranty from Iomega.

Iomega received thousands of complaints about the click of death. Iomega stated that fewer than 1 in 200 Jaz and Zip drive owners were affected by the click of death.<ref name="pcworld1"/> Iomega often stated that the problems were caused by the use of (functionally identical) third-party media. A [[class action suit]] was filed against them for violation of the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Oo5MfD6y8hwC&pg=RA1-PA32&lpg=RA1-PA32&dq=rinaldi+v.+iomega&source=bl&ots=bWkBAem-eJ&sig=HAIht81bxDfN99_9L7KvTNYDvOQ&hl=en&ei=ZhxMTvnkNOjRiAKRl5CUAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=rinaldi%20v.%20iomega&f=false |title=Products liability: recreation and ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1985-09-14 |accessdate=2011-09-12}}</ref> in September 1998. (''Rinaldi v. Iomega Corp.'', 41 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 2d 1143) The case was [[Settlement (litigation)|settled]] in March 2001 and Zip drive owners were given a rebate toward the future purchase of an Iomega product.

{{Listen|filename=WD bad heads click of death.ogg|title=Click of death|description=WD hard drive with click of death caused by a head crash|format=[[Ogg]]}}

On a [[hard disk drive]], the ''click of death'' refers to a similar phenomenon; the head actuator may click or knock as the drive repetitively tries to recover from one or more errors. These sounds can be the heads repetitively loading or unloading, or they can be the sounds of the actuator striking a stop, or both. The ''click of death'' may indicate that the hard drive has crashed or failed.

'''Military science fiction''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[science fiction]] featuring the use of [[science fiction technology]], mainly [[science fiction weapons|weapons]], for military purposes and principal characters that are members of a military organization involved in military activity; occurring sometimes in outer space or on a different planet or planets. 

A detailed description of the conflict, the tactics and weapons used for it, and the role of a military service and the individual members of that military organization forms the basis for a typical work of military science fiction. The stories often use features of actual past or current Earth conflicts, with countries being replaced by planets or galaxies of similar characteristics, [[battleship]]s replaced by space battleships and certain events changed so that the author can extrapolate what might have occurred.

Traditional military values of bravery, sacrifice, sense of duty, and camaraderie are emphasized, and the action is usually described from the point of view of a soldier or officer.<ref name="Waterson2008">{{cite journal | last = Waterson | first = Rick | title = Welcome to Windycon 35! | journal = Windycon Program Book | volume = 35 | pages = 1 | publisher = ISFiC | location = Palatine, Ill. | date = 2008-11-14}}</ref> Typically, the technology is more advanced than that of the present and described in detail. In some stories, however, technology is fairly static, and weapons that would be familiar to present-day soldiers are used, but other aspects of society have changed. For example, women may be accepted as equal partners for combat roles.  In many military sci-fi stories, technological advances are basic to plot development,
but battles are often won more by cleverness or bravery than by technology.

One subset of military science fiction overlaps with [[space opera]], concentrating on large-scale space battles with futuristic weapons. At one extreme, the genre is used to speculate about future wars involving space travel, or the effects of such a war on humans; at the other, it consists of the use of military fiction plots with some superficial science fiction trappings. The term "military space opera" is occasionally used to denote this subgenre, as used for example by critic Sylvia Kelso when describing [[Lois McMaster Bujold]]'s [[Vorkosigan Saga]].<ref name=renaissance251>David G. Hartwell, Kathryn Cramer, ''The Space Opera Renaissance'', Tor Books, ISBN 0-7653-0617-4. Introduction, p.251</ref>  Another example of military space opera would be the [[Battlestar Galactica]] franchise, both traditional and more notably the reimagined series.

The key distinction of military science fiction from space opera is that the principal characters in a space opera are not military personnel, but civilians or [[paramilitary]]. Military science fiction also does not necessarily always include an outer space or multi-planetary setting like space opera.

== History ==

Precursors for military science fiction can be found in "future war" stories dating back at least to [[George Tomkyns Chesney|George Chesney]]'s story "[[The Battle of Dorking]]" (1871).<ref name="define">{{cite web | title = Defining the Genre: Military Science Fiction | publisher = Fandomania | year = 2008 | url = http://fandomania.com/defining-the-genre-military-science-fiction/ | accessdate = 2008-11-11}}</ref> Other works of fiction followed, including [[H.G. Wells]]'s "[[The Land Ironclads]]." Eventually, as science fiction became an established and separate genre, military science fiction established itself as a subgenre.  One such work is [[H. Beam Piper]]'s ''Uller Uprising'' (1952) (based on the events of the [[Sepoy Mutiny]]). [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Starship Troopers]]'' (1959) is another work of military SF, along with [[Gordon Dickson]]'s ''[[Dorsai]]'' (1960), and these are thought to be mostly responsible for popularizing this sub-genre's popularity among young readers of the time.

The [[Vietnam War]] resulted in veterans with combat experience deciding to write science fiction, including [[Joe Haldeman]] and [[David Drake]].  Throughout the 1970s, works such as Haldeman's ''[[The Forever War]]'' and Drake's ''[[Hammer's Slammers]]'' helped increase the popularity of the genre.<ref name="define" /> Short stories also were popular, collected in books like ''[[Combat SF]]'', edited by [[Gordon R. Dickson]]. This [[anthology]] includes one of the first ''Hammer's Slammers'' stories as well as one of the ''[[Bolo (tank)|BOLO]]'' stories by [[Keith Laumer]] and one of the ''Berserker'' stories by [[Fred Saberhagen]]. This anthology seems to have been the first time SF-stories specifically dealing with war as a subject were collected and marketed as such. The series of anthologies with the group title ''There Will be War'' edited by Pournelle and [[John F. Carr]] (nine volumes from 1983 through 1990) helped keep the category active, and encouraged new writers to add to it.

[[David Drake]] has often written of the horrors and futility of war. He has said, in the afterwords of several of his ''[[Hammer's Slammers]]'' books (1979 and later), that one of his reasons for writing is to educate those people who have not experienced war, but who might have to make the decision to start or endorse a war (as policy makers or as voters) about what war is really like, and what the powers and limits of the military as an instrument of policy are.

[[David Weber]] has said that:
<blockquote>
"For me, military science-fiction is science-fiction which is written about a military situation with a fundamental understanding of how military lifestyles and characters differ from civilian lifestyles and characters. It is science-fiction which attempts to realistically portray the military within a science-fiction context. It is not 'bug shoots'. It is about human beings, and members of other species, caught up in warfare and carnage. It isn't an excuse for simplistic solutions to problems."<ref>[http://www.sfcrowsnest.com/sfnews2/02_july/news0702_1.shtml Interview by Stephen Hunt]</ref>
</blockquote>

The '''Spitzer Space Telescope''' ('''SST'''), formerly the '''Space Infrared Telescope Facility''' ('''SIRTF'''), is an [[infrared]] [[space observatory]] launched in 2003. It is the fourth and final of the [[NASA]] [[Great Observatories program]].

The planned mission period was to be 2.5 years with a pre-launch expectation that the mission could extend to five or slightly more years until the onboard [[liquid helium]] supply was exhausted. This occurred on 15 May 2009.<ref>[http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2009-12/index.shtml ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> Without liquid helium to cool the telescope to the very low temperatures needed to operate, most of the instruments are no longer usable. However, the two shortest-wavelength modules of the [[#Instruments|IRAC]] camera are still operable with the same sensitivity as before the [[cryogen]] was exhausted, and will continue to be used in the '''Spitzer Warm Mission'''.<ref name="cycle6">{{cite web | author=Spitzer Science Center | title=Cycle-6 Warm Mission | publisher=NASA / JPL | url=http://sohelp2.ipac.caltech.edu/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&_a=view&parentcategoryid=8&nav=0 | accessdate=2009-09-16}}</ref> All Spitzer data, from both the primary and warm phases, are archived at the [[Infrared Science Archive]] (IRSA).

In keeping with NASA tradition, the telescope was renamed after its successful demonstration of operation, on December 18, 2003. Unlike most [[telescope]]s that are named after famous deceased astronomers by a board of scientists, the new name for SIRTF was obtained from a contest open to the general public.

The contest led to the telescope being named in honor of [[Lyman Spitzer]], one of the 20th century's great scientists.<ref name="spitzer_bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/postsecondary/features/F_Lyman_Spitzer.html|title=Who was Lyman Spitzer?|accessdate=6 January 2009 |work=Nasa: For Educators |publisher=California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory |date=11 March 2004}}</ref> Though he was not the first to propose the idea of the [[space telescope]] ([[Hermann Oberth]] being the first, in ''Wege zur Raumschiffahrt,'' 1929,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/37981 |title=Up close and personal |accessdate=20 April 2009 |work=Physics World|publisher=Institute of Physics|date=2 March 2009}}</ref> and also in ''Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen,'' 1923),<ref>Please refer to [[Hubble Space Telescope#Proposals and precursors|Hubble Space Telescope]].</ref> [[Lyman Spitzer|Spitzer]] wrote a 1946 report for [[RAND]] describing the advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory and how it could be realized with available (or upcoming) technology.<ref>{{cite book |author=Carolyn Collins Petersen, John C.

The {{US$|800 million}} Spitzer was launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], on a [[Delta II rocket|Delta II]] 7920H ELV rocket, Monday, 25 August 2003 at 13:35:39 [[UTC-5]] ([[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]]).<ref>{{cite news | author=William Harwood | work=Spaceflight Now | title=First images from Spitzer Space Telescope unveiled | url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0312/17sstresults/ | date= December 18, 2003| accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref>

It follows a rather unusual orbit, [[heliocentric orbit|heliocentric]] instead of [[geocentric orbit|geocentric]], trailing and drifting away from Earth's orbit at approximately 0.1 [[astronomical unit]] per year (a so-called "earth-trailing" orbit). The [[primary mirror]] is {{convert|85|cm|in|sp=us}} in diameter, [[F-number|''f''/12]] and made of [[beryllium]] and was cooled to {{convert|5.5|K|F|lk=in}}. The [[satellite]] contains three instruments that allowed it to perform astronomical imaging and [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] from 3 to 180 micrometers, [[spectroscopy]] from 5 to 40 micrometers, and [[spectrophotometry]] from 5 to 100 micrometers.

== History ==
By the early 1970s, astronomers began to consider the possibility of placing an [[infrared telescope]] above the obscuring effects of Earth's atmosphere.
In 1979, a report from the National Research Council of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], ''A Strategy for Space Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 1980s'', identified a Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) as "one of two major astrophysics facilities [to be developed] for [[Spacelab]]", a Shuttle-borne platform. Anticipating the major results from an upcoming Explorer satellite and from the Shuttle mission, the report also favored the "study and development of ... long-duration spaceflights of infrared telescopes cooled to cryogenic temperatures."
The launch in January 1983 of the [[Infrared Astronomical Satellite]], jointly developed by the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, to conduct the first infrared survey of the sky, whetted the appetites of scientists worldwide for follow-up space missions capitalizing on the rapid improvements in infrared detector technology.

Earlier infrared observations had been made by both space-based and ground-based [[observatory|observatories]].  Ground-based observatories have the drawback that at infrared [[wavelength]]s or [[frequency|frequencies]], both the Earth's [[earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and the telescope itself will radiate (glow) strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere is opaque at most infrared wavelengths. This necessitates lengthy exposure times and greatly  decreases the ability to detect faint objects. It could be compared to trying to observe the stars at noon. Previous space-based satellites (such as [[IRAS]], the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, and [[Infrared Space Observatory|ISO]], the Infrared Space Observatory) were operational during the 1980s and 1990s and great advances in astronomical technology have been made since then.

Most of the early concepts envisioned repeated flights aboard the NASA Space Shuttle.
This approach was developed in an era when the Shuttle program was expected to support weekly flights of up to 30 days duration.
A May 1983 NASA proposal described SIRTF as a Shuttle-attached mission, with an evolving scientific instrument payload.
Several flights were anticipated with a probable transition into a more extended mode of operation, possibly in association with a future space platform or space station.
SIRTF would be a 1-meter class, cryogenically cooled, multi-user facility consisting of a telescope and associated focal plane instruments.
It would be launched on the Space Shuttle and remain attached to the Shuttle as a Spacelab payload during astronomical observations, after which it would be returned to Earth for refurbishment prior to re-flight.
The first flight was expected to occur about 1990, with the succeeding flights anticipated beginning approximately one year later.
However, the Spacelab-2 flight aboard [[STS-51-F]] showed that the Shuttle environment was poorly suited to an onboard infrared telescope due to contamination from the relatively "dirty" vacuum associated with the orbiters.
By September 1983 NASA was considering the "possibility of a long duration [free-flyer] SIRTF mission".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/infrared/index.html |title=Studying the Universe in Infrared |accessdate=2007-12-08 | last=Watanabe | first=Susan |date=2007-11-22 |publisher=NASA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Kwok | first=Johnny | title=Finding a Way: The Spitzer Space Telescope Story | work=Academy Sharing Knowledge | publisher=NASA | url =http://appel.nasa.gov/ask/issues/25/25s_finding.php | date=Fall 2006 | accessdate=2007-12-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070908000438/http://appel.nasa.gov/ask/issues/25/25s_finding.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-08}}</ref>

Spitzer is the only one of the [[Great Observatories]] not launched by the [[Space Shuttle]], which had been originally intended.
However after the 1986 [[STS-51L|Challenger disaster]], the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] [[LH2]]/[[LOX]] upper stage, which would have been required to place it in its final orbit, was banned from Shuttle use.
The mission underwent a series of redesigns during the 1990s, primarily due to budget considerations. This resulted in a much smaller but still fully capable mission which could use the smaller Delta II expendable launch vehicle.

[[File:NASA-SpitzerTelescope-Logo.svg|thumb|Logo]]
One of the most important advances of this redesign was an Earth-trailing orbit.
Cryogenic satellites that require liquid helium (LHe, T ? 4 K) temperatures in near-Earth orbit are typically exposed to a large heat load from the Earth, and consequently entail large usage of LHe coolant, which then tends to dominate the total payload mass and limits mission life.
Placing the satellite in solar orbit far from Earth allowed innovative passive cooling such as the sun shield, against the single remaining major heat source to drastically reduce the total mass of helium needed, resulting in an overall smaller lighter payload, with major cost savings.
This orbit also simplifies telescope pointing, but does require the [[Deep Space Network]] for communications.

The primary instrument package (telescope and cryogenic chamber) was developed by [[Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.]], in [[Boulder, CO]]. The individual instruments were developed jointly by industrial, academic, and government institutions, the principals being Cornell, the University of Arizona, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Ball Aerospace, and Goddard Spaceflight Center. The infrared detectors were developed by Raytheon in Goleta, California. Raytheon used indium antimonide and a doped silicon detector in the creation of the infrared detectors. It is stated that these detectors are 100 times more sensitive than what was once available in the beginning of the project during the 1980s.<ref>[http://investor.raytheon.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=84193&p=irol-newsArticle_Print&ID=483065&highlight= Raytheon Company : Investor Relations : News Release].

* '''IRAC''' ('''I'''nfra'''r'''ed '''A'''rray '''C'''amera), an infrared camera which operates simultaneously on four wavelengths (3.6&nbsp;µm, 4.5&nbsp;µm, 5.8&nbsp;µm and 8&nbsp;µm). Each module uses a 256×256-pixel detector—the short wavelength pair use indium antimonide technology, the long wavelength pair use arsenic-doped silicon impurity band conduction technology.<ref>[http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/irac/ SSC IRAC (Mid IR camera) science users information page], 4 Oct 2009.</ref> The two shorter wavelength bands (3.6&nbsp;µm & 4.5&nbsp;µm) for this instrument remain productive after LHe depletion in the spring of 2009, at the telescope equilibrium temperature of around 30 K, so IRAC continues to operate as the "Spitzer Warm Mission". The principal investigator is [[Giovanni Fazio]] of [[Harvard University]]; the flight hardware was built by [[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].

* '''IRS''' ('''I'''nfra'''r'''ed '''S'''pectrograph), an infrared spectrometer with four sub-modules which operate at the wavelengths 5.3–14&nbsp;µm (low resolution), 10–19.5&nbsp;µm (high resolution), 14–40&nbsp;µm (low resolution), and 19–37&nbsp;µm (high resolution). Each module uses a 128×128-pixel detector—the short wavelength pair use arsenic-doped silicon blocked impurity band technology, the long wavelength pair use antimony-doped silicon blocked impurity band technology.<ref>[http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/irs/ SSC IRS (spectrometer) science users' information page], 4 Oct 2009.</ref> The principal investigator is [[James R. Houck]] of [[Cornell University]]; the flight hardware was built by [[Ball Aerospace]].

* '''MIPS''' ('''M'''ultiband '''I'''maging '''P'''hotometer for '''S'''pitzer), three detector arrays in the far infrared (128 × 128 pixels at 24&nbsp;[[µm]], 32 × 32 pixels at 70&nbsp;µm, 2 × 20 pixels at 160&nbsp;µm). The 24&nbsp;µm detector is identical to one of the IRS short wavelength modules. The 70&nbsp;µm detector uses gallium-doped germanium technology, and the 160&nbsp;µm detector also uses gallium-doped germanium, but with mechanical stress added to each pixel to lower the bandgap and extend sensitivity to this long wavelength.<ref>[http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/mips/ SSC MIPS] (long wavelength 24um, 70um, & 160um) imaging photometer and spectrometer science users' information page, 4 Oct 2009.</ref> The principal investigator is [[George H. Rieke]] of the [[University of Arizona]]; the flight hardware was built by [[Ball Aerospace]].

As an example of data from the different instruments, the nebula [[Henize 206]] was imaged in 2004, allowing comparison of images from each device.

==Results==
[[File:Comets Kick up Dust in Helix Nebula (PIA09178).jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Helix Nebula]]. Blue shows infrared light of 3.6 to 4.5 micrometers; green shows infrared light of 5.8 to 8 micrometers; and red shows infrared light of 24 micrometers.]]
[[File:Andromeda galaxy Ssc2005-20a1.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Andromeda Galaxy]] (M31) taken by Spitzer in infrared, MIPS, 24 [[micrometre|micrometers]] 2004 August 25.]]

The first images taken by SST were designed to show off the abilities of the telescope and showed a glowing stellar nursery; a big swirling, dusty [[galaxy]]; a disc of planet-forming debris; and organic material in the distant universe.  Since then, many monthly press releases have highlighted Spitzer's capabilities, as the NASA and [[ESA]] images do for the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].

As one of its most noteworthy observations, in 2005, SST became the first telescope to directly capture the light from [[extrasolar planet]]s, namely the "hot Jupiters" [[HD 209458b]] and TrES-1.  (It did not resolve that light into actual images though.)<ref>[http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/189-ssc2005-09-NASA-s-Spitzer-Marks-Beginning-of-New-Age-of-Planetary-Science Press Release: NASA's Spitzer Marks Beginning of New Age of Planetary Science].</ref> This was the first time extrasolar planets had actually been visually seen; earlier observations had been indirectly made by drawing conclusions from behaviors of the stars the planets were orbiting. The telescope also discovered in April 2005 that [[Cohen-kuhi Tau/4]] had a planetary disk that was vastly younger and contained less mass than previously theorized, leading to new understandings of how planets are formed.

While some time on the telescope is reserved for participating institutions and crucial projects, astronomers around the world also have the opportunity to submit proposals for observing time.  Important targets include forming stars ([[young stellar object]]s, or YSOs), planets, and other galaxies.  Images are freely available for educational and journalistic purposes.

In 2004, it was reported that Spitzer had spotted a faintly glowing body that may be the youngest star ever seen.  The telescope was trained on a core of gas and dust known as [[L1014]] which had previously appeared completely dark to ground-based observatories and to ISO ([[Infrared Space Observatory]]), a predecessor to Spitzer.  The advanced technology of Spitzer revealed a bright red hot spot in the middle of L1014.

Scientists from the [[University of Texas at Austin]], who discovered the object, believe the hot spot to be an example of early star development, with the young star collecting gas and dust from the cloud around it.  Early speculation about the hot spot was that it might have been the faint light of another core that lies 10 times further from Earth but along the same line of sight as L1014.  Follow-up observation from ground-based near-infrared observatories detected a faint fan-shaped glow in the same location as the object found by Spitzer.  That glow is too feeble to have come from the more distant core, leading to the conclusion that the object is located within L1014. (Young ''et al.'', 2004)

In 2005, astronomers from the [[University of Wisconsin System|University of Wisconsin]] at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Madison]] and [[University of Wisconsin–Whitewater|Whitewater]] determined, on the basis of 400 hours of observation on the Spitzer Space Telescope, that the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] has a more substantial [[barred-spiral galaxy|bar structure]] across its core than previously recognized.

Also in 2005, astronomers [[Alexander Kashlinsky]] and [[John C. Mather|John Mather]] of NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] reported that one of Spitzer's earliest images may have captured the light of the first stars in the universe.  An image of a [[quasar]] in the [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] [[constellation]], intended only to help [[calibrate]] the telescope, was found to contain an infrared glow after the light of known objects was removed.  Kashlinsky and Mather are convinced that the numerous blobs in this glow are the light of stars that formed as early as 100 million years after the [[big bang]], [[red shift]]ed by [[cosmic expansion]].<ref>[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa007&articleID=0009A468-3F5E-1369-BF5E83414B7F0000 Infrared Glow of First Stars Found: Scientific American].</ref>

In March 2006, astronomers reported an 80-light-year-long nebula near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, the [[Double Helix Nebula]], which is, as the name implies, twisted into a double spiral shape. This is thought to be evidence of massive magnetic fields generated by the gas disc orbiting the [[supermassive black hole]] at the galaxy's center, 300 [[light year]]s from the nebula and 25,000 light years from Earth. This nebula was discovered by the Spitzer Space Telescope, and published in the magazine ''Nature'' on March 16, 2006.

In May 2007, astronomers successfully mapped the atmospheric temperature of [[HD 189733 b]], thus obtaining the first map of some kind of an extrasolar planet.

Since September 2006 the telescope participates in a series of surveys called the  [[Gould Belt Survey]], observing the [[Gould Belt|Gould's Belt]] region in multiple wavelengths. The first set of observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope were completed from September 21, 2006 through September 27. Resulting from these observations, the team of astronomers led by Dr. Robert Gutermuth, of the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] reported the discovery of [[Serpens south|Serpens South]], a cluster of 50 young stars in the [[Serpens]] constellation.

Scientists have long wondered how tiny silicate crystals, which need high temperatures to form, have found their way into frozen comets, born in the very cold environment of the Solar System's outer edges. The crystals would have begun as non-crystallized, amorphous silicate particles, part of the mix of gas and dust from which the Solar System developed. This mystery has deepened with the results of the [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] sample return mission, which captured particles from Comet [[Wild 2]]. Many of the Stardust particles were found to have formed at temperatures in excess of 1000 K.

In May 2009, Spitzer researchers from Germany, Hungary and the Netherlands found that amorphous silicate appears to have been transformed into crystalline form by an outburst from a star. They detected the infrared signature of [[forsterite]] silicate crystals on the disk of dust and gas surrounding the star EX Lupi during one of its frequent flare-ups, or outbursts, seen by Spitzer in April 2008. These crystals were not present in Spitzer's previous observations of the star's disk during one of its quiet periods. These crystals appear to have formed by radiative heating of the dust within 0.5 AU of EX Lupi.<ref>[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2009-083 JPL News | Spitzer Catches Star Cooking Up Comet Crystals]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ábrahám ''et al.''|title=''Episodic formation of cometary material in the outburst of a young Sun-like star''|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7244/full/nature08004.html|date=published online May 14, 2009|doi=10.1038/nature08004|bibcode = 2009Natur.459..224A|volume=459|issue=7244|pages=224–226|arxiv = 0906.3161 }}</ref>

In August 2009, the telescope found evidence of a high-speed collision between two burgeoning planets orbiting a young star.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8195467.stm BBC NEWS | Science & Environment | Traces of planet collision found]</ref>

In October 2009, astronomers Anne J. Verbiscer, Michael F. Skrutskie, and Douglas P. Hamilton published findings of the "[[Phoebe ring]]" of [[Saturn]], which was found with the telescope; the ring is a huge, tenuous disc of material extending from 128 to 207 times the radius of Saturn.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Verbiscer|first=Anne|author2=Michael Skrutskie, Douglas Hamilton|title=Saturn's largest ring|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nature08515.pdf|date=published online October 7, 2009|doi=10.1038/nature08515|pmid=19812546|bibcode = 2009Natur.461.1098V|volume=461|issue=7267|pages=1098–100}}</ref>

Spitzer observations, announced in May 2011, indicate that tiny forsterite crystals might be falling down like rain on to the [[protostar]] HOPS-68. The discovery of the forsterite crystals in the outer collapsing cloud of the protostar is surprising, because the crystals form at lava-like high temperatures, yet they are found in the molecular cloud where the temperatures are about minus 170 degrees Celsius. This led the team of astronomers to speculate that the [[bipolar outflow]] from the young star may be transporting the forsterite crystals from near the star's surface to the chilly outer cloud.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/news/spitzer20110526_prt.htm NASA Mission News | Spitzer Sees Crystal Rain in Infant Star Outer Clouds]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Poteet, C.

In January 2012, it was reported that further analysis of the Spitzer observations of Ex Lupi can be understood if the forsterite crystalline dust was moving away from the protostar at a remarkable average speed of 38 ''kilometres per second''. It would appear that such high speeds can only arise if the dust grains had been ejected by a bipolar outflow close to the star.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Juhász, A., ''et al.''|title=''The 2008 Outburst of EX Lup—Silicate Crystals in Motion''|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...744..118J|date=published online January, 2012|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/744/2/118|bibcode = 2012ApJ...744..118J|volume=744|issue=2| page= 118|arxiv = 1110.3754 }}</ref> Such observations are consistent with an astrophysical theory, developed in the early 1990s, where it was suggested that bipolar outflows garden or transform the disks of gas and dust that surround protostars by continually ejecting reprocessed, highly heated material from the inner disk, adjacent to the protostar, to regions of the accretion disk further away from the protostar.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Liffman K. and Brown M. |title=The motion and size sorting of particles ejected from a protostellar accretion disk |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995Icar..116..275L |date=published online October, 1995|doi=10.1006/icar.1995.1126|bibcode = 1995Icar..116..275L|volume=116|issue=2| pages= 275–290}}</ref>

===GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL surveys===
GLIMPSE, the Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire, is a survey spanning 300° of the inner Milky Way galaxy.

'''Gary Kleck''' (born March 2, 1951) is a [[criminology|criminologist]] and is the David J. Bordua Professor of Criminology at [[Florida State University]].

==Criminology==
Kleck has done numerous studies of the effects of guns on death and injury in crimes,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kleck |first=Gary |last2=McElrath |first2=Karen |date= |year=1988 |title=The effects of weaponry on human violence |url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2579469 |journal=Social Forces |publisher=Oxford University Press |publication-date=March 1991 |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=669–692 |doi= |jstor= |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref> on suicides,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kleck |first=Gary |year=1988 |title=Miscounting suicides |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1943-278X.1988.tb00158.x/full |journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior |publisher= |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=219–236 |doi= 10.1111/j.1943-278X.1988.tb00158.x|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref> and gun accidents,<ref>Chapter 7, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America.

In addition to his work on guns and violence, Kleck has done research concluding that increasing levels of punishment will not increase the deterrent effects of punishment,<ref>[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0011-1348.2005.00019.x/abstract Kleck, Sever, Li and Gertz, "The missing link in general deterrence research."] Criminology 43(3):623-660.</ref> and that capital punishment does not have any measurable effect on homicide rates.<ref>Kleck, "Capital punishment, gun ownership, and homicide."  American Journal of Sociology 84(4):882-910.</ref>

===Defensive gun use research and debate===
{{Main|Defensive gun use}}
Kleck conducted a national survey in 1994 (the National Self-Defense Survey) and, extrapolating from the 5,000 households surveyed, estimated that in 1993 there were approximately 2.5 million incidents of defensive gun use (DGU - the use of guns for [[self-protection]]), compared to about 0.5 million gun crimes as estimated by the National Crime Victimization Survey.<ref>[http://www.guncite.com/gcdgklec.html Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz, "Armed Resistance to Crime: The Prevalence and Nature of Self-Defense with a Gun"], 86 Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 1, 1995.</ref>

[[David Hemenway]] at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] Injury Control Research Center, said that Kleck's estimates are difficult to reconcile with comparable crime statistics, are subject to a high degree of sampling error, and that "because of differences in coverage and potential response errors, what exactly these surveys measure remains uncertain; mere repetition does not eliminate bias."<ref name="Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review">{{cite book|last=National Research Council|title=Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review|year=2004|publisher=The National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-309-09124-1|pages=111–113|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10881&page=112}}</ref> Kleck and Gertz responded to this criticism saying: "It is obvious to us that David Hemenway had no intention of producing a balanced, intellectually serious assessment of our estimates of defensive gun use (DGU). Instead, his critique serves the narrow political purpose of 'getting the estimate down,' for the sake of advancing the gun control cause." <ref>http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6937&context=jclc Northwestern University Law School</ref>

Kleck asserts errors in his critics' claims that his survey's estimates of defensive gun uses linked with specific crime types, or that involved a wounding of the offender, are implausibly large compared to estimates of the total numbers of such crimes. The total number of nonfatal gunshot woundings, whether medically treated or not, is unknown, and no meaningful estimates can be derived from his survey regarding defensive gun uses linked with specific crime types, or that involved wounding the offender, because the sample sizes are too small. The fact that some crime-specific estimates derived from the Kleck survey are implausibly large is at least partly a reflection of the small samples on which they are based - no more than 196 cases. Kleck states that his estimate of total defensive gun uses was based on nearly 5,000 cases. Thus, he argues, the implausible character of some estimates of small ''subsets'' of defensive gun uses is not a valid criticism of whether estimates of the ''total'' number of defensive gun uses are implausible or too high.<ref name="Kleck, G 2001">Kleck, G. and D. Kates (2001), Armed: New Perspectives on Gun Control, Chapter 6.  N.Y.: Prometheus</ref>

==Impact==
In 1993, Kleck won the [[Michael J. Hindelang Award]] from the [[American Society of Criminology]] for his book ''[[Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America]]'' (Aldine de Gruyter, 1991).<ref>[http://www.asc41.com/awards/awardWinners.html#carte American Society of Criminology, Michael J. Hindelang Awards, Books, 1993 Gary Kleck, "Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America"]</ref> He has testified before Congress and state legislatures on gun control proposals.  His research was cited in the Supreme Court's landmark ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'' decision, which struck down the D.C. handgun ban and held that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms.<ref>[http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf Supreme Court of the United States, District of Columbia v. Heller, No. 07-290.] Decided June 26, 2008. Kleck's research referenced on (PDF) pages 134, 135, 138, and 144.</ref>

'''''Survivor: Pearl Islands''''' (also broadcast as '''''Survivor: Pearl Islands — Panama''''') is the seventh season of the American [[CBS]] competitive [[reality television]] series ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]''. It was filmed from June 23, 2003 through July 31, 2003 and premiered on September 18, 2003. The season was filmed on the [[Pearl Islands]], off the coast of [[Panama]], and had a [[Piracy|pirate culture]] theme. Hosted by [[Jeff Probst]], it consisted of the usual 39 days of gameplay with 16 competitors.

The two original tribes were Drake and Morgan, named for [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] and [[Henry Morgan]], respectively. With ten contestants remaining, the two were merged into the Balboa tribe, named after an injured snake found by contestant [[Rupert Boneham]]. Office clerk [[Sandra Diaz-Twine]] defeated [[Scout Leader|scoutmaster]] Lillian Morris in a 6–1 jury vote.

The complete season was released on [[DVD]] on February 7, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsstore.com/survivor-season-7-pearl-islands-dvd/detail.php?p=267260|title=Survivor Season 7: Pearl Islands DVD|work=[[CBS]]|accessdate=March 26, 2014}}</ref>

===Future appearances===
[[Rupert Boneham]] returned to the Pearl Islands for ''[[Survivor: All-Stars]]'', placing 4th. [[Jonny Fairplay|Jon "Jonny Fairplay" Dalton]] returned for ''[[Survivor: Micronesia]]'' where he was the first person voted out, placing 20th. In 2009, Boneham appeared as a challenge reward on the third Israeli season of ''[[Survivor (Israel)|Survivor]]'', ''[[Survivor 10: Philippine Islands]]''. Boneham and [[Sandra Diaz-Twine]] returned to the game on ''[[Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains]]'', with Boneham placing 6th and Diaz-Twine again winning the season, becoming the first two-time winner of ''Survivor''. Boneham would later return for his fourth appearance on the show, competing in ''[[Survivor: Blood vs. Water]]'', this time along with his wife, Laura, where he placed 20th.

==Season summary==
The start of the game was announced as a surprise to the contestants, most of whom believed that they were on their way to a photoshoot. After being divided into two tribes of eight, Morgan and Drake, they were given some money and sent to a small village to barter and buy supplies for their camps in lieu of being given them as in seasons past. Drake, thanks to Sandra's ability to speak Spanish and Rupert stealing the other tribe's abandoned shoes to barter, was able to acquire better supplies than Morgan, and thus went on an early winning streak, dwindling Morgan to five members.

Despite Drake's winning streak, member Burton conspired to throw an immunity challenge to eliminate a weaker player. The reluctant Drake tribe threw the challenge, but Burton was voted off for his cunning. This resulted in a major shift: Morgan, led by Andrew, experienced a renewal, and Drake began to splinter due to fighting between de facto leader Rupert and the conniving Jon. Morgan's newfound momentum led them to win the next two immunity challenges, leaving both tribes with five players each. 

Upon arrival at their next challenge, the tribes were faced with the "Outcast" twist, with the six eliminated players competing against the remaining players for a chance to return to the game. The Outcasts beat both Morgan and Drake in the challenge, forcing them both to go to tribal council and resulting in two of the Outcasts returning to the game. Burton and former Morgan castaway Lillian returned to the game, and joined the eight other castaways in forming the merged Balboa tribe. While Burton made up with his former tribe, Lillian's return was resented by the Morgan members. Lillian enacted revenge against her former tribemates, siding with the Drake alliance to eliminate Andrew.

While the Drake alliance had the upper hand, Jon, Burton, and Lillian decided that Rupert, as the strongest member of the Drake alliance, was an immunity threat, and worked with the remaining Morgan members to blindside him from the game. The three navigated between the Drake and Morgan factions to take out members of both sides, until they were the dominant alliance with only five players remaining.  Lillian was swayed by Darrah and Sandra to break up the duo of Jon and Burton, and Burton was voted out for a second time. In another twist, the first five jurors were able to compete for immunity with four players remaining. They subsequently won the competition, and challenge threat Darrah was eliminated. 

In the final immunity challenge, Lillian beat Jon and Sandra to secure a space in the final tribal council. Knowing that she would likely lose for having already been voted out of the game, she chose to take Sandra to the end for she felt Sandra deserved the victory more than Jon. The jury awarded Sandra the title of Sole Survivor by a vote of 6-1.

{{note|Immunity ep 8|4}} Burton and Lillian were given automatic [[Immunity (reality television)|immunity]] for the next Tribal Council as a reward for having been voted back into the game by the Outcasts.

The sixteen contestants arrived at the Pearl Islands dressed in their street clothes. The contestants were shocked when they were told that they would be participating in the clothes on their backs, most believing they were getting publicity shots prior to the game. Host Jeff Probst threw the contestants' sneakers overboard, and they were given a sack of [[Panamanian balboa|Panamanian currency]]. The two tribes, Morgan and Drake, were sent to buy surviving essentials at a local village. When they reached the village, Morgan was scrambling to get supplies, while Drake was more successful, as Sandra was able to speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] with the locals. Morgan had left their shoes unattended, so Rupert took the opportunity to steal their shoes so he could buy goods for his tribe. Meanwhile, Morgan member Osten traded all of his clothing, except for his [[boxer shorts|boxers]] to buy goods for his tribe. After they were finished buying goods, the tribes got on their [[marine vessel]]s and traveled to their respective islands. On Night 1, Morgan had trouble sleeping, as rocks were falling from above, and crabs were biting the members. Meanwhile, Drake decided to celebrate their new home by drinking Panamanian wine, which they had bought at the village. Jon became incredibly drunk, which annoyed his tribemates. When morning came, the dehydrated Morgan tribe was relieved to find directions to a freshwater [[water well|well]] on their map. At the well, Lillian and Ryan S. bonded while filling their [[Canteen (bottle)|canteen]]s. 
*'''Immunity challenge:''' Each tribe must transport a [[cannon]] through the jungle along a course that runs from one side of the island to the other. Along the course, the castaways must avoid several obstacles. The first tribe to bring their cannon to the finish line wins immunity.
At the immunity challenge, Osten took off his boxers, which had been loose due to the weight he had lost. Other male members of Morgan also stripped naked. Morgan had a lead, however just before the finish line, their cannon got stuck in the sand, causing Drake to pull ahead and win the challenge. After they had lost, the Morgan tribe was upset, but Andrew tried to cheer his tribe up by giving them a pep talk. Nicole wanted to oust Tijuana, but when Tijuana heard of Nicole's plan, she decided she couldn't trust her. In the end, the vote went against Nicole.

The Morgan tribe had trouble sleeping as the cold nights had taken their toll on the contestants. Over at Drake, Rupert caught fish for his tribe. After receiving Tree Mail about the upcoming reward challenge, Ryan S. felt that he was under a lot of pressure to do well in the challenge. 
*'''Reward challenge:''' Each tribe has a designated treasure chest underwater. Each player must dive into the ocean to retrieve a pre-placed item and put it into their tribe's treasure chest. Once all the items are in the chest, the contestants, as a tribe, must grab the chest and swim it to the shore. First tribe to bring their chest to the shore wins reward. For the reward, both tribes were given a shovel. Probst explained that there is an actual treasure buried at each camp. The winning tribe would be given the first of three pieces to a map that will help them find the treasure. In addition, the winning tribe would have to send one member to the losing tribe's camp to take an item of their choosing back to their camp. 
As Ryan S. started swimming during the challenge, he had trouble with his mask as well as staying underwater giving Drake an early lead. Morgan never recovered, giving Drake their second win in a row. In a twist, the winning tribe, Drake, had to send one member to the Morgan camp to take one of their items back with them. Drake sent Sandra, who chose to take Morgan's tarp. Sandra got mad when the Morgan tribe wouldn't help her take the tarp down, so she proceeded to take apart their shelter piece by piece. While trying to rebuild their shelter, Osten announced that he was considering quitting the game, which upset Andrew. Meanwhile, at Drake, Shawn went fishing and lost the head of his tribe's fishing [[spear]], which upset Rupert. Rupert searched underwater for the lost head, and wound up finding it. 
*'''Immunity challenge:''' Each tribe would capture three members of the opposing tribe. The other castaways must try to free their captured tribemates, and then overcome a series of obstacles in order to raise their flag. First tribe to raise their flag wins immunity.
Once again, Morgan lost the immunity challenge. Osten surprised his tribemates by asking to be voted off, which disappointed Tijuana. In the end, Osten did not get his wish, as the vote went against the tribe's weakest link, Ryan S.

The Morgan tribe quietly thought about their misfortunes. The Drake tribe decided to look for their buried treasure. They had guessed that it would be along the shoreline, therefore it would only be accessible during the low [[tide]]. However, the Drake tribe did not succeed in finding the treasure, so they decided to take a break and check another time.
*'''Reward challenge:''' Each tribe was given two boats and a fisherman's [[grappling hook]]. They must try to sink both of the opposite tribe's boats. The hooks could be used to remove plugs that covered holes along the sides of each boat. The last tribe still floating wins [[blanket]]s, [[mattress]]es, [[pillow]]s, and a piece of the map to the buried treasure.
Jon wanted Sandra to sit out at the reward challenge, as he thought she was a weak swimmer, which angered Sandra. Once again, Drake ended up winning the reward challenge, which left Morgan distraught. The next morning, Lillian woke up early to go on a fishing trip and lost the tribe's fishing hook. Meanwhile, Drake decided not to look for the treasure, so they discussed what item they should take from the Morgan camp. They decided they should take Morgan's water pot. Christa was sent to the Morgan camp to take the pot. When Christa arrived at Morgan's camp, the Morgan tribe asked many questions about Drake. Christa tried not to reveal too much about her tribe, which she found difficult. 
*'''Immunity challenge:''' The strongest member of each tribe must suspend the smallest member above the ocean using a [[rope]]-and-[[pulley]] system. The first person to drop the rope and their suspended tribemate would lose immunity.
At the immunity challenge, it came down to Morgan's Osten, and Drake's Rupert. Probst decided to add difficulty to the challenge by forcing Osten and Rupert to stand, and then he forbade them to rest the rope on the wooden braces in front of them. Osten couldn't hold the rope any longer, giving Drake immunity for the third consecutive time. At Morgan, Andrew decided that Lillian was the least valuable, and that she should be the next one to go. Andrew spoke with Lillian to let her know that she was on the chopping block. Lillian became the third person voted out.

The Morgan tribe was at risk of losing their shelter due to the rising tide, and built a breaker wall out of sand to try to protect it. Meanwhile, having never voted anyone off, there was some tension at Drake due to clashing personalities. 
*'''Reward challenge:''' Each tribe must retrieve sixteen puzzle pieces; eight buried in the sand and eight hidden out at sea. The tribes must collect all sixteen pieces in order to solve a puzzle. First tribe to solve their giant puzzle wins a [[sewing]] kit and a piece of the map to the buried treasure.
At the reward challenge, Morgan fell behind as Osten had trouble swimming, giving Drake a lead. However Drake member Trish had trouble digging out one of Drake's pieces, allowing Morgan to make a comeback. However, Drake solved their puzzle just before Morgan could, giving Drake yet another win, and the final piece to their treasure map. With all three pieces, Drake had a good idea where to look for the treasure. They got somewhat confused when they had to find a spot on the map called "Devil's Fork". Drake was overcome with joy when Shawn hit the treasure chest with the shovel. The tribe gathered to see what the chest contained. Inside, there were [[goblet]]s, [[candle]]s, candleholders, canned foods, [[sugar]], [[honey]], blankets, [[coffee]] beans, and [[chocolate]]. Over at Morgan, Andrew and Ryan O. went to the other side of the island to fish, however they came back with no fish. The Drake tribe sent Trish to the Morgan camp, who Morgan greeted. Trish decided to take Morgan's [[lantern]]. Over at Drake, Burton proposed to Rupert that they throw the next immunity challenge to get rid of one of the weaker women, to which Rupert agreed.
*'''Immunity challenge:''' Each castaway must cross a human [[checkerboard]] over water. When a castaway is face-to-face with an opposing tribe member, a hand-to-hand clash would occur. Whichever castaway loses balance first will have to start over. First tribe to get all of their members across wins immunity. In addition, the winning tribe will have the right to kidnap a member of the opposing tribe.
At the immunity challenge, Drake sat out two of their strongest players, Burton and Rupert, to increase the chances of Morgan winning the challenge. Morgan won their first challenge, sending Drake to Tribal Council for the first time. After Morgan won, Probst announced that they had the right to kidnap one member of Drake; they chose Rupert. At Drake, many alliances scrambled, with Jon as a swing vote. In the end, the vote went against Burton, who was blindsided by a secret alliance that included his closest friend, Shawn.

With Rupert still at their camp, the Morgan tribe moved their shelter to avoid the rising tide. Meanwhile, Drake decided to save their last can of [[spam (food)|spam]] for Rupert upon his return. Some Drake members were worried that Rupert may have given too much information to the Morgan tribe. 
*'''Reward challenge:''' Each tribe must retrieve rungs for a [[ladder]] from the water. In addition, they must retrieve a golden idol hidden in an old Spanish well in the jungle. First tribe to assemble their ladder and place the golden idol at the top of their platform wins a portable [[shower]], a pot for boiling water, two [[jerrycan]]s, rain jackets, sponges, [[shampoo]] and conditioner.
At the reward challenge, Drake fell behind as they lost control of their boat due to Jon's faulty navigating. Morgan found their golden idol and quickly assembled their ladder, winning their first reward challenge. After Morgan won, Rupert was offered a chance to return to the Morgan camp to enjoy a shower, however Rupert decided to return to his Drake camp. Winning the challenge, Morgan had to send one member to the Drake camp to take one item. They chose Andrew, who took a bag of [[rice]] from Drake. When Drake got Tree Mail inviting them to an immunity challenge that likely involved eating exotic seafood, they decided to strategize. Michelle claimed to have a high tolerance for eating undesirable foods, so Drake decided to use her as a [[decoy]]. Their plan was that Michelle would pretend to have trouble downing the food in order to fool Morgan into competing with her in the event of a tiebreaker. 
*'''Immunity challenge:''' Each castaway must spin a wheel, which will determine which two ingredients would be blended together for them to drink. The ingredients were red [[shellfish]], [[sardine]]s, [[razor clam]]s, bleeding clams, sea water, [[squid]], mango, rock [[oysters]], [[conch]], [[octopus]], [[coconut juice]], and an ingredient of Jeff's choice. The first person unable to keep their concoction down will lose immunity for their whole tribe.
The immunity challenge initially resulted in a tie, with all contestants managing to swallow the concoctions. However, when it was time for Morgan to choose a Drake member, they chose Sandra and not Michelle. Sandra was able to drink her concoction, however she had trouble swallowing it, allowing Morgan's Darrah to win immunity for her tribe. Sandra and Michelle both felt vulnerable. Jon was upset at Michelle for not pretending to have trouble drinking the concoction, and she was ultimately unanimously eliminated.

The Drake tribe was upset when Balboa, a baby snake Rupert found, was found dead. A local [[pelican]], nicknamed "Pelican Pete," came to the Morgan camp; Osten feared the pelican and threatened it with a [[machete]], amusing his tribemates. After Rupert suggested that they raise the floor of the Drake shelter, the Drake tribe got to work. Jon and Sandra were annoyed at Shawn due to his complaining. 
*'''Reward challenge:''' Each tribe must fire a [[cannon]] and try to hit designated targets. First tribe to hit all of their designated targets wins a grill, [[spice]]s, [[lobster]]s, and [[steak]]. Should Morgan win, they would receive their second piece of the map to their treasure.
At the reward challenge, it was a very close competition. It came down to Andrew from Morgan and Christa from Drake. Andrew missed his target, allowing Christa to hit her target. Christa was successful, winning reward for Drake. The Drake barbecued their steaks, and enjoyed their feast. Jon was sent to the Morgan camp to take an item. Jon took their water pot and enjoyed shampoo. While at Morgan, Jon revealed that Drake had thrown one of the immunity challenges, which irritated Andrew. 
*'''Immunity challenge:''' Tribe members would hold a pole on their shoulders behind their neck. Periodically, weight would be added to the poles. The castaways would decide which poles the weight would added on for the opposing tribe. Last tribe standing wins immunity.
At the immunity challenge, Morgan chose to add all of the weight to Rupert's pole, while Drake decided to spread the weight evenly among the Morgan tribe. Morgan's strategy worked, as Rupert could not hold the weight. In the end, Christa couldn't compete against that last two Morgan men left, giving Morgan yet another immunity win. After losing immunity, Trish wanted to oust Rupert as she saw him as a threat. Her alliance needed Shawn to complete the plan. But Christa caught the exchange and told Rupert about the plan started a secret alliance of their own. In the end, Shawn flipped and Trish's plan backfired, as she was voted off.

While returning to camp from Tribal Council, Rupert was enraged at Jon as Rupert had suspected that Jon had voted for him. Jon admitted to voting for Rupert, and the two apologized for the good of their tribe. Over at Morgan, the rainy weather prevented the hungry tribe members from fishing. They were eating their diminishing supply of rice and beans. When the contestants arrived at the challenge, they were shocked to see the castaways they had previously voted off return as a ghost tribe, The Outcasts. The immunity challenge would be between three tribes, the first one in ''Survivor'' history. 
*'''Immunity challenge:''' Each castaway except for one designated "rescuer" from each tribe will be prisoners in a set of cages. The rescuer must free all of their tribemates. First tribe to free all of their prisoners and cross the finish line with their flag wins.
**'''Additional stipulation:''' Drake and Morgan are competing against the Outcasts, rather than each other. Any tribe that finishes behind the Outcasts must go to Tribal Council and vote out a member. The Outcasts will then hold a special Tribal Council in which they will vote members back into the game, enough to replace each person that just left. Those returning will be given automatic immunity for the next Tribal Council. If the Outcasts finish last, Drake and Morgan will be safe, and all six Outcasts leave the game permanently.
Morgan fell behind in the challenge as Drake took the lead, with The Outcasts not far behind. In the end, The Outcasts managed to unlock the last door, cross the finish line, and win the challenge, sending both Morgan and Drake to Tribal Council. After the challenge, Morgan was upset that they would have to let one of The Outcasts back into their tribe. Osten asked his tribemates to vote him off. Over at Drake, Jon and Shawn were both on the chopping block. The tribe decided to let the two make their case as to why they should stay. Shawn spoke of trust, while Jon spoke of work ethic. In the end, work ethic proved to be more important as Shawn was voted out. Soon after, at the Morgan Tribal Council, Osten decided to take the opportunity to quit the game. For the first time, voting was done verbally and was unanimous, as Osten's torch was snuffed and put to rest on the ground for the remainder of the season.

The Outcasts, a tribe consisting of the first six departed castaways, had to vote two people back into the game. At The Outcasts' Tribal Council, each Outcast made their plea as to why they should be voted back into the game. It was decided, in a 3-3-2-2-1-1 vote, that Burton and Lillian would return to represent the Outcasts. After randomly selecting who would go to which tribe, Burton returned to Drake and Lillian returned to Morgan. When Burton returned to Drake, his tribe apologized, and were happy to have him back. When Lillian returned to Morgan, she was welcomed by her old tribe, however she wasn't sure if she could trust them, especially Andrew, who was still visibly resentful toward her. Over at Drake, Burton, Christa and Rupert made an alliance to vote out Jon at their next Tribal Council. They thought that Jon's lack of honesty could work against them once the tribes merge. When the two tribes arrived at what they thought would be a reward challenge, Probst announced that the tribes were merging and it was decided that Drake's camp would be better to live in. 
*'''Immunity challenge:''' Each castaway must pull themselves along a rope under a floating wood platform without coming up for air. The challenge ran in two heats. The two winners of each heat would compete against each other in the final heat. The winner of the final heat wins individual immunity.
After the announcement of the merge, the first individual immunity challenge took place, in which Burton won narrowly over Rupert. When the castaways arrived at camp, they named the merged tribe "Balboa" after Rupert's pet snake. The hungry castaways then saw a merge feast ready for them. Having been voted out of Morgan and then returned, Lillian was the potential swing vote for the next Tribal Council. At Tribal Council, Burton decided to give the Immunity Necklace to Rupert, since he was already immune due to the Outcast twist. In the end, Lillian joined the former Drake members to pay revenge to Andrew, who was eliminated.

As morning came, Lillian got up early and celebrated her renewed life in the game by being the first to get to work. After his strongest ally was ousted, Ryan O. feared that he was on the chopping block. While fishing, Ryan O. tried to align himself with Burton to oust former Drake members Christa, Rupert, and Sandra. When Burton returned from fishing, he returned with an [[electric ray]], although he still wanted to cook it and enjoy the meat. 
*'''Reward challenge:''' The challenge was done in three heats. Each castaway would use a [[slingshot]] to fire marbles at targets. Whenever a target is hit, it will ignite a flame that would climb to the next target. The first person from each heat to hit their three targets in ascending order would move on to the final round. The first person in the final round to hit their three targets wins [[pancakes]] and [[maple syrup]], [[bacon]] and [[egg (food)|egg]]s, sweet rolls, orange juice to enjoyed in a remote, attractive location.
At the Reward challenge, Ryan O. won the first heat, Rupert won the second, and Lillian won the third. Rupert won the final round. Rupert decided to give his reward to Burton, who took Lillian along with him. While Burton and Lil were having breakfast, Burton brought up a plan to eliminate Rupert as soon as possible. The plan was for Lillian to eliminate Rupert by creating an alliance with Darrah and Tijuana, while lying to Christa and Rupert. At camp, Sandra and Christa contemplated eliminating Rupert and Burton. 
*'''Immunity challenge:''' The immunity challenge involved a trivia test based on local [[pirate]] [[Folklore|lore]]. Each castaway who answers correctly would get to place coconuts in the bins of those who answered incorrectly. When a castaway receives five coconuts, they are out of the challenge. Last castaway standing wins immunity.
At the immunity challenge, Ryan O. was quickly eliminated. The challenge's final two were Rupert and Christa. Rupert answered the final question correctly and placed the fifth coconut into Christa's bin, winning immunity. Knowing that he could be next to go, Ryan O. tried to create alliances with Burton, then Tijuana and Darrah. Rupert was worried that Ryan O. could be successful. In the end, Rupert's fears were for naught as Ryan O. was unanimously sent to the jury.

Jon was annoyed at the arrogance from the Christa, Rupert, and Sandra alliance. Jon and Burton made a plan to break that alliance. They planned to align with Darrah and Tijuana. While Rupert was fishing and Christa and Sandra were getting lemons, Jon and Burton made efforts to align with Darrah and Tijuana. The two women agreed to align with Jon and Burton.
*'''Reward challenge:''' The challenge took place at the wreck of an old Spanish [[galleon]]. The castaways must team up in pairs to complete two rounds. Each pair must race up a [[cargo net]], and then swing on a rope to the other side of the ship. Then they must climb up to a [[crow]]'s nest and slide down a large canvas sail. The winning pairs would then play against each other, but to make it more difficult, they must carry bags of puzzle pieces that they must assemble at the end of the course. The pair to win the final round wins a trip on a luxury [[catamaran]] with [[pizza]] and [[beer]].
At the reward challenge, it was a tight race between the team of Burton and Lillian and the team of Christa and Darrah. Darrah missed the rope that Christa tossed, allowing Burton and Lillian to advance to the final round. Meanwhile, over at the other round, Rupert and Jon had a lead over Tijuana and Sandra. In the end, Rupert and Jon won their round. The final round was between the team of Burton and Lillian and the team of Rupert and Jon. It was a tight race, however Burton and Lillian finished the puzzle first, winning reward. Burton decided to give his reward to Jon, while Lillian kept hers. Back at camp, Rupert's trust for Burton was dwindling after Burton chose to give his reward to Jon over Rupert. While Jon and Lillian enjoyed their reward, Jon told Lillian how she could convince Rupert, Christa and Sandra that she was on their side, when in reality, she's actually aligned with Burton, Darrah, Jon and Tijuana. When Lillian and Jon returned to camp, Rupert tried to align with Lillian. Lillian managed to convince Rupert that she was loyal to his alliance, when in reality she was aligned with Burton, Darrah, Jon and Tijuana. 
*'''Immunity challenge:''' The castaways must use a [[blowgun]]. Each castaway was designated an area on a large target. The castaways must try to use their blowgun to knock out the other player's darts into the other castaways areas. Last player left in the challenge wins immunity.
At the immunity challenge, Rupert had an early lead. However, in the end, it came down to Burton, Jon and Lillian. Burton ended up winning immunity. Back at camp, the alliance of Burton, Darrah, Jon, Lillian, and Tijuana pretended that Darrah was going to be next one to go, however Rupert didn't trust them fully. Still convinced that Lillian was on his side, Rupert thought that there would be a tie. At Tribal Council, Rupert was blindsided when Lillian voted against him and Sandra voted for Jon. (Sandra's vote ensured the result, even if Lillian had remained true.) He was voted off and became the second member of the jury.

After Rupert was voted out, Sandra was furious at Jon for breaking their alliance. After Sandra's yelling, the Balboa tribe members noticed that someone had thrown away a bucket of fish Rupert had caught. Christa was blamed for it, however Sandra admitted in an interview that she had spilled the fish. At the reward challenge, the castaways were reunited with their loved ones. Before the challenge started, Jon was saddened to hear from his best friend Dan that his grandmother had died. 
*'''Reward challenge:''' Probst brought the castaways' loved ones to the challenge. The castaways would ask questions about themselves. Both the castaways and their loved ones would write down an answer. When the two answers matched, the castaway would get to choose which loved one to take a step towards walking off a plank, falling into the ocean. The last loved one left gets to stay at the Balboa camp for a day.
When the challenge started, Sandra chose Dan to take a step on the plank. Jon was upset, as he wanted to hear the details about his grandmother's death. Sandra's husband was the first loved one sent into the ocean, followed by Christa's fiancé, Darrah's boyfriend, Burton's mother, then Tijuana's friend. With Lillian's husband and Jon's friend left, Burton was the one who decided which one would jump off the plank. Feeling sorry for Jon, Burton sent Lillian's husband off the plank. When Jon won reward, he learned that him and his friend would share the camp on their own, with the other castaways banished to a separate island (formerly the Morgan tribe's island) without their loved ones. While Jon and his friend Dan were alone at the Balboa camp, the two of them revealed that the story about Jon's grandmother's death was preplanned and that she was actually still alive. Jon and Dan celebrated alone. When the rest of Balboa returned, Sandra and Christa attempted to get Tijuana to break her alliance with Burton, Jon, and Lillian. During the night, as Burton and Jon went away from camp to talk about strategy, Sandra called Tijuana to come with her and listen to Burton and Jon's strategic talk. Sandra did this to ensure there was no doubt about the alliance between Burton, Jon, and Lillian. Sandra and Tijuana returned before Jon and Burton, and Tijuana told Darrah what she heard. 
*'''Immunity challenge:''' Each castaway has a board with three words on it broken up by letters "SURVIVOR PEARL ISLANDS". The castaways must use the letters to form twenty new words. Words must be in English and must be spelled correctly. Plurals, proper names, acronyms and names of cities and states are not allowed. "SURVIVOR", "PEARL" and "ISLANDS" are not allowed as well. If a castaway broke any of these rules, the castaway would be eliminated from the challenge. First player to form twenty words spelled correctly wins immunity.
At the start of the immunity challenge, the castaways had trouble forming words that are spelled correctly. Christa, Tijuana, and Jon were all eliminated for misspelling(s) when Jeff checked their answers. Later, Burton initially won immunity, however as the castaways were heading back to camp, Probst called them back, announcing that he had failed to notice a misspelled word on his board. Burton spelled "LIASON", but it was missing an "I" and should be spelled "LIAISON". Burton was stripped of immunity, and the challenge was restarted because some of the castaways looked at other people's boards and possibly began discussing words with each other. As a result, an alternate challenge was given with Darrah, Lillian, and Sandra competing against each other, since they weren't eliminated from the challenge. After one minute of writing four or more letter words from the phrase, "OUTWIT OUTPLAY OUTLAST", Darrah ended up winning immunity with 14 to Lillian's 10 and Sandra's 12. After Darrah won immunity, Jon and Burton were worried that they were on the chopping block as the women outnumbered the men. Knowing that women of the former Morgan tribe wanted Burton out, Jon tried to create an alliance with Sandra and Christa, however Sandra said she didn't trust Jon. In the end, Jon ended up convincing the former Drake tribe and Lillian to vote out Tijuana and she became the third member of the jury.

After returning from Tribal Council in which Tijuana was voted out, Sandra and Christa had second thoughts about their alliance with Jon. They tried to break their alliance with him by attempting to align with Darrah. 
*'''Reward challenge:''' The castaways would compete in teams of three. Beginning on a platform in the water, one team member would cross a balance beam, then dive underwater to retrieve paddles tied to floating boxes. The other two must then untie three barrels from an underwater cable and move on to a ladder, where the last paddle is tied. All three team members would then jump into the water to retrieve their designated boat and then they would race the boat to the first floating platform. First team to touch the platform wins a night at a [[spa]] where the team would enjoy a shower and a massage followed by dinner.
The team of Darrah, Jon, and Lillian won the reward challenge. After returning from the reward, Jon and Burton discussed voting out Christa next due to her being aligned with Rupert previously.
*'''Immunity challenge:''' Each castaway would use old [[musket]]s to shoot at designated targets covered with [[kerosene]]. First castaway to set all three of their targets ablaze wins immunity.
At the immunity challenge, Christa took an early lead even though she had no experience of using guns, however Darrah quickly tied with Christa when she hit two of her targets. Christa just missed her final target, allowing Darrah to hit her final target and win immunity for the second time in a row. After the immunity challenge, Lillian and Christa were both told that the other was going home. In the end, Christa was voted out and became the fourth member of the jury.

After voting out Christa, Jon and Burton decided they were going to betray Darrah for being an immunity threat, while Sandra tried to plot revenge after losing her last ally.
*'''Reward challenge:''' Each castaway must untie themselves from a post, find a key buried in the sand, escape from a jail cell, fire a [[slingshot]] at plates, and then solve a [[puzzle]]. First castaway to complete the challenge wins a [[GMC Envoy]] along with a night in [[Panama City]] where the winner and an invitee would camp out in ruins and enjoy a feast.
Burton won the reward challenge and took Jon with him on the trip. Back at camp, the girls talked about Burton and Jon's schemes. Lillian told Darrah that Jon and Burton wanted to betray her for being a physical threat, so Lillian, Darrah, and Sandra all decided to form an all female final three alliance. The women decided to vote off Burton, or Jon if Burton wins immunity. The next day, Lillian expressed doubt over the plan to vote Burton or Jon out, and afraid that they would berate her for their betrayal. Sandra decided to feign sadness to stop the guys from realizing there was a plot against them. When Burton and Jon returned to camp, only Darrah and Lillian were there to welcome her. Darrah and Lillian told the guys that Sandra was ready to leave and didn't strategize to vote either of them out. Burton was sceptical about it and asked Lillian questions about if it was true, while Jon approached Sandra and then decided to make a deal that it won't be her next to go home and sticking with the plan to vote off Darrah at the next tribal council by making Sandra swear on her kids. In reality, Sandra mouthed to herself that she swore on her kids to get rid of Jon and Burton. 
*'''Immunity challenge:''' Each castaway must use a canteen to pour water in a tube that will lift a key to open a lock. The lock releases a rope, allowing the castaway to lower a plank into the water. First castaway to lower five planks and walk them wins immunity.
Darrah won immunity for the third consecutive time. Jon realized that Lillian was being withdrawn and questioned her loyalty. Jon told Burton that he thought that the women made a deal to get rid of Burton, so the two men tried to lobby Sandra and Darrah to vote out Lillian with them. In the end, the women stuck together to send Burton to the jury.

The final four was awakened by a motorboat to find host Jeff Probst with breakfast and [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. After their meal, they were excited to see letters from home. Knowing that he was on the chopping block, Jon told Darrah that it would be a good strategic move to vote out Lillian because she was a threat to gain jury votes. Lillian convinced Sandra that Darrah should go because of her three straight immunity wins. 
*'''Immunity challenge:''' The challenge would be a test of survival and pirate folklore knowledge. In a twist, the final four castaways would be competing against each other and the jury, which will be playing as a team. Should the jury win, none of the final four castaways would be immune. Should one of the remaining castaways win, that castaway would be safe from elimination.
At the immunity challenge, the jury took an early lead, however Jon quickly tied the score. In the end, the jury answered the final question correctly, meaning that none of the remaining castaways were immune. At Tribal Council, Darrah was seen as a physical threat and she was voted out.

After receiving Tree Mail at midnight, the final three got up early to paddle to a shipwreck. Jeff Probst told them that they were about to take part in the ceremony for fallen castaways. After all the torches of those voted out (Osten's was left at Tribal Council) were placed on the wreck, the final three shot muskets at the shipwreck and it erupted and burned to the ground. 
*'''Immunity challenge:''' The final three must balance themselves on a small raft floating in the water. They could use their hands and feet for balance, but not their behind or knees. Last castaway on their raft wins immunity and a guaranteed spot in the final two.
At the immunity challenge, Jon and Sandra felt uncomfortable, while Lillian felt fine. Sandra fell early. Jon tried to make a final two deal with Lillian, however she refused because she felt she could beat him without a deal. After over two hours, Jon lost his balance, guaranteeing Lillian a spot in the final two. After Lillian won the final immunity challenge, Jon and Sandra both lobbied Lillian to take them to the final two. Jon argued that he was widely hated by the jury and that taking him to the final two would guarantee Lillian a million dollars. Sandra told Lillian that she has a family she'd like to provide for. Lillian was still unsure of whom to take to the final two. After much consideration, Lillian decided to vote out Jon due to Sandra's motivation of providing for her family.

At the final Tribal Council, Lillian talked about her honesty in her speech and admitted that it was a mistake to bring her Boy Scout uniform to the game. Sandra talked about her work ethic and said that she didn't ride any coattails. In the end, Sandra beat out Lillian to become the Sole Survivor in a 6-1 vote.

==History==
The GROMACS project was originally started in 1991 at Department of Biophysical Chemistry, [[University of Groningen]], [[Netherlands]] (1991-2000). The goal was to construct a dedicated parallel computer system for molecular simulations, based on a ring architecture. The molecular dynamics specific routines were rewritten in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] from the [[Fortran]]77-based program [[GROMOS]], which had been developed in the same group.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Since 2001 GROMACS is developed by the GROMACS development teams at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] and [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]].

==Features==
GROMACS is extremely fast due to algorithmic and processor-specific optimization, typically running 3-10 times faster than many simulation programs. GROMACS is operated via the [[command-line]], and can use files for input and output. GROMACS provides calculation progress and [[ETA]] feedback, a trajectory viewer, and an extensive library for trajectory analysis.<ref name="About Gromacs"/> In addition, support for different [[force field (chemistry)|force fields]] makes GROMACS very flexible. It can be executed in parallel, using [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] or [[thread (computer science)|threads]]. GROMACS contains a script to convert molecular coordinates from a [[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] file into the formats it uses internally. Once a configuration file for the simulation of several molecules (possibly including [[solvent]]) has been created, the actual simulation run (which can be time consuming) produces a trajectory file, describing the movements of the atoms over time. This trajectory file can then be analyzed or visualized with a number of supplied tools.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://manual.gromacs.org/current/online/flow.html | title =  GROMACS flow chart | publisher = gromacs.org | date = 18 January 2009 | accessdate = 26 June 2012}}</ref>

===Easter eggs===
{{As of|2010|01}}, GROMACS' source code contains approximately 400 alternative acronyms to "GROMACS" as jokes among the developers and [[biochemistry]] researchers. These include "Gromacs Runs On Most of All Computer Systems", "Gromacs Runs One Microsecond At Cannonball Speeds", "Good ROcking Metal Altar for Chronical Sinner", "Working on GRowing Old MAkes el Chrono Sweat", and "Great Red Owns Many ACres of Sand". They are randomly selected to possibly appear in GROMACS's output stream. In one instance, one of these acronyms caused offense.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://foldingforum.org/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=12922#p126473 | title = Re: Working on Giving Russians Opium May Alter Current Situation | work = Folding@home | date = 17 January 2010 | accessdate = 2012-06-26}}</ref>

==Applications==
Under a non-GPL license, GROMACS is widely used in the [[Folding@home]] [[distributed computing]] project for simulations of [[protein folding]], where it the base code for the project's largest and most regularly used series of [[Folding@home cores|calculation cores]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://folding.stanford.edu/English/FAQ-OpenSource | title = Folding@home Open Source FAQ | author = Pande lab | work = Folding@home | publisher = [[Stanford University]] | format = FAQ | date = 11 June 2012 | accessdate = 26 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Adam Beberg, Daniel Ensign, Guha Jayachandran, Siraj Khaliq, Vijay Pande | title = Folding@home: Lessons From Eight Years of Volunteer Distributed Computing | journal = Parallel & Distributed Processing, IEEE International Symposium | year = 2009 | volume = | issue = | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922 | pmid = | issn = 1530-2075 | url = http://www.hicomb.org/papers/HICOMB2009-13.pdf | isbn = 978-1-4244-3751-1}}</ref> [[EvoGrid]], a distributed computing project to evolve [[artificial life]], also employs GROMACS.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/science/29grid.html?ref=science | title = Wanted: Home Computers to Join in Research on Artificial Life | last = Markoff | first = John | work = The New York Times | date = 29 September 2009 | accessdate = 26 June 2012}}</ref>

It was introduced in 1995 by Nelson ''et al.'' as a parallel molecular dynamics code enabling interactive simulation by linking to the visualization code VMD. NAMD has since matured, adding many features and scaling to thousands of processors.
The latest stable version (as of October 2014) is 2.10.

Both pre-compiled binaries and the source code of NAMD are available free of charge for non-commercial use by individuals, academic institutions and corporations for in-house business purposes.

'''Baruch''' ({{Hebrew Name|????????|Barukh|B?rû?|"Blessed"}}) has been a given name among [[Jew]]s from [[Biblical times]] up to the present, on some occasions also used as surname. It is also found, though more rarely, among Christians—particularly among [[Protestant]]s who use [[Old Testament]] names. 

Except for its use as a name, this is also related to ''[[berakhah]]'' or ''bracha'' (Hebrew: '''????'''; plural ?????, ''berakhot''), which is a Jewish [[blessing]]. See also: ''[[Baraka (disambiguation)|Baraka]]'' and ''[[Barakah]]''.

The root B-R-K meaning "blessing" is also present in other [[Semitic]] languages. The most common [[Arabic language|Arabic]] form is the passive form [[Mubarak (disambiguation)|Mubarak]], but the form [[Barack (given name)|Barack]] is also used.

[[Benedictus (disambiguation)|Benedictus]] is a [[Latin]] name with similar meaning; cf. [[Baruch Spinoza]] or Benedictus de Spinoza.

==People with the given name Baruch==
===Bible===

Structure prediction is fundamentally different from the inverse problem of [[protein design]].  Protein structure prediction is one of the most important goals pursued by [[bioinformatics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]]; it is highly important in [[medicine]] (for example, in [[drug design]]) and [[biotechnology]] (for example, in the design of novel [[enzymes]]). Every two years, the performance of current methods is assessed in the [[CASP]] experiment (Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction). A continuous evaluation of protein structure prediction web servers is performed by the community project [[CAMEO3D]].

== Protein structure and terminology ==
Proteins are chains of amino acids joined together by peptide bonds. Many conformations of this chain are possible due to the rotation of the chain about each C? atom. It is these conformational changes that are responsible for differences in the three dimensional structure of proteins. Each amino acid in the chain is polar, i.e. it has separated positive and negative charged regions with a free C=O group, which can act as hydrogen bond acceptor and an NH group, which can act as hydrogen bond donor. These groups can therefore interact in the protein structure. The 20 amino acids can be classified according  to the chemistry of the side chain which also plays an important structural role. Glycine takes on a special position, as it has the smallest side chain, only one Hydrogen atom, and therefore can increase the local flexibility in the protein structure. Cysteine on the other hand can react with another cysteine residue and thereby form a cross link stabilizing the whole structure.

The protein structure can be considered as a sequence of secondary structure elements, such as ? helices and  ? sheets, which together constitute the overall three-dimensional configuration of the protein chain. In these secondary structures regular patterns of H bonds are formed between neighboring amino acids, and the amino acids have similar ? and ? angles.
[[Image:fipsi.png|thumb|200px|Bond angles for ? and ?]]

The formation of these structures neutralizes the polar groups on each amino acid. The secondary structures are tightly packed in the protein core in a hydrophobic environment. Each amino acid side group has a limited volume to occupy and a limited number of possible interactions with other nearby side chains, a situation that must be taken into account in molecular modeling and alignments.

===? Helix===
{{Main|? helix}}
The  ?  helix  is the most abundant type of secondary structure in proteins. The ? helix has 3.6 amino acids per turn with an H bond formed between every fourth residue; the average length is 10 amino acids (3 turns) or 10 Å but varies from 5 to
40 (1.5 to 11 turns). The alignment of the H bonds creates a dipole moment for the helix with a resulting partial positive charge at the amino end of the helix. Because this region has free NH<small>2</small>  groups, it will interact with negatively charged groups such as phosphates. The most common location of   ? helices is at the surface of protein cores, where they provide an interface with the aqueous environment. The inner-facing side of the helix tends to have hydrophobic amino acids and the outer-facing side hydrophilic amino acids. Thus, every third of four amino acids along the chain will tend to be hydrophobic, a pattern that can be quite readily detected. In the leucine zipper motif, a repeating pattern of leucines on the facing sides of two adjacent helices is highly predictive of the motif. A helical-wheel plot can be used to show this repeated pattern. Other  ?  helices buried in the protein  core  or  in  cellular membranes  have a higher  and  more  regular  distribution  of hydrophobic amino acids, and are highly predictive of such structures. Helices exposed on the surface have a lower proportion of hydrophobic amino acids. Amino acid content can be predictive of an   ? -helical region. Regions richer in alanine (A), glutamic acid (E), leucine (L), and methionine (M) and poorer in proline (P), glycine (G), tyrosine (Y), and serine (S) tend to form an   ?  helix. Proline destabilizes or breaks an   ?  helix but can be present in longer helices, forming a bend.
[[File:Alpha helix.png|thumb|right|100px|An alpha-helix with hydrogen bonds (yellow dots)]]

===? sheet===
{{Main|? sheet}}
? sheets are formed by H bonds between an average of 5–10 consecutive amino acids in one portion of the chain with another 5–10 farther down the chain. The interacting regions may be adjacent, with a short loop in between, or far apart, with other structures in between. Every chain may run in the same direction to form a parallel sheet, every other chain may run in the reverse chemical direction to form an anti parallel sheet, or the chains may be parallel and anti parallel to form a mixed sheet.The pattern of H bonding is different in the parallel and anti parallel configurations. Each amino acid in the interior strands of the sheet forms two H bonds with neighboring amino acids, whereas each amino acid on the outside strands forms only one bond with an interior strand. Looking across the sheet at right angles to the strands, more distant strands are rotated slightly counterclockwise to form a left-handed twist. The C?  atoms alternate above and below the sheet in a pleated structure, and the R side groups of the amino acids alternate above and below the pleats. The ?  and ?  angles of the amino acids in    sheets vary considerably in one region of the [[Ramachandran plot]]. It is more difficult to predict the location of   ? sheets than of ?   helices. The situation improves somewhat when the amino acid variation in multiple sequence alignments is taken into account.

===Loop===
Loops are regions of a protein chain that are
(1) between   ? helices and  ?  sheets, 
(2) of various lengths and three-dimensional configurations, and 
(3) on the surface of the structure. 
Hairpin loops that represent a complete turn in the polypeptide chain joining two antiparallel  ?  strands may be as short as two amino acids in length. Loops interact with the surrounding aqueous environment and other proteins. Because amino acids in loops are not constrained by space and environment as are amino acids in the core region, and do not have an effect on the arrangement of secondary structures in the core, more substitutions, insertions, and deletions may occur. Thus, in a sequence alignment, the presence of these features may be an indication of a loop. The positions of [[introns]] in genomic DNA sometimes correspond to the locations of loops in the encoded protein {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}. Loops also tend to have charged and polar amino acids and are frequently a component of active sites. A detailed examination of loop structures has shown that they fall into distinct families.

===Coils===
A region of secondary structure that is not a ? helix, a ? sheet, or a recognizable turn is commonly referred to as a coil.

==Protein classification==

Proteins may be classified according to both structural and sequence similarity. For structural classification, the sizes and spatial arrangements of secondary structures described in the above paragraph are compared in known three-dimensional structures.Classification based on sequence similarity was historically the first to be used. Initially, similarity based on alignments of whole sequences was performed. Later, proteins were classified on the basis of the occurrence of conserved amino acid patterns. [[Databases]] that classify proteins by one or more of these schemes are available.
In considering protein classification schemes, it is important  to keep several observations in mind. First, two entirely different protein sequences from different evolutionary origins may fold into a similar structure. Conversely, the sequence of an ancient gene for a given structure may have diverged considerably in different species while at the same time maintaining the same basic structural features. Recognizing any remaining sequence similarity in such cases may be a very difficult task. Second, two proteins that share a significant degree of sequence similarity either with each other or with a third sequence also share an evolutionary origin and should share some structural  features also. However, gene duplication and genetic rearrangements during evolution may give rise to new gene copies, which can then evolve into proteins with new function and structure.<ref name="Mount"/>

===Terms Used for Classifying Protein Structures and Sequences===

The more commonly used terms for evolutionary and structural relationships among proteins are listed below. Many additional terms are used for various kinds of structural features found in proteins. Descriptions of such terms may be found at the CATH Web site the [[Structural Classification of Proteins]] (SCOP) Web site and a Glaxo-Wellcome tutorial on the Swiss bioinformatics Expasy Web site.

;active site : a localized combination of amino acid side groups within the tertiary (three-dimensional) or quaternary (protein subunit) structure that can interact with a chemically specific substrate and that provides the protein with biological activity. Proteins of very different amino acid sequences may fold into a structure that produces the same active site.

;architecture : the relative orientations of secondary structures in a three-dimensional structure without regard to whether or not they share a similar loop structure.

;fold : a type of architecture that also has a conserved loop structure.

;blocks : a conserved amino acid sequence pattern in a family of proteins. The pattern includes a series of possible matches at each position in the rep- resented sequences, but there are not any inserted or deleted positions in the pattern or in the sequences. By way of contrast, sequence profiles are a type of scoring matrix that represents a similar set of patterns that includes insertions and deletions.

;class : a term used to classify protein domains according to their secondary structural content and organization. Four classes were originally recognized by Levitt and Chothia (1976), and several others have been added in the SCOP database. Three classes are given in the CATH database: mainly-?, mainly-?, and ?–?, with the ?–? class including both alternating ? /? and ?+? structures.

;core : the portion of a folded protein molecule that comprises the hydrophobic interior of  ?-helices and ?-sheets. The compact structure brings together side groups of amino acids into close enough proximity so that they can interact. When comparing protein structures, as in the SCOP database, core is the region common to most of the structures that share a common fold or that are in the same superfamily. In structure prediction, core is sometimes defined as the arrangement of secondary structures that is likely to be conserved during evolutionary change.

;domain (sequence context) : a segment of a polypeptide chain that can fold into a three-dimensional structure irrespective of the presence of other segments of the chain. The separate domains of a given protein may interact extensively or may be joined only by a length of polypeptide chain. A protein with several domains may use these domains for functional interactions with different molecules.

;family (sequence context) : a group of proteins of similar biochemical function that are more than 50% identical when aligned. This same cutoff is still used by the [[Protein Information Resource]] (PIR). A protein family comprises proteins  with the same function  in different organisms (orthologous sequences) but may also include proteins in the same organism (paralogous sequences) derived from gene duplication and rearrangements. If a multiple sequence alignment of a protein family reveals a common level of similarity throughout the lengths of the proteins, PIR refers to the family as a homeomorphic family. The aligned region is referred to as a homeomorphic domain, and this region may comprise several smaller homology domains that are shared with other families. Families may be further subdivided into subfamilies or grouped into superfamilies based on respective higher or lower levels of sequence similarity. The SCOP database reports 1296 families and the CATH database (version 1.7 beta), reports 1846 families.
:When the sequences of proteins with the same function are examined in greater detail, some are found to share high sequence similarity. They are obviously members of the same family by the above criteria. However, others are found that have very little, or even insignificant, sequence similarity with other family members. In such cases, the family relationship between two distant family members A and C can often be demonstrated by finding an additional family member B that shares significant similarity with both A and C. Thus, B provides a connecting link between A and C. Another approach is to examine distant alignments for highly conserved matches.
:At a level of identity of 50%, proteins are likely to have the same three-dimensional structure, and the identical atoms in the sequence alignment will also superimpose within approximately 1 Å in the structural model. Thus, if the structure of one member of a family is known, a reliable prediction may be made for a second member of the family, and the higher the identity level, the more reliable the prediction. Protein structural modeling can be performed by examining how well the amino acid substitutions fit into the core of the three-dimensional structure.

;family (structural context) : as used in the FSSP database ([[Families of structurally similar proteins]]) and the DALI/FSSP Web site, two structures that have a significant level of structural similarity but not necessarily significant sequence similarity.

;fold : similar to structural motif, includes a larger combination of secondary structural units in the same configuration. Thus, proteins sharing the same fold have the same combination of secondary structures that are connected by similar loops. An example is the Rossman fold comprising several alternating  ?  helices and parallel ? strands. In the SCOP, CATH, and FSSP databases, the known protein structures have been classified into hierarchical levels of structural complexity with the fold as a basic level of classification.

;homologous domain (sequence context) : an extended sequence pattern, generally found by sequence alignment methods, that indicates a common  evolutionary origin among the aligned sequences. A homology domain is generally longer than motifs. The domain may include all of a given protein sequence or only a portion of the sequence. Some domains are complex and made up of several smaller homology domains that became joined to form a larger one during evolution. A domain that covers an  entire  sequence is called the homeomorphic domain by PIR ([[Protein Information Resource]]).

;module : a region of conserved amino acid patterns comprising one or more motifs and considered to be a fundamental unit of structure or function. The presence of a module has also been used to classify proteins into families.

;motif (sequence context) : a conserved pattern of amino acids that is found in two or more proteins. In the [[Prosite]] catalog, a motif is an amino acid pattern that is found in a group of proteins that have a similar biochemical activity, and that often is near the active site of the protein. Examples of sequence motif databases are the Prosite catalog and the Stanford Motifs Database.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Huang | first1 = JY. | last2 = Brutlag | first2 = DL. | title = The EMOTIF database. | journal = Nucleic Acids Res | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 202–4 | month = Jan | year = 2001 | doi =  | PMID = 11125091 }}</ref>

;motif (structural context) : a combination of several secondary structural elements produced by the folding of adjacent sections of the polypeptide chain into a specific three-dimensional configuration. An example is the helix-loop-helix motif. Structural motifs are also referred to as supersecondary structures and folds.

;position-specific scoring matrix (sequence context, also known as weight or scoring matrix) : represents a conserved region in a multiple sequence alignment with no gaps. Each matrix column represents the variation found in one column of the multiple sequence alignment.
:Position-specific scoring matrix—3D (structural context) represents the amino acid variation found in an alignment of proteins that fall into the same structural class. Matrix columns represent the amino acid variation found at one amino acid position in the aligned structures.

;primary structure : the linear amino acid sequence of a protein, which chemically is a polypeptide chain composed of amino acids joined by peptide bonds.

;profile (sequence context) : a scoring matrix that represents a multiple sequence alignment of a protein family. The profile is usually obtained from a well-conserved region in a multiple sequence alignment. The profile is in the form of a matrix with each column representing a position in the alignment and each row one of the amino acids. Matrix values give the likelihood of each amino acid at the corresponding position in the alignment. The profile is moved along the target sequence to locate the best scoring regions by a dynamic programming algorithm. Gaps are allowed during matching and a gap penalty is included in this case as a negative score when no amino acid is matched. A sequence profile may also be represented by a hidden Markov model, referred to as a profile HMM ([[hidden markov model]]).

;profile (structural context) : a scoring matrix that represents which amino acids should fit well and which should fit poorly at sequential positions in a known protein structure. Profile columns represent sequential positions in the structure, and profile rows represent the 20 amino acids. As with a sequence profile, the structural profile is moved along a target sequence to find the highest possible alignment score by a dynamic programming algorithm. Gaps may be included and receive a penalty. The resulting score provides an indication as to whether or not the target protein might adopt such a structure.

;quaternary structure : the three-dimensional configuration of a protein molecule comprising several independent polypeptide chains.

;secondary structure : the interactions that occur between the C, O, and NH groups on amino acids in a polypeptide chain to form ?-helices, ?-sheets, turns, loops, and other forms, and that facilitate the folding into a three-dimensional structure.

;superfamily : a group of protein families of the same or different lengths that are related by distant yet detectable sequence similarity. Members of a given superfamily thus have a common evolutionary origin. Originally, Dayhoff defined the cutoff for superfamily status as being the chance that the sequences are not related of 10 6, on the basis of an alignment score (Dayhoff et al. 1978). Proteins with few identities in an alignment of the sequences but with a convincingly common number of structural and functional features are placed in the same superfamily. At the level of three-dimensional structure, superfamily proteins will share common structural features such as a common fold, but there may also be differences in the number and arrangement of secondary structures. The PIR resource uses the term ''homeomorphic superfamilies'' to refer to superfamilies that are composed of sequences that can be aligned from end to end, representing a sharing of single sequence homology domain, a region of similarity that extends throughout the alignment. This domain may also comprise smaller homology domains that are shared with other protein families and superfamilies. Although a given protein sequence may contain domains found in several superfamilies, thus indicating a complex evolutionary history, sequences will be assigned to only one homeomorphic  superfamily based on the presence of similarity throughout a multiple sequence alignment. The superfamily alignment may also include regions that do not align either within or at the ends of the alignment. In contrast, sequences in the same family align well throughout the alignment.

;supersecondary structure : a term with similar meaning to a structural motif. Tertiary structure is the three-dimensional or globular structure formed by the packing together or folding of secondary structures of a polypeptide chain.<ref name="Mount"/>

== Secondary structure ==
{{Main|List of protein secondary structure prediction programs}}

'''Secondary structure prediction''' is a set of techniques in [[bioinformatics]] that aim to predict the local [[secondary structure]]s of [[protein]]s based only on knowledge of their [[amino acid]] sequence only. For proteins, a prediction consists of assigning regions of the amino acid sequence as likely [[alpha helix|alpha helices]], [[beta sheet|beta strand]]s (often noted as "extended" conformations), or [[turn (biochemistry)|turns]]. The success of a prediction is determined by comparing it to the results of the [[DSSP (protein)|DSSP]] algorithm (or similar e.g. [[STRIDE (protein)|STRIDE]]) applied to the [[X-ray crystallography|crystal structure]] of the protein. Specialized algorithms have been developed for the detection of specific well-defined patterns such as [[transmembrane helix|transmembrane helices]] and [[coiled coil]]s in proteins.<ref name="Mount"/>

The best modern methods of secondary structure prediction in proteins reach about 80% accuracy;<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Pirovano | first1 = W. | last2 = Heringa | first2 = J. | title = Protein secondary structure prediction. | journal = Methods Mol Biol | volume = 609 | issue =  | pages = 327–48 | month =  | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-60327-241-4_19 | PMID = 20221928 }}</ref> this high accuracy allows the use of the predictions as feature improving [[fold recognition]] and [[ab initio]] protein structure prediction, classification of [[structural motif]]s, and refinement of [[sequence alignment]]s. The accuracy of current protein secondary structure prediction methods is assessed in weekly [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmarks]] such as [[LiveBench]] and [[EVA (benchmark)|EVA]].

These methods, applied to a single sequence, are typically at most about 60-65% accurate, and often underpredict beta sheets.<ref name="Mount" /> The [[evolution]]ary [[conservation (genetics)|conservation]] of secondary structures can be exploited by simultaneously assessing many [[homology (biology)|homologous]] sequences in a [[multiple sequence alignment]], by calculating the net secondary structure propensity of an aligned column of amino acids. In concert with larger databases of known protein structures and modern [[machine learning]] methods such as [[artificial neural network|neural nets]] and [[support vector machine]]s, these methods can achieve up 80% overall accuracy in [[globular protein]]s.<ref name="Dor">{{cite journal |author=Dor O, Zhou Y |year=2006 |pages=838–45 |title=Achieving 80% tenfold cross-validated accuracy for secondary structure prediction by large-scale training |issue=4 |volume=66 |journal=Proteins |pmid=17177203 |doi=10.1002/prot.21298}}</ref> The theoretical upper limit of accuracy is around 90%,<ref name="Dor" /> partly due to idiosyncrasies in DSSP assignment near the ends of secondary structures, where local conformations vary under native conditions but may be forced to assume a single conformation in crystals due to packing constraints. Limitations are also imposed by secondary structure prediction's inability to account for [[tertiary structure]]; for example, a sequence predicted as a likely helix may still be able to adopt a beta-strand conformation if it is located within a beta-sheet region of the protein and its side chains pack well with their neighbors. Dramatic conformational changes related to the protein's function or environment can also alter local secondary structure.

===Historical perspective===
To date, over 20 different secondary structure prediction methods were developed. One of the first algorithms was [[Chou-Fasman method]], which relies predominantly on probability parameters determined from relative frequencies of each amino acid's appearance in each type of secondary structure.<ref name="Chou">{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/bi00699a002 |author=Chou PY, Fasman GD |year=1974 |title=Prediction of protein conformation |journal=Biochemistry |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=222–245 |pmid=4358940}}</ref> The original Chou-Fasman parameters, determined from the small sample of structures solved in the mid-1970s, produce poor results compared to modern methods, though the parameterization has been updated since it was first published. The Chou-Fasman method is roughly 50-60% accurate in predicting secondary structures.<ref name="Mount" />

Next, notable program was the [[GOR method]], named for the three scientists who developed it — ''G''arnier, ''O''sguthorpe, and ''R''obson — is an [[information theory]]-based method. It uses a more powerful probabilistic techniques of [[Bayesian inference]].<ref name="Garnier">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(78)90297-8 |author=Garnier J, Osguthorpe DJ, Robson B |year=1978 |title=Analysis of the accuracy and implications of simple methods for predicting the secondary structure of globular proteins |journal=J Mol Biol |volume=120 |issue=1 |pages=97–120 |pmid=642007}}</ref> The GOR method takes into account not only the probability of each amino acid having a particular secondary structure, but also the [[conditional probability]] of the amino acid assuming each structure given the contributions of its neighbors (it does not assume that the neighbors have that same structure).  The approach is both more sensitive and more accurate than that of Chou and Fasman because amino acid structural propensities are only strong for a small number of amino acids such as [[proline]] and [[glycine]].  Weak contributions from each of many neighbors can add up to strong effect overall.  The original GOR method was roughly 65% accurate and is dramatically more successful in predicting alpha helices than beta sheets, which it frequently mispredicted as loops or disorganized regions.<ref name="Mount" />

Another big step forward, was using [[machine learning]] methods. First [[artificial neural network]]s methods were used. As a training sets they use solved structures to identify common sequence motifs associated with particular arrangements of secondary structures. These methods are over 70% accurate in their predictions, although beta strands are still often underpredicted due to the lack of three-dimensional structural information that would allow assessment of [[hydrogen bonding]] patterns that can promote formation of the extended conformation required for the presence of a complete beta sheet.<ref name="Mount" /> [[Psipred|PSIPRED]] and [[Jpred|JPRED]] are some of the most known programs based on neural networks for protein secondary structure prediction.

== Tertiary structure ==
The practical role of protein structure prediction is now more important than ever. Massive amounts of protein sequence data are produced by modern large-scale [[DNA]] sequencing efforts such as the [[Human Genome Project]]. Despite community-wide efforts in [[structural genomics]], the output of experimentally determined protein structures—typically by time-consuming and relatively expensive [[X-ray crystallography]] or [[Protein NMR|NMR spectroscopy]]—is lagging far behind the output of protein sequences.

The protein structure prediction remains an extremely difficult and unresolved undertaking. The two main problems are calculation of [[Gibbs free energy|protein free energy]] and [[energy minimization|finding the global minimum]] of this energy. A protein structure prediction method must explore the space of possible protein structures which is [[Levinthal's paradox|astronomically large]]. These problems can be partially bypassed in "comparative" or [[homology modeling]] and [[fold recognition]] methods, in which the search space is pruned by the assumption that the protein in question adopts a structure that is close to the experimentally determined structure of another homologous protein. On the other hand, the ''de novo'' or [[De novo protein structure prediction|ab initio protein structure prediction]] methods must explicitly resolve these problems. The progress and challenges in protein structure prediction has been reviewed in Zhang 2008.<ref name="zhang2008"/>

===''Ab initio'' protein modelling===

{{main|De novo protein structure prediction}}

====Energy- and fragment-based methods====
''Ab initio''- or ''de novo''- protein modelling methods seek to build three-dimensional protein models "from scratch", i.e., based on physical principles rather than (directly) on previously solved structures. There are many possible procedures that either attempt to mimic [[protein folding]] or apply some [[stochastic]] method to search possible solutions (i.e., [[global optimization]] of a suitable energy function). These procedures tend to require vast computational resources, and have thus only been carried out for tiny proteins. To predict protein structure ''de novo'' for larger proteins will require better algorithms and larger computational resources like those afforded by either powerful supercomputers (such as [[Blue Gene]] or [[MDGRAPE-3]]) or distributed computing (such as [[Folding@home]], the [[Human Proteome Folding Project]] and [[Rosetta@Home]]). Although these computational barriers are vast, the potential benefits of structural genomics (by predicted or experimental methods) make ''ab initio'' structure prediction an active research field.<ref name="zhang2008">{{cite journal |author=Zhang Y |title=Progress and challenges in protein structure prediction |journal=Curr Opin Struct Biol |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=342–8 |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2008.02.004 |pmid=18436442 |pmc=2680823}}</ref>

====Evolutionary covariation to predict 3D contacts====

As sequencing became more commonplace in the 1990s several groups used protein sequence alignments to predict correlated [[mutation]]s and it was hoped that these coevolved residues could be used to predict tertiary structure (using the analogy to distance constraints from experimental procedures such as [[NMR]]). The assumption is when single residue mutations are slightly deleterious, compensatory mutations may occur to restabilize residue-residue interactions.
This early work used what are known as ''local'' methods to calculate correlated mutations from protein sequences, but suffered from indirect false correlations which result from treating each pair of residues as independent of all other pairs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gobel | first1 = U. ''et al.'' | year = 1994 | title = ''Correlated mutations and residue contacts in proteins.''

In 2011, a different, and this time ''global'' statistical approach, demonstrated that predicted coevolved residues were sufficient to predict the 3D fold of a protein, providing there are enough sequences available (>1,000 homologous sequences are needed).<ref name="marks">{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = D.

===Comparative protein modeling===

Comparative protein modelling uses previously solved structures as starting points, or templates. This is effective because it appears that although the number of actual proteins is vast, there is a limited set of [[tertiary structure|tertiary]] [[structural motif]]s to which most proteins belong. It has been suggested that there are only around 2,000 distinct protein folds in nature, though there are many millions of different proteins.

These methods may also be split into two groups:<ref name="zhang2008"/>
;[[Homology modeling]] : is based on the reasonable assumption that two [[Homology (biology)#Homology of sequences in genetics|homologous]] proteins will share very similar structures. Because a protein's fold is more evolutionarily conserved than its amino acid sequence, a target sequence can be modeled with reasonable accuracy on a very distantly related template, provided that the relationship between target and template can be discerned through [[sequence alignment]]. It has been suggested that the primary bottleneck in comparative modelling arises from difficulties in alignment rather than from errors in structure prediction given a known-good alignment.<ref name="zhang2005">{{cite journal |author=Zhang Y and Skolnick J |title=The protein structure prediction problem could be solved using the current PDB library |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=1029–34 |year=2005 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0407152101 |pmid=15653774 |pmc=545829}}</ref> Unsurprisingly, homology modelling is most accurate when the target and template have similar sequences.

;[[Protein threading]]:<ref name="bowie1991">{{cite journal |author=Bowie JU, Luthy R, Eisenberg D |title=A method to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional structure |journal=Science |volume=253 |issue=5016 |pages=164–170 |year=1991 |doi=10.1126/science.1853201 |pmid=1853201}}</ref> scans the amino acid sequence of an unknown structure against a database of solved structures.  In each case, a scoring function is used to assess the compatibility of the sequence to the structure, thus yielding possible three-dimensional models. This type of method is also known as '''3D-1D fold recognition''' due to its compatibility analysis between three-dimensional structures and linear protein sequences. This method has also given rise to methods performing an '''inverse folding search''' by evaluating the compatibility of a given structure with a large database of sequences, thus predicting which sequences have the potential to produce a given fold.

===Side-chain geometry prediction===
Accurate packing of the amino acid [[side chain]]s represents a separate problem in protein structure prediction. Methods that specifically address the problem of predicting side-chain geometry include [[dead-end elimination]] and the [[self-consistent mean field (biology)|self-consistent mean field]] methods. The side chain conformations with low energy are usually determined on the rigid polypeptide backbone and using a set of discrete side chain conformations known as "[[rotamer]]s." The methods attempt to identify the set of rotamers that minimize the model's overall energy.

These methods use rotamer libraries, which are collections of favorable conformations for each residue type in proteins. Rotamer libraries may contain information about the conformation, its frequency, and the standard deviations about mean dihedral angles, which can be used in sampling.<ref name="Rotamers21stCentury">{{cite journal |author=Dunbrack, RL |journal=Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. |year=2002 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=431–440 |title=Rotamer Libraries in the 21st Century |pmid=12163064 |doi=10.1016/S0959-440X(02)00344-5}}</ref> Rotamer libraries are derived from [[structural bioinformatics]] or other statistical analysis of side-chain conformations in known experimental structures of proteins, such as by clustering the observed conformations for tetrahedral carbons near the staggered (60°, 180°, -60°) values.

Rotamer libraries can be backbone-independent, secondary-structure-dependent, or backbone-dependent. Backbone-independent rotamer libraries make no reference to backbone conformation, and are calculated from all available side chains of a certain type (for instance, the first example of a rotamer library, done by Ponder and [[Frederic M. Richards|Richards]] at Yale in 1987).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(87)90358-5 |author=Ponder JW, Richards FM |title=Tertiary templates for proteins: use of packing criteria in the enumeration of allowed sequences for different structural classes |journal= J.

The modern versions of these libraries as used in most software are presented as multidimensional distributions of probability or frequency, where the peaks correspond to the dihedral-angle conformations considered as individual rotamers in the lists. Some versions are based on very carefully curated data and are used primarily for structure validation,<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Chen | first1 = VB. | last2 = Arendall | first2 = WB. | last3 = Headd | first3 = JJ. | last4 = Keedy | first4 = DA. | last5 = Immormino | first5 = RM. | last6 = Kapral | first6 = GJ. | last7 = Murray | first7 = LW. | last8 = Richardson | first8 = JS. | last9 = Richardson | first9 = DC. | title = MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography. | journal = Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr | volume = 66 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 12–21 | month = Jan | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1107/S0907444909042073 | PMID = 20057044 }}</ref> while others emphasize relative frequencies in much larger data sets and are the form used primarily for structure prediction, such as the Dunbrack rotamer libraries.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bower | first1 = MJ. | last2 = Cohen | first2 = FE. | last3 = Dunbrack | first3 = RL. | title = Prediction of protein side-chain rotamers from a backbone-dependent rotamer library: a new homology modeling tool. | journal = J Mol Biol | volume = 267 | issue = 5 | pages = 1268–82 | month = Apr | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.1997.0926 | PMID = 9150411 }}</ref>

In the case of [[protein complex|complexes of two or more proteins]], where the structures of the proteins are known or can be predicted with high accuracy, [[Macromolecular docking|protein–protein docking]] methods can be used to predict the structure of the complex. Information of the effect of mutations at specific sites on the affinity of the complex helps to understand the complex structure and to guide docking methods.

'''Water quality''' refers to the chemical, physical, biological, and radiological characteristics of [[water]].<ref name="waterquality">Diersing, Nancy (2009). [http://floridakeys.noaa.gov/scisummaries/wqfaq.pdf "Water Quality: Frequently Asked Questions."] Florida Brooks National Marine Sanctuary, Key West, FL.</ref> It is a measure of the condition of water relative to the requirements of one or more biotic species and or to any human need or purpose.<ref>Johnson, D.L., S.H.

The most common standards used to assess water quality relate to health of [[ecosystems]], safety of human contact and [[drinking water]].

== Standards ==
In the setting of standards, agencies make political and technical/scientific decisions about how the water will be used.<ref>United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/standards/about/rev.htm "Water Quality Standards Review and Revision."] 2006.</ref> In the case of natural [[Body of water|water bodies]], they also make some reasonable estimate of pristine conditions. Different uses raise different concerns and therefore different standards are considered. Natural water bodies will vary in response to environmental conditions. [[Environmental science|Environmental scientists]] work  to understand how these systems function, which in turn helps to identify the sources and fates of contaminants. [[Environmental lawyers]] and policymakers work to define legislation with the intention that water is maintained at an appropriate quality for its identified use.

The vast majority of [[surface water]] on the planet is neither [[potable]] nor [[toxicity|toxic]]. This remains true when [[seawater]] in the oceans (which is too salty to drink) is not counted. Another general perception of ''water quality'' is that of a simple property that tells whether water is [[pollution|polluted]] or not. In fact, water quality is a complex subject, in part because water is a complex medium intrinsically tied to the [[ecology]] of the Earth. Industrial and commercial activities (e.g. [[manufacturing]], [[mining]], [[construction]], [[transport]]) are a major cause of [[water pollution]] as are [[surface runoff|runoff]] from [[farm|agricultural]] areas, [[urban runoff]] and discharge of treated and untreated [[sewage]].

==Categories==
The parameters for water quality are determined by the intended use.  Work in the area of water quality tends to be focused on water that is treated for human consumption, industrial use, or in the environment.

===Human consumption===
Contaminants that may be in untreated water include [[microorganism]]s such as viruses, protozoa and bacteria; inorganic contaminants such as [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[metals]]; [[Organic chemistry|organic chemical]] contaminants from industrial processes and [[petroleum]] use; [[pesticides]] and [[herbicides]];  and [[radioactive]] contaminants. Water quality depends on the local geology and ecosystem, as well as human uses such as sewage dispersion, industrial pollution, use of water bodies as a [[heat sink]], and overuse (which may lower the level of the water).

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) limits the amounts of certain contaminants in [[tap water]] provided by US public water systems.  The [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] authorizes EPA to issue two types of standards:  ''primary standards'' regulate substances that potentially affect human health, and ''secondary standards'' prescribe aesthetic qualities, those that affect taste, odor, or appearance. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations establish limits for contaminants in [[bottled water]] that must provide the same protection for public health. Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of these contaminants does not necessarily indicate that the water poses a health risk.

In [[urbanization|urbanized]] areas around the world, [[water purification]] technology is used in municipal water systems to remove contaminants from the source water (surface water or [[groundwater]]) before it is distributed to homes, businesses, schools and other users. Water drawn directly from a stream, lake, or [[aquifer]] and that has no treatment will be of uncertain quality.

===Industrial and domestic use===
Dissolved minerals may affect suitability of water for a range of industrial and domestic purposes. The most familiar of these is probably the presence of ions of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] which  interfere with the cleaning action of [[soap]], and can form hard [[sulfate]] and soft [[carbonate]] deposits in water heaters or [[boiler]]s.<ref>Babbitt, Harold E. & Doland, James J. ''Water Supply Engineering'' (1949) McGraw-Hill p.388</ref>  Hard water may be softened to remove these ions.  The softening process often substitutes [[sodium]] cations.<ref>Linsley, Ray K. & Franzini, Joseph B. ''Water-Resources Engineering'' (1972) McGraw-Hill ISBN 0-07-037959-9 pp.454-456</ref>  Hard water may be preferable to soft water for human consumption, since health problems have been associated with excess sodium and with calcium and magnesium deficiencies. Softening decreases nutrition and may increase cleaning effectiveness.<ref>World Health Organization (2004). [http://www.who.int/entity/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrconsensusrep.pdf "Consensus of the Meeting: Nutrient minerals in drinking-water and the potential health consequences of long-term consumption of demineralized and remineralized and altered mineral content drinking-waters."] ''Rolling Revision of the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality (draft).'' From November 11–13, 2003 meeting in Rome, Italy at the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health.</ref>

===Environmental water quality===
[[File:Water runoff.jpg|right|200px|thumb|upright|[[Urban runoff]] discharging to coastal waters]]
{{See also|Environmental monitoring|Freshwater environmental quality parameters}}

Environmental water quality, also called '''ambient water quality,''' relates to water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and oceans. Water quality standards for surface waters vary significantly due to different environmental conditions, ecosystems, and intended human uses. Toxic substances and high populations of certain microorganisms can present a health hazard for non-drinking purposes such as irrigation, swimming, fishing, rafting, boating, and industrial uses. These conditions may also affect wildlife, which use the water for drinking or as a habitat. Modern water quality laws generally specify protection of fisheries and recreational use and require, as a minimum, retention of current quality standards.
[[File:Monster Soup - William Heath.jpg|thumb|left|Satirical cartoon by [[William Heath (artist)|William Heath]], showing a woman observing monsters in a drop of London water (at the time of the ''Commission on the London Water Supply'' report, 1828)]]
There is some desire among the public to return water bodies to pristine, or pre-industrial conditions. Most current environmental laws focus on the designation of particular uses of a water body. In some countries these designations allow for some [[water contamination]] as long as the particular type of contamination is not harmful to the designated uses. Given the landscape changes (e.g., [[land development]], [[urbanization]], [[clearcutting]] in forested areas) in the [[drainage basin|watersheds]] of many freshwater bodies, returning to pristine conditions would be a significant challenge. In these cases, environmental scientists focus on achieving goals for maintaining healthy ecosystems and may concentrate on the protection of populations of [[endangered species]] and protecting human health.

==Sampling and measurement==
{{See also|water chemistry analysis|analytical chemistry}}
The complexity of water quality as a subject is reflected in the many types of measurements of water quality indicators.  The most accurate measurements of water quality are made on-site, because water exists in equilibrium with its surroundings.  Measurements commonly made on-site and in direct contact with the water source in question include temperature, [[pH]], [[dissolved oxygen]], [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]], [[Reduction potential|oxygen reduction potential (ORP)]], [[turbidity]], and [[Secchi disk]] depth.

===Sample collection===
[[File:WQ sampling station USGS 2004.jpg|thumb|An automated sampling station installed along the East Branch [[Milwaukee River]], [[New Fane, Wisconsin]]. The cover of the 24-bottle autosampler (center) is partially raised, showing the sample bottles inside. The autosampler was programmed to collect samples at time intervals, or proportionate to flow over a specified period. The data logger (white cabinet) recorded temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen levels.]]
More complex measurements are often made in a [[laboratory]] requiring a water sample to be collected, preserved, transported, and analyzed at another location.  The process of water sampling introduces two significant problems.  The first problem is the extent to which the sample may be representative of the water source of interest.  Many water sources vary with time and with location.  The measurement of interest may vary seasonally or from day to night or in response to some activity of man or natural populations of aquatic plants and animals.<ref>Goldman, Charles R. & Horne, Alexander J. ''Limnology'' (1983) McGraw-Hill ISBN 0-07-023651-8 chapter 6</ref>  The measurement of interest may vary with distances from the water boundary with overlying [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] and underlying or confining [[soil]].  The sampler must determine if a single time and location meets the needs of the investigation, or if the water use of interest can be satisfactorily assessed by [[average]]d values with time and/or location, or if critical [[maxima and minima]] require individual measurements over a range of times, locations and/or events.  The sample collection procedure must assure correct weighting of individual sampling times and locations where averaging is appropriate.<ref name="Franson">Franson, Mary Ann (1975). ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' 14th ed. Washington, DC: American Public Health Association, American Water Works Association & Water Pollution Control Federation. ISBN 0-87553-078-8</ref>{{rp|39–40}} Where critical maximum or minimum values exist, [[statistics|statistical methods]] must be applied to observed variation to determine an adequate number of samples to assess [[probability]] of exceeding those critical values.<ref>EPA (1973). ''Handbook for Monitoring Industrial Wastewater.'' Chapter 8.</ref>

The second problem occurs as the sample is removed from the water source and begins to establish [[chemical equilibrium]] with its new surroundings - the sample container. Sample containers must be made of materials with minimal reactivity with substances to be measured; and pre-cleaning of sample containers is important. The water sample may dissolve part of the sample container and any residue on that container, or chemicals dissolved in the water sample may [[sorption|sorb]] onto the sample container and remain there when the water is poured out for analysis.<ref name="Franson"/>{{rp|4}} Similar physical and chemical interactions may take place with any pumps, piping, or intermediate devices used to transfer the water sample into the sample container. Water collected from depths below the surface will normally be held at the reduced [[pressure]] of the atmosphere; so gas [[solvation|dissolved]] in the water may escape into unfilled space at the top of the container.  Atmospheric gas present in that air space may also dissolve into the water sample. Other chemical reaction equilibria may change if the water sample changes temperature.  Finely divided solid particles formerly [[suspended solids|suspended]] by water turbulence may settle to the bottom of the sample container, or a solid phase may form from biological growth or [[precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]]. [[Microorganism]]s within the water sample may biochemically alter concentrations of [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[organic compound]]s.  Changing carbon dioxide concentrations may alter [[pH]] and change solubility of chemicals of interest. These problems are of special concern during measurement of chemicals assumed to be significant at very low concentrations.<ref>Goldman, Charles R. & Horne, Alexander J. ''Limnology'' (1983) McGraw-Hill ISBN 0-07-023651-8 pp.87-88</ref>

[[File:watersampling.JPG|thumb|right|Filtering a manually collected water sample ([[Environmental monitoring#Grab samples|grab sample]]) for analysis]]
Sample preservation may partially resolve the second problem. A common procedure is keeping samples cold to slow the [[reaction rate|rate of chemical reactions]] and phase change, and analyzing the sample as soon as possible; but this merely minimizes the changes rather than preventing them.<ref name="Franson" />{{rp|43–45}} A useful procedure for determining influence of sample containers during delay between sample collection and analysis involves preparation for two artificial samples in advance of the sampling event. One sample container is filled with water known from previous analysis to contain no detectable amount of the chemical of interest. This sample, called a "blank," is opened for exposure to the atmosphere when the sample of interest is collected, then resealed and transported to the laboratory with the sample for analysis to determine if sample holding procedures introduced any measurable amount of the chemical of interest.  The second artificial sample is collected with the sample of interest, but then "spiked" with a measured additional amount of the chemical of interest at the time of collection. The blank and spiked samples are carried with the sample of interest and analyzed by the same methods at the same times to determine any changes indicating gains or losses during the elapsed time between collection and analysis.<ref>United States Geological Survey (USGS), Denver, CO (2009).

===Testing in response to natural disasters and other emergencies===
Inevitably after events such as earthquakes and tsunamis, there is an immediate response by the aid agencies as relief operations get underway to try and restore basic infrastructure and provide the basic fundamental items that are necessary for survival and subsequent recovery. Access to clean drinking water and adequate sanitation is a priority at times like this. The threat of disease increases hugely due to the large numbers of people living close together, often in squalid conditions, and without proper sanitation.

After a natural disaster, as far as water quality testing is concerned there are widespread views on the best course of action to take and a variety of methods can be employed. The key basic water quality parameters that need to be addressed in an emergency are bacteriological indicators of fecal contamination, free [[chlorine]] residual, pH, turbidity and possibly conductivity/total dissolved solids. There are a number of portable water test kits on the market widely used by aid and relief agencies for carrying out such testing.

After major natural disasters, a considerable length of time might pass before water quality returns to pre-disaster levels. For example, following the [[2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami]] the Colombo-based [[International Water Management Institute]] (IWMI) monitored the effects of saltwater and concluded that the wells recovered to pre-tsunami drinking water quality one and a half years after the event.<ref>International Water Management Institute, Colombo, Sri Lanka (2010). [http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%207%20-%20Helping_restore_the_quality_of_drinking_water_after_the_tsunami.pdf "Helping restore the quality of drinking water after the tsunami."] ''Success Stories.'' Issue 7. {{doi|10.5337/2011.0030}}</ref> IWMI developed protocols for cleaning wells contaminated by saltwater; these were subsequently officially endorsed by the [[World Health Organization]] as part of its series of Emergency Guidelines.<ref>World Health Organization (2011). [http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/hygiene/envsan/technotes/en/ "WHO technical notes for emergencies."] Water Engineering Development Centre, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK.</ref>

===Chemical analysis===
[[File:GCMS open.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|gas chromatograph-<br/>mass spectrometer]] measures [[pesticide]]s and other [[Organic compound|organic]] pollutants]]
The simplest methods of chemical analysis are those measuring [[chemical element]]s without respect to their form.  Elemental analysis for [[dissolved oxygen]], as an example, would indicate a concentration of 890,000 milligrams per litre (mg/L) of water sample because water is made of oxygen. The method selected to measure dissolved oxygen should differentiate between [[Diatomic molecule|diatomic]] oxygen and oxygen combined with other elements.  The comparative simplicity of elemental analysis has produced a large amount of sample data and water quality criteria for elements sometimes identified as [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]]. Water analysis for heavy metals must consider soil particles suspended in the water sample. These suspended soil particles may contain measurable amounts of metal.  Although the particles are not [[solvation|dissolved]] in the water, they may be consumed by people drinking the water.  Adding [[acid]] to a water sample to prevent loss of dissolved metals onto the sample container may dissolve more metals from suspended soil particles.  [[Filtration]] of soil particles from the water sample before acid addition, however, may cause loss of dissolved metals onto the filter.<ref>State of California Environmental Protection Agency ''Representative Sampling of Ground Water for Hazardous Substances'' (1994) pp.23-24</ref>  The complexities of differentiating similar [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]] are even more challenging.

Making these complex measurements can be expensive. Because direct measurements of water quality can be expensive, ongoing monitoring programs are typically conducted by government agencies. However, there are local volunteer programs and resources available for some general assessment.  Tools available to the general public include on-site test kits, commonly used for home fish tanks, and biological assessment procedures.

===Real-time monitoring===
Although water quality is usually sampled and analyzed at laboratories, nowadays, citizens demand real-time information about the water they are drinking. During the last years, several companies <ref>ADVANTICSYS Smart Water Solutions. [http://www.advanticsys.com/services/smart-water-monitoring/ "Smart Water"]</ref> are deploying worldwide real-time remote monitoring systems for measuring water pH, turbidity or dissolved oxygen levels.

===Drinking water indicators===
[[File:Electrical conductivity meter.jpg|thumb|right|An [[electrical conductivity meter]] is used to measure [[total dissolved solids]]]]
The following is a list of indicators often measured by situational category:
* [[Alkalinity]]
* [[Color of water]]
* [[pH]]
* Taste and odor ([[geosmin]], [[2-Methylisoborneol]] (MIB), etc.)
* Dissolved metals and salts ([[sodium]], [[chloride]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]], [[manganese]], [[magnesium]])

[[Biological indicator|Biological monitoring]] metrics have been developed in many places, and one widely used measure is the presence and abundance of members of the insect orders [[Ephemeroptera]], [[Plecoptera]] and [[Trichoptera]]. (Common names are, respectively, Mayfly, Stonefly and Caddisfly.) EPT indexes will naturally vary from region to region, but generally, within a region, the greater the number of taxa from these orders, the better the water quality. Organisations in the United States, such as EPA offer guidance on developing a monitoring program and identifying members of these and other aquatic insect orders.<ref>For an overview of the U.S. federal biomonitoring publications, see U.S. EPA, [http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/methods/wet/ "Whole Effluent Toxicity."]</ref><ref>U.S. EPA. Washington, DC.[http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/methods/wet/disk2/atx.pdf "Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms."] Document No. EPA-821-R-02-012. October 2002.</ref>

Individuals interested in monitoring water quality who cannot afford or manage lab scale analysis can also use biological indicators to get a general reading of water quality. One example is the IOWATER volunteer water monitoring program, which includes a [[benthic]] [[macroinvertebrate]] indicator key.<ref>IOWATER (Iowa Department of Natural Resources). Iowa City, IA (2005). [http://www.iowater.net/Publications/BMIKey2Edvmay05.pdf "Benthic Macroinvertebrate Key."]</ref>

Bivalve molluscs are largely used as [[bioindicators]] to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both  fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of the ecosystem. They are particularly useful since they are sessile so that they are representative of the environment where they are sampled or placed. A typical project is the [[Mussel Watch Program]]me,<ref>http://ccma.nos.noaa.gov/about/coast/nsandt/musselwatch.aspx</ref> but today they are used worldwide.

The Southern African Scoring System (SASS) method is a biological water quality monitoring system based on the presence of benthic macroinvertebrates. The SASS [[aquatic biomonitoring]] tool has been refined over the past 30 years and is now on the fifth version (SASS5) which has been specifically modified in accordance with international standards, namely the [[ISO/IEC 17025]] protocol.<ref>Dickens CWS and Graham PM. 2002. [http://www.dwa.gov.za/iwqs/rhp/methods/dickens%20and%20graham.pdf The Southern Africa Scoring System (SASS) version 5 rapid bioassessment for rivers] “African Journal of Aquatic Science”, 27:1-10.</ref> The SASS5 method is used by the South African [[Department of Water Affairs]] as a standard method for River Health Assessment, which feeds the national River Health Programme and the national Rivers Database.

====European Union====
{{Further|Water supply and sanitation in the European Union}}
The water policy of the [[European Union]] is primarily codified in three [[European Union directive|directives]]:
*[[Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment]] (91/271/EEC) of 21 May 1991 concerning discharges of municipal and some industrial [[wastewater]]s;
*[[Water supply and sanitation in the European Union#Drinking water directive of 1998|The Drinking Water Directive]] (98/83/EC) of 3 November 1998 concerning potable water quality;
*[[Water Framework Directive]] (2000/60/EC) of 23 October 2000 concerning [[water resources]] management.

====United Kingdom====
In England and Wales acceptable levels for drinking water supply are listed in the "Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2000."<ref>National Archives, London, UK. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/3184/contents/made "The Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2000."] 2000 No. 3184. 2000-12-08.</ref>

====South Africa====
{{Further|Water supply and sanitation in South Africa}}
Water quality guidelines for South Africa are grouped according to potential user types (e.g. domestic, industrial) in the 1996 Water Quality Guidelines.<ref>Republic of South Africa, Department of Water Affairs, Pretoria (1996). [http://www.dwaf.gov.za/IWQS/wq_guide/index.html "Water quality guidelines for South Africa: First Edition 1996."]</ref>  Drinking water quality is subject to the South African National Standard (SANS) 241 Drinking Water Specification.<ref>Hodgson K, Manus L. A drinking water quality framework for South Africa. Water SA. 2006;32(5):673-678 [http://www.wrc.org.za/downloads/watersa/2006/WISA%20special%20ed/9.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}.</ref>

====United States====
In the United States, [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|Water Quality Standards]] are created by state agencies for different types of water bodies and water body locations per desired uses.<ref>U.S. Clean Water Act, Section 303, {{USC|33|1313}}.</ref> The [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) requires each governing jurisdiction (states, territories, and covered tribal entities) to submit a set of biennial reports on the quality of water in their area. These reports are known as the 303(d) and 305(b) reports, named for their respective CWA provisions, and are submitted to, and approved by, EPA.<ref>U.S. Clean Water Act, Section 303(d), {{USC|33|1313}}; Section 305(b), {{USC|33|1315(b)}}.</ref> These reports are completed by the governing jurisdiction, typically a [[:Category:State environmental protection agencies of the United States|state environmental agency]], and are available on the web.  In coming years it is expected that the governing jurisdictions will submit all three reports as a single document, called the "Integrated Report." The 305(b) report ("National Water Quality Inventory Report to Congress") is a general report on water quality, providing overall information about the number of miles of streams and rivers and their aggregate condition.<ref>U.S. EPA. [http://epa.gov/305b/ "National Water Quality Inventory Report to Congress."]</ref> <ref>The "314 report" had provided similar information for lakes. Congress has not provided funds directly for implementation of the Section 314 Clean Lakes Program since 1994. See [http://www.epa.gov/owow/lakes/cllkspgm.html EPA's Clean Lakes Program.]</ref> The CWA requires states to adopt water quality standards for each of the possible designated uses that they assign to their waters. Should evidence suggest or document that a stream, river or lake has failed to meet the water quality criteria for one or more of its designated uses, it is placed on the 303(d) list of impaired waters. Once a state has placed a water body on the 303(d) list, it must develop a management plan establishing [[Total Maximum Daily Load]]s for the pollutant(s) impairing the use of the water. These TMDLs establish the reductions needed to fully support the designated uses.<ref>More information about water quality in the United States is on the EPA's [http://cfpub.epa.gov/surf/locate/index.cfm "Surf Your Watershed"] website.</ref>

Drinking water standards are issued by EPA under the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]].

}}
'''Cape Canaveral Air Force Station''' ('''CCAFS''') is an installation of the United States [[Air Force Space Command]]'s [[45th Space Wing]],<ref name=paf/> headquartered at nearby [[Patrick Air Force Base]]. Located on [[Cape Canaveral]] in the state of Florida, CCAFS is the primary launch head of America's [[Eastern Range]]<ref name="CAST_p1-12">CAST 1999, p. 1-12.</ref> with four launch pads currently active. Popularly known as "Cape Kennedy" from 1963 to 1973, and as "Cape Canaveral" from 1949 to 1963 and from 1973 to the present, the facility is south-southeast of [[NASA]]'s [[John F. Kennedy Space Center|Kennedy Space Center]] on adjacent [[Merritt Island]], with the two linked by bridges and causeways. The [[Cape Canaveral AFS Skid Strip]] provides a {{convert|10000|ft|m|adj=on}} runway<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldaerodata.com/wad.cgi?id=US75885|title=World Aero Data: Cape Cnaveral AFS Skid Strip – XMR|accessdate=August 31, 2008}}</ref> close to the launch complexes for military airlift aircraft delivering heavy and outsized payloads to the Cape.

A number of American space exploration "firsts" were launched from CCAFS, including [[Explorer 1|the first U.S. Earth satellite]] (1958), [[Mercury-Redstone 3|first U.S. astronaut]] (1961), [[Mercury-Atlas 6|first U.S. astronaut in orbit]] (1962), [[Gemini 3|first two-man U.S. spacecraft]] (1965), [[Surveyor 1|first U.S. unmanned lunar landing]] (1966), and [[Apollo 7|first three-man U.S. spacecraft]] (1968). It was also the launch site for all of the first spacecraft to (separately) [[planetary flyby|fly past each of the planets]] in the Solar System (1962–1977), the [[Mariner 9|first spacecraft to orbit Mars]] (1971) and [[Mars Pathfinder|roam its surface]] (1996), the first [[Pioneer Venus project|American spacecraft to orbit and land on Venus]] (1978), the [[Cassini–Huygens|first spacecraft to orbit Saturn]] (2004), and [[MESSENGER|to orbit Mercury]] (2011).

==History==
The CCAFS area had been used by the United States government since 1949 when President [[Harry S. Truman]] established the Joint Long Range Proving Grounds at Cape Canaveral to test missiles.<ref>[http://www.patrick.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=4514 EVOLUTION OF THE 45TH SPACE WING]</ref> The location was among the best in the continental United States for this purpose, as it allowed for launches out over the Atlantic Ocean, and is closer to the [[equator]] than most other parts of the United States, allowing rockets to get a boost from the Earth's rotation.[[File:Bumper8 launch-GPN-2000-000613.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A [[Bumper (rocket)|Bumper V-2]] was the first missile launched at Cape Canaveral, on July 24, 1950.]]

On June 1, 1948, the [[U.S. Navy]] transferred the former [[Naval Air Station Banana River]] to the [[U.S. Air Force]], with USAF renaming the facility the Joint Long Range Proving Ground (JLRPG) Base on June 10, 1949. On October 1, 1949, the Joint Long Range Proving Ground Base was transferred from the Air Materiel Command to the Air Force Division of the Joint Long Range Proving Ground. On May 17, 1950, the base was renamed the Long Range Proving Ground Base, but three months later was renamed [[Patrick Air Force Base]], in honor of Army Maj. Gen. [[Mason Patrick]].<ref name="CAST_p1-5">CAST 1999, p. 1-5.</ref>  In 1951, the Air Force established the [[Eastern Test Range|Air Force Missile Test Center]].

Early American [[sub-orbital]] rocket flights were achieved at Cape Canaveral in 1956.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/sites/capallc5.htm Cape Canaveral LC5]</ref> These flights occurred shortly after sub-orbital flights launched from [[White Sands Missile Range]], such as the [[Viking (rocket)|Viking 12 sounding rocket]] on February 4, 1955.
<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/viking.htm Encyclopedia Astronautica]</ref>
Following the Soviet Union's successful [[Sputnik 1]], the US attempted its first launch of an artificial satellite from Cape Canaveral on December 6, 1957. However, the rocket carrying [[Vanguard TV3]] blew up on the launch pad.<ref>By MILTON BRACKER Special to The New,York Times. (1957, Dec 07). Vanguard rocket burns on beach; failure to launch test satellite assailed as blow to U.S. prestige. New York Times (1923-Current File), pp. 1. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/114053516?accountid=11209</ref>

[[NASA]] was founded in 1958, and Air Force crews launched missiles for NASA from the Cape, known then as Cape Canaveral Missile Annex. [[Redstone (rocket)|Redstone]], [[Jupiter IRBM|Jupiter]], [[MGM-31 Pershing|Pershing]], [[Polaris ballistic missile|Polaris]], [[Thor (rocket)|Thor]], [[Atlas (rocket)|Atlas]], [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] and [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman]] missiles were all tested from the site, the Thor becoming the basis for the [[expendable launch vehicle]] (ELV) [[Delta rocket]], which launched [[Telstar 1]] in July 1962. The row of Titan (LC-15, 16, [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 19|19]], 20) and Atlas (LC-11, 12, 13, [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 14|14]]) launch pads along the coast came to be known as '''Missile Row''' in the 1960s.

===Mercury and Gemini===
{{Main|Project Mercury|Project Gemini}}
NASA's early manned spaceflight programs, [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], were prepared for launch from Cape launch pads [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 5|LC-5]], LC-14 and LC-19 by U.S. Air Force crews. Mercury's objectives were to place a manned spacecraft in Earth orbit, investigate human performance and ability to function in space, and safely recover the astronaut and spacecraft. The first two manned tests used the [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle|Redstone]] booster from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 5|LC-5]] for the 1961 suborbital flights of [[Alan Shepard]] on May 5 (the first American in space) and [[Gus Grissom]] on July 21. The first American in orbit, and the first carried by the larger [[Atlas LV-3B|Atlas D]] rocket, was [[John Glenn]], launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 14|LC-14]] on February 20, 1962. On February 22, Vice-President  [[Lyndon Johnson]] escorted Glenn to the Cape from Patrick Air Force Base. The President [[John Kennedy]] rode with Glenn to a ceremony where Glenn was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Service Medal]].

Three more orbital flights followed.

The two-man Gemini spacecraft, with its [[Titan II GLV|Titan II]] booster, based on the [[LGM-25C Titan II|military ICBM]], and the unmanned [[Agena Target Vehicle|Atlas-Agena Target Vehicle]], helped carry out [[Space rendezvous#First rendezvous|rendezvous and docking]] and [[extra-vehicular activity]] missions critical for Apollo. Twelve Gemini missions were launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 19|LC-19]], the last ten of which were manned. The first manned flight, [[Gemini 3]], took place on March 23, 1965. The final flight, [[Gemini 12]], launched on November 11, 1966. Seven Atlas-Agenas were launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 14|LC-14]], two of which failed to reach orbit.

===Early Apollo missions===
{{main|Apollo program}}
The Apollo program, with the goal of landing a man on the Moon, required the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn family]] of rockets. The lunar missions required the large [[Saturn V]] rocket, for which NASA built a new launch facility, the [[Kennedy Space Center]] located west and north of Canaveral on Merrit Island. But the early members of this family, the two-stage [[Saturn I]] and [[Saturn IB|IB]], fit within the launch capabilities of the Cape's [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Launch Complexes 34]] and [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 37|37]]. The first four Saturn I development launches were made from LC-34 between October 27, 1961 and March 28, 1963. These were followed by the final test launch and five operational launches from LC-37 between January 29, 1964 and July 30, 1965.

The Saturn IB uprated the capability of the Saturn I, so that it could be used for Earth orbital tests of the Apollo spacecraft. Three unmanned test launches were made on LC-34 and LC-37 between February 26 and August 25, 1966. The first manned [[Apollo Command Module|Command Module]] flight [[Apollo 1]] (initially designated AS-204), was planned to launch from LC-34 on February 21, 1967, but on January 27, 1967, the entire crew of [[Gus Grissom]], [[Edward Higgins White|Ed White]] and [[Roger B. Chaffee|Roger Chaffee]] were killed in a Command Module fire during a spacecraft test on the launch pad. The AS-204 rocket was used to launch [[Apollo 5]] from LC-37 on January 22, 1968, the unmanned, first Earth orbital test flight of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]]. After significant changes to the Command Module, [[Apollo 7]] was launched from LC-34 to fulfill Apollo 1's mission, using Saturn IB AS-205 on October 11, 1968.

In 1972, NASA deactivated both LC-34 and LC-37. It briefly consisdered reactivating both for [[Apollo Applications Program]] launches after the end of Apollo, but instead modified the Kennedy Space Center launch complex to handle the Saturn IB for the [[Skylab]] and [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] launches. The LC-34 service structure and umbillical tower were razed, leaving only the concrete launch pedestal as a monument to the Apollo 1 crew. In 2001, LC-37 was recommissioned and converted to service [[Delta IV]] launch vehicles.

===Temporary name change===
On November 29, 1963, following the death of President Kennedy, his successor [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] issued [[s:Executive Order 11129|Executive Order 11129]] renaming both NASA's Merrit Island facility and "the facilities of Station No. 1 of the Atlantic Missile Range" (a reference to Canaveral AFB) the "John F. Kennedy Space Center". He had also convinced the governor of Florida to change the name of [[Cape Canaveral]] to ''Cape Kennedy''. This resulted in some confusion in the public mind joining the two. NASA Administrator [[James E. Webb]] clarified this by issuing a directive stating the ''Kennedy Space Center'' name applied only to Merrit Island, while the Air Force issued a general order renaming the military launch site ''Cape Kennedy Air Force Station''.<ref name="Moonport_appendixb">{{cite book

However, the geographical name change proved to be unpopular, owing to the historical longevity of Cape Canaveral. In 1973, both the Air Force Base and the geographical Cape names were reverted to Canaveral.<ref>[http://spaceline.org/capehistory/3a.html The History of Cape Canaveral, chapter 3]</ref><ref>[http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:304993 Cape Canaveral GNIS page]</ref>

===Subsequent activity===
The Air Force chose to expand the capabilities of the Titan launch vehicles for its heavy lift capabilities. The Air Force constructed Launch Complexes [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40|40]] and [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41|41]] to launch Titan III and Titan IV rockets just south of [[Kennedy Space Center]]. A Titan III has about the same payload capacity as the [[Saturn IB]] at a considerable cost savings.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Launch Complex 40 and 41 have been used to launch defense reconnaissance, communications and weather satellites and NASA planetary missions. The Air Force also planned to launch two Air Force manned space projects from LC 40 and 41. They were the [[Dyna-Soar]], a manned orbital rocket plane (canceled in 1963) and the USAF [[Manned Orbital Laboratory]] (MOL), a manned reconnaissance space station (canceled in 1969).{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

From 1974–1977 the powerful Titan-Centaur became the new heavy lift vehicle for NASA, launching the [[Viking program|Viking]] and [[Voyager program|Voyager]] series of spacecraft from Launch Complex 41. Complex 41 later became the launch site for the most powerful unmanned U.S. rocket, the [[Titan IV]], developed by the Air Force.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

With increased use of a [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40|leased launch pad]] by [[private spaceflight|private]] company [[SpaceX]], the Air Force launch support operations at the Cape are planning for 21 launches in 2014, a fifty percent increase over the 2013 launch rate.  SpaceX has reservations for a total of ten of those launches in 2014, with an option for an eleventh.<ref name=sn20140115>

==Unmanned launches at Cape Canaveral==
[[File:Pioneer I on the Launch Pad - GPN-2002-000204.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pioneer 1 atop its launcher]]
NASA's first launch, [[Pioneer 1]], came on October 11, 1958 from Cape Canaveral's [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|LC-17A]] using a [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor]]-Able booster. The civilian agency has used launch pads at Cape Canaveral AFS ever since for unmanned launches ranging from satellites to lunar probes, including the [[Ranger program|Ranger]], [[Surveyor Program|Surveyor]] and [[Lunar Orbiter program]]s during the 1960s.

NASA has also launched communications and weather satellites from Launch Complexes [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40|40]] and [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41|41]], built at the north end of the Cape in 1964 by the Air Force for its [[Titan IIIC]] and [[Titan IV]] rockets. From 1974–1977 the powerful [[Titan IIIE]] served as the heavy-lift vehicle for NASA, launching the [[Viking program|Viking]] and [[Voyager program|Voyager]] series of planetary spacecraft and the [[Cassini–Huygens]] Saturn probe from LC-41.

Three Cape Canaveral pads are currently operated by NASA and private industry for civilian launches: [[SLC-41]] for the [[Atlas V]] and [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 37|SLC-37B]] for the [[Delta IV]], both for [[United Launch Alliance]] heavy payloads; and [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40|SLC-40]] for [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9]] launches to the [[International Space Station]].

NASA's [[Launch Services Program]] (LSP) is responsible for oversight of launch operations and countdown management for all unmanned launches at Cape Canaveral which it does not operate.

Of the launch complexes built since 1950, only four remain active with two planned for future use.

Launch Complex [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 47|SLC-47]] is used to launch weather sounding rockets.

In the case of low-inclination (geostationary) launches the location of the area at 28°27?N put it at a slight disadvantage against other launch facilities situated nearer the equator. The boost eastward from the Earth's rotation is about {{convert|908|mph|m/s||abbr=in|disp=flip}} at Cape Canaveral against about {{convert|1035|mph|m/s||abbr=in|disp=flip}} at the European [[Guiana Space Centre]] in French Guiana.<ref name=as20110801>

In the case of high-inclination (polar) launches the latitude does not matter, but the Cape Canaveral area is not suitable because inhabited areas underlie these trajectories; [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], Cape Canaveral's West coast counterpart, or the smaller [[Kodiak Launch Complex]] in Alaska is used instead.

'''Zhou Tai''' (died c. 223),<ref name="SGZ death year" /><ref name="RDC death year" /> [[courtesy name]] '''Youping''', was a military general serving under the warlord [[Sun Quan]] in the late [[Eastern Han dynasty]] and early [[Three Kingdoms]] period. He previously served under [[Sun Ce]], Sun Quan's elder brother and predecessor.

==Service under Sun Ce==
Zhou Tai was from Xiacai County (???), Jiujiang [[Commandery (China)|Commandery]] (???), which is in present-day [[Fengtai County]], [[Huainan]], [[Anhui]]. Around the early 190s, he and [[Jiang Qin]] came to serve [[Sun Ce]], who was on [[Sun Ce's conquests in Jiangdong|a series of conquests]] in the [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] region. Zhou Tai was faithful and polite. He also made contributions by fighting in various battles under Sun Ce's banner. When Sun Ce occupied [[Kuaiji Commandery]] (present-day [[Shaoxing]], [[Zhejiang]]) after the [[Commandery (China)|commandery]]'s Administrator, [[Wang Lang]], surrendered to him, he appointed Zhou Tai as a "Major of Separate Command" (????) and put him in command of some troops.<ref>(????????????? ... ??????????????????????????????????) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 55.</ref>

===Saving Sun Quan===
Sun Ce's younger brother, [[Sun Quan]], favoured Zhou Tai so he requested for Zhou to be transferred to his unit. Once, when Sun Ce was away on a campaign against some bandits who had emerged in the six counties of Kuaiji, Sun Quan was left in Xuancheng County (???) with less than 1,000 men. Out of negligence, Sun Quan did not set up defence posts, so when thousands of bandits suddenly attacked Xuancheng, he attempted to flee. However, by then, Sun Quan had already been surrounded by the bandits, who attacked him and slashed at his saddle, causing much panic among his men. Only Zhou Tai, with his spirits roused, rushed to protect Sun Quan, emboldening those near him and making them able to fight again. When the bandits finally dispersed, Zhou Tai had sustained 12 deep wounds all over his body and he took a long time to recover. If Zhou Tai was not there on that day, Sun Quan would have surely perished. Zhou Tai's act of bravery was greatly appreciated by Sun Ce, who appointed him as the Chief (?) of Chungu County (???).<ref>(????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 55.</ref>

===Campaign against Liu Xun===
In 199, Zhou Tai followed Sun Ce to attack [[Liu Xun (Han dynasty)|Liu Xun]] at Wan County (??; in present-day [[Anhui]]) and [[Huang Zu]] at Jiangxia Commandery (???; commandery capital in present-day [[Yunmeng County]], [[Xiaogan]], [[Hubei]]). When he returned from the campaigns, he passed by Yuzhang Commandery (???) and was appointed as the Chief (?) of Yichun County (???). The residents in the counties under his governorship provided him with the necessary funding and supplies for his troops.<ref>(?????????????????????????????) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 55.</ref>

==Service under Sun Quan==
Sun Ce was assassinated in 200 CE while he was out on a hunting expedition and was succeeded by Sun Quan. In 208, Zhou Tai participated in the [[Battle of Jiangxia]] against Huang Zu. Later that year, Zhou Tai fought at the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] under the command of [[Zhou Yu]] and [[Cheng Pu]], and the allied forces of Sun Quan and [[Liu Bei]] scored a major victory over [[Cao Cao]]'s forces. Zhou Tai was also involved in the [[Battle of Jiangling (208)|Battle of Jiangling]], a follow-up to Red Cliffs, and Sun Quan's forces defeated Cao Cao's general [[Cao Ren]] and captured Nan Commandery (??; around present-day [[Jingzhou]], [[Hubei]]). After the battles, Zhou Tai was ordered to garrison at Cen County (??).<ref>(??????????????????????????????????????) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 55.</ref>

===Battle of Ruxu===
In 217, Cao Cao launched another attack on Sun Quan, leading to the [[Battle of Ruxu (217)|Battle of Ruxu]]. Zhou Tai participated in the defence of Ruxu, and Sun Quan's forces succeeded in driving back the invaders. After Cao Cao's retreat, Zhou Tai was appointed as "General Who Pacifies the Caitiffs" (????) and was ordered to remain behind to guard Ruxu. At the time, [[Zhu Ran]] and [[Xu Sheng]] were also stationed at Ruxu and were Zhou Tai's subordinates, but they were reluctant to submit to Zhou's command. Sun Quan made a special trip to Ruxu and he threw a party for all the military officers there. Sun Quan personally served wine to Zhou Tai and asked him to undress. He pointed at every scar on Zhou Tai's body and asked Zhou about it, whereupon Zhou would relate stories of the battles he fought in. At the end, Sun Quan told Zhou Tai to put on his clothes and they revelled through the night. The following day, Sun Quan instructed a herald to grant Zhou Tai his imperial parasol.<ref>(??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 55.</ref>

The ''Jiang Biao Zhuan'' (???) further described this incident as follows:

{{quote|
Sun Quan held [Zhou Tai's] arm and tears crossed his face. He called Zhou Tai by his courtesy name, saying, "Youping, you've fought like bears and tigers for me and my brother. You were willing to lay down your life and you've sustained wounds all over your body. [The scars] appear as though they have been etched into your skin. How can I not treat you like a brother, and not grant you any military appointments? You've rendered meritorious service to Wu, and I'll stand by you whether in honour or shame, and I'll share joy and sorrow with you. Youping, be merry. Don't be disheartened by the fact that you come from a humble background." Sun Quan then bestowed an imperial silk parasol of blue veils upon Zhou Tai. After all was over, he asked Zhou Tai to lead him out of Ruxu, with the sounds of drums and horns in the background.<ref>(??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????) ''Jiang Biao Zhuan'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 55.</ref>
}}

Zhu Ran, Xu Sheng and the other officers were impressed with Zhou Tai and they submitted to his command.<ref>(???????) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 55.</ref>

===Jing Province campaign===
In 219, Sun Quan sent his general [[Lü Meng]] to [[Lü Meng's invasion of Jing Province|invade and seize]] Liu Bei's territories in [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]], which were defended by [[Guan Yu]]. After the success of the invasion, Sun Quan planned to attack Liu Bei in Shu (covering present-day [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]]) so he appointed Zhou Tai as the Administrator (??) of [[Hanzhong]] Commandery even though Hanzhong was still under Liu Bei's control then. He also appointed Zhou Tai as "General of Roused Valour" (????) and awarded him the title "Marquis of Lingyang" (???).<ref>(????????????????????????????) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 55.</ref>

===Death===
Zhou Tai died sometime during the Huangwu era (222-229) in Sun Quan's reign.<ref>(?????) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 55.</ref> His year of death was not specified, but the Australian sinologist [[Rafe de Crespigny]] estimated it to be around 223.<ref name="RDC death year" />

==Descendants==
Zhou Tai's son, Zhou Shao (??), was appointed as a Cavalry Commandant (???) and commanded some troops. He fought in the [[Battle of Ruxu (222–223)|Battle of Ruxu]] of 222–223 against the [[Cao Wei|Wei]] general [[Cao Ren]] and made contributions in battle. Later in 228, he participated in the [[Battle of Shiting]] under [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]]'s command, which saw a victory for Wu forces over the Wei army led by [[Cao Xiu]]. Zhou Shao was promoted to Major-General (???) for his achievement. He died in 230 and was succeeded by his younger brother, Zhou Cheng (??), who inherited his military appointment and their father's marquis title.<ref>(?????????????????????????????????????????????)

The '''2003 London blackout''' was a serious [[power outage]] that occurred in parts of southern [[London]] and north-west [[Kent]] on 28 August 2003. It was the largest blackout in [[South East England]] since the [[Great Storm of 1987]], affecting an estimated 500,000 people.

==Immediate impact==

Power went off at about 18:26 [[British Summer Time]].

==Media coverage==

Even before the blackout the UK press were anticipating a UK equivalent of the [[Northeast blackout of 2003]], which occurred two weeks earlier (August 14) and affected about 100 times more people. For example, on August 15, The [[Daily Express]] had reported that the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]] might not be able to cope with predicted power surges in the winter of 2004. 

On the day of the blackout London [[Mayor]] [[Ken Livingstone]] declared the situation a "catastrophic failure" and "the normal British disease of underinvestment and not keeping your plant up to date". The press followed this lead. The power transmission company [[National Grid plc]] responded that, as they had invested £3000 million  in the last 10 years, the system certainly could not be described as old and decrepit.

Headlines such as "Power cut cripples London" ([[CNN]]) concealed the fact that over 90% of London's population was unaffected (but see below for the effects on the London Underground and mainline rail services).

Later it became clear to the press that the blackout might not be directly attributable to underinvestment, but this was still the main thrust of the stories: e.g. ''[[The Independent]]'', 30 August: ''"Just admit it, Mr Urwin. National Grid needs to invest more"''.

On 8 September the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' ran a story ''"Blackout report will take weeks"'' [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/articles/6595311?source=Evening%20Standard]. On 10 September National Grid published a 43-page report describing the causes of the blackout (and made it available on the internet [http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/library/documents/pdfs/London28082003.pdf]). The national [[BBC]] TV evening news did not cover this.

In mid October an anonymous National Grid engineer spoke to the BBC. It emerged that there may have been a maintenance problem not covered in National Grid's report (see below).

==Causes==

Initial reports were that there appeared to be a problem with a cable feed from the national grid in the [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] area of south London. A spokesman for National Grid said it was "an unusual occurrence", but "not even vaguely on the scale of [[Northeast blackout of 2003|what happened in the U.S.]]", adding that there was a fault in the 275 kV system. Later, Chief Operating Officer Mark Fairbairn said the problem was caused by the extremely rare coincidence of two faults happening only seven seconds apart.

Later National Grid's report revealed that the second fault, and the ultimate cause of the blackout, was the fitting of a wrongly rated part in a backup system - similar to fitting a 1 ampere fuse instead of a 5 ampere fuse. The first fault was a problem with a transformer. The impression was given that this fault was in a sense routine - about 13 such faults happen in a year. Normally it would be possible to switch the transformer out of the system and continue with power uninterrupted, but in this case the switch over exposed the second problem. 

On 17 October it emerged that the transformer fault was due to an oil leak, spotted some weeks before the blackout. The oil had been topped up but the leak had not been cured. National Grid's Director Of Transmission admitted to a "small backlog" of maintenance checks. On 21 October it became clear that the leak had been known of since March. National Grid had started a regular programme of topping-up until the transformer could conveniently be serviced. Evidently this was ultimately not enough to keep up with the leak; "it got bigger" said a spokesman.

==Effects==

The London fire brigade took around 400 calls and made 100 rescues of people stuck in lifts. All main rail services were at a standstill in south London and the south-east. Sixty percent of the [[London Underground]] was affected (London Underground had shut down the last of their independent generators in favour of using Grid supplies in 2002) and people were stuck underground. 270 sets of traffic lights were hit. To relieve the transport problems, buses accepted train and Tube tickets. Thousands of people took to the rain-soaked streets. Pubs filled up with people sitting out the delays.

==Restoration of service==

Power came back on after 34 [[minute]]s at 19:00 BST, but is reported to have taken about two hours to be restored fully in some areas.

'''William Duckworth''' (January 13, 1943&nbsp;– September 13, 2012) was an [[United States|American]] [[composer]] who also was an author, educator and Internet pioneer. He wrote more than 200 pieces of music and is credited with the composition of the first [[post-minimal|postminimal]] piece of music, ''The Time Curve Preludes'' (1977–78), for [[piano]]. Duckworth was a Professor of Music at [[Bucknell University]]. Nora Farrell, his wife, runs Monroe Street Music, which publishes many of his pieces.

==Biography==
Duckworth was born in North Carolina in 1943. He obtained a bachelor's degree in music from [[East Carolina University]], then master's and doctorates in music education from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana]].<ref>Kozinn, Allan. "William Duckworth, internet composer, dies at 69." New York Times 22 Sept. 2012: B8(L). Opposing Viewpoints in Context. Web. 18 Nov. 2013.</ref> He studied [[Musical composition|composition]] under composer [[Ben Johnston]] and wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on the notation of composer [[John Cage]]. In 2002 he was awarded a grant from the [[Foundation for Contemporary Arts]] Grants to Artists Award, as well as a fellowship from the National Endowment of the Arts in 1977. Duckworth collaborated with his future wife, Nora Farrell, on his internet projects before marrying her. Over the years Duckworth enjoyed a close collaboration with [[James Jordan (conductor)|James Jordan]] who frequently performs Duckworth's music with his world-renowned choral ensembles. Duckworth died at his home in West New York, N.J., after a long fight with pancreatic cancer.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/arts/music/william-duckworth-internet-composer-dies-at-69.html Kozinn, Allan, "William Duckworth, Internet Composer, Dies at 69," ''The New York Times'', September 22, 2012]</ref><ref>[http://www.artsjournal.com/postclassic/2012/09/strange-times-william-duckworth-1943-2012.html Kyle Gann's obituary for William Duckworth, accessed 13 September 2012]</ref>

==Work as a composer==
Duckworth wrote more than 200 pieces of music. His best-known compositions include ''The Time Curve Preludes,'' 24 short pieces for piano, and ''Southern Harmony'', which consists of 20 pieces for an eight-part chorus and employs features of shape note singing and minimalism. Other works include ''Mysterious Numbers'', written for chamber orchestra, ''Imaginary Dances'', for solo piano, and ''Simple Songs about Sex and War'', written in collaboration with poet Hayden Carruth. "The Time Curve Preludes" were recorded by [[Bruce Brubaker]] in 2009.<ref>Kosman, Joshua, [http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/CD-Bruce-Brubaker-Time-Curve-3290585.php "CD: Bruce Brubaker 'Time Curve'"], "San Francisco Chronicle", August 2, 2009</ref> In the last months of his life, Duckworth completed a piano concerto for Brubaker.<ref>Duckworth, William, [http://www.billduckworth.com/content/big-piano "BIG PIANO"], composer's blog</ref>

===The Time Curve Preludes===
''The Time Curve Preludes,'' a set of 24 short pieces for piano, has been described by music critic [[Kyle Gann]] as the first work of postminimalism.<ref>[http://www.artsjournal.com/postclassic/2004/01/academie_dunderrated_william_d.html Kyle Gann discusses Duckworth on Arts Journal, accessed 16 February 2010]</ref> The harmonic language is more active than preexisting minimalist conventions and doesn't satisfy the established expectations of minimalist practice.<ref>Byelick, "Duckworth: Time Curve Preludes," American Record Guide (Mar.-Apr. 2012): 89, GALE|A281901288.</ref> Along with its elements of minimalism, the preludes utilize many references to piano music of earlier periods, a tenet of postmodernism. The music makes reference to folk music, jazz, medieval music, [[Erik Satie]], banjo strumming, and the style of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].<ref>Jonathan W. Bernard, “Minimalism, Postminimalism, and the Resurgence of Tonality in Recent American,” American Music, Vol. 21, No. 1 (Spring, 2003): 128.</ref><ref>William Duckworth, The Time Curve Preludes, Neely Bruce (piano), 1979, CD2031 7-4529-52031-2-4, compact disc (liner notes by Kyle Gann).</ref> One of the facets of earlier minimalism is the lack of explicit structure, while this set of pieces are of much more recognizable structure, including the division of 24 separate preludes. The number of preludes itself is a reference to [[Bach]]'s [[Well-Tempered Clavier]], though it doesn't utilize every key as does the Well-Tempered Clavier. The music also utilizes the Fibonacci series in developing proportional and rhythmic patterns, which were set out with the use of a numerical grid.<ref>Duckworth, compact disc.</ref> The use of the Fibonacci sequence is not unique and appears in Bartok's music as well, and Duckworth's use of bitonality in Prelude No. 7 seems to be referential of Darius Milhaud's music. Most central to the piece is the Dies Irae, which is transformed into a major variant and serves as the central motive of the piece.<ref>William Duckworth, "The Time Curve Preludes," Web, 22 Sept. 2013, <http://www.billduckworth.com/time-curve-preludes-info>.</ref>

The Time Curve Preludes were composed between 1977 and 1978 on a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. They were premiered at Wesleyan University in 1979 by pianist Neely Bruce.<ref>Duckworth, web.</ref>

==Career in education==
Duckworth was professor and former chairman of the Department of Music at [[Bucknell University]] in Lewisburg, Penn.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} A 1992 profile in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine described him as a "hip, bright, innovative teacher."<ref>Zevin, Dan. "Dancing in the seats." Rolling Stone 639 (1992): 83. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. July 1, 2010.</ref> Duckworth instructed [[Martin Rubeo]], founder of the alternative rock band, [[Gramsci Melodic]], when the latter was a student at [[Bucknell University]].<ref>[http://media.www.theduquesneduke.com/media/storage/paper1278/news/2008/09/11/Features/Du.Alums.Band.To.Play.At.Diesel-3425157.shtml The Duquesne Duke 9-11-2008]</ref>

==Internet activities==
Much of Duckworth's late music was composed and performed as part of ''[http://cathedral.monroestreet.com/index.php Cathedral]''. Conceived in 1996 and launched on June 10, 1997, ''Cathedral'' is a work in music and art which depicts five "mystical moments in time": The building of the Great Pyramid in Giza, the building of Chartres Cathedral, the 19th century Native American Ghost Dance movement, the detonation of the atomic bomb, and the creation of the World Wide Web.<ref>Kozinn, Allan. "William Duckworth, internet composer, dies at 69." New York Times 22 Sept. 2012: B8(L). Opposing Viewpoints in Context. Web. 18 Nov. 2013.</ref>

More recently, ''Cathedral'' has served as the site for the distribution of ''The iPod Opera 2.0: The Myth of Orpheus, the Chronicler and Eurydice'', podcast in 26 episodes as MP3 and QuickTime video files. The video episodes may be downloaded and played on many different kinds of computer systems, including Apple OS, Windows and Linux computers, while the MP3 files may be downloaded and burned as an audio disk. The completion of the podcast in February 2007 was timed to coincide with the 400th anniversary of the first performance of [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi's]] ''[[L'Orfeo]]''.<ref>Kozinn</ref>

''Cathedral'' features an instrument called the PitchWeb, which allows anyone with a computer to play along with the Cathedral Band when the band is performing live over the Internet. Duckworth plays the PitchWeb on a laptop computer when the band performs live.<ref>Kozinn</ref>

''Cathedral'' was conceived during a conversation Duckworth had with his wife, Nora Farrell, a software designer who specializes in music and publishing web applications. Farrell collaborated with Duckworth on ''Cathedral'' and elements of it such as "The iPod Opera 2.0." As a member of the Cathedral Band, she edits the PitchWeb contributions by outside musicians.

A chapter in Duckworth's 2005 book, ''Virtual Music: How the Web Got Wired for Sound'', discusses the ''Cathedral'' site.

'''Interstate&nbsp;278''' ('''I-278''') is an [[auxiliary Interstate Highway]] in [[New Jersey]] and [[New York]] in the United States. The road runs {{convert|35.62|mi|km|2}} from [[U.S. Route&nbsp;1/9]] (US&nbsp;1/9) in [[Linden, New Jersey]] to the [[Bruckner Interchange]] in the [[New York City]] borough of [[the Bronx]]. The majority of I-278 is in New York City, where it serves as a partial [[beltway]] and is the only Interstate to pass through all five of the city's [[borough (New York City)|borough]]s. I-278 follows several freeways, including the '''Union Freeway''' in [[Union County, New Jersey]], the '''Staten Island Expressway''' ('''SIE''') across [[Staten Island]], the '''Gowanus Expressway''' in southern Brooklyn, the '''Brooklyn-Queens Expressway''' ('''BQE''') across northern Brooklyn and Queens, a small part of the [[Grand Central Parkway]] in Queens, and a part of the [[Bruckner Expressway]] in the Bronx. I-278 also crosses multiple bridges, including the [[Goethals Bridge]], the [[Verrazano Narrows Bridge]], the [[Kosciuszko Bridge (New York City)|Kosciuszko Bridge]] and the [[Triborough Bridge]].

Despite its number, I-278 does not connect to [[Interstate 78|I-78]]. There were once plans to extend I-278 west to I-78 east of the [[New Jersey Route 24|Route&nbsp;24]] interchange in [[Springfield Township, Union County, New Jersey|Springfield, New Jersey]]. This was cancelled due to opposition from the communities along the route. The segment that does exist in New Jersey was opened in 1969. There were also plans to extend I-78 east across Manhattan and into Brooklyn via the [[Williamsburg Bridge]]; this would have been a second location where the two highways would have interchanged, but these plans were also thwarted.  In New York, the various parts of I-278 were planned by [[Robert Moses]], an urban planner in New York City. Some of these completed segments predated the Interstate Highway System and are thus not up to standards. Over the years, portions of I-278 have required upgrading. In addition, they tore through many New York City neighborhoods, causing controversy. All of I-278 through New York City was completed by the 1960s. [[Interstate 87|I-87]] was once planned to follow the segment of I-278 between the [[Williamsburg Bridge]] and the [[Major Deegan Expressway]], but this ultimately became a part of I-278. In addition, the Bruckner Expressway portion of I-278 had been designated with different route numbers. At first, it was to be [[Interstate 895 (New York)|I-895]] between I-87 and the Sheridan Expressway and [[Interstate 678|I-678]] past there. Later, I-278 was planned to follow the Bruckner Expressway and the Sheridan Expressway to I-95 (with no route number for the Bruckner Expressway past there) before the current numbering took place by 1970, with I-895 designated onto the Sheridan Expressway.

==History==

===New Jersey===
The New Jersey portion of freeway was planned in 1955 as the Union Freeway and designated as I-278 in 1958. It was to connect the Goethals Bridge west to [[Interstate 78 in New Jersey|I-78]] at the tripoint of [[Springfield Township, Union County, New Jersey|Springfield]], [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union Township]], and [[Millburn, New Jersey|Millburn]].<ref name=nyt2>{{cite news |last=Wright |first=George Cable |title=New Roads with New Numbers Will Parallel Old U.S. Routes |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 19, 1958}}</ref><ref>{{cite map|publisher=[[Millburn, New Jersey]]|title=The Township of Millburn in the County of Essex New Jersey|year=1968|url=http://mapmaker.rutgers.edu/ESSEX_COUNTY/Millburn.jpg|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref> The western part of this planned freeway faced strong opposition. Even though it was to run along an abandoned railroad right-of-way, it would traverse through dense development in [[Roselle Park, New Jersey|Roselle Park]], [[Kenilworth, New Jersey|Kenilworth]], and Union Township, thereby making the project further disliked.<ref name=tbta>{{cite book|title=Arterial Progress 1959–1965|publisher=[[Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority]] |year=1965}}</ref><ref>{{cite map|publisher=New Jersey Department of Transportation|title=Union County Sheet 1|year=1967|url=http://mapmaker.rutgers.edu/UNION_COUNTY/UnionCoHighway1967_1.gif|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite map|publisher=New Jersey Department of Transportation|title=Union County Sheet 2|year=1967|url=http://mapmaker.rutgers.edu/UNION_COUNTY/UnionCoHighways1967_2.gif|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref> By 1967, state officials decided not to pursue the continuation of I-278, and used the funds for I-278 to build [[Interstate 195 (New Jersey)|I-195]] across Central New Jersey instead.<ref name=NJDOT1967>{{cite book|title=New Jersey Highway Facts|publisher=New Jersey Department of Transportation|year=1967}}</ref> Meanwhile, I-278 was built between US&nbsp;1/9 in Linden and the Goethals Bridge, opening to traffic in 1969 at a cost of $11.5 million.<ref name=nyt3>{{cite news|title=Elizabeth Link to Goethals Bridge Set To Open|newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 29, 1969}}</ref>

The Union Freeway Extension was revived again, and was to start at US&nbsp;1/9, but end at [[Interstate 287|I-287]] in [[Hanover Township, New Jersey|Hanover Township]], following the [[New Jersey Route 24|Route&nbsp;24]] freeway between I-78 and I-287. Nevertheless, the [[Federal Highway Administration]] rejected the proposal, thus ending the I-278 project.<ref>{{cite book|title=Report on the Status of the Federal-Aid Highway Program|publisher=[[U.S. Senate Committee on Public Works]]|year=1970}}</ref>

===Staten Island Expressway===
[[File:Staten Island Expressway new Exit 15.JPG|right|thumb|The brand-new exit&nbsp;15 on the Staten Island Expressway eastbound that opened on July 9, 2012]]
The Staten Island Expressway was first planned in 1941 as the Cross-Richmond Express Highway, a freeway connecting the Goethals and Verrazano bridges that was a part of a comprehensive system of freeways and parkways for the borough of Staten Island.<ref name=nycpd>{{cite book|title=Master Plan: Express Highways, Parkways and Major Streets|publisher=[[New York City Planning Department]]|year=1941}}</ref> In 1945, [[Robert Moses]] took over planning for the freeway and called it the Clove Lakes Expressway.<ref name=tbta2>{{cite book|title=Joint Study of Arterial Facilities|publisher=Port of New York Authority and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority|year=1955}}</ref> The plan received approval in stages through the mid-1950s and construction on the expressway began in 1959.<ref name=tbta/><ref name=nyt4>{{cite news|last=Bennett|first=Charles G.|title=Span Approaches Approved by City|newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 20, 1957}}</ref> By this time, the Staten Island Expressway had received the I-278 designation.<ref name=nyt2/>

The construction of the Staten Island Expressway was particularly noted for the massive movement of earth required to build the section of the highway between Clove Road and Price Street (now Narrows Road North, a service road of the expressway) between [[Grymes Hill, Staten Island|Grymes Hill]] and [[Emerson Hill, Staten Island|Emerson Hill]]. The earth removed from the cut in the hill was placed in a remote section of central Staten Island adjacent to Sea View Hospital and has since been nicknamed "Moses Mountain," as a backhanded compliment to the highway's builder.<ref name=tpb>{{cite book|last=Caro|first=Robert A.|authorlink=Robert Caro|title=[[The Power Broker]]|publisher=[[Random House|Vintage Books-Random House]]|year=1974}}</ref> Originally Moses intended for a spur of the expressway to follow the central ridge of the island, to connect with the [[Outerbridge Crossing]]. But local opposition to this spur was tremendous, and unlike previous projects by Moses, it went down to defeat when Mayor [[John V. Lindsay]] took office in 1966; the southern half of this proposed spur did get built, however, and was opened for traffic as the [[Richmond Parkway (Staten Island)|Richmond Parkway]], which was to have been the name of the entire roadway.<ref name=nyt/> The aborted section, from the Expressway to Richmond Avenue, has become part of the park system of New York City known as the [[Staten Island Greenbelt]].<ref name=nyt/> A [[ramp stub]] of an interchange on the expressway still exists cut into the hillside section of [[Todt Hill]]. Part of the trail system of the Greenbelt was using the abandoned overpass bridge as pedestrian crossing of the Expressway up until 2013, when it was dismantled for lane widening improvements.<ref name=gm/><ref name=sia3 />

The first link of the Staten Island Expressway opened in January 1964, from the [[Goethals Bridge]] to [[Victory Boulevard (Staten Island)|Victory Boulevard]]. The remainder opened later that year. The freeway had a total cost of $47 million.<ref name=nyt5>{{cite news|last=Ingraham|first=Joseph C.|title=Hour Will Be Cut for Some Trips |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 21, 1964}}</ref> In 1998, bus lanes were created on the eastern part of the Staten Island Expressway near the Verrazano Narrows Bridge; they were extended west to Todt Hill Road/Slosson Avenue in 2005.<ref name=nydn2>{{cite news|title=Push Is On for Varied Road Tolls|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=November 23, 1998}}</ref><ref name=sia2>{{cite news |last=Solomonow |first=Seth |title=New Bus Lanes Earn Cheers, Jeers from Motorists |newspaper=Staten Island Advance |date=November 27, 2005}}</ref> In 2008, the bus lanes were opened to high-occupancy vehicles during rush hours.<ref name=sia/>

It was announced in July 2008 that a major project to improve the notoriously bad traffic conditions on the expressway is expected to commence in spring of 2010 at a cost of $50 million. Included in the project is the construction of six new on- and off-ramps, improvements to and relocations of existing on- and off-ramps, and other improvements to surrounding roads.

===Brooklyn–Queens Expressway===
The Brooklyn–Queens Expressway was initially planned in 1936 as the Brooklyn–Queens Connecting Highway,  a link between the Gowanus Parkway and the [[Triborough Bridge]] .<ref name=nyt8>{{cite news|title=Freeways Are Now Urged|newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 13, 1936}}</ref> A part of the Brooklyn–Queens Connecting Highway opened in 1939 between Meeker Avenue and NY&nbsp;25.

In 1958, existing segments of the expressway were eligible for interstate highway funding. For a short time, the segment of highway between the Triborough Bridge and the Williamsburg Bridge was to be designated I-87 and continue north as the Major Deegan Expressway. By 1959, the I-278 designation was given to the entire length of the highway.<ref name=nyt2/> Since the roadway was constructed prior to modern expressway standards, the road needed to be upgraded to meet standards. By the 1990s, a major multiyear project begin in the 1980s brought upgrades to the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway.<ref name=nyt11>{{cite news |last=Faison |first=Seth |title=New Year Brings New Road Projects to Test Commuters' Patience |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 4, 1993 |accessdate=February 13, 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/04/nyregion/new-year-brings-new-road-projects-to-test-commuters-patience.html?scp=4&sq=brooklyn-queens%20expressway%20construction&st=cse}}</ref> In 1999, a proposal surfaced to put the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway in a tunnel.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Samuel |first1=Peter |last2=Poole Jr. |first2=Robert W. |title=How To Build Our Way Out of Congestion |url=http://reason.org/files/cc99ab897989d16735ecf32af82ed15b.pdf |publisher=[[Reason Public Policy Institute]] |year=1999}}</ref>  In the 2000s, the expressway underwent another upgrade project that replaced many bridges along the route.<ref name=qg>{{cite news |title=Most Of BQE Upgrade To Be Completed By Sept. |newspaper=The Queens Gazette |date=February 25, 2004 |accessdate=February 13, 2010 |url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2004-02-25/Features/Most_Of_BQE_Upgrade_To_Be_Completed_By_Sept.html}}</ref>

The BQE was designed by Robert Moses who had originally planned for the two-tiered section in Brooklyn Heights to go straight through Hicks Street, then connect to the Brooklyn Bridge at Adams Street. . Another route that was proposed by Moses would have continued up Hicks Street passed Atlantic Ave removing all the buildings on one side of court street (where Trader Joes is located today) destroying what is now a thriving commercial and residential district, then curving east into Tillary Street (at Cadman Plaza). The Brooklyn Heights Association was able to fight off these proposed routes which created the two-tiered section above Furman Street with the Promenade over it. Today this section of the BQE is in need of repair and the DOT proposed building a tunnel which was unable to get the support or funds. Most likely in the next couple of year one level will be repaired at a time which will force north and south bound traffic on the other level. This has yet to be confirmed by the DOT.

===Bruckner Expressway===
The Bruckner Expressway was originally the Bruckner Boulevard, designated as part of [[New York State Route 1A|NY&nbsp;1A]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Thibodeau |first=William A. |title=The ALA Green Book |edition=1938–39 |year=1938 |publisher=Automobile Legal Association}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York Info-Map |publisher=[[Gulf Oil Company]] |year=1940 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Esso]] |year=1940 |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref> In the 1930s, a freeway was planned on the Bruckner Boulevard alignment in order to provide a connection between the Triborough Bridge and a freeway leading north into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].<ref name=nycpd/><ref name=nyt8/> Robert Moses took over planning for the road in 1951 and called for an elevated freeway between the Triborough Bridge and the Bronx River and a depressed freeway east of there.<ref name=tbta3>{{cite book|title=Traffic Improvement of Bruckner Boulevard|publisher=Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority |year=1951}}</ref> Construction on the elevated Bruckner Expressway began in 1957 while it started on the depressed segment in 1959.

Over the years, the I-278 portion of the Bruckner Expressway has had different designations. When the Interstate Highway System was first created, the road was to be part of I-895 from I-87 to the Sheridan Expressway and I-678 from there to I-95.<ref name=nyt2/> Later, I-278 was planned to follow the Bruckner Expressway from I-87 to the Sheridan Expressway, where it would continue on that freeway to I-95, while the Bruckner Expressway was not designated an interstate north of there.<ref name="chevron"/> By 1970, I-278 was aligned onto its current alignment, with I-895 created along the Sheridan Expressway.<ref name="esso"/>

The original '''TACACS''' protocol, which dates back to 1984, was used for communicating with an authentication server, common in older [[Unix|UNIX]] networks; it spawned related protocols:
* '''Extended TACACS''' ('''XTACACS''') is a proprietary extension to TACACS introduced by [[Cisco Systems]] in 1990 without backwards compatibility to the original protocol. TACACS and XTACACS both allow a remote access server to communicate with an authentication server in order to determine if the user has access to the network. 
* '''Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus''' ('''TACACS+''') is a protocol developed by Cisco and released as an open standard beginning in 1993. Although derived from TACACS, TACACS+ is a separate protocol that handles [[AAA protocol|authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA)]] services. TACACS+ and other flexible AAA protocols have largely replaced their predecessors.

==History==
TACACS was originally developed in 1984 by [[BBN Technologies]] for administering [[MILNET]], which ran unclassified network traffic for [[DARPA]] at the time and would later evolve into the [[U.S. Department of Defense]]'s [[NIPRNet]]. Originally designed as a means to automate authentication &ndash; allowing someone who was already logged into one host in the network to connect to another on the same network without needing to re-authenticate &ndash; it was first formally described by BBN's Brian Anderson in December 1984 in [[IETF]] [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc927 RFC 927].<ref name="dooley">{{cite book | author1=Dooley, Kevin | url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596003678.do | title=Cisco Cookbook | publisher=O'Reilly Media | author2=Brown, Ian | year=2003 | pages=137 | isbn=9781449390952}}</ref><ref name="anderson">{{cite web | url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc927 | title=TACACS User Identification Telnet Option | publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force | date=December 1984 | accessdate=22 February 2014 | author=Anderson, Brian}}</ref> [[Cisco Systems]] began supporting TACACS in its networking products in the late 1980s, eventually adding several extensions to the protocol. In 1990, Cisco's extensions on the top of TACACS became a proprietary protocol called Extended TACACS (XTACACS). Although TACACS and XTACACS are not open standards, Craig Finseth of the University of Minnesota, with Cisco's assistance, published a description of the protocols in 1993 in IETF [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1492 RFC 1492] for informational purposes.<ref name="dooley" /><ref name="ballad">{{cite book | title=Access Control, Authentication, and Public Key Infrastructure | publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning | author1=Ballad, Bill | author2=Ballad, Tricia | author3=Banks, Erin | year=2011 | pages=278–280 | isbn=9780763791285}}</ref><ref name="finseth">{{cite web | url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1492 | title=An Access Control Protocol, Sometimes Called TACACS | publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force | date=July 1993 | accessdate=22 February 2014 | author=Finseth, Craig}}</ref>

==Technical descriptions==

===TACACS===
TACACS is defined in RFC 1492, and uses (either [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] or [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]) port 49 by default. TACACS allows a client to accept a username and password and send a query to a TACACS authentication server, sometimes called a TACACS daemon or simply TACACSD. TACACSD uses TCP and usually runs on port 49. It would determine whether to accept or deny the authentication request and send a response back. The TIP (routing node accepting dial-up line connections, which the user would normally want to log in into) would then allow access or not, based upon the response. In this way, the process of making the decision is "opened up" and the algorithms and data used to make the decision are under the complete control of whomever is running the TACACS daemon.

===TACACS+===
TACACS+ and [[RADIUS]] have generally replaced TACACS and XTACACS in more recently built or updated networks. TACACS+ is an entirely new protocol and is not compatible with its predecessors, TACACS and XTACACS. TACACS+ uses TCP (while RADIUS operates over UDP). Since TACACS+ uses the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) architecture, these separate components of the protocol can be segregated and handled on separate servers.<ref name="tacacs+v.radius">{{cite web | url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security-vpn/remote-authentication-dial-user-service-radius/13838-10.html | title=TACACS+ and RADIUS Comparison | publisher=Cisco | date=14 January 2008 | accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref>

Since TCP is connection oriented protocol, TACACS+ does not have to implement transmission control. RADIUS, however, does have to detect and correct transmission errors like packet loss, timeout etc. since it rides on UDP which is connectionless. RADIUS encrypts only the users' password as it travels from the RADIUS client to RADIUS server. All other information such as the username, authorization, accounting are transmitted in clear text. Therefore it is vulnerable to different types of attacks. TACACS+ encrypts all the information mentioned above and therefore does not have the vulnerabilities present in the RADIUS protocol.

[[Image:sewardcollins1917.jpg|thumb|300px|Seward Collins from his 1917 [[The Hill School]] yearbook.]]
'''Seward Bishop Collins''' (April 22, 1899 &ndash; December 8, 1952) was an American New York socialite and [[publisher]]. By the end of the 1920s, he was a self-described "[[fascism|fascist]]".

==Biography==
Collins graduated from [[Princeton University]] and entered New York's literary life in 1926, as a [[bon vivant]]. He knew many literary giants of his day, had an affair with [[Dorothy Parker]], and amassed a large collection of [[erotica]]. His bookstore, The American Review Bookshop, was at 231 West 58th Street in [[New York City]]. It carried many journals, broadsheets and newsletters that supported [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] causes in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].

In 1936, he married [[Dorothea Brande]]. A man of independent wealth, Collins published two literary journals: ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' (1927&ndash;1933) and ''[[The American Review#1930s|The American Review]]'' (1933&ndash;1937). 

Collins was infatuated with the writings of prominent [[humanism|humanists]] of his day, including [[Paul Elmer More]] and [[Irving Babbitt]]. Politically, he moved from left-liberalism in the early 1920s and eventually away from More's and Babbitt's [[Humanism]] to what he called "fascism" by the end of the decade. In ''The American Review'', he sought to develop an American form of fascism and praised Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] and German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] in an article titled "Monarch as Alternative," which appeared in the first issue in 1933. In that essay, Collins attacked both [[capitalism]] and [[communism]] and heralded the "New Monarch," who would champion the common good over and against the machinations of capitalists and communists. His praise of Hitler was grounded in his belief that Hitler's rise to power that year heralded the end of the communist threat, as is illustrated by this excerpt:

<blockquote>One would gather from the fantastic lack of proportion of our press&mdash;not to say its gullibility and sensationalism&mdash;that the most important aspect of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] revolution was the hardships suffered by [[Jew]]s under the new regime. Even if the absurd atrocity stories were all true, the fact would be almost negligible beside an event that shouts aloud in spite of the journalistic silence: the victory of Hitler signifies the end of the Communist threat, ''forever''. Wherever Communism grows strong enough to make a Communist revolution a danger, it will be crushed by a Fascist revolution.</blockquote>

In a 1936 interview that he granted to [[Grace Lumpkin]] in the pro-communist periodical ''[[FIGHT against War and Fascism]]'', Collins stated: "I am a fascist. I admire Hitler and Mussolini very much. They have done great things for their countries." When Lumpkin objected to Hitler's persecution of the Jews, Collins replied: "It is not persecution. The Jews make trouble. It is necessary to segregate them."  

''The American Review'' ran articles by many leading literary critics of the day, including the [[Southern Agrarians]], who, though hardly fascists, accepted a Northern publisher for their anti-modern essays. Several of them came to regret (and renounce) their relationship with Collins, however, after his political views became better known. One of them, [[Allen Tate]], wrote a rebuttal of fascism for the liberal ''[[The New Republic]]''. Nevertheless, Tate remained in contact with Collins and continued to publish in ''The American Review'' until its demise, in 1937.

In addition to featuring essays by many critics of [[modernity]], ''The American Review'' also became the a vehicle for spreading the ideas associated with English [[Distributism]], the supporters of which included [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]].   

Collins and his wife, a [[Mediumship|spiritual medium]], were actively involved with [[parapsychology|psychic phenomena]] during the 1930s. Their circle of friends included [[W.H. Salter]], [[Theodore Besterman]] and [[Mrs. Henry Sidgwick]], all of whom were affiliated with the [[Society for Psychical Research]] in London.

Today Collins is remembered primarily as a fascist editor and publisher who detested both capitalism and communism and counted many pre-War writers as his friends or colleagues. His essay "Monarch as Alternative," mentioned above, appears in ''Conservatism in America Since 1930'', a collection of essays by [[American conservatism|conservative]] writers published by [[New York University Press]] in 2003.

A 2005 biography of Collins, ''And Then They Loved Him: Seward Collins & the Chimera of an American Fascism'', argues that he was never a real "fascist." This book, which is based on Collins' actual papers and letters (as well as his [[FBI]] file), argues that Collins was in fact a [[Distributist]], i.e., a follower of [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]], who inexplicably called [[Agrarianism]] "fascism." Indeed, the book concludes that Collins then became a kind of [[scapegoat]] after 1941 when many other members of the American social and intellectual elites were eager to distract attention from their own flirtations with fascism in the 1920s and 1930s. Yet his praise of Hitler and Mussolini, noted above, testifies to his beliefs, at least during the 1930s.

'''Iona College''' is a [[Congregation of Christian Brothers]]-affiliated four-year college  in [[New Rochelle, New York]].  Located 20 miles north of [[Midtown Manhattan]] in suburban [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], the college occupies 45 acres (0.18&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) on North Ave. It also operates a Graduate Center in [[Pearl River, New York|Pearl River]] [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], [[New York]].

Iona offers [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], [[Bachelor of Science|BS]], [[BBA]], and [[Professional studies|BPS]] undergraduate degrees and several master's degree programs. An honors program, with special courses, seminars, mentoring, advising, and off-campus opportunities, is available to top students.

==History==

Before 1940, the Christian Brothers were in charge of Saint Mary's College, Halifax NS Canada. They had been invited by Archbishop Edward McCarthy in 1913 to revitalize the diocesan college. They received a contract that seemed too generous to McCarthy's successors. Archbishop John T McNally succeeded in replacing them with the Jesuits in 1940. The brothers were given a tearful send off at a great dinner held at the Nova Scotian Hotel. Brother Cornelia was one of the teachers at SMC. Peter McGuigan, The Intrigues of Archbishop John T McNally and the Rise of Saint Mary's University. Fernwood Press, 2010              

Founded in 1940 by the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers]], Iona College is a private, coeducational institution of learning in the tradition of American [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] higher education. In 1989, Elizabeth Seton College of [[Yonkers, New York]] merged with Iona.<ref name="Iona Merges With Elizabeth Seton College">{{cite news|title=Iona Merges With Elizabeth Seton College|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/19/nyregion/iona-merges-with-elizabeth-seton-college.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=February 19, 1989|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref>

Iona College opened its doors in 1940, with nine Christian Brothers and six lay faculty greeting the first class. The Christian Brothers named the College after Iona, the island monastery of St. Columba [in Irish: St. Colmcille] located off the west coast of [[Scotland]]. Columba founded the monastery in 563 AD. The Congregation of Christian Brothers was itself founded in 1802 by Blessed Edmund Ignatius Rice in [[Waterford, Ireland]].

In 1940, the idea of the College's founding community of Brothers was to start a small, affordable college for the sons of New York's working class. At the time, the Christian Brothers taught in seven high schools in the Archdiocese of New York, including [[Iona Preparatory School|Iona Prep]], All Hallows, [[Rice High School (Manhattan)|Rice High School]], and [[Power Memorial Academy|Power Memorial]]. They recognized that many of their graduates could not afford the cost of local universities, and so they started Iona.

Iona started small, and shrank further after the U.S. entered [[World War II]] with the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941.  For example, the fall of 1943 began with 94 students, but the spring term ended with fewer than 40.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  Only three members of the entering class went on to receive Bachelor of Arts degrees in August, 1944. Returning veterans, attracted by Iona's practical majors like Accounting{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} (and their tuition underwritten by the G.I. Bill), soon stretched the College to its limits. Seventy-one men graduated in 1948 and 300 in 1950.

Guiding the College through its tenuous start and sudden growth were two gifted Presidents: Br. William Barnabas Cornelia (1885–1955) and Br. Arthur Austin Loftus (1904–1979). One a native of Dublin, the other a native New Yorker, they helped Iona expand and prosper throughout the middle of the 20th century.

In 2011, Iona College admitted that it had reported inflated figures from 2002&ndash;2011 about "acceptance rates, SAT scores, graduation rates, and alumni who give annually" in a bid to influence [[college rankings]].<ref>[http://www.iona.edu/about/reportcommittee/docs/Audit-Report-Letter.pdf Audit Report Letter], Iona College.

==Mission statement==
According to its mission statement, "Iona College is a caring academic community, inspired by the legacy of Blessed Edmund Rice and the Christian Brothers, which embodies opportunity, justice, and the liberating power of education. Iona College's purpose is to foster intellectual inquiry, community engagement, and an appreciation for diversity. In the tradition of American Catholic Higher Education, Iona College commits its energies and resources to the development of graduates recognized for their ethics, creativity, and problem solving abilities; their independent and adaptable thinking; their joy in lifelong learning; and their enduring integration of mind, body, and spirit."  This statement was adopted in May 2012.<ref name="iona.edu">[http://www.iona.edu/about/mission.cfm ]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref>

==Academics==
The university is divided into two main academic units: a school of arts and sciences, and a business school. The ''School of Arts & Sciences'' is one of the two main schools at Iona College.

Academic lecture halls at Iona College include Murphy Center, McSpedon Hall, Arrigoni Center, Doorley Hall, Cornelia Hall, Amend Hall, Ryan Library, and Hagan Hall. The most recent additions to the campus include the newly constructed Robert V. LaPenta Student Union, the expanded Hynes Athletic Center, and the new residence hall in the heart of campus, East Hall.

Hynes Athletic Center hosts training centers for the college's Division 1 teams in addition to the 2,611-seat multi-purpose arena which hosts year round activities. 

Ryan Library is the major research and studying center of the campus. It was announced in 2005 that the library would go through an extensive modernization process. The renovation included an expanded print collection and larger spaces for students to study and do research. The project was completed in time for the Fall Semester of 2009. The library is a prominent symbol of Iona College along North Ave. 

Iona became the first metro-New York college with a completely wireless Internet campus in September 2001.<ref>[http://www.iona.edu/infotech/wirelessannc.cfm Iona.edu]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref>

===Loftus Hall===

Iona offers several different housing options for students. Loftus Hall, designed to house first year students only, is a 10-floor building. Each floor has six suites of two bedrooms (a double and a triple), one handicapped room which houses two people, and the RA (resident assistant) room. Loftus features a small computer lab, a kitchen, a laundry room, a quiet meditation room, a study lounge, and a vending lounge/game room.

===Conese and South Hall===

Conese, formally North, and South Halls are among the newer residence halls and were built in 2005. North and South were originally designed for upperclassmen; since the recent influx of accepted freshmen, Conese Hall has become the second, "unofficial" freshman residence hall. In 2014, Conese Hall was once again made to house only upperclassmen. North and South are identical buildings, and hold fewer people than Loftus. Both buildings have six floors, with four rooms on each floor: one suite of seven and three suites of 10. Each suite has two bathrooms, a small kitchenette, and a common room/living room type arrangement. North Hall was renamed to Conese Hall at Homecoming 2008, October 4, 2008, to acknowledge a $5 million gift to the college from Anna May and Eugene P. Conese.

===Rice Hall===

Rice Hall, nestled in the quiet back corner of Iona's campus, is primarily a single occupant dorm, though there are rooms for two, three, or four persons. It is the oldest dormitory at Iona, and was originally used to house the Christian Brothers as well as the brothers in training. The building is four floors, with laundry services being provided in the basement. Amenities include a game room, TV lounge, kitchen, computer lab, and gym.

===East Hall===

East Hall is Iona's newest residence hall, located in the very center of campus on the site of the previous Walsh Hall (an academic building which housed Iona's Psychology department). East Hall, which is three stories and holds an estimated 112 residents, accommodates students in a traditional corridor-style setting. There is an elevator in the center lobby area and lounges on both the second and third floors. It has rooms for groups of three and four students with a common bathroom on each wing. Each floor is separated by gender. The first and third floors are designated for female students and the second for males. Among its amenities are wireless internet, cable television, and telephone lines in each room. The main floor has a kitchen area, a mail room, and laundry facilities. There are three resident assistants (RAs) in the building and one campus minister.

===Eastchester Apartments===

Iona also holds several apartments in the Eastchester Apartment Complex, which is located down the block from the campus. Each building in Eastchester has an RA.

'''''Malum in se''''' (plural ''mala in se'') is a [[list of Latin phrases|Latin phrase]] meaning ''wrong'' or ''evil in itself''.  The phrase is used to refer to conduct assessed as sinful or inherently wrong by nature, independent of regulations governing the conduct.  It is distinguished from ''[[malum prohibitum]]'', which is wrong only because it is prohibited.

For example, most human beings believe that murder, rape, and theft are wrong, regardless of whether a law governs such conduct or where the conduct occurs, and is thus recognizably ''malum in se''. In contrast, ''malum prohibitum'' crimes are criminal not because they are inherently bad, but because the act is prohibited by the law of the state.

This concept was used to develop the various [[common law offences]].<ref>John A. Yogis, Q.C., ''Canadian Law Dictionary'', Barrons, 2003.</ref>

Another way to describe the underlying conceptual difference between "malum in se" and "malum prohibitum" is "iussum quia iustum" and "iustum quia iussum," namely something that is commanded (iussum) because it is just (iustum) and something that is just (iustum) because it is commanded (iussum).

'''''The Great Mouse Detective''''' is a 1986 American animated [[mystery film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], originally released to movie theaters on July 2, 1986 by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. The 26th feature in the [[Walt Disney Animated Classics]], the film was directed by Burny Mattinson, David Michener, and the team of [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]], who later directed Disney's hit films ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''. The film was also known as '''''The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective''''' for its 1992 theatrical re-release and '''''Basil the Great Mouse Detective''''' in some countries. The main characters are all [[mouse|mice]] and [[rat]]s living in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London.

Based on the children's book series ''[[Basil of Baker Street]]'' by [[Eve Titus]], it draws heavily on the tradition of [[Sherlock Holmes]] with a heroic mouse who consciously emulates the detective; Titus named the main character after actor [[Basil Rathbone]], who is best remembered for playing Holmes in film (and whose voice, sampled from a 1966 reading of "[[The Adventure of the Red-Headed League]]"<ref name="usa">{{cite news |url=http://travel.usatoday.com/alliance/destinations/mouseplanet/post/2011/02/How-Basil-Saved-Disney-Feature-Animation-Part-One/144296/1 |title=How Basil Saved Disney Feature Animation: Part One |accessdate=2012-01-16 |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=February 23, 2011}}</ref> was the voice of Holmes in this film, 19 years after his death). Sherlock Holmes also mentions "Basil" as one of his aliases in the [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] story "[[The Adventure of Black Peter]]".

After the failure of the Disney animated feature film ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'', this simpler film proved to be a success upon its initial release in 1986. As such, the new senior management of the company were convinced that their animation department was still a viable enterprise and this set the stage for the [[Disney Renaissance]].

==Plot==
<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words in length. Current length is 569 words.-->
In London, circa 1897, a young mouse named Olivia Flaversham is celebrating her birthday with her [[wikt:toymaker|toymaker]] father, Hiram. Suddenly, Fidget, a bat with a [[peg leg]], barges in, and after a brief struggle, disappears with Hiram. Fidget takes Hiram to Professor Ratigan who commands him to create a [[clockwork]] [[robot]] which mimics the Queen of the Mice so Ratigan can rule England. Hiram initially refuses to participate in the scheme, but agrees when Ratigan threatens Olivia.

Returning to London after a [[tour of duty]] in [[Afghanistan]], Dr. David Q. Dawson stumbles upon Olivia, who is searching for the renowned Basil of Baker Street. Dawson escorts Olivia to Basil’s residence and the two meet the detective. At first, Basil is reluctant, but when Olivia describes Fidget, Basil now realizes his chance to capture Ratigan. Basil and Dawson take Toby, [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s pet dog, to track Fidget's scent, where they find him in a toyshop stealing clockwork mechanisms and toy soldiers' uniforms. Fidget later traps Olivia by ambushing her from inside a toy cradle. Basil and Dawson pursue Fidget, but become entangled and fall behind. While searching the shop, Dawson discovers Fidget's checklist, to which Basil does some chemical tests to discover the list came from a riverfront near the [[Thames]]. Basil and Dawson disguise themselves as sailors and go into a tavern called the "Rat Trap" and follow Fidget to Ratigan's headquarters. They are caught, and Ratigan ties them to a spring-loaded mousetrap connected with a [[Rube Goldberg machine]]. Ratigan sets out for [[Buckingham Palace]], where Fidget and his accomplices kidnap the queen. Basil, along with Dawson, deduces the trap's weakness and escape just in time.

At Buckingham Palace, Ratigan forces Hiram to operate the toy Queen, while the real Queen is taken to be fed to Felicia, Ratigan’s pet cat. The toy Queen declares Ratigan the ruler of all Mousedom, and he announces his tyrannical plans for his new "subjects". Just then, Basil, Dawson and Olivia save Hiram and the real Queen, and apprehend Fidget (along with Ratigan's other henchmen). Basil seizes control of the mechanical queen, making it denounce Ratigan as a fraud and tyrant while breaking into pieces. The crowd, enraged by Ratigan's [[treason]], start climbing on him and defeating his guards. Ratigan frees himself and escapes on his [[dirigible]] with Fidget, holding Olivia hostage. Basil, Dawson, and Hiram create their own craft with a matchbox and some small [[helium]]-filled balloons, held together by the [[Union Jack]]. Ratigan tosses Fidget overboard to lighten the craft, and then attempts to drive the dirigible himself. Basil jumps on to the dirigible to confront Ratigan, causing him to crash straight into the [[Big Ben]].

Inside the clock, Basil manages to get Ratigan's cape stuck on some gears and rescues Olivia and safely delivers her to Hiram. Ratigan, however breaks free and attacks Basil, eventually knocking him to the dirigible, until the clock bell strikes 10:00 and Ratigan falls to his death, taking Basil with him. However, Basil manages to grab the wreckage of Ratigan's dirigible and save himself from falling just in time. Back at Baker Street, Basil and Dawson recount their adventures, as well as the queen's gratitude for saving her life. Afterwards, the Flavershams leave to catch their train. As Dawson tries to leave, a distraught new client solicits Basil’s help, with Basil noting that Dawson is his trusted associate, prompting Dawson to remain and assist Basil.

==Voice Cast==
* [[Barrie Ingham]] as '''Basil''': A detective, based on the fictional sleuth [[Sherlock Holmes]]. His main goal is to get Professor Ratigan behind bars and rescue Olivia Flaversham's father, while simultaneously preventing a royal assassination. There are a few differences between Basil in the book series and in the film version, such as mercurial moods in the latter. He also plays the violin rather well in the movie, whereas the book series stated Basil's violin playing was atrocious—instead, Basil played the [[flute]].

* [[Vincent Price]] as '''Professor Ratigan''': Basil's archenemy. He is based on [[Professor Moriarty]] from the Sherlock Holmes stories. He plots to seize control of the British monarchy. He and Basil are long-established archenemies. In the book series, it is revealed his given name is Padraic and that Ratigan is, in fact, a mouse. At the end of the film, he is knocked off [[Big Ben]] and disappears into the fog below, following a fierce battle with Basil, similar to the Sherlock Homes story "[[The Final Problem]]".

* [[Val Bettin]] as '''Major Dr. David Q. Dawson''', previously of the Queen's [[66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot|66th Regiment]] in [[Afghanistan]]. His character is based upon [[Doctor Watson|Dr. John H. Watson]] from the Sherlock Holmes stories. The interaction between him and Basil mimics that of Watson and Holmes, as Dawson is constantly amazed by Basil's deductions. He eventually becomes Basil's associate, friend, and personal biographer.
* Susanne Pollatschek as '''Olivia Flaversham''': An eight-year-old female mouse of Scottish descent who seeks Basil's help in finding her toymaker father.

* [[Candy Candido]] as '''Fidget''': Ratigan's bumbling [[bat]] henchman. He tends to do the dirty work for his boss. He has a crippled wing and a peg leg, and, as a result, he cannot fly. Ratigan throws him off the side of his flying machine near the end of the film, and he falls into the [[Thames]]. He survives the fall in the book (how is not explained).

* [[Frank Welker]] as '''Toby''': Basil's trustful [[Basset Hound]]. He technically belongs to [[Sherlock Holmes]], who lives above Basil.

* [[Alan Young]] as '''Hiram Flaversham''': Olivia's loving Scottish father. He works as a toymaker, and is kidnapped by Fidget to make the Queen Mousetoria robot for the evil Ratigan.

* [[Frank Welker]] as '''Felicia''': Ratigan's massive and pompous pet cat. Ratigan calls upon her by ringing a special bell to dispose of traitors or anyone who makes him angry. She is chased by Toby and attacked by Royal Guard Dogs in the final part of the movie and is not seen again. She is presumed dead.

* Diana Chesney as '''Mrs. Judson''': Basil's housekeeper. She adores Basil, but gets very annoyed when he mistreats her good pillows by shooting them with a [[pistol]]. She is based on [[Mrs. Hudson]].

* Eve Brenner as '''Queen Mousetoria''': The mouse queen of England, whom Ratigan attempts to depose of. She is a [[parody]] of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and the setting for this film coincides with the real Victoria's [[Diamond Jubilee]] (as can be seen with humans entering Buckingham Palace at the same time the mice are).

* Melissa Manchester (uncredited) as '''Miss Kitty Mouse''': A singer at a seedy tavern called ''The Rat Trap''

* [[Barrie Ingham]] as '''Bartholomew''': One of Ratigan's henchmen. He meets his end early on during Ratigan's song when he drunkenly calls his boss a rat; enraged, Ratigan throws him outside and summons Felicia, who devours him.

* [[Basil Rathbone]] as [[Sherlock Holmes]]: The famous human detective who lives above Basil. His voice is taken from clips of the original Sherlock Holmes films.

* [[Laurie Main]] as [[Doctor Watson|Dr. Watson]]: The medical associate/partner of Sherlock Holmes, who also lives above Basil. Unlike Rathbone, voice clips of [[Nigel Bruce]] were not used for the voice of Watson.

==Production==
As Disney was toiling with ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'', two animators removed from the film, [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], began developing an adaptation of the ''Basil of Baker Street'' books. Soon-to-be-removed Disney head [[Ron W. Miller]] supported the project. When [[Michael Eisner]] came in as Disney's CEO, he insisted on slashing ''Basil'''s projected $24 million budget in half (it was greenlit at $10 million).<ref name= "mick">Stewart, James B. (2005). ''[[DisneyWar]]'' (pp. 70-71, 84). New York: [[Simon & Schuster]].</ref>

The layouts were done on computers, and the use of video cameras made a digital version of pencil testing possible. The movie is also notable for its early use of [[computer generated imagery]] (CGI) for a chase scene that takes place in the interior of [[Big Ben]]. The movements of the clock's gears were produced as wire-frame graphics on a computer, printed out and traced onto animation cels where colors and the characters were added. ''The Great Mouse Detective'' is sometimes cited as the first animated film from Walt Disney Pictures to use CGI; in reality, 1985's ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' has this distinction.

Olivia was originally intended to be an older character with the potential as a love interest for Basil or even an infatuated Dr. Dawson, before it was decided that she should be a child to better gain audience sympathy. While Basil and Dawson were visually based on [[Sherlock Holmes (1939 film series)|Rathbone and Bruce]], their voices and personalities were not. Basil's voice was based on [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]]’s portrayal of Henry Higgins in the film ''[[Pygmalion (1938 film)|Pygmalion]]''<ref name="usa"/> while Dawson's voice was based on Disney animation legend [[Eric Larson]].<ref name="usa"/>

{{quote|"We didn’t want to make them simply miniature versions of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce," Clements affirmed. "Dawson’s not a buffoon. He’s a foil for Basil but also a warm and caring person."<ref name="usa"/>}}

Eisner's decision to name the film ''The Great Mouse Detective'' and not ''Basil of Baker Street'' (he thought "Basil" sounded "too English")<ref name= "mick"/> was unpopular with the filmmakers. Animator Ed Gombert wrote a satirical interoffice memo, allegedly by studio executive [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]], which gave preceding Disney films generic titles such as ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Seven Little Men Help a Girl]]'', ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|The Girl with the See-through Shoes]]'', and ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|Puppies Taken Away]]''.<ref name="gombert1986">{{cite web | url=http://www.drawn2gether.com/blog/2008/03/24/crew-picture-the-great-mouse-detective/ | title=Crew Picture The Great Mouse Detective | work=Drawn2gether | date=2008-03-24 | accessdate=February 23, 2012}}</ref><ref name="lat19860629">{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-29/entertainment/ca-22_1_big-cheese | title=Mousechievious Memo Upsets Big Cheese | work=Los Angeles Times | date=1986-06-29 | accessdate=February 23, 2012}}</ref>

==Reception==
The film was well received by critics during its initial release, including a "two thumbs up" rating from critics [[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Siskel and Ebert]].<ref>{{cite episode | title=Review of ''The Great Mouse Detective'' | series=[[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|Siskel & Ebert]] | airdate=February 1992 | accessdate=May 1, 2010 | network= Syndication ([[Disney-ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television]])}}</ref> The film also maintains an 81% "Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 16 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/adventures_of_the_great_mouse_detective/ | title=Reviews for ''The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective'' | publisher=[[Flixster]] | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>  London's [[Time Out (company)|''Time Out'']] magazine wrote, "As usual with [[film noir]] [...] it is the villain who steals the heart and one is rooting for in the breathtaking showdown high up in the cogs and ratchets of Big Ben."<ref>{{cite book|last=Peachment|first=Chris|editor-last=Pym|editor-first=John|title=Time Out Film Guide 2009|edition=17th|chapter=The Great Mouse Detective (aka Basil the Great Mouse Detective)|page=426|isbn=978-1-84670-100-9|year=2008|accessdate=November 9, 2010|publisher=Time Out Group Ltd}}</ref>

This film did fairly well at the box office, garnering around $25,336,794<ref>{{cite web|title=The Great Mouse Detective - Releases|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&id=greatmousedetective.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref> over a budget of $14 million<ref name="box office" /> during its initial release. Its moderate success after its predecessor's failure gave the new management of Disney confidence in the viability of their animation department. This led to creation of ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', released three years later, which signaled a [[Disney Renaissance|renaissance]] for the company.

==Home video==

After a re-release in February 1992, the film was released on VHS and [[Laserdisc]] in July 1992 as part of the [[Walt Disney Classics]] series. It was released again on VHS in August 1999 (with a game sheet inside it as part of a contest) and on DVD in 2002 with a short making-of featurette.

A new "Mystery in the Mist Edition" of ''The Great Mouse Detective'' was released on DVD on April 13, 2010 and on [[Blu-ray Disc]] on October 9, 2012. Unlike previous home video releases, which all used the 1992 reissue title print (''The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective''), this DVD restored the original 1986 title card, which had previously not been seen since the original 1986 release. The DVD also has the film in 1.78:1 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] Widescreen revealing more picture, bringing it closer to its original theatrical aspect ratio. This edition has not been released in Europe, but the [[Blu-ray]] edition is region-free and thus can be played in any region of the world.<ref>[http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Great-Mouse-Detective-Blu-ray/44740/ Blu-ray.com - The Great Mouse Detective Blu-ray: Mystery in the Mist Edition]</ref>

The '''Continental Mark II''' was a [[personal luxury car]] produced by the Continental Division of the [[Ford Motor Company]] in 1956 and 1957. Many aficionados of the automobile consider the Continental Mark II one of the classics of the postwar period.

==History==

Ford wanted a superior and standalone up-market brand aside from [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]], to compete with [[General Motors]]' [[Cadillac]] and [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation's]] [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]] brands.

The new Continental was not intended to be the largest nor the most powerful automobile; rather, the most luxurious and elegant American car available, designed to recapture the spirit of the great classics of the prewar period—with prices to match. The Mark II's inspiration was the celebrated [[V12 engine|V12]]-powered [[Lincoln Continental]] of the 1940s, among the most notable cars of that [[World War II|War]]-interrupted decade.

==Design==

Having considered using an outside design team, Ford turned inside to their own [[Special Products Division]]. In Fall 1952, they designated [[John Reinhart]] as chief stylist; [[Gordon Buehrig]] as the chief body engineer, assisted by [[Robert McGuffey Thomas]]; and [[Harley Copp]] as chief engineer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Design/Thomas_interview.htm |title=Reminiscences of Robert McGuffey Thomas |publisher=Autolife.umd.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}</ref>

Ford had wanted to use [[unibody]] technology, but Copp argued against such a choice for a high-brand/low volume model, which was required to be delivered into sale in a short time scale.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0s98D99c1tsC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=harley+copp#v=onepage&q=harley%20copp&f=false|title=The Lincoln story: the postwar years|author=Thomas E. Bonsall|accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>

What emerged was something quite unlike other American cars of the period. While other makes experimented with flamboyant chrome-laden styling, the Continental Mark II was almost European in its simplicity of line and understated grace.

There was something of the style of the early [[Ford Thunderbird]] at the front, with a tasteful egg-crate grille; a long, curving hood; and straight fenders to the headlights. The fender line went back to behind the doors, at which point the line kicked up a little before curving back down to the taillights.

Little chrome was used compared to other vehicles of the time, and the only two-tone paint combinations offered were limited to roofs being contrasted with bodies. The car had power steering, power brakes, power windows, power seats, power vent windows, and a tachometer.<ref name="flory2008"/> The vanes on the wheel covers were individually bolted inside the frame of the cover. It sported a high greenhouse and a wraparound windscreen. Fueling was accomplished via a swingaway left taillight. The Continental Mark II had only one option, [[air conditioning]], for $595.<ref name="flory2008"/> Cars with A/C had different body parts.<ref name="clymer1963">{{cite book|last=Clymer|first=Floyd|title=The Lincoln Continental|year=1963}}</ref>

Most of the car was hand-built to an exacting standard, including the application of multiple coats of paint, hand sanding, double lacquering, and polishing to perfection.

For power, the Mark II featured the newly offered {{convert|368|cuin|L|sing=on}} Lincoln V8. Standard equipment in the Lincoln line, the engines selected for the Mark II were effectively factory blueprinted, assembled from the closest-to-specifications parts available. Turning out {{Convert|285|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1956, the engine was tuned to produce {{Convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1957. The engine was mated to a three-speed Lincoln automatic, and both engine and transmission were subject to extensive pre-release testing. In a 1956 report from [[Popular Mechanics]], the Mark ll got 16.7 mpg at 50&nbsp;mph.<ref name="clymer1963"/>

Its perimeter frame was of ladder form with a central spine between the transmission and the crossmember at the kick-up ahead of the rear wheels. The crossmember under the front seat was of box form, but all the other six, unusually, were made of tubing (with that at the transmission augmented by box members). A Mark II chassis was used to create the [[Lincoln Futura]] [[concept car]].
[[File:Continental markiicom.jpg|thumb|1956 Continental Mark II.]]

==Sales==
The Mark II sold for around $10,000,<ref>{{cite web|author=by the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1956-continental-mark-ii-convertible.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "1956 Continental Mark II Convertible" |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-10-31 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref> the  equivalent of a new [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]] or two [[Cadillac (automobile)|Cadillacs]] (at least until the $13,074 [[Cadillac_Eldorado_Brougham#1957-1958|Cadillac Eldorado Brougham]] out-priced it in 1957). In spite of this, Ford estimated they still lost over a thousand dollars per car<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z7531/Continental-Mark-II.aspx |title=1956 Continental Mark II Images, Information and History (Lincoln Continental Mark II, MK2) |publisher=Conceptcarz.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref> on the 3,000 that were built.

About 1,300 were sold in the last quarter of 1955 after the car's October debut at the Paris Motor Show; another 1,300 or so in 1956; and 444 in 1957, some with factory-installed air conditioning. Initially, Ford accepted losses on the Mark II in return for the prestige with which it endowed its entire product line; but after going public, tolerance for such losses fell.

Famous owners included [[Elvis Presley]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]], and a cross section of the richest men in America. Taylor's car was a gift from [[Warner Bros.]] studio, and was painted a custom color to match her distinctive eye color.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2012/11/29/elizabeth-taylor-156-continental-mark-ii-dazzler/ |title=Elizabeth Taylor's 1956 Continental Mark II a dazzler |publisher=foxnews.com |date=2012-11-29 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}</ref>

The car was featured in the 1956 film ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'', starring Sinatra, [[Bing Crosby]], [[Grace Kelly]], and [[Louis Armstrong]].

==Brand confusion==
[[File:Continental Mark II rear.jpg|thumb|Rear view.]]
While technically never a Lincoln and manufactured by a separate new division, Continental, the Mark II was sold and maintained through Lincoln dealerships, featured a Lincoln drivetrain, and sported a Continental-emulating spare tire hump in the trunk lid, affectionally called a "Continental kit" for all the optional add-ons during the 50's. The outside mounted spare was 1st used on the 39-48 Lincoln Continentals. On its hood and trunk were four-pointed stars, soon adopted by Lincoln as its own emblem.

Handbuilt and resultantly expensive at around [[USD]]10,000 on launch, the quickly redesigned 1958 Mark III<ref>http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z11093/Lincoln-Continental-Mark-III.aspx</ref> was cheaper at $6,000, mostly because it recycled Lincoln parts and technology. The result was that the two products were difficult to differentiate within the customer's mind, and resulted in the Continental marque's being reabsorbed by Lincoln.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/auto_manufacturers_c.htm |title=All the Makes: Cadillac to Cunningham |publisher=Uniquecarsandparts.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}</ref> Confusion of the model as a Lincoln has reigned ever since.

==Status today==
Today, approximately half of the original 3,000 cars still exist in varying states of repair. An active owners' club exists,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lcoc.org/ |title=Lincoln & Continental Owners Club |publisher=Lcoc.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-04}}</ref> and thanks to the use of standard Lincoln mechanical components, most parts required to keep them going are available. Prices range between $8,000 for a running example in poor repair to $70,000 in concours condition.

From today's vantage point, it can be argued that the Continental Mark II was successful at being what it was intended to be: an American Rolls-Royce or [[Bentley Motors Limited|Bentley]], and a re-creation of the grand cars of the thirties. Unfortunately, it was not profitable to manufacture, even at its five-figure 1950s sales price.

After the deposition of [[Domnus II]] by the [[Second Council of Ephesus]], 449, [[Dioscorus of Alexandria|Dioscorus]] persuaded the emperor [[Theodosius II]] to fill the vacancy with one of the clergy of [[Constantinople]]. Maximus was selected and ordained, in violation of canon law, by [[Patriarch Anatolius of Constantinople]], without the official sanction of the clergy or people of Antioch.

Maximus, though his elevation was under questionable conditions, gained a positive reputation in the conduct of his diocese and province. He dispatched ''epistolae tractoriae'' through the churches subject to him as metropolitan, requiring the signatures of the bishops to [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo's]] famous ''[[Tome of Leo|Tome]]'' and to another document condemning both [[Nestorius]] and [[Eutyches]].

Having thus discreetly assured his position, he was summoned to the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in October 451, and took his seat without question, and when the  acts of the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] were quashed, including the deposition of the other prelates, a special exception was made of the substitution of Maximus for Domnus on the express ground that Leo had opened communion with him and recognized his episcopate ([[Philippe Labbe]], ''Concilia'', iv. 682).

His most important controversy at Chalcedon was with [[Juvenal of Jerusalem]] regarding the limits of their respective [[patriarch]]ates. It was long and bitter; at last a compromise was accepted by the council, that Antioch should minister to the provinces of the two Phoenicias and Arabia and that the three provinces of Palestine should fall under the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]].

Maximus next appears in a letter, dated June 11, 453, from Leo the Great, to whom he had appealed in defence of the prerogatives of his see. Leo promised to help him against either Jerusalem or Constantinople, exhorting him to assert his privileges as bishop of the third see in Christendom (i.e. only inferior to Alexandria and Rome). Maximus's zeal for the orthodox faith receives warm commendation from Leo, who exhorts him as ''consors apostolicae sedis'' to maintain the doctrine founded by St. Peter ''speciali magisterio'' in the cities of Antioch and Rome, against the erroneous teaching both of Nestorius and Eutyches, and to watch over the churches of the East generally and keep Leo informed about events. Leo closes his letter with a desire that Maximus will restrain unordained persons, whether [[monk]]s or laity, from public preaching and teaching.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3604119.htm Leo, Epistle 119]</ref>

Two years later, 455, the episcopate of Maximus came to a disastrous close by his deposition. The nature of his offence is nowhere specified. We do not know how much longer he lived or what became of him.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career and World Championship Wrestling (1994–2001)===
Guerrero made his [[professional wrestling]] debut in May 1994 wrestling in [[Mexico]] and [[Japan]] including [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]].<ref name=OWOW/><ref name="wcwbio">{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010119182000/www.wcw.com/2000/superstars/loco/|title=WCW Bio|accessdate=2009-06-18|publisher=WCW|archiveurl=http://www.wcw.com/2000/superstars/loco/|archivedate=2001-01-19|accessdate=2001-01-19}}</ref> He joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in May 1996.<ref name="wcwbio"/> He made his in-ring debut wrestling [[Darren Matthews|Steven Regal]].<ref name="wcwbio"/> While in WCW, Guerrero shared the limelight with his uncle Eddie, becoming a reluctant ally of his uncle's. As part of their [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]], Eddie would continually try to make Guerrero adopt Eddie's cheating tactics, but Guerrero often refused to do so. Eventually, Guerrero's treatment at the hands of Eddie would drive him "crazy" and Chavo adopted the [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] of a psycho fixated with a [[Hobby horse (toy)|hobby horse]] he dubbed "Pepé."<ref name="wcwbio"/> This led to a [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Norman Smiley]] in which Pepé was thrown into a [[woodchipper]] by Smiley.<ref name=nitro1>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/updates/1999012m.htm|accessdate=2009-06-19|title=WCW Nitro - 1/11/99|publisher=DDTDigest}}</ref> Another result of his insanity, was his inability to join Eddie's [[Latino World Order]] stable, which was a take-off of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]]. The stable included nearly every Latino wrestler in WCW except Chavo Jr. Towards the end of 1999 and early 2000, he adopted a salesman gimmick.<ref name="slam"/>

He was also a member of the comedy [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]] the [[Misfits In Action]] (MIA), billed as Lieutenant Loco. As Loco, he defeated [[Daffney]] for the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship|WCW Cruiserweight Champion]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triangle match]] also involving [[Glenn Gilbertti|Disco Inferno]] on the June 7, 2000 episode of ''[[WCW Thunder|Thunder]]''.<ref name=thunder>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/updates/2000061t.htm|accessdate=2009-06-18|title=WCW Thunder - Wednesday, June 7, 2000|publisher=DDTDigest}}</ref> Loco lost the championship to [[Lance Storm]] a month later on ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]''.<ref name=nitro>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/updates/2000075m.htm|accessdate=2009-06-18|title=WCW Monday Nitro - July 31, 2000|publisher=DDTDigest}}</ref> At [[WCW Mayhem#2000|WCW Mayhem]], Loco left the MIA and reverted to Chavo Guerrero, Jr.<ref name="wcwbio"/>

Guerrero won the Cruiserweight Championship from [[Mike Sanders (wrestler)|Mike Sanders]] on the December 6 episode of ''Thunder''.<ref name=thunder2>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/updates/2000121t.htm|title=WCW Thunder - Wednesday, 12/6/2000|publisher=DDTDigest}}</ref> Chavo defended and retained the title against Rey Misterio, Jr. on February 18, 2001 at the [[WCW Superbrawl Revenge#SuperBrawl Revenge|WCW SuperBrawl Revenge]] in Nashville, Tennessee.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment===

====Los Guerreros (2001–2004)====
{{See also|Los Guerreros#World Wrestling Entertainment|l1=Los Guerreros}}
Guerrero's contract with WCW was one of the twenty-five contracts that were included in WCW's sale to the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF). Like most of the wrestling talent that came over with WCW, Guerrero wrestled under the WCW banner as his WWF debut was as part of [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/010705.html|title=SmackDown - 5 July 2001 Results|date=2007-05-10}}</ref> a group of WCW and ECW employees who had, in [[kayfabe|storyline]], [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|invaded]] WWF after their promotion was bought out by WWF.

Guerrero spent time as an undercard wrestler in the company, which was soon rebranded World Wrestling Entertainment, before becoming a trainer for WWE's second ''[[WWE Tough Enough#Tough Enough 2|Tough Enough]]'' competition. Soon after returning to the active roster, Guerrero was aligned with his uncle Eddie, forming the [[tag team]] [[Los Guerreros]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/020919.html|title=SmackDown - 19 September 2002 Results|date=May 10, 2007}}</ref> In contrast to his previous WCW storyline with his uncle, Guerrero fully adopted his uncle's policy of "Lie, Cheat and Steal" to win matches as part of the gimmick. The duo won the [[WWE Tag Team Championship]] twice,<ref name=WWEtag>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwetag/|accessdate=2008-06-21|title=WWE Tag Team Championship official title history}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts|work="Wrestling’s historical cards"|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|page=112}}</ref> feuding with such teams as [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.|Rey Mysterio]] and [[The World's Greatest Tag Team|Team Angle]].

The tag team eventually [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|turned]] into [[face (professional wrestling)|fan favorites]] and as Eddie's popularity grew, he began seeking the [[WWE Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/040129.html|title=SmackDown - 29 January 2004 Results|date=May 10, 2007}}</ref> In one [[kayfabe|angle]], his uncle's singles title ambitions made Guerrero jealous and Guerrero turned on Eddie, broke from the team, and became a [[heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/040108.html|title=SmackDown - January 8, 2004 Results|date=2007-05-10}}</ref> He was soon joined by his father Chavo Sr. who sided with his son instead of his brother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/040115.html|title=SmackDown - 15 January 2004 Results|date=May 10, 2007}}</ref> Eddie defeated Chavo at the [[Royal Rumble (2004)|2004 Royal Rumble]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts|work=Wrestling's historical cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|page=114 }}</ref>

====Cruiserweight Champion; Kerwin White (2004–2005)====
After the feud with Eddie finished, Guerrero became a wrestler in the cruiserweight division and captured the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship]] on several occasions.<ref name="illustrated115">{{Cite news|title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts|work="Wrestling's historical cards"|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|page=115}}</ref>

[[Image:Kerwin white.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Chavo as Kerwin White vs [[Yoshihiro Tajiri|Tajiri]]]]
On February 15, 2004, at a Smackdown-exclusive [[No Way Out (2004)|No Way Out]] in Daly City, California, Chavo, with his father, [[Chavo Guerrero, Sr.|Chavo Classic]], in his corner, defeated Rey Mysterio to win the WWE Cruiserweight Title. On a May 4 taping of Smackdown! in Tucson, Arizona, Chavo would eventually drop the title to returning WWE Diva [[Jacqueline Moore|Jacqueline]] after he issued an open challenge for anyone to face him for his title. He would regain the title on May 16, 2004 at [[Judgment Day (2004)|Judgment Day]] in a match with his hand tied behind his back, though his father Chavo Classic untied it during the match. Chavo again dropped the title on a May 18 taping of Smackdown! in Las Vegas, Nevada, this time to Chavo Classic, who "accidentally" pinned his son in a Triple Threat Match which involved [[Matt Hyson|Spike Dudley]].

On an August 26, 2004 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Guerrero suffered a [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimate]] concussion due to [[Billy Kidman]]'s [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Shooting star press|shooting star press]] and had to be taken to the hospital.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/040826.html|title=SmackDown - 26 August 2004 Results|date=May 10, 2007}}</ref> Guerrero returned several months later as a fan favorite again, exacting revenge from Kidman, who had turned into a villain as a result of the injury to Guerrero,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/041021.html|title=SmackDown - 21 October 2004 Results|date=2007-05-10}}</ref> but shortly returned to his villainous persona after receiving a villain reaction after facing then-cruiserweight champion Funaki in a losing effort during a ''SmackDown!'' show in Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/041125.html|title=Velocity - 27 October 2004 Results|date=2007-05-10}}</ref>

Guerrero went on to become Cruiserweight Champion once again at [[No Way Out (2005)|No Way Out]] in 2005 after eliminating [[Paul London]] in a six-way cruiserweight [[Professional wrestling match types#Gauntlet match|gauntlet match]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts|work=Wrestling’s historical cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing |year=2007|page=117}}</ref> He would lose the title to London in a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] a few weeks later; Guerrero was the first person eliminated from the battle royal when everyone else in the match ganged up to throw him out right at the beginning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/050331.html|title=SmackDown - 31 March 2005 Results|date=2007-05-10}}</ref> In reality, Guerrero was forced to drop the title due to a broken orbital bone that would sideline him for several weeks.

On June 30, Guerrero became one of the last minute trades in the [[WWE Draft|2005 WWE Draft]], which saw him jump from ''SmackDown!'' to  the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] brand. The next week, on ''Raw'', he denounced his [[Hispanic]] heritage in favor of the [[wikt:Anglo-American|Anglo-American]] way.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/050704.html|title=RAW - 4 July 2005 Results|date=2007-05-10}}</ref> This came after two weeks of being battered by the Mexican faction, [[The Mexicools]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/050623.html|title=SmackDown - 23 June 2005 Results|date=May 10, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/050630.html|title=SmackDown - 30 June 2005 Results|date=2007-05-10}}</ref> It led to the changing of his persona to "Kerwin White", a [[Stereotype|stereotypical]], middle-class, white, conservative, Anglo-American man.<ref name=bol30>{{Cite book|title=The WrestleCrap Book of Lists!|last=Reynolds|first=R. D.|year=2007|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1-55022-762-9|page=30}}</ref> He dyed his hair blond and often drove a [[golf cart]] to the ring which held his [[Foreign object (professional wrestling)|golf clubs]].<ref name=bol30/> His new [[catchphrase]] became the [[pun]], "If it's not White, it's not right." The phrase later changed to "If it's not Kerwin White, it's not right". It was later phased out entirely. Soon after his debut, White started making suggestive remarks towards [[African American]]s, [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian Americans]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], and other non-White people, specifically directed towards then-babyface, [[Shelton Benjamin]]. On an episode of ''Raw'', White cost Shelton a match against [[Rob Conway]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/050905.html|title=RAW -September 5, 2005 Results|date=2007-05-10}}</ref> Benjamin defeated White by [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] the following week when Kerwin attacked Shelton with his golf club.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/050912.html|title=RAW - 12 September 2005 Results|date=2007-05-10}}</ref> At [[Unforgiven (2005)|Unforgiven]], White was beaten by Benjamin.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts|work=Wrestling’s historical cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|page=118}}</ref> White then hired [[Nick Nemeth]] (later known as Dolph Ziggler) as his new "[[caddy]]" to help him in his matches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/050926.html|title=RAW - 26 September 2005 Results|date=2007-05-10}}</ref>

====Aftermath of Eddie's death (2005–2007)====
[[File:Chavo Guerrero, Jr. in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada.jpg|thumb|upright|Guerrero makes his entrance at a WWE house show in Canada]]
On the morning of November 13, 2005, Guerrero checked into the same hotel as his uncle, Eddie,  in [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. Guerrero was alerted by hotel security that Eddie did not respond to a wake-up call and opened the locked door to the room, Guerrero found his uncle (more of a brother due to the fact they were close to the same age and grew up together) unconscious. Guerrero attempted [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] but Eddie was declared dead when paramedics arrived on the scene.

Later that afternoon, Guerrero appeared at a press conference with WWE Chairman [[Vince McMahon]] to address Eddie's death. They announced that both shows that week would be tributes to Eddie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wrestlemag.com/news/index.php?p=1368|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071012175602/http://wrestlemag.com/news/index.php?p=1368|archivedate=2007-10-12|title=Vince McMahon and Chavo Guerrero discuss this morning’s tragic news on the passing of Eddie Guerrero; tonight's TV tapings set to be a four hour tribute show|date=2007-05-10}}</ref> These events resulted in Guerrero dropping the Kerwin White gimmick and wrestling under his real name as a fan favorite to continue the Guerrero legacy. Under his real name, he defeated [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield]] (JBL) on the November 18, 2005 episode of ''SmackDown!'', using the [[Suplex#Vertical suplex|"Three Amigos"]] triple suplexes and the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frog splash|Frog Splash]] in tribute to Eddie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/051118.html|title=SmackDown - 18 November 2005 Results|date=2007-05-10}}</ref> He also used the cheating tactic of throwing a steel chair to an opponent who catches it (while lying down himself) as the referee turns around and disqualifies the opponent, which Eddie made famous.

On the February 24, 2006 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Guerrero attacked [[Randy Orton]] with the Three Amigos and the frog splash when Orton began to insult Eddie, and talked about the heritage of the Guerreros. Guerrero was soon dragged out by security, but kept yelling to Orton "You forgot about the Guerreros - the greatest wrestling family!" and "You forgot ''me''!".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/060224.html|title=SmackDown - 24 February 2006 Results|date=May 10, 2007}}</ref> On the February 27 episode of ''Raw'', Guerrero faced off against now-heel [[Shelton Benjamin]] in a qualifying match for the Money in the Bank ladder match at [[WrestleMania 22]]. During the match, Orton interfered and hit Guerrero with the [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|RKO]]. This allowed Shelton to get the pinfall victory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060227.html|title=RAW - 27 February 2006 Results|date=May 10, 2007}}</ref> On the April 3 episode of ''Raw'', Guerrero came out to address the crowd. He thanked the fans for all the support they had given him and his family and for keeping Eddie's spirit alive, but he expressed his disappointment in not having a title match at [[WrestleMania 22]]. He felt that night would become his WrestleMania and he was going to dedicate his match to his Eddie. He proceeded to challenge Shelton Benjamin for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]], but ended up losing after he missed a Frog Splash, allowing Benjamin to connect with his T-Bone Suplex finisher. In a segment that aired on ''WWE Unlimited'', an emotional Guerrero decided to quit WWE, in storyline, after believing he had let his family, Eddie, and the fans down and expressed his doubts about being a wrestler.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060403.html|title=RAW - 3 April 2006 Results|date=2007-05-10}}</ref>

On May 13, Guerrero appeared at a ''SmackDown!'' house show in El Paso, defeating then-heel [[Dave Finlay|Finlay]]. Guerrero also appeared at [[Judgment Day (2006)|Judgment Day]] to support [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.|Rey Mysterio]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/2006/matches/23848441/results/|title=Rey Mysterio's dream ride somehow continues|date=2006-05-21|first=Ed III|last=Williams|accessdate=2008-01-05|publisher=WWE}}</ref> Guerrero would then support Mysterio for a few weeks on ''SmackDown!''. At the [[The Great American Bash (2006)|Great American Bash]], Guerrero interfered in Mysterio's [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] match, ostensibly to help Mysterio.<ref name="GAB06">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/thegreatamericanbash/history/2006/matches/258159823/results/|title=Shattered Dreams|date=2006-07-23|first=Brett|last=Hoffman|accessdate=2008-01-06|publisher=WWE|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071211184750/http://www.wwe.com/shows/thegreatamericanbash/history/2006/matches/258159823/results/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=2007-12-11}}</ref> Guerrero turned into a villain once more, however, by hitting Mysterio with a steel chair, which allowed challenger [[Booker Huffman|King Booker]] to win the match.<ref name="GAB06"/> On the August 4 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Guerrero accused Rey of using Eddie's name to succeed, claiming that Rey disrespected Eddie's memory. Guerrero went on to beat Mysterio at [[SummerSlam (2006)|SummerSlam]], after [[Vickie Guerrero]] accidentally knocked Mysterio off the top turnbuckle. On August 25, Vickie came down to the ring to apologize to Mysterio and Guerrero. Vickie ended up turning on Mysterio by hitting him in the back with a steel chair. The following week on ''SmackDown!'', Vickie announced herself as Guerrero's new [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]]. Weeks later on October 8, Mysterio gained his revenge on Guerrero by defeating him in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|Falls Count Anywhere match]] at [[No Mercy (2006)|No Mercy]]. Guerrero eventually challenged Mysterio to an [["I Quit" match]], in which Guerrero won after inflicting multiple chair shots to Rey Mysterio and in turn injuring Mysterio's knee in process. As per the condition of the match, Rey was forced to leave ''SmackDown!'', possibly ending the emotional feud between the two.

A week later, [[Chris Benoit]], another old friend of Eddie's, tried talking to Vickie, but she would not hear it. It started a feud between Guerrero and Benoit and both men would have numerous confrontations over the following weeks. Benoit defeated Guerrero to retain the [[WWE United States Championship]] at the [[Survivor Series (2006)|Survivor Series]]. After weeks of continued interaction, the two faced off in a United States title rematch at [[Armageddon (2006)|Armageddon]] that Guerrero also lost when he tapped out to a [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]]. Guerrero got yet another rematch the following Friday, losing the match after Vickie hit Benoit with the title belt. Guerrero snapped after the match, knocking over Vickie and attacking Benoit.

Chavo remained inactive until the December 18, 2007 episode of ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW]]'', where he appeared after the main event between WWE United States Champion [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] and [[ECW Championship|ECW Champion]] [[CM Punk]] and proceeded to attack the vulnerable ECW Champion, sending a message that he wanted a title shot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/12182007/articles/whychavo|title=Why, Chavo?

With the beginning of 2008, Guerrero entered a feud with CM Punk regarding his ECW title. Guerrero challenged Punk to several matches<ref name="CMcountout">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/01012008/|title=Extreme resolutions|date=2008-01-01|first=Andrew|last=Rote|accessdate=2008-02-05|publisher=WWE}}</ref><ref name="CMDQ">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/01082008/|title=Retaining gold|date=2008-01-08|first=Kara A.|last=Medalis|accessdate=2008-02-05|publisher=WWE}}</ref> until he finally won the third via [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]] after interference from [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] to earn a championship match.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/01152008/|title=The Gold Standard shines|date=2008-01-15|first=Kara A.|last=Medalis|accessdate=2008-02-05|publisher=WWE}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/01152008/articles/edgespoils|title=Edge spoils CM Punk's run|date=2008-01-15|first=Andrew|last=Rote|accessdate=2008-02-05|publisher=WWE}}</ref> The previous matches he lost via countout and [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]].<ref name="CMcountout"/><ref name="CMDQ"/> On the January 22 episode of ''ECW'', Guerrero defeated CM Punk in a [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|No Disqualification match]] to win the ECW title which he won his  first world championship following interference from Edge.

At [[WrestleMania XXIV]], Guerrero lost the ECW Championship to [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] in a record [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Squash|eleven seconds]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/2008/matches/6514336/results/|date=2008-03-30|last=Murphy|first=Ryan|title=Big Red champion|publisher=WWE}}</ref> Shortly afterward, [[Justin LaRouche|Bam Neely]] debuted to act as his bodyguard. Shortly after losing the ECW Championship, Guerrero had several attempts to regain the ECW Championship including losing to Kane at [[Backlash (2008)|Backlash]] and also failing to become the number one contender at [[One Night Stand (2008)|One Night Stand]]. Guerrero became involved in the Edge-[[The Undertaker|Undertaker]] rivalry at this point, but Edge later turned on all La Familia teammates, including Guerrero. After this, Guerrero returned to singles and tag team action with Neely, feuding with ECW newcomers [[Evan Bourne]] and [[Richard Young (wrestler)|Ricky Ortiz]], and also attempted to regain the ECW Championship at [[Unforgiven (2008)|Unforgiven]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Championship Scramble match]], but failed. He also was embroiled in the Undertaker-Big Show storyline, and lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Casket match]] to the Undertaker on October 31. After that he tried to win the ECW Championship from [[Matt Hardy]], but he failed to win the title.

====Final storylines (2009–2011)====
[[File:Hornswoggled.jpg|thumb|Guerrero during his feud with [[Hornswoggle]] in 2009.]]
Guerrero was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the [[2009 WWE Draft#Supplemental Draft|2009 Supplemental Draft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2009draft/2009supplementaldraftresults/|title=2009 WWE Supplemental Draft results|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|date=2009-04-15|accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref> He then became involved in the feud between Vickie Guerrero and [[Santino Marella]], in which he attempted to help his Aunt in law on numerous occasions. At [[Extreme Rules (2009)|Extreme Rules]], Guerrero and his aunt faced Santino in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Hog Pen match]], in which the duo lost. Upon Vickie's departure from WWE, Chavo continued to feud with Marella and defeated him on the June 18 episode of ''[[WWE Superstars]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwesuperstars/archive/results0618/mainarticle|title=Packed to the brim|date=June 18, 2009|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}</ref>

Guerrero next feuded with [[Hornswoggle]], where the two constantly faced off in various types of matches (in which a handicap of some sort was imposed on Guerrero by the various celebrity guests left in charge of Raw every week) with Hornswoggle gaining the win. This feud won the award of Worst Feud of the Year by Wrestling Observer Newsletter.

As part of the [[2010 WWE Draft#Supplemental Draft|2010 WWE Supplemental Draft]], Guererro was drafted back to the SmackDown brand. On Chavo's first night back to Smackdown, [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] came out and [[chokeslam]]med him during a promo to welcome him back to Smackdown. He then started an alliance with Dolph Ziggler to feud with Christian. Guerrero and Ziggler teamed up in a tag team match against Christian and Hornswoggle, but they were defeated. The duo competed in a handicap match against Christian, which concluded in a victory at the hands of Ziggler and Guerrero. They both competed in a Battle Royal to determine who would replace The Undertaker in the World Heavyweight Championship match at [[WWE Fatal 4-Way|Fatal Four Way]], which was won by Rey Mysterio. On the July 9th episode of Smackdown, Guerrero competed in a triple threat [[Money in the Bank (2010)|Money in the Bank]] qualifying match, along with Dolph Ziggler and MVP. Throughout the match, it became apparent that Vickie Guerrero (Ziggler's manager) had told Guerrero and Ziggler to work together to ensure Ziggler qualified for Smackdown's Money in the Bank ladder match. During the match, however, when both MVP and Ziggler were down, Guerrero attempted to pin MVP to win the match himself, turning his back on Vickie and Ziggler, thus ending the alliance. Ziggler did win the match, however, by forcing MVP to submit to the sleeper hold. Guerrero soon started portraying [[Jack Swagger]]'s Soaring Eagle mascot, however this was later dropped.

On January 30, 2011, Chavo competed in the [[Royal Rumble (2011)|2011 Royal Rumble]] match as the tenth entry before being eliminated by the eleventh entrant, [[Mark Henry]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Carapola|first=Stuart|title=COMPLETE ROYAL RUMBLE PPV COVERAGE: A NEW CHAMPION IS CROWNED AND WE DISCOVER WHO WILL CHALLENGE FOR THE TITLE AT WRESTLEMANIA|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/54817/complete-royal-rumble-ppv-coverage-a-new-champion-is-crowned-and-we-discover-who-will-challenge-for-the-title-at-wrestlemania.html?p=1|publisher=PWInsider|accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>

On March 8, Chavo was announced as a NXT Pro to [[Darren Young (wrestler)|Darren Young]] for the [[WWE NXT#NXT Redemption|fifth season]] of ''[[WWE NXT]]''. On the May 6 episode of ''SmackDown,'' Chavo commentated on a match between [[Tyson Kidd]] and [[Místico|Sin Cara]], which Sin Cara won. After the match, Chavo and Sin Cara shook hands, with Chavo hinting at a future match between them. On the May 13 episode of ''SmackDown,'' Chavo interfered in the match between Sin Cara and Daniel Bryan, helping Sin Cara win. At [[Over The Limit (2011)|Over The Limit]], Sin Cara defeated Guerrero, and again on ''SmackDown'' (which turns out to be his last appearance on Smackdown), to end their feud. Afterwards, he mainly appeared on NXT with his rookie Darren Young. His last match in WWE was teaming up with [[JTG]] and [[Darren Young (wrestler)|Darren Young]] against [[Naofumi Yamamoto|Yoshi Tatsu]], [[Conor O'Brian]] and [[Vladimir Kozlov]] on NXT in a losing effort.

On June 25, 2011, at his request, Guerrero was released by WWE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/chavo-guerrero-released|title=Chavo Guerrero released|date=2011-06-25|accessdate=2011-06-25|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref>

Chavo is the son of [[Chavo Guerrero, Sr.|Salvador "Chavo" Guerrero]] and Nancy Vasquez.<ref>[http://searches1.rootsweb.com/usgenweb/archives/tx/elpaso/vitals/marriages/1970/elpam70b.txt VITAL RECORDS - EL PASO COUNTY, TX - MARRIAGE 1970 - Salvador Guerrero Yañez married Nancy Vasquez on May 10, 1970]</ref> He [[Marriage|married]] wife Susan in 1998 and has two sons. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

On August 30, 2007, Guerrero, along with nine other WWE wrestlers were named by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' to be given illegal steroids not in compliance with the Talent Wellness program. Guerrero received [[growth hormone|somatropin]], [[nandrolone]], and [[anastrozole]] between April 2005 and May 2006. [[Chris Benoit]], [[Eddie Guerrero]], and [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Brian Adams]] were also discovered to have been given steroids prior to their deaths during this investigation, as well as former WWE Wrestler [[Sylvain Grenier]].<ref name="suspension"/><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/31/AR2007083101961.html?hpid=moreheadlines Pro Wrestling Suspends 10 Linked to Steroid Ring - washingtonpost.com]</ref>

In June 2007, [[Chris Benoit]] (a close friend of Guerrero), his wife [[Nancy Benoit|Nancy]], and their son Daniel were found dead at their home (their deaths have since been [[Chris Benoit double murder and suicide|ruled a double homicide-suicide perpetrated by Chris Benoit]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=3315501|title=Police Paint Grisly Picture of Benoit Home|accessdate=2007-12-27|publisher=ABC News|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070821062228/http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=3315501|archivedate=August 21, 2007}}</ref> Guerrero was reportedly one of the last people to talk to Benoit and one of the people to whom Benoit sent text messages before committing [[suicide]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/GuestColumn/2008/12/02/7605856.html|title=The unbearable ambiguity of Benoit|date=2008-12-02|last=Muchnick|first=Irvin|accessdate=2008-12-06|publisher=SLAM!

'''Jazz Aviation LP''', formerly Jazz, is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[regional airline]] based at [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport]] in [[Enfield, Nova Scotia|Enfield]] and [[Halifax Regional Municipality]], [[Nova Scotia]],<ref>"[http://www.flyjazz.ca/en/home/aboutjazz/contactus.aspx Contact Us]." ''Air Canada Jazz''. Retrieved on May 19, 2009. "Head Office 310 Goudey Drive Halifax Stanfield International Airport Enfield, Nova Scotia, B2T lE4"</ref><ref>"[http://www.halifax.ca/mediaroom/website.pdf Map]." [[Halifax Regional Municipality]]. Retrieved on March 2, 2011.</ref> and is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Chorus Aviation]].  Jazz Aviation provides regional and charter airline services in Canada and the United States, generally under the brand name Air Canada Express (formerly Air Canada Jazz) and Jazz Charters.

It is Canada's second largest airline (only in terms of fleet size but not in terms of passengers carried annually, number of employees or destinations served) and operates as Air Canada Express for [[Air Canada]] to 79 destinations in Canada and the [[United States]]. Under a Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA), Air Canada sets the Jazz route network and flight schedule, and purchases all of Jazz’s seat capacity based on predetermined rates. Its main base is [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport]], with hubs at [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], [[Victoria International Airport]], [[Vancouver International Airport]], [[Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport]], and [[Calgary International Airport]].<ref name="FI">{{cite news | title= Directory: World Airlines | work= [[Flight International]] | page= 54 | date= 2007-03-27}}</ref>

In April 2011, [[Air Canada]] decided to retire the ''Air Canada Jazz'' brand and created a new identity for its regional operations, [[Air Canada Express]].  The Jazz brand is now entirely managed by Jazz Aviation LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Chorus Aviation]].

==History==
Established in  2001 as Air Canada Regional Inc. from the consolidation of the Air Canada connector carriers [[Air BC]], [[Air Nova]], [[Air Ontario]] and [[Canadian Regional Airlines]] (shortly after the successful merger between [[Canadian Airlines]] and Air Canada). The merger was finalised in 2002 with the creation of a new brand-Air Canada Jazz.  As of April 2011, it employed 5,081 people.<ref>[http://www.flyjazz.ca/english/media/corpFact.asp Corporate fact sheet]</ref>

The airline successfully launched an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) in February 2006&nbsp;– units of the income trust trade as JAZ.UN.

In February 2006, Air Canada announced that City Centre Aviation Limited (CCAL) had served a 30-day termination notice for Jazz's month-to-month lease of terminal space at Toronto City Centre Airport.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2006/02/28/to-jazzairlinesisland060228.html|title=Jazz voted off the Island|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=2006-02-28|accessdate=2009-12-03}}</ref>  The [[Toronto Port Authority]] itself does not control any significant terminal space at the airport, but it extended permission for Jazz to continue using the airport; however, since the airline could not find terminal space, they cancelled service to the airport at the end of February 2006. CCAL had been bought by REGCO Holdings, (now Porter Aviation Holdings), the owners of [[Porter Airlines]], which launched service from the airport later that year.

In 2006, [[ACE Aviation Holdings]] sold off all of their Air Canada Jazz assets.  Air Canada Jazz was then an independent company known as Jazz Air Income Fund.

In August 2008, Jazz Air removed all life jackets from its aircraft in order to lower fuel costs. According to the airline, passengers are to use floating seat cushions in the event of an emergency over water. The airline also stated that an event of a [[water landing]] on the regional airline routes was almost zero, as there is no operation over great bodies of water except for the [[Great Lakes]] and that in all circumstances, the airline always remains within {{convert|50|nmi|km}} from land, as stipulated in the law, which removes the obligation from carrying any flotation devices.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/article/484113|title= Air Canada's Jazz tosses life jackets|author=Winsa, Patti|publisher=[[The Toronto Star]]|date=2008-08-23|accessdate=2009-12-03}}</ref> Although at the time they did fly over the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] on flights to Newfoundland.

On 15 November 2010, the airline was restructured and changed its name to [[Chorus Aviation]], became a public corporation and will be traded as "CHR" at the Toronto Stock Exchange.<ref name="lapresseaffaires.cyberpresse.ca">{{cite web|url=http://lapresseaffaires.cyberpresse.ca/economie/transports/201011/09/01-4340864-jazz-se-transforme-en-societe-par-actions-et-devient-chorus-aviation.php |language=French|trans_title=Jazz transforms into joint-stock company and became Chorus Aviation |title=Jazz se transforme en société par actions et devient Chorus Aviation|date=9 November 2010}}{{fr}}</ref>

In 2012 it was announced that Air Canada would phase out the use of the "Air Canada Jazz" name and livery, and that it would no longer be used for branding.  The newly branded entity, sub-contracted to Chorus Aviation until 2020, is officially called "'''Air Canada Express'''", with  ''operated by Jazz'' featured on the aircraft.

==Other ventures==

===Thomas Cook Canada===
In April 2010, it was announced that Jazz Aviation LP had reached an agreement with [[Thomas Cook Group PLC]] to operate a fleet of at least six [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-200]] aircraft during the winter 2010/2011 season.<ref name="TCook">[http://www.financialpost.com/news-sectors/story.html?id=2764490 Jazz Air in agreement with Thomas Cook Canada]</ref> The deal with Thomas Cook Group PLC followed the collapse of Canadian airline [[Skyservice]], who previously operated aircraft for Thomas Cook during the winter season.  The aircraft, which were leased from UK operator [[Thomas Cook Airlines]], were used on flights to destinations in the Caribbean, Mexico and Central America.  On September 30, 2010, it was announced that the deal had been extended until 2015.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2010/09/30/con-jazz-vacation.html | work=CBC News | title=Jazz Air adds hot vacation spots to schedule | date=2010-09-30}}</ref> Sunquest charter service to sun destinations operated by Jazz Aviation, doing business as Thomas Cook Canada, began on November 5, 2010.  However, on April 13, 2012, it was announced that Thomas Cook Canada Inc. had terminated the remaining three years of the five-year flight services agreement with Jazz,<ref name="canadanewsire">{{cite news| url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/954425/jazz-aviation-lp-receives-notification-of-thomas-cook-canada-s-intention-to-discontinue-flight-services-agreement | work=Canada Newsire | title=Jazz Aviation LP receives notification of Thomas Cook Canada's intention to discontinue Flight Services Agreement | date=2012-04-13}}</ref> and the service ended on April 30, 2012.

For the 2011/2012 season, flights departed from the Canadian airports of [[Toronto]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Calgary]] and [[Vancouver]].<ref>[http://www.flyjazz.ca/en/home/thomascookcanada/routemap.aspx Thomas Cook Canada Route Map - Winter 2011/2012]{{dead link|date=January 2013}}</ref>  Destinations included [[Aruba]], [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], [[Puerto Plata Airport|Puerto Plata]], [[Punta Cana]], [[Montego Bay]], [[Cancun]], [[Cozumel]], [[Puerto Vallarta]], [[Los Cabos]] and [[Curaçao]].

===PLUNA Líneas Aéreas Uruguayas S.A.===
In April 2010, Jazz Air purchased a 33 1/3% interest in the Latin American Regional Aviation Holding Corporation (LARAH).  In turn, LARAH owns a 75% interest in [[Uruguay]]an flag carrier [[PLUNA]], while the remaining 25% is owned by the Uruguayan government. PLUNA said on July 6, 2012, that it was “suspending all flights indefinitely” and announced that 720 of the 900 staff would be sent on unemployment pay until a new associate for the company is found or the airline is definitively sold.<ref>[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=194177&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1417600&highlight= PLUNA  Press Release]</ref>

[[Bombardier Aerospace]] delivered the first of its new regional jet variant, the 75-passenger [[Bombardier CRJ700 series#CRJ700 Series 705|CRJ700 Series 705]] to Jazz Aviation on May 27, 2005. The aircraft was the first of 15 CRJ705 and 15 CRJ200 aircraft ordered in September 2004. Originally the order had been for 30 CRJ705s and 15 CRJ200s, but was changed to 15 and 15, subsequently 15 [[Embraer 175]] aircraft were added to the Air Canada mainline fleet.  A 16th CRJ705 was added to replace a CRJ100 which was written off.  The new aircraft undertook its first revenue earning flight on June 1, 2005, from [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]] to [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]. In mid-2006, the last Air Canada CRJ100 was transferred to Jazz.

On February 9, 2010, Jazz Aviation announced that it had finalized an agreement with Bombardier Commercial Aircraft for 15 Q400 ''NextGen'' turboprops with options for an additional 15 aircraft with deliveries to start in May 2011.<ref>[http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Jazz-Air-LP-announces-cnw-4142044501.html?x=0&.v=1 ]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref> They will be configured in a 74 passenger, all economy layout. The Q400s will be used to replace older CRJ100/200 models which are to be returned to lessor.  The Q400s will be delivered in the new [[Air Canada Express]] paint scheme, and will be the first aircraft in the Jazz fleet to have ''Air Canada Express'' branding.

===Fleet history===
Air Canada Jazz previously operated 10 [[BAe 146-200]] aircraft (on behalf of Air Canada) which it inherited from Air Nova and Air BC. They were retired from service in 2005.

Jazz previously operated a fleet of 6 [[Boeing 757-200]] aircraft, branded as Thomas Cook Canada for the 2010-2012 winter seasons.

Jazz operated 25 CRJ100 aircraft from 2004 to 2013 on behalf of Air Canada.  They were replaced by the Q400.

==Cabins==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}

===Business Class===
''Business Class'' is Air Canada's premium product in North America, and is offered by Jazz (doing business as Air Canada Express) on the CRJ705.  There are 10 seats ([[B/E Aerospace]]'s ''Spectrum'' business class seat) covered in grey leather.  The seating is 1x2 abreast (with a single seat at row 1 port side), with 37" pitch.  Each seat is equipped with a 110V power outlet and personal audio/video on demand featuring Air Canada's ''enRoute ?'' inflight entertainment system by Thales.  The CRJ705's galley is not equipped with ovens, therefore only cold meals are served.

===Economy Class===
Jazz's Dash 8-100/300/400 and CRJ200 fleet feature all ''Economy Class'' cabins.  The DHC-8-102s and DHC-8-301s feature the original ''deHavilland'' interior.  The DHC-8-102A and the DHC-8-311s feature an interior that was updated in 1990 by Heath Tecna.  The DHC-8-402 features Bombardier's ''NextGen'' interior.

The Q400s, CRJ200s, and CRJ705s (Economy Class) feature B/E Aerospace's ''Premium Economy'' Spectrum seat.  The ''Economy Class'' seats on the CRJ705 are equipped with personal audio/video on demand featuring Air Canada's ''enRoute ?'' inflight entertainment system by Thales, with only select seats having a 110V power outlet.
Seating is 2x2 abreast, exception being the first row of Economy Class on the CRJ705 where there is a single seat port side.  All seats are covered in either grey (CRJs) or blue (Dash 8s) leather.

==Onboard services==

'''Domnus II''', was [[Patriarch of Antioch]] between 442 and 449 and a friend of the influential Bishop of [[Cyrrhus]], [[Theodoret|Saint Theodoret]].

==Biography==
Domnus was ordained deacon by the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch]] [[Juvenal of Jerusalem]] in 429 AD and remained at the Monastery of [[Euthymius the Great|St. Euthymius]] in [[Palestine]] for two years. In 431 AD he left the monastery to aid his uncle, [[Patriarch of Antioch|Patriarch]] [[John of Antioch|John I of Antioch]], as part of the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] Controversy. Domnus went to [[Antioch]] to support proponents of the [[School of Antioch]] in favour of Nestorianism against supporters of [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Pope]] [[Cyril of Alexandria]] and his successor [[Dioscurus]].

In 442 AD, upon the death of his uncle, Domnus was elected successor with support he had acquired in Antioch. In 445 AD he summoned a synod of Syrian bishops and confirmed the deposition of [[Athanasius of Perrha]]. In 447 AD he consecrated [[Irenaeus of Tyre|Irenaeus]] to the see of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] (Theodoret, ''Epistle'' 110); but emperor [[Theodosius II]], commanded that the appointment should be annulled on the grounds that [[Irenaeus]] was both a ''digamus'' and a supporter of [[Nestorianism]]. He defended [[Ibas of Edessa|Ibas]], bishop of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], against charges of promulgating Nestorian doctrines, and summoned a council at Antioch (448) which decided in favor of Ibas and deposed his accusers. Domnus's sentence, though revoked by [[Flavian of Constantinople|Flavian]], [[Patriarch of Constantinople]], was confirmed by three episcopal commissioners to whom he and the emperor Theodosius II had committed the matter.

As a result, he was deposed at the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] on August 8, 449. Cowed by the authoritarian spirit of [[Dioscorus of Alexandria|Dioscorus]], and unnerved by the violence of Barsumas and his monks, Domnus revoked his former condemnation of [[Eutyches]], and voted for the condemnation of [[Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople|Flavian]], but in vain. He was the only bishop then deposed and banished who was not reinstated after the [[Council of Chalcedon]]&mdash;though this may have been by request so he could retire to his beloved monastery.

At that council [[Maximus II of Antioch|Maximus II]], his successor in the see of Antioch, obtained permission to assign Domnus a pension from the revenues of the church, and on his recall from exile Domnus returned to the monastic home of his youth, ending his days in the Monastery of St. Euthymius, where in 452 AD, according to [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]], he afforded a refuge to [[Juvenal of Jerusalem]] when he was driven from his see (Theophanes, p.&nbsp;92).

'''Big Bend National Park''' in the U.S. state of [[Texas]] has national significance as the largest protected area of [[Chihuahuan Desert]] [[topography]] and [[ecology]] in the United States. It contains more than 1,200 species of plants, more than 450 species of birds, 56 species of reptiles, and 75 species of mammals.<ref name="USGS08">{{cite book

The [[national park]] covers {{convert|801163|acre|ha}},<ref name="area"/> which is larger than the state of Rhode Island. Few other parks exceed this park's value for the protection and study of [[geology|geologic]] and [[Paleontology|paleontologic]] resources. A variety of [[Cretaceous]] and [[Cenozoic]] [[fossil]] organisms exist in abundance. [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] have discovered artifacts estimated to be 9,000 years old, and historic buildings and landscapes offer graphic illustration of life along the international border in the 19th century.

For more than {{convert|1000|mi}}, the [[Rio Grande|Rio Grande/Río Bravo]] forms the international boundary between [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]], and Big Bend National Park administers approximately {{convert|118|mi}} along that boundary. The park was named after the area, which is bounded by a large bend in the river and Texas-Mexico border (''see map at right below'').

Because the Rio Grande serves as an international boundary, the park faces unusual constraints while administering and enforcing park rules, regulations, and policies. In accordance with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], the park's territory extends only to the center of the deepest river channel as the river flowed in 1848. The rest of the land south of that channel, and the river, lies within Mexican territory.

==Geography and climate==
The park exhibits dramatic contrasts and its climate may be characterized as one of extremes. Dry and hot late spring and summer days often exceed {{convert|100|F}} in the lower elevations. Winters are normally mild but sub-freezing temperatures occasionally occur. Because of the range in altitude from approximately {{convert|1800|ft}} along the river to [[Emory Peak]] in the [[Chisos Mountains]] at {{convert|7832|ft}}<ref name="USGS08"/> a wide variation in available moisture and temperature exists throughout the park. These variations contribute to an exceptional diversity in plant and animal habitats. Some species in the park, such as the Chisos Oak (''[[Quercus gravesii]]''), are found nowhere else in the United States.

The {{convert|118|mi}} of river that form the southern park boundary include the spectacular canyons of Santa Elena, Mariscal, and Boquillas. The Rio Grande which meanders through this portion of the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], has cut deep canyons with nearly vertical walls through three uplifts made primarily of [[limestone]]. Throughout the open [[desert]] areas, the highly productive Rio Grande [[riparian zone]] includes numerous plant and animal species and significant cultural resources. The vegetative belt extends into the desert along [[Stream|creeks]] and [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyo]]s.

South of the border lie the Mexican states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and [[Coahuila]] and newly protected areas for flora and fauna, which are regions known as the [[Maderas del Carmen]] and the Cañón de Santa Elena.

In 2012, the park was named as an [[Dark-sky preserve|International Dark Sky Park]] by the [[International Dark-Sky Association]], which recognized the park as one of only ten places on the planet certified for dark sky stargazing.  In addition, the Association recognized the park as having the darkest measured skies in the lower 48 United States.  On many nights, park visitors can look up to the night's sky to see thousands of stars, bright planets, and the clear outline of the [[Milky Way]] band.  [[Astronomers]], both professional and amateur, are seen on many moonless nights gazing up at the stars through portable telescopes.

The oldest recorded [[tectonic]] activity in the park is related to the [[Paleozoic]] [[Marathon Uplift|Marathon]] [[orogeny]], although it is possible that [[Proterozoic]] events (over 550 [[mya (unit)|mya]]) have some deep control.  The Marathon orogeny (part of the [[Ouachita orogeny|Ouachita-Marathon-Sonora orogenic belt]]) is part of [[Thrust fault|thrusting]] of rocks from the [[South American Plate]] over the [[North American Plate]].  This can be best seen in the Persimmon Gap area of the park.  This orogenic event is linked to the lack of [[Triassic]]- and [[Jurassic]]-age rocks in the park.<ref name="USGS08"/>

Between the [[Triassic]] and the [[Cretaceous]] the South American Plate [[rifting|rifted]] from the North American Plate, resulting in the deposition of the Glen Rose Limestone, Del Carmen Limestone, Sue Peaks Formation, Santa Elena Limestone, Del Rio Clay, Buda Limestone and [[Boquillas Formation|Boquillas]] formations (preserved in the Sierra del Carmen–Santiago Mountains, Nine Point Mesa, Mariscal Mountain and Mesa de Anguila areas).  Also during this time, the Chihuahua trough formed as the [[Gulf of Mexico]] opened, which resulted in east-west [[Strike and dip|striking]] [[Fault (geology)|normal faulting]].<ref name="USGS08"/>  As a result of this depositional time, there are [[dinosaur]],<ref name="Lehman:2002">{{cite journal

Following the ending of rifting in the Late Cretaceous to the early [[Cenozoic]], the Big Bend area was subjected to the [[Laramide orogeny]].  This period of (now east-west) compression caused the northeast-facing Mesa de Anguila (an uplifted [[monocline]] on the southwest margin of the park), the southwest-facing Sierra del Carmen–Santiago Mountains (an uplifted and [[Thrust fault|thrust-faulted]] monocline that forms the boundary of the park on the east) and the Tornillo Basin. During the middle Cenozoic most of the [[volcanic rock]]s, including the Chisos group, the Pine Canyon caldera complex and the Burro Mesa Formation, formed.<ref name="USGS08"/>

The most recent tectonic activity in the park is [[Basin and Range]] faulting from the [[Neogene]] to [[Quaternary]].  This period of east-west extension has resulted in Estufa and Dehalo bolsons in the Chisos Mountains, as well as the Terlingua and Sierra del Carmen, Chalk Draw and Burro Mesa faults.  The [[Rio Grande]] has entered the Big Bend area roughly 2 mya, and since then extensive [[erosion]] and down cutting has occurred.<ref name="USGS08"/>

==Cultural resources==
Cultural resources in the park range from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Paleo-Indian]] period 10,500 years ago through the historic period represented by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] groups, such as the Chisos, [[Mescalero]]s, and [[Comanche]]. More recently, Spanish, Mexican, Anglo and Irish settlers [[farm]]ed, [[ranch]]ed, and [[Mining|mined]] in the area.

Throughout the prehistoric period, humans found shelter and maintained open campsites throughout the park. The archeological record reveals an [[Mesoamerican chronology|Archaic-period]] desert culture, whose inhabitants developed a nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle that remained virtually unchanged for several thousand years.

The historic cultural landscape centers upon various subsistence or commercial land uses. The riparian and tributary environments were used for subsistence and irrigation farming. Transportation networks, irrigation structures, simple domestic residences and outbuildings, and planed and terraced farm land lining the stream banks characterize these landscapes.

==Human history==
[[File:Pine Canyon Falls Pan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|150px|Pine Canyon Falls inside Big Bend National Park]]
During the early historic period (pre-1535) several Indian groups were recorded as inhabiting the Big Bend. The Chisos Indians were a loosely organized group of nomadic hunters and gatherers who probably practiced limited agriculture on a seasonal basis. The origin of the Chisos Indians is not known. Linguistically, they were associated with the Conchos Indians of northern Chihuahua and northwestern Coahuila. Their language group spoke a variation of [[Uto-Aztecan]], a language whose speakers ranged from central Mexico to the [[Great Basin]] of the U.S.

The [[Jumano]] was a nomadic group that traveled and traded throughout west Texas and southeastern [[New Mexico]], but some historic records indicate that they were enemies of the Chisos. Around the beginning of the 18th century, the [[Mescalero|Mescalero Apaches]] began to invade the Big Bend region and displaced the Chisos Indians. One of the last Native American groups to use the Big Bend was the [[Comanches]], who passed through the park along the [[Comanche Trail]] on their way to and from periodic raids into the Mexican interior. These raids continued until the mid-19th century. The last of the great military leaders of the native peoples of the region was an Apache of Spanish ancestry named Alzate, who was active as late as the late 1860s.

The European presence in the region begins circa 1535 A.D. with the first [[Spain|Spanish]] explorations into this portion of North America. The expedition of [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] passed near the Big Bend and was followed by other expeditions. Some of these expeditions were searching for gold and silver, or farm and ranch land. Others, such as those by the [[Franciscan]] [[missionaries]], were intended to establish centers in which the natives could be [[Evangelicalism|evangelized]]. In an attempt to protect the northern frontier of the [[New Spain]], from which emerged present day Mexico, a line of ''presidios'', or [[fort]]s, was established along the Rio Grande in the late 18th century. The Presidio de San Vicente was built near present-day [[San Vicente, Coahuila|San Vicente]], [[Coahuila]], and the Presidio de San Carlos was built near present-day [[Manuel Benavides]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]. Some of the presidios were soon abandoned, because of financial difficulties and because they could not effectively stop Indian intrusions into Mexico. The soldiers and settlers of these presidios moved to newer presidios where the interests of the [[Spanish Empire]] were more defensible. Such was the case of Santa Rosa Maria del Sacramento, now Muzquiz, Coahuila.

Very little study has been made of the Spanish occupation of the Big Bend following the abandonment of the presidios. In 1805, a Spanish settlement called Altares existed {{convert|30|mi}} south of the Rio Grande. The region became a part of Mexico when it achieved its independence from Spain in 1821. Mexican families lived in the area when English-speaking settlers began arriving following the secession of Texas during the latter half of the 19th century.

Following the end of the [[Mexican-American War]] in 1848, the U.S. Army made military [[Surveying|surveys]] of the uncharted land of the Big Bend. Forts and outposts were established across Trans-Pecos Texas to protect migrating settlers from Indian attacks. A significant proportion of the soldiers in the late 1800s were [[African American]] and came to be called the "[[buffalo soldiers]]," a name apparently given to them by the Native Americans. [[Henry Ossian Flipper|Lieutenant Henry Flipper]], the first American of African ancestry to graduate from [[West Point]], served in Shafter, Texas near the end of the 19th century. (Shafter lies west of the Big Bend along the highway from [[Presidio, Texas|Presidio]] to [[Marfa, Texas|Marfa]].) Ranchers began to settle in the Big Bend about 1880, and by 1900, sheep, goat, and cattle ranches occupied most of the area. The delicate desert environment was soon [[Overgrazing|overgrazed]].

In the late 19th and early 20th century, valuable [[mineral]] deposits were discovered and brought settlers who worked in the mines or supported the mines by farming or by cutting [[timber]] for the mines and [[smelter]]s. Communities sprang up around the mines. [[Boquillas, Texas|Boquillas]] and [[Terlingua, Texas|Terlingua]] all resulted from mining operations. During this period, the Rio Grande flood plain was settled by farmers. Settlements developed with names like Terlingua Abajo, San Vicente, La Coyota and Castolon. These were often no more than clusters of families living and farming in the same area, and they were successful only to the degree that the land was able to support them.

In the 1930s, many people who loved the Big Bend country saw that it was a land of unique contrast and beauty that was worth preserving for future generations. In 1933, the [[Texas Legislature]] passed legislation to establish Texas Canyons State Park. Later that year, the park was redesignated Big Bend State Park. In 1935, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation that would enable the acquisition of the land for a national park. The State of Texas deeded the land that it had acquired to the [[Federal government of the United States]], and on June 12, 1944, Big Bend National Park became a reality. The park opened to visitors on July 1, 1944.

== Flora and fauna ==
[[File:Running Javelina.jpg|thumbnail|A javelina in Big Bend]]

Despite its harsh desert environment, Big Bend has more than 1200 species of plants (including 60 cactus species), over 600 species of vertebrates, and about 3600 insect species. The variety of life is largely due to the diverse ecology and changes in elevation between the dry, hot desert, the cool mountains, and the fertile river valley.

Most of the animals are not visible in the day, particularly in the desert. The park comes alive at night, with many of the animals foraging for food. About 150 [[cougar]] (''Puma concolor'') sightings are reported per year, despite the fact that there only two dozen cougars in the park.<ref>{{cite web

[[American black bear|Mexican black bears]] (''Ursus americanus eremicus'') are also present in the mountain areas.

The variety of cactus and other plant life add color to the Big Bend region. Cactus species in the park include prickly pear (''[[Opuntia]]'' spp.), Claretcup (''[[Echinocereus coccineus]]'') and [[pitaya]] (''[[Echinocereus enneacanthus|E. enneacanthus]]''). In the spring, the wildflowers are in full bloom and the [[yucca]] flowers display bright colors. [[Bluebonnet (plant)|Bluebonnet]]s (''Lupinus'' spp.) are prevalent in Big Bend, and white and pink bluebonnets are sometimes visible by the road. Other flowering plants such as the desert marigold (''[[Baileya multiradiata]]''), desert willow (''[[Chilopsis|Chilopsis linearis]]''), ocotillo (''[[Fouquieria splendens]]''), rock nettle (''[[Eucnide urens]]'') and lechuguilla (''[[Agave lechuguilla]]'') abound in Big Bend.

The first U.S. record of the [[Northern Tufted Flycatcher|northern tufted flycatcher]] (''Mitrephanes phaeocercus''), a [[Central America]]n species, was from this site in November 1991.  Birders also flock to the park, as it is home to the only area in the United States within the breeding range of the [[Colima Warbler|Colima warbler]] (''Vermivora crissalis'').

Plans to reintroduce the [[Mexican wolf]] to Big Bend National Park were rejected in the late 1980s by the state of Texas. Disagreement over the reintroduction included the question of whether the park contained enough prey animals, such as deer and javelinas, to sustain a wolf population.<ref>Jason Manning: [http://wildworldofwolves.tripod.com/id37.htm "The Wolf in Texas"]. The Wild World of Wolves on wildworldofwolves.tripod.com</ref>

==Tourist information==
Big Bend is one of the largest, most remote, and least-visited national parks in the lower 48 United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Encarta|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/Features/Lists/?article=LessTraveledNationalParks|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwQ6NxqA|archivedate=2009-10-31}}</ref> In recent years, only 300,000–350,000 visitors have entered the park annually.

Big Bend's primary attraction is its [[hiking]] and [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] trails. Particularly notable among these are the Chimneys Trail, which visits a rock formation in the desert, the Marufo Vega trail, a loop trail that passes through scenic canyons on the way to and from the Rio Grande, and the Outer Mountain Loop trail in the Chisos, which begins in the Chisos Basin, climbs into the high mountains, descends into the desert along the Dodson Trail, and then returns to the Chisos Basin, completing a thirty mile loop. Other notable locations include Santa Elena Canyon, Grapevine Hills, and the Mule Ears, two imposing rock towers in the middle of the desert.  Professional backpacking guide services provide trips in the park.

The park administers {{convert|118|mi|km}} of the Rio Grande for recreational use. There are professional river [[outfitter]]s that provide tours of the river. Use of a personal boat is permitted but a free river float permit is required.  In June 2009, the Department of Homeland Security began treating all float trips as trips that had left and re-entered the country and required participants to have an acceptable form of identification such as a passport to re-enter the country.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/bibe/parknews/western-hemisphere-travel-initiative.htm Big Bend National Park Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative]</ref>

Visitors often crossed the Rio Grande to visit the Mexican village of [[Boquillas del Carmen|Boquillas]] but the Department of Homeland Security closed the border crossing in 2002. In April 2013, the Boquillas crossing reopened as an official Class B Port of Entry between the U.S. and Mexico. It is open Wednesday through Sunday between 9am and 6pm.<ref>''Big Bend Gazette'', April 10, 2013, [http://bigbendgazette.com/2013/04/10/boquillas-crossing-open 	  Boquillas Crossing is OPEN!]</ref><ref>''National Parks Traveller'', April 23, 2013, [http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2013/04/port-boquillas-border-crossing-open-once-again-big-bend-national-park23114 Port Of Boquillas Border Crossing Open Once Again In Big Bend National Park]</ref><ref>''Houston Chronicle'', April 15, 2013, John MacCormack, [http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/In-Boquillas-border-crossing-a-welcome-sight-4436705.php In Boquillas, reopened border crossing a welcome sight]</ref>

With more than 450 species of birds recorded in the park, a widely popular activity is [[birdwatching]]. Many species stop in the park during their annual [[Bird migration|migrations]].

There are five paved roads in Big Bend. [[Persimmon Gap]] to Panther Junction is a {{convert|28|mi|adj=on}} road from the north entrance of the park to park headquarters at Panther Junction. Panther Junction to Rio Grande Village is a {{convert|21|mi|adj=on}} road that descends {{convert|2000|ft}} from the park headquarters at Panther Junction to the Rio Grande. Maverick Entrance Station to Panther Junction is a {{convert|23|mi|adj=on}} route from the western entrance of the park to the park headquarters. Chisos Basin Road is {{convert|6|mi|sigfig=1}} long and climbs to {{convert|5679|ft}} above sea level at Panther Pass before descending into the Chisos Basin. The {{convert|30|mi|km}} Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive leads to the Castolon Historic District and Santa Elena Canyon.

For out of state visitors who wish to visit Big Bend, flying into Midland/Odessa and then renting a car is the best option available.  As a side note, it is a good idea for tourists to purchase tents, gear, and food/snacks in one of the large cities near the airport as the small towns around Big Bend are not equipped with everything a camper will need.

'''Henry Wharton Conway''' (March 18, 1793 – November 9, 1827) was a United States naval officer during the [[War of 1812]] and a politician in [[Arkansas Territory]], who was elected as a territorial delegate (1823-1827) to the [[United States House of Representatives]] for three consecutive congresses. He died in 1827 as a result of wounds from a [[duel]] with [[Robert Crittenden]], a former friend and political ally.<ref>{{cite web|title=Henry Wharton Conway|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=7334|publisher=Conway-Crittenden Duel - The Central Arkansas Library System|accessdate=20 June 2013}}</ref> 

==Biography==
Conway was born into a [[plantation|planter]] family on March 18, 1793, as the son of Thomas and Ann Rector Conway, near [[Greeneville, Tennessee]] in [[Greene County, Tennessee]]. He was educated by private tutors. He had two younger brothers who followed him into politics in the West.

==Career==
During the [[War of 1812]], Conway was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] in the [[United States Navy]], and was promoted to [[Lieutenant]] in 1813.

In 1817, Conway became a clerk in the [[U.S. Treasury]]. Having saved money for his journey, the following year he joined the migration West to the [[Missouri Territory]]. In 1820, he moved to the [[Arkansas Territory]].  There he became active in territorial politics, forming a friendship and an alliance with [[Robert Crittenden]].

'''Adolf Lu Hitler Rangsa Marak''' (born {{circa|1958}}<ref>{{cite news|author=Catherine Earp |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/odd/news/a459968/politician-adolf-hitler-competes-in-indian-elections.html |title=Politician Adolf Hitler competes in Indian elections - Odd News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2013-02-19 |accessdate=2013-02-24}}</ref>) is a politician in the state of [[Meghalaya]], [[India]].

A member of the [[Nationalist Congress Party]], he was forest and environment minister in the government of [[E.K. Mawlong]] and then cooperation minister under Chief Minister [[Flinder Anderson Khonglam]].

He lost his seat in the state assembly in the February 2003 elections.

On June 27, 2003, he was arrested on charges of maintaining links with the banned militant group [[Achik National Volunteers' Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2003/06/30/stories/2003063002981300.htm |title=The Hindu : I was on a peace mission, says ex-Minister |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-22}}</ref>  He was released on bail about a month later.

The following year he lost the [[Garo Hills]] District Council election for the Dengnakpara G.D.C. [[constituency]] to Roster Sangma of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://westgarohills.gov.in/election/mdc2004/result.htm |title=Garo Hills District Council Election 2004 |publisher=Westgarohills.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2009-11-22}}</ref>

He lost the 2003 legislative election by just over 300 votes in a close fought battle with [[Zenith Sangma|Zenith M. Sangma]] by finishing in 2nd place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeetegakaun.in/meghalaya_elections_2008/assembly_constituencies/west_garo_hills_district/rangsakona/ncp/shri_adolf_lu_hitler_r_marak.php |title=Shri Adolf Lu Hitler R. Marak : NCP Candidate, Rangsakona, West Garo Hills : Meghalaya Assembly Elections, 2008 |publisher=Jeetegakaun.in |date= |accessdate=2009-11-22}}</ref>  However, he reemerged as the victor in the 2008 legislative elections.<ref>{{cite web|date=  8 March 2008 |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Hitler_Frankenstein_in_Meghalaya_Assembly/rssarticleshow/2846608.cms |title=Hitler, Frankenstein in Meghalaya Assembly-India-The Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2009-11-22}}</ref>

In regards to his apparently controversial name, Hitler Marak told the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'': "Maybe my parents liked the name and hence christened me [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]... I am happy with my name, although I don't have any dictatorial tendencies."

In February 2013 it was widely reported in international media that Marak would be running again for the state assembly in [[Meghalaya]], against some other oddly-named candidates, such as Frankenstein Momin and Billykid Sangma.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Who-to-vote-for-Hitler-or-Frankenstein/tabid/417/articleID/288038/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Who to vote for...

==Early life and education==
Ambrose Hundley Sevier was born near [[Greeneville, Tennessee]] in [[Greene County, Tennessee]]. Sevier moved to [[Missouri]] in 1820 and to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] in 1821.

In Arkansas he became clerk of the Territorial [[legislature|House of Representatives]]. He studied law and was admitted to the [[Bar association|bar]] in 1823.

==Marriage and family==
Sevier married Juliette Johnson, the sister of [[Robert Ward Johnson]], who also became an influential politician in the state. Their father Benjamin Johnson had gone to Arkansas as the first territorial judge; in 1836 he was appointed as the first federal district judge when the territory became a state.<ref>[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&entryID=1682 James M. Woods, "Robert Ward Johnson (1814-1879)"], ''Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture'', 2010, accessed 13 November 2013</ref> Ambrose and Juliette had several children.

He was elected as a Delegate to the [[Twentieth United States Congress|Twentieth US Congress]] to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[Henry Wharton Conway]], killed as a result of a duel with a former friend. Sevier was reelected and served as delegate in three successive congresses from 1828 to 1836, when Arkansas was admitted to the Union. Sevier is known as the "Father of Arkansas Statehood".

In 1836 Sevier was elected as the first member of the [[United States Senate]] from Arkansas. He was reelected in 1837 and 1843. He resigned from office in 1848. During the [[Twenty-ninth United States Congress|twenty-ninth Congress]], he was allowed to hold the seat of President ''pro tem'' of the Senate for a day, though he was not elected to that post. During his tenure, he served as chairman of the Committee on [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] Affairs and was a member of the [[Committee on Foreign Relations]].

In 1848 Sevier and [[Nathan Clifford]], the Attorney General of the United States, were appointed ambassadors to [[Mexico]] by President [[James K. Polk]] to negotiate the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] at the end of the [[Mexican-American War]].

After completing this project, Ambrose Hundley Sevier died the last day of that year on his [[plantation]] in [[Pulaski County, Arkansas]]. He was buried in the historic [[Mount Holly Cemetery]]. The State of Arkansas erected a monument in the cemetery in his honor.

Sevier was part of the powerful "Family" of Democratic politicians in Arkansas, who included his first cousins: Representative [[Henry Wharton Conway]], Governor [[James Sevier Conway]], and Governor [[Elias Nelson Conway]]; brother-in-law Senator [[Robert Ward Johnson]], and son-in-law Governor [[Thomas James Churchill]].

==Origins of the Natchez Trace==
Largely following a geologic ridgeline, prehistoric animals followed the dry ground between the [[salt lick]]s of central Tennessee to grazing lands southward and the Mississippi River.  Native Americans used many early footpaths created by the foraging of [[American Bison|bison]], [[deer]] and other large [[game (food)|game]] that could break paths through the dense undergrowth.  In the case of the Trace, bison traveled north to find salt licks in the Nashville area.<ref>{{cite book

Numerous [[Prehistoric]] [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] settlements in Mississippi were connected by the Natchez Trace.  Among them were the 2000-year-old [[Pharr Mounds]] of the Middle [[Woodland period]], located near present-day [[Tupelo, Mississippi]].

The first recorded European explorer to travel the Trace in its entirety was an unnamed [[Frenchman]] in 1742, who wrote of the trail and its "miserable conditions".  Europeans may have earlier traveled the trail, particularly Spanish explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] (c.1496/1497–1542).  Early European explorers depended on the assistance of Native American guides—specifically, the [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]]. These tribes and earlier peoples, collectively known as the [[Mississippian culture]], had long used the Trace for trade, so they likely used it with the Europeans.

==Development and disappearance of the Trace==
Even before the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, President [[Thomas Jefferson]] wanted to connect the distant Mississippi frontier to other settled areas of the United States. To foster communication with what was then called the Southwest, he designated a postal road to be built between [[Daniel Boone]]'s [[Wilderness Road]], the southern branch of the road ended at [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and the Mississippi River.  To emphasize American sovereignty in the area, he decided to call it the [[Columbian Highway]].  The US signed treaties with the [[Chickasaw]] and [[Choctaw]] tribes to keep peace as European Americans entered the area in greater number.  In 1801 the [[United States Army]] began blazing the trail, performing major work to prepare it as a thoroughfare.  The work was first done by soldiers reassigned from [[West Tennessee]], then later by civilian contract.  By 1809, the trail was fully navigable by wagon.  Critical to the success of the Trace as a trade route was the development of [[inn]]s and [[trading post]]s, referred to at the time as "stands."  For the most part, the stands developed southbound from the head of the trail in [[Nashville]].<ref name=Devoss/>

Many early United States settlements in Mississippi and Tennessee developed along the Natchez Trace. Some of the most prominent were [[Washington, Mississippi|Washington]], the old capital of Mississippi; "old Greenville", where [[Andrew Jackson]] plied his occupation as a [[slave trader]]; and [[Port Gibson, Mississippi|Port Gibson]], among others.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cotterill, R. S. |date=April 1921 | title = The Natchez Trace | journal = Tennessee Historical Magazine | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–35 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=1rVYAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA27#v=onepage  }}</ref>  By 1816, the continued development of both [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], with its access to the Mississippi River, and Nashville, which with [[Jackson's Military Road]] had a direct line to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], began shifting trade both east and west away from the Trace.  As author [[William C. Davis (American politician)|William C. Davis]] writes in his book ''A Way Through the Wilderness'', it was "a victim of its own success" by encouraging development in the frontier area.

With the rise of [[steamboat]] culture on the Mississippi, the Trace lost its importance as a national road, as goods could be moved more quickly and cheaply, in greater quantity, on the river. Although many authors have written that the Trace disappeared back into the woods, much of it continued to be used by people living in its vicinity.  With large sections of the Trace in Tennessee converted to county roads for operation, it continues to be used.

==Early 19th century==
Though the Natchez Trace was only used as a major United States Route for a brief span, it served an essential function for years.  The Trace was the only reliable land link between the eastern States and the trading ports of [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]].  This brought all sorts of people down the Trace: itinerant preachers, [[highwaymen]] and traders and [[peddler]]s among them.

As part of the "[[Great Awakening]]" movement that swept the country in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the "spiritual development" along the Trace started from the Natchez end and moved up.  Several [[Methodist Church|Methodist]] preachers began working a [[circuit preacher|circuit]] along the Trace as early as 1800.  By 1812 they claimed a membership of 1,067 [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] and 267 [[African Americans]].<ref>Daniels, 1962 pp.146-149</ref>
The Methodists were soon joined in Natchez by other [[Protestant]] denominations, including  [[Baptist church|Baptist]] [[missionaries]] and [[Presbyterian church|Presbyterian]]s.  The latter accompanied the migration of Scots-Irish and Scots into the frontier areas.  Both Presbyterians and their frontier offshoot, the [[Cumberland Presbyterian church|Cumberland Presbyterians]], were the most active of the three denominations in this backcountry area.  They also claimed converts among [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].  The Presbyterians started working from the south; the Cumberland Presbyterians worked from the north, as they had migrated into Tennessee from Kentucky.

As with much of the unsettled West, [[banditry]] regularly occurred along the Trace.  Much of it centered around ''[[Natchez Under-The-Hill]]'', as compared with the tame sister of [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] atop the river bluff (the current Natchez).  Under-the-Hill, where [[barges]] and [[keelboats]] put in with goods from northern ports, was a hotbed for gamblers, prostitutes and drunkenness.  The rowdiest of the men were the "Kaintucks", the crude frontiersmen from Kentucky who operated [[flatboats]] down the river, and later worked on the [[steamboats]].  They delivered goods to Natchez in exchange for pockets full of cash, and treated Natchez Under-the-Hill as what could be called an early 19th-century [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Then they would walk up the Trace the 450 miles back to Nashville.  In 1810 an estimated 10,000 Kaintucks used the Trace to go north and start another river journey.<ref name=Devoss/>

Worse dangers lurked on the Trace in the areas outside city boundaries.  Highwaymen such as [[John Murrell (bandit)|John Murrell]] and [[Samuel Mason]] terrorized travelers along the road.  They operated large gangs of organized [[brigands]] in one of the first examples of land-based  [[organized crime]] in the United States.<ref>[[#Coates|Coates, 2014]] pp.107, 115-116, 270</ref><ref>Daniels; 1962; pp.114, 124-128</ref>

==Death of Meriwether Lewis==
{{main|Meriwether Lewis}}
[[File:Meriwether Lewis National Monument and Gravesite.jpg|thumb|Meriwether Lewis National Monument and Gravesite, April 2014.]]
[[Meriwether Lewis]], of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] fame, met his death while traveling on the Trace. Then governor of the [[Louisiana Territory]], he was on his way to Washington, DC from his base in St. Louis, Missouri.  Lewis stopped at [[Grinder's Stand]] near current-day [[Hohenwald, Tennessee]] for overnight shelter in October 1809.  He was distraught over many issues, possibly affected by using opium, and was believed by many to have committed suicide by gun, but given the unusual circumstances surrounding his death there is some persistent uncertainty about this conclusion.  He was buried near the inn.<ref name=Brown>[http://stories.washingtonhistory.org/LC-columbia/teaching/pdfs/What-really-happened-to-MeriwetherLewis.pdf Dee Brown, "What Really Happened to Meriwether Lewis?"], ''Columbia Magazine'', Winter 1988, Vol. 1, No. 4, accessed 17 Oct 2010</ref>  His mother believed he had been murdered, and rumors circulated about possible killers. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and his former partner [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] accepted the report of suicide.

In 1858, a Tennessee state commission erected a monument at the site. On the bicentennial of Lewis' death in 2009, the first national public memorial service honoring his life was held, as the last event of the Lewis and Clark Expedition Bicentennial. A bronze bust was installed at his gravesite. Today, Grinder's Stand and the nearby city of [[Hohenwald, Tennessee|Hohenwald]] are within the boundaries of [[Lewis County, Tennessee|Lewis County]], named in honor of Meriwether Lewis.

'''El Dorado''' ({{IPA-es|el do??aðo|pron}}, {{IPAc-en|lang|?|?|l|_|d|?|?|r|??|d|o?|}}; [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "the golden one"), originally ''El Hombre Dorado'' (the golden man), ''El Indio Dorado'' (the golden [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]]), or ''El Rey Dorado'' (the golden king), is the term used by Europeans to describe a tribal chief of the [[Muisca]] native people of [[Colombia]], [[South America]], who as an initiation rite, covered himself with [[gold]] dust and  dove into [[Lake Guatavita]]. Imagined as a place, El Dorado went from a city to a kingdom and an empire of this legendary golden king. In pursuit of the legend, Spanish conquistadors [[Francisco Orellana]] and [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] departed from [[Quito]] (now capital of Ecuador) in 1541 in an expedition towards the [[Amazon Basin]], as a result of which Orellana became the first known person to navigate the entire length of the [[Amazon River]].

''El Dorado'' or Eldorado is now the name of numerous places, especially mining towns, in South America, the United States and elsewhere, as well as the name of many films and TV shows, pieces of music, sports teams, and other items.

==Muisca indigenous people==
{{main|Muisca people|Muisca mythology}}
{{expand section|date=February 2014}}
The Muisca occupied the highlands of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] and [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] departments of Colombia in two migrations from outlying lowland areas, one starting ~1270BCE, and a second between 800BCE and 500BCE.  At those times, other more ancient civilizations also flourished in the highlands.

In the [[Muisca mythology|mythology of the Muisca]], Mnya the Gold or golden color,  represents the energy contained in the trinity of [[:es:Chiminigagua|Chiminigagua]], which constitutes the creative power of everything that exists.<ref>http://www.culturarecreacionydeporte.gov.co/portal/bogotanitos/mitos/chiminichagua</ref> Chiminigagua is, along with [[Bachué]], [[Cuza]], Chibchacum, [[Bochica]], and Nemcatacoa, one of the creators of the universe.

===The tribal ceremony===
[[Image:Muisca raft Legend of El Dorado Offerings of gold.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Zipa]] used to cover his body in gold dust and, from his [[Muisca raft|raft]], he offered treasures to the ''[[Guatavita]]'' goddess in the middle of the sacred lake. This old Muisca tradition became the origin of the '''El Dorado''' legend. This Balsa Muisca (Muisca raft) figure is on display in the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá]], Colombia.]]
The original narrative can be found in the rambling chronicle, ''[[El Carnero]]'', of [[Juan Rodriguez Freyle]]. According to Freyle, the king or chief priest of the Muisca, in a ritual at [[Lake Guatavita]] near present-day [[Bogotá]] was said to be covered with gold dust which he then washed off in the lake while his attendants threw trinkets made of gold, emeralds and precious stones into the lake.

In 1638, Freyle wrote this account of the ceremony, addressed to  the ''[[cacique]]'' or governor of [[Guatavita]]:{{#tag:ref|<blockquote>"Era costumbre entre estos naturales que el que había de ser sucesor y heredero del señorío o cacicazgo de su tío, a quien heredaba, había de ayunar seis años metido en una cueva que tenían dedicada y señalada par esto, y que en todo este tiempo no había de tener parte con mujeres, ni comer carne, sal ni ají y otras cosas que les vedaban; y entre ellas que durante el ayuno no habían de ver el sol, sólo de noche tenían licencia para salir de la cueva y ver la luna y estrellas y recogerse antes que el sol los viese. Y cumplido este ayuno y ceremonias se metían en posesión del cacicazgo o señorío, y la primera jornada que habían de hacer era ir a la gran laguna de Guatavita a ofrecer y sacrificar al demonio (sic) que tenían por su dios y señor. La ceremonia que en esto había era que en aquella laguna se hacía una gran balsa de juncos, aderezábanla y adornábanla todo lo más vistoso que podían, metían en ella cuatro braseros encendidos en que desde luego quemaban mucho moque, que es el sahumerio de estos naturales, y trementina, con otros muchos y diversos perfumes. Estaba a este tiempo toda la laguna en redondo, con ser muy grande, y hondable de tal manera que puede navegar en ella un navío de alto bordo, la cual estaba toda coronada de infinidad de indios e indias, con mucha plumería, chagualas y coronas de oro, con infinitos fuegos a la redonda; y luego que en la balsa comenzaba el sahumerio lo encendían en tierra, en tal manera, que el humo impedía la luz del día.
<br><br>
"A este tiempo desnudaban al heredero en carnes vivas y lo untaban con una tierra pegajosa y lo espolvoreaban con oro en polvo y molido, de tal manera que iba cubierto todo de este metal. Metíanle en la balsa, en la cual iba parado, y a los pies le ponían un gran montón de oro y esmeraldas para que ofreciese a su dios. Entraban con él en la balsa cuatro caciques, los más principales, sus sujetos, muy aderezados de plumería, coronas de oro, brazales y chagualas y orejeras de oro, también desnudos, y cada cual llevaba su ofrecimiento. En partiendo la balsa de tierra comenzaban los instrumentos, cornetas, fotutos y otros instrumentos, y con esto una gran vocería que atronaba montes y valles y duraba hasta que la balsa llegaba al medio de la laguna, de donde, con una bandera, se hacía señal para el silencio.
<br><br>
"Hacía el indio dorado su ofrecimiento echando todo el oro que llevaba a los pies en el medio de la laguna, y los demás caciques que iban con él y le acompañaban hacían lo propio, lo cual acabado abatían la bandera, que en todo el tiempo que gastaban en el ofrecimiento la tenían levantada, y partiendo la balsa a tierra comenzaba la grita, gaitas y fotutos con muy largos corros de bailes y danzas a su modo, con la cual ceremonia recibían al nuevo electo y quedaba conocido por señor y príncipe.
<br><br>
"De esta ceremonia se tomó aquel nombre tan celebrado del Dorado, que tantas vidas ha costado."</blockquote>|group=Note}}<ref>{{cite book|first=Juan Rodríguez|last=Freyle|title=Conquista y descubrimiento del Nuevo Reino de Granada [El Carnero]|year=1636}}</ref>
<blockquote>
The ceremony took place on the appointment of a new ruler. Before taking office, he spent some time secluded in a cave, without women, forbidden to eat salt, or to go out during daylight. The first journey he had to make was to go to the great lagoon of Guatavita, to make offerings and sacrifices to the demon which they worshipped as their god and lord. During the ceremony which took place at the lagoon, they made a raft of [[Juncaceae|rush]]es, embellishing and decorating it with the most attractive things they had. They put on it four lighted braziers in which they burned much moque, which is the incense of these natives, and also resin and many other perfumes. The lagoon was large and deep, so that a ship with high sides could sail on it, all loaded with an infinity of men and women dressed in fine plumes, golden plaques and crowns.... As soon as those on the raft began to burn incense, they also lit braziers on the shore, so that the smoke hid the light of day.

At this time, they stripped the heir to his skin, and anointed him with a sticky earth on which they placed gold dust so that he was completely covered with this metal. They placed him on the raft ... and at his feet they placed a great heap of gold and emeralds for him to offer to his god. In the raft with him went four principal subject chiefs, decked in plumes, crowns, bracelets, pendants and ear rings all of gold. They, too, were naked, and each one carried his offering .... when the raft reached the centre of the lagoon, they raised a banner as a signal for silence. 

The gilded Indian then ... [threw] out all the pile of gold into the middle of the lake, and the chiefs who had accompanied him did the same on their own accounts. ... After this they lowered the flag, which had remained up during the whole time of offering, and, as the raft moved towards the shore, the shouting began again, with pipes, flutes and large teams of singers and dancers. With this ceremony the new ruler was received, and was recognised as lord and king.

This is the ceremony that became the famous El Dorado, which has taken so many lives and fortunes.

powdered salt. For it seemed to him that to wear any other finery was 
less beautiful, and that to put on ornaments or arms made of gold

common thing." Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo, Spanish Historian, 1478-1557

==From ritual to myth and metaphor==
El Dorado is applied to a legendary story in which precious stones were found in fabulous abundance along with gold coins. The concept of El Dorado underwent several transformations, and eventually accounts of the previous myth were also combined with those of a legendary lost city. The resulting El Dorado myth enticed European explorers for two centuries. Among the earliest alleged stories was the one told on his death bed by "Martinez", ammunitioner for Spanish adventurer [[Diego de Ordaz]], who claimed to have been rescued from shipwreck, conveyed inland, and entertained by "El Dorado" himself (1531).{{cn|date=February 2014}}(Antonio de Berrio, then acting governor of Trinidad, official copy of the records of San Juan de Puerto Rico, as recounted by Sir Walter Raleigh.) The fable of Juan Martinez was founded on the adventures of Juan Martin de Albujar, well known to the Spanish historians of the Conquest; and who, in the expedition of Pedro de Silva (1570), fell into the hands of the Caribs of the Lower Orinoco) 

During the 16th and 17th centuries, Europeans, still fascinated by and ignorant of the New World, believed that a hidden city of immense wealth existed. Many searched for this treasure, in quests that ended in the loss of countless lives. The illustration of El Dorado's location on maps only made matters worse, as it made some people think that the city of El Dorado's existence had been confirmed. The mythical city of El Dorado on Lake Parime was marked on [[England|English]] and other maps until its existence was disproved by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] during his Latin-America expedition (1799–1804)<ref>[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/humboldt/alexander/travels/chapter25.html ''Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America During the Years of 1799-1804'' by Alexander von Humboldt, Chapter 25]</ref>

Meanwhile, the name of ''El Dorado'' came to be used metaphorically of any place where wealth could be rapidly acquired. It was given to [[El Dorado County, California]], and to towns and cities in various states. It has also been anglicized to the single word ''Eldorado''.

El Dorado is also sometimes used as a metaphor to represent an ultimate prize or "[[Holy Grail]]" that one might spend one's life seeking. It could represent true love, heaven, happiness, or success. It is used sometimes as a figure of speech to represent something much sought after that may not even exist, or, at least, may not ever be found. Such use is evident in  Poe's poem "El Dorado". In this context, El Dorado bears similarity to other myths such as the [[Fountain of Youth]] and [[Shangri-la]]. The other side of the ideal quest metaphor may be represented by ''Helldorado'', a satirical nickname given to [[Tombstone, Arizona]] (United States) in the 1880's by a disgruntled miner who complained that many of his profession had traveled far to find El Dorado, only to wind up washing dishes in restaurants.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

== Prelude: gold and greed ==
Spanish conquistadores had noticed the native people's fine artifacts of gold and silver long before any legend of "golden men" or "lost cities" fired the imagination of kings and commoners alike.  The prevalence of such valuable artifacts, and the natives apparent ignorance of their value, inspired speculation as to a plentiful source for them.

Prior to the time of Spanish conquest of the Muisca people and discovery of Lake Guatavita, a handful of expeditions had set out to explore the lowlands to the east of the mighty Andes in search of gold, cinnamon, precious stones, and anything else of value.

During the [[Klein-Venedig]] period in Venezuela (1528–1546), agents of the German [[Welser]] banking family (which had received a concession from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]]), starting with German ''conquistador'' Ambrosius Ehinger's first expedition in July of 1529, launched repeated expeditions into the interior of the country in [[Klein-Venedig#The search for El Dorado|search of gold]].{{cn|date=February 2014}} German conquistador [[Nikolaus Federmann]] had spent years in the late 1530’s searching the Colombian plateaus, Orinoco Basin and Venezuelan lowlands searching in vain for El Dorado. Then there was [[Philipp von Hutten]] (1541–1545), who led an exploring party from [[Santa Ana de Coro|Coro]] on the coast of [[Venezuela]].

Spanish explorer [[Diego de Ordaz]], then governor of the eastern part of Venezuela known as Paria. was the first European to explore the [[Orinoco river]] in 1531-32 in search of gold. A veteran of Cortez's campaign in Mexico, Ordaz followed the Orinoco beyond the mouth of the Meta River but was blocked by the rapids at Atures. After his return he died, possibly poisoned, on a voyage back to Spain.

== The Search for El Dorado ==
The earliest reference to the name ''El Dorado'' was in 1535 or 1536, before Spanish contact with the Muisca people.

In 1535, Captains Anasco and Ampudia were dispatched by Spanish conquistador Sebastian de Belalcazar, one of Francisco Pizarro's chief lieutenants, to discover the valley of ''Dorado'' in pursuit of the splendid riches of the Zaque, or chieftain of Cundinamarca, described by a wandering Indian of Tacumga.

After the death of Ordaz while returning from his expedition, the Crown appointed a new Governor of [[Paria (province)|Paria]], [[Jeronimo Ortal]], who diligently explored the interior along the [[Meta River]] between 1532 and 1537. In 1535 he ordered Captain [[Alonso de Herrera]] to move inland by the waters of the [[Uyapari River|Uyapari]] (today the town of Barrancas de Orinoco). Herrera, who had accompanied Ordaz three years before, explored the Meta River but was killed by [[Achagua people|Achagua Indians]] near its banks while waiting out the winter rains in [[Casanare Department|Casanare]].

In 1536 [[Gonzalo Díaz de Pineda]] had led an expedition to the lowlands to the east of Quito and had found cinnamon trees but no rich empire.

===Quesada brothers' expeditions===
It was stories of El Dorado that in 1537 drew the Spanish conquistador [[Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada]] and his army of 800 men away from their mission to find an overland route to Peru and up into the Andean homeland of the Muisca for the first time. A little further to the north, Spanish conquistador [[Hernán Pérez de Quesada]] (brother of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada) set out in September of 1540 with a large party of 270 Spaniards and countless Indian porters to explore the Orinoco Basin, but they likewise found nothing before turning around and returning to Bogotá. Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada also led another expedition starting from [[Bogotá]] in 1569 to conquer territory east of the Andes{{relevance-inline|date=February 2014}}.

The Muisca towns and their treasures quickly fell to the [[conquistador]]es. At the same time, the Spanish began to hear stories of El Dorado from captured natives (mostly Indians), and of the rites which used to take place at Lake Guatavita.{{Specify|when?|date=February 2014}} The Spaniards also found much gold on these natives, which led them to spread the word that El Dorado was near. The news of the gold was changed by word of mouth to the extent that it was said that the gold on these natives was proof that there was a kingdom of immense wealth in the south of the New World, or modern day South America.

===Sebastin de Belalczar's expedition===

=== Pizarro and Orellana's discovery of the Amazon ===
{{See also|Amazon River#History}}
In 1540, [[Gonzalo Pizarro]], the younger half-brother of [[Francisco Pizarro]], the Spanish [[conquistador]] who toppled the [[Incan Empire]] in Peru, was made the governor of the province of [[Quito]] in northern [[Ecuador]].  Shortly after taking lead in Quito, Gonzalo learned from many of the natives of a valley far to the east rich in both [[cinnamon]] and gold.  He banded together 340 soldiers and about 4000 natives in 1541 and led them eastward down the [[Coca River|Rio Coca]] and [[Napo River|Rio Napo]]. [[Francisco de Orellana]] accompanied Pizarro on the expedition as his lieutenant.   Gonzalo quit after many of the soldiers and natives had died from hunger, disease, and periodic attacks by hostile natives.  He ordered Orellana to continue downstream, where he eventually made it to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  The expedition found neither cinnamon nor gold, but Orellana is credited with discovering the [[Amazon River]] (so named because of a [[Amazons|tribe of female warriors]] that attacked Orellana’s men while on their voyage.)

[[File:Guaiana ofte de Provincien tusschen Rio de las Amazonas ende Rio de Yuiapari ofte Orinoque.jpg|thumb|Parime Lacus on a map by [[Hessel Gerritsz]] (1625). Situated at the west coast of the lake, the so-called city of Manoa or El Dorado]]

===Lake Guatavita gold===
{{missing information|Guatavita wasn't the only lake or even the most important lake where the Muisca rite of passage was performed|date=February 2014}}
{{missing information|exactly when and how Lake Guatavita was found|date=February 2014}}

[[Conquistadores]] Lázaro Fonte and Hernán Perez de Quesada attempted (unsuccessfully) to drain the lake in 1545 using a "bucket chain" of labourers. After 3 months, the water level had been reduced by 3 metres, and only a small amount of gold was recovered, with a value of 3000–4000 pesos (approx. 100,000 USD today; a peso or piece of eight of the 15th century weighs .88oz of 93% pure silver).

A later more industrious attempt was made in 1580, by Bogotá business entrepreneur Antonio de Sepúlveda. A notch was cut deep into the rim of the lake, which managed to reduce the water level by 20 metres, before collapsing and killing many of the labourers. A share of the findings—consisting of various golden ornaments, jewellery and armour—was sent to [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip the 2nd of Spain]]. Sepúlveda's discovery came to approximately 12,000 pesos. He died a poor man, and is buried at the church in the small town of [[Guatavita]].

In 1801, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] made a visit to Guatavita, and on his return to Paris, calculated from the findings of Sepúlveda's efforts that Guatavita could offer up as much as $300 million worth of gold.

In 1898, 'The Company for the Exploitation of the Lagoon of Guatavita' was formed and taken over by 'Contractors Ltd.' of London, in a deal brokered by British expatriate Mr Hartley Knowles. The lake was drained by a tunnel that emerged in the centre of the lake. The water was drained to a depth of about 4 feet of mud and slime.{{cn|date=March 2014}} This made it impossible to explore, and when the mud had dried sitting and being baked by the sun, it had set like concrete. A haul of only £500 was found, and auctioned at [[Sotheby]]s of London. Some of these artifacts were donated to the [[British Museum]].<ref>British Museum Collection [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=15311&plaA=15311-3-1]</ref></blockquote> The company filed for bankruptcy and ceased activities in 1929.

In 1965, the Colombian government designated the lake as a protected area.  Private salvage operations including attempts to drain the lake, are now illegal.{{cn|date=March 2014}}

===Governor Antonio de Berrio's expeditions===
Spanish Governor of Trinidad, Antonio de Berrio (nephew of Jiménez de Quesada), made three expeditions to the Guyana region in 1584, 1585 and 1591.

===Sir Walter Raleigh===

In 1595 Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] set sail following one of the many old maps to El Dorado, aiming to reach Lake Parime in the highlands of Guyana (the supposed location of El Dorado at the time). He had set many goals for his expedition, and believed he had a genuine chance at finding the so-called city of gold. First, he wanted to find the mythical city of El Dorado, which he suspected to be an actual Indian city named Manoa. Second, he hoped to establish an English presence in the Southern Hemisphere that could compete with that of the Spanish. His third goal was to create an English settlement in the land called [[Guyana]], and to try to reduce commerce between the natives and Spaniards.

Though Sir Walter Raleigh never found El Dorado, he was convinced that there was some fantastic city whose riches could be discovered. Finding gold on the riverbanks and in villages only strengthened his resolve.<ref>[http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/raleighsam/283 ''Sir Walter Raleigh.'']</ref> In 1617, he returned to the New World on a second expedition, this time with his son, Watt Raleigh, to continue his quest for El Dorado. However, Sir Walter Raleigh, by now an old man, stayed behind in a camp on the island of [[Trinidad]]. Watt Raleigh was killed in a battle with Spaniards. Overall, the second expedition was a disaster. Upon Raleigh's return to England, [[James VI and I|King James]] ordered for him to be beheaded for disobeying orders to avoid conflict with the Spanish.<ref>Drye, Willie. [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]. [http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/archaeology/el-dorado ''El Dorado Legend Snared Sir Walter Raleigh.'']</ref>  He was executed in 1618.
{{missing information|how, why and when the searches eventually came to an end, and modern geologic and geophysical evidence of the putative lake's existance|date=February 2014}}

===Post Elizabethan expeditions===
In 1637-38, Acana and Fritz, two monks, severally undertook journeys to the lands of the Manoas.

In 1740, Don Manuel Centurion, Governor of San Thome del Angostura, embarked upon the Caura and Rio Paragua, encountered the most dreadful sufferings and occassioned the deaths of several hundred persons.  Their survey of the local geography, however, provided the basis of another set of expeditions starting in 1775.

In 1775 to 1780, Nicholas Rodriguez and Antonio Santos, two entrepreneurs employed by the Spanish Governors, set out on foot and reached the Uraricuera and Rio Branco, but of course found nothing.

== Epilogue: gold strikes and the extractive wealth of the rainforest ==
By the mid-1570's, the Spanish silver strike at [[Potosí]] in Upper Peru (modern Bolivia) was producing unprecedented real wealth.

In 1603, Queen Elizabeth I of England died, bringing to an end the era of Elizabethan adventurism.  A bit later, in 1618, Sir Walter Raleigh, the great inspirer, was beheaded for what was ostensibly insubordination
(and not the least propagating tales of improbable and unattainable kingdoms of gold and emeralds while expending lives and the king's fortune on fruitless and disastrous expeditions).
  
In 1695, ''[[bandeirantes]]'' in the south from [[Captaincy of Sao Paulo|Sao Paulo]] struck gold along a tributary of the Sao Francisco River in the highlands of State of [[Minas Gerais]], Brazil.  The prospect of real gold overshadowed the illusory promise of "gold men" and "lost cities" in the vast interior of the north.

Between 1799 and 1804, Alexander Humboldt conducted an extensive and scientific survey of the Guyana river basins and lakes, concluding that seasonally flooded confluence of rivers may be what inspired the notion of a mythical lake, and of the supposed golden city on the shore, nothing remained.  

It appears today that the Muisca obtained their gold in trade, and while possessed in passing of great quantities of it over time, no great store of the metal was ever accumulated.

==Popular culture==
Frequent allusions are made to the legend, in many forms of culture and media.

===Automobiles===
* For five decades, starting in 1953, the most expensive model of [[General Motors]]' prestige make was the [[Cadillac Eldorado]].

===Film===
*In [[Howard Hawks]]' film ''[[El Dorado (1966 film)|El Dorado]]'' (1966), starring [[John Wayne]] and [[Robert Mitchum]], El Dorado is a town in Texas cattle country. The character Alan Bourdillion "Mississippi" Treherne (played by [[James Caan]]) recites most of Poe's poem throughout the film, and film's title song<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061619/trivia ''El Dorado'' (1966) – Trivia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> by [[Nelson Riddle]] is derivative of Poe's poem.

*[[Werner Herzog]]'s film, ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'' (1972), also explores the El Dorado metaphor. The main character, [[Lope de Aguirre]], is historically based but is actually an amalgam of Aguirre and [[Francisco de Orellana]], mentioned in the historical section, above.

* ''[[The Road to El Dorado]]'' (2000) is an American animated comedy film by [[DreamWorks Animation]], which tells the story of two 16th-century Spanish men who discover the mythical city and are declared gods by the inhabitants. The story is set in Central America, not in Colombia, and incorporates elements of [[Hernán Cortés]]'s campaigns.

===Literature===
Perhaps the best-known literary references are those in [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667, Book xi. 408–411) and in [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]'' (1759, chs. 18, 19). A portion of Candide is set in El Dorado, city made of material finer than gold and diamonds, which are just considered mud and rocks in the road.

[[Eldorado (poem)|"Eldorado"]] (1849) is both the title and subject of a [[Satire|satirical]], four-stanza poem by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], about a knight's search for the legendary city.

El Dorado is also referenced in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), in which the Eldorado Exploring Expedition journeys into the jungles of [[Africa]] in search of conquest and treasure, only to meet an untimely demise.

===Music===
* [[Iron Maiden]]'s album ''[[The Final Frontier]]'' (2010) includes a song called "[[El Dorado (song)|El Dorado]]", which compares the bankers who caused the [[Great Recession]] to the charlatans who sold the stories of El Dorado.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://files.homepagemodules.de/b210833/f11745263t510912p7384449n2.jpg|title='We're Taking No Prisoners'|journal=Kerrang!|date=9 June 2010|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref>

* [[Every Time I Die]]'s album ''[[From Parts Unknown]]'' (2014) contains a track called "El Dorado".

* [[Two Steps From Hell]]'s album ''[[SkyWorld]]'' (2012) contains a track called "El Dorado".

* [[Electric Light Orchestra]]'s (1974) album "[[Eldorado (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Eldorado]]" contains three tracks entitled "Eldorado Overture", "Eldorado" and "Eldorado Finale".

===Television===
* ''[[The Mysterious Cities of Gold]]'' (1982) is an animated miniseries that follows the fictional story of several children and a group of Spanish explorers as they search for El Dorado in the Americas during the 16th century. In the story, El Dorado is but one of seven cities of gold hidden around the world.
* The final episode of TV series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' is titled "Eldorado".

===Video games===
* In [[Zynga]]'s game ''[[Indiana Jones Adventure World]]'', El Dorado is the main objective for the player to complete.<!-- Please, add only items that are related to the myth, as described here. Merely the same name is not enough. -->

* In  ''[[Journeyman Project 3]]'', the player finds himself in the legendary city.  The first time the player arrives, the city is completely destroyed.  On further visits, the player find a thriving civilization on the brink of destruction by alien forces who seek a small item they believe to be their birthright.

*The main storyline of [[Kingsisle]]'s MMORPG game ''[[Pirate101]]'' is based on finding El Dorado. The players have to find the many pieces of the map made by [[Marco Polo]], which provides the exact time and location in which to find the portal to El Dorado.

* The [[PlayStation 3]] game ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' is based on a search for El Dorado and on its connections to [[Francis Drake]]. Expecting to find a city of gold, the searchers find a huge gold statue, later discovered to be a golden coffin containing the victim and the remains of an ancient plague.

* One of the campaigns of ''[[Age of Empires II: The Forgotten]]'' is titled "El Dorado", and focuses on Orellana and Pizarro's expedition.

* In ''[[Expeditions: Conquistador]]'', El Dorado can be found in the Mexican jungle, as a city full of riches. Exploring it will trigger a fight with natives, and an encounter with the Aztec god Xipe Totec.

* In ''[[The Secret World]]'' by Funcom, El Dorado is a battlefield where secret societies fight to get control of ancient relics that would provide them key informations on anima.

== Tones ==
There are nine [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] in six distinct [[tone contour]]s in Cantonese. However, as three of the nine are [[checked tone|entering tone]]s (??, Jyutping: ''jap6 sing1''), which only appear in syllables ending with ''p'', ''t'', and ''k'', they do not have separate tone numbers in Jyutping (though they do in [[Cantonese Pinyin]]; these are shown in parentheses in the table below).

== Comparison with Yale romanization ==
Jyutping and the [[Yale romanization of Cantonese]] represent Cantonese pronunciations with the same letters in:
* The [[initial (linguistics)|initial]]s: ''b'', ''p'', ''m'', ''f'', ''d'', ''t'', ''n'', ''l'', ''g'', ''k'', ''ng'', ''h'', ''s'', ''gw'', ''kw'', ''w''.
* The [[vowel]]: ''aa'' (except when used alone), ''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u'', ''yu''.
* The [[nasal stop]]: ''m'', ''ng''.
* The [[Syllable coda|coda]]: ''i'', ''u'', ''m'', ''n'', ''ng'', ''p'', ''t'', ''k''.
But they differ in the following:
* The [[vowel]]s ''eo'' and ''oe'' represent {{IPA|/?/}} and {{IPA|/œ?/}} respectively in Jyutping, whereas the ''eu'' represents both vowels in Yale.
* The [[initial (linguistics)|initial]] ''j'' represents {{IPA|/j/}} in Jyutping whereas ''y'' is used instead in Yale.
* The initial ''z'' represents {{IPA|/ts/}} in Jyutping whereas ''j'' is used instead in Yale.
* The initial ''c'' represents {{IPA|/ts?/}} in Jyutping whereas ''ch'' is used instead in Yale.
* In Jyutping, if no [[consonant]] precedes the vowel ''yu'', then the initial ''j'' is appended before the vowel. In Yale, the corresponding initial ''y'' is never appended before ''yu'' under any circumstances.
* Jyutping defines three [[final (linguistics)|final]]s not in Yale: ''eu'' {{IPA|/??u/}}, ''em'' {{IPA|/??m/}}, and ''ep'' {{IPA|/??p/}}.  These three finals are used in colloquial Cantonese words, such as ''deu6'' (?), ''lem2'' (?), and ''gep6'' (?).
* To represent [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s, only tone numbers are used in Jyutping whereas Yale traditionally uses tone marks together with the letter ''h'' (though tone numbers can be used in Yale as well).

== Comparison with Cantonese pinyin ==
Jyutping and [[Cantonese Pinyin]] represent Cantonese pronunciations with the same letters in:
* The [[initial (linguistics)|initial]]s: ''b'', ''p'', ''m'', ''f'', ''d'', ''t'', ''n'', ''l'', ''g'', ''k'', ''ng'', ''h'', ''s'', ''gw'', ''kw'', ''j'', ''w''.
* The [[vowel]]: ''aa'', ''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u''.
* The [[nasal stop]]: ''m'', ''ng''.
* The [[Syllable coda|coda]]: ''i'' (except for its use in the [[Syllable coda|coda]] {{IPA|/y/}} in Jyutping; see below), ''u'', ''m'', ''n'', ''ng'', ''p'', ''t'', ''k''.
But they have some differences:
* The [[vowel]] ''oe'' represents both {{IPA|/?/}} and {{IPA|/œ?/}} in Cantonese Pinyin whereas ''eo'' and ''oe'' represent {{IPA|/?/}} and {{IPA|/œ?/}} respectively in Jyutping.
* The vowel ''y'' represents {{IPA|/y/}} in Cantonese Pinyin whereas both ''yu'' (used in the [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]]) and ''i'' (used in the [[Syllable coda|coda]] of the [[syllable rime#Syllable final|final]] -''eoi'') are used in Jyutping.
* The initial ''dz'' represents {{IPA|/ts/}} in Cantonese Pinyin whereas ''z'' is used instead in Jyutping.
* The initial ''ts'' represents {{IPA|/ts?/}} in Cantonese Pinyin whereas ''c'' is used instead in Jyutping.
* To represent [[tone (linguistics)|tones]], the numbers 1 to 9 are usually used in Cantonese Pinyin, although the use of 1, 3, 6 to replace 7, 8, 9 for the [[checked tone]]s is acceptable. However, only the numbers 1 to 6 are used in Jyutping.

==Jyutping input method==
The '''Jyutping method''' ({{zh|t=?????}}) refers to a family of [[Chinese input methods for computers|input methods]] based on the Jyutping romanization system.

The Jyutping method allows a user to input Chinese characters by entering the jyutping of a Chinese character (with or without tone, depending on the system) and then presenting the user with a list of possible characters with that pronunciation.

'''Robert Ward Johnson''' (July 22, 1814 &ndash; July 26, 1879) was an attorney and politician, elected United States Representative and [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|US Senator]], as well as [[Congress of the Confederate States|Confederate States Senator]], from the state of [[Arkansas]].

Considered a member of [[The Family (Arkansas politics)|The Family]], a political network in Arkansas, he was the nephew of three Johnson brothers in Kentucky who each served as US Congressman from the state, and held other prominent business and political positions in the state and nationally.

==Early life and education==
[[Image:Robert Ward Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Portrait of Johnson in his younger years.]]
Robert Ward Johnson was born to Benjamin and Matilda (née Williams) Johnson in [[Scott County, Kentucky]];<ref name="ark">[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&entryID=1682 "Robert Ward Johnson (1814-1879)"], ''Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture'', accessed 12 November 2013</ref> his father had three brothers who were elected as US Congressmen and the family was politically prominent in the state. His grandfather Johnson had acquired thousands of acres of land in the area at the end of the eighteenth century. The family were slaveholders. Robert Johnson's siblings included a sister Juliette.

His paternal uncles were [[Richard Mentor Johnson]], a US Representative and Senator, and [[Vice President of the United States]] under [[Martin Van Buren]]; and his brothers [[James Johnson (Kentucky)|James Johnson]] and [[John Telemachus Johnson]], older and younger, respectively, who were each elected as US Representatives from Kentucky.

In 1821 when Robert was seven, his parents moved the family to [[Arkansas Territory]], where his father had been appointed as Superior Judge.<ref name="ark"/> They settled in [[Little Rock]]. His father was appointed in 1836 as the first federal district judge in the new state of Arkansas.<ref name="ark"/>

The boy was later sent back to Kentucky to study at the Choctaw Academy, which his uncle [[Richard M. Johnson]] had founded in 1825 on his farm near [[Georgetown, Kentucky]] primarily to educate [[Choctaw people|Choctaw]] boys from the Southeast in the English language and European-American culture. He was handsomely paid by the federal government.<ref name="ark"/><ref name="okla">[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v006/v006p453.html Carolyn Foreman, "THE CHOCTAW ACADEMY"], ''Chronicles of Oklahoma'', Volume 6, No. 4, December 1928, accessed 12 November 2013</ref> At times, 200-300 boys were there as students.

The Choctaw students were at the school in the period prior to the [[Indian Removal]] in the 1830s of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]], but they were under pressure in the Southeast from encroaching settlers. His uncle kept the school going into the late 1830s, after some peoples had been forcibly relocated to [[Indian Territory]] west of the Mississippi River.<ref name="okla"/> The youth Johnson went on to study at Saint Joseph's College, an academy in [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]], and graduated.

After St. Joseph's, Johnson returned to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], which was the capital. He studied law (read the law) as a legal apprentice and was admitted to the bar in 1835.

==Marriage and family==
After being admitted to the bar in Arkansas, Johnson married Sarah Smith in 1836. They had six children together; three survived to adulthood. Sarah died in 1862, during the [[American Civil War]].

The next year, Johnson at the age of 49 married her younger sister, Laura Smith. They had no children.

==Career==
In Little Rock, Johnson soon became involved in Democratic Party politics. He was elected as the prosecuting attorney for [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] and served from 1840 to 1842. He effectively acted as the state's attorney.

His sister Juliette married [[Ambrose Hundley Sevier]], who was later elected as US Senator from Arkansas. Both Sevier and Johnson became part of [[The Family (Arkansas politics)|The Family]], a group of men related by marriage and politics, who dominated the state [[Democratic Party (United States)]] and politics, and its national representation in the antebellum years.

Prior to the Civil War, Johnson moved his family to [[Helena, Arkansas]], in the [[Mississippi Delta]], where he established his law practice. Johnson was elected from there, beginning in 1846, to the [[Thirtieth United States Congress|Thirtieth]], [[Thirty-first United States Congress|Thirty-first]], and [[Thirty-second United States Congress|Thirty-second]] Congresses. He became chairman of the House Committee on Indian Affairs. In this period, his brother-in-law Sevier was chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs.

Johnson declined to run for reelection in 1852. He was appointed by the legislature to the [[United States Senate]] to fill the unexpired term of Senator [[Solon Borland]]. In 1855, he was elected by the legislature to the seat, serving the full term until 3 March 1861.

[[Image:RWJohnson-portrait.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Portrait of Johnson c. 1865.]]
After the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], he served as a delegate to the Provisional Government of the [[Confederate States]] in 1862. He served as a member of the Confederate Senate from 1862 to 1865.

The war ended Sevier's political career. Property damage and the abolition of slavery ruined him economically. After the war, he practiced law in Washington, D.C. for more than a decade during [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]]. Returning to Arkansas in the late 1870s, after the end of Reconstruction, he ran unsuccessfully for reelection to the Senate in 1878.

Robert Ward Johnson died in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] in 1879. He is buried in the historic [[Mount Holly Cemetery]] there.

The [[Archdiocese of Turku]] is the oldest [[diocese]] in [[Finland]]. Mediaeval bishops of the [[Roman Catholicism in Finland|Catholic Church]] were also ''de facto'' secular leaders of the country until the end of the 13th century.

After the [[Swedish Reformation|Reformation]] in Scandinavia, [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] bishops became state officials. When Finland became a separate [[Grand Duchy of Finland|grand duchy]], the then Bishop of Turku was elevated to archiepiscopal rank in 1817. Since 1868, the Archbishops of Turku and Finland have been considered [[primate (bishop)|primate]]s of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]].

== Bishop Henry ==
[[Bishop Henry|Henry]] [[Bishop of Uppsala|of Uppsala]] is often mentioned in contemporary sources as the first Bishop of Finland. According to legends, the English-born Henry arrived in Finland with King [[Eric IX of Sweden]] during the [[First Swedish Crusade]], later suffering martyrdom in the 1150s. His position as Bishop of Finland is, however totally unhistorical, and not claimed even by legends.

'''Solon Borland''' (September 21, 1808 – January 1, 1864)<ref>[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B000642 Biographical Directory of the United States Congress] Retrieved on 2009-01-20.</ref> was a newspaperman, soldier, diplomat, [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from the State of [[Arkansas]] and a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officer during the [[American Civil War]].

==Early life==
Borland was born in [[Suffolk, Virginia]]. When he was a youth, his family moved to [[North Carolina]], where he attended preparatory schools.  He later studied medicine and opened a practice. He married three times, first in 1831 to Hildah Wright of Virginia, who died in 1837, and with whom he had two sons. He then married Eliza Buck Hart of [[Memphis, Tennessee]] in 1839, but she died in 1842, with no offspring. In 1843 following his second wife's death, he moved to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], where he founded the ''Arkansas Banner'', which became an influential newspaper in state-wide [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politics. Three years later, he challenged the editor of the rival ''Arkansas Gazette'', a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] paper, to a [[duel]] due to a slander published against Doctor Borland. In 1845 he had met Mary Isabel Melbourne, of Little Rock, with whom he would marry that same year and later have three children.

==Mexican-American War==
During the [[Mexican-American War]], Borland was commissioned as a [[Major (United States)|major]] in the Arkansas Volunteer Cavalry, serving under [[Archibald Yell]]. He served throughout the war, having turned over his newspaper to associates. Borland was taken as a [[prisoner of war]] by the Mexican army on January 23, 1847, just south of [[Saltillo, Coahuila]]. He escaped, and was discharged when his regiment was disbanded and mustered out in June, but continued in the army as volunteer [[aide-de-camp]] to General [[William J. Worth]] during the remainder of the campaign, from the [[Battle of Molino del Rey]] to the [[Battle for Mexico City|capture of Mexico City]] on September 14, 1847.

==Controversial politics==
After the war, he was elected as a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] to fill the unexpired term of [[Ambrose Hundley Sevier]]. His views were generally of a disunionist version, and he was not popular with many Senate members. During an 1850 debate over Southern rights, he physically attacked [[Mississippi]] Senator [[Henry S. Foote|Henry Foote]]. He discovered soon after his return to Little Rock that his views were not popular at home, either. Borland resigned from the Senate in 1853 and served as United States Minister to [[Nicaragua]] through 1854. However, this duty did not run smoothly for him either.

Immediately after his arrival in [[Managua]], he called for the US Government to repudiate the [[Clayton-Bulwer Treaty]], and for the American military to support [[Honduras]] in its confrontation with Great Britain. In a public address in Nicaragua, he stated that it was his greatest ambition to see Nicaragua "forming a bright star in the flag of the United States". He was reprimanded for this by [[US Secretary of State]] [[William Marcy]]. While leaving [[San Juan del Norte|Greystown]] in May, 1854, Borland interfered with the local arrest of an American citizen. He was threatened with arrest, but due to his [[diplomatic immunity]], no arrest was made. However, a crowd had gathered, and a bottle was thrown which hit Borland in the face. Enraged, he reported the incident to the United States, who promptly dispatched a [[gunboat]], and demanded an apology. When none was given, the town was bombarded and burned.

Borland returned to Little Rock in October 1854, and resumed his medical practice and operation of his [[pharmacy]]. Borland declined a nomination from [[Franklin Pierce|President Pierce]] as [[Governor]] of the [[New Mexico Territory]]. However he remained active in local politics, and very vocal as to his views on states rights and secession.

==Civil War service, death==
At the start of the Civil War, Borland was appointed as a commander of the state [[militia]] by Arkansas Governor [[Henry Massie Rector]], and ordered to lead the expedition that seized [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]], in the first days of the war, despite the fact that Arkansas had not yet seceded. By the time Borland and his forces arrived in Fort Smith, the Federal troops had already departed, and there were no shots fired. He was replaced as commander at the Arkansas Secession convention less than a month later, but he was able to obtain a position as a commander for Northeast Arkansas. For a time in 1861 he commanded the depot at Pitman's Ferry, near [[Pocahontas, Arkansas]], responsible for troop deployments and supplies. His only son with his third wife, George Godwin Borland, had joined the Confederate Army despite being only 16 years of age, and would later be [[killed in action]].

Borland helped recruit troops for the [[Confederate States Army]] during this period, and helped raise the "[[3rd Arkansas Cavalry]]" on June 10, 1861, and became its first [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. The regiment was sent to [[Corinth, Mississippi]], but without Borland. The regiment would eventually serve under [[History of Confederate States Army Generals#Major general|Major General]] [[Joseph Wheeler]], seeing action in the [[Second Battle of Corinth]] and the [[Battle of Hatchie's Bridge]], along with other battles as a part of the [[Army of Mississippi]]. However, Borland never left Arkansas.

While in his command position for the Northern Arkansas Militia, he ordered an embargo of goods to end price speculation, which was rescinded by Governor Rector. Borland protested that a governor could not countermand an order from a Confederate official, but in January 1862 his order was countermanded by the [[Confederate States Secretary of War]] at the time, [[Judah P. Benjamin]]. In declining health and resenting that embarrassment, Borland resigned from further service to the Confederacy in June, 1862, moving to [[Dallas County, Arkansas]]. Borland died before the war's end, in [[Harris County, Texas]]. His burial place is in Mount Holly Cemetery in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].

In 1962, the town of [[Frenchport, Arkansas]], began hosting "Solon Borland Daze," a community festival dedicated to recalling the life and achievements of the U.S. senator and his French-Creole mistress, after whom the town is named.

'''Conrad Yeatis''' "'''Sonny'''" '''Clark''' (July 21, 1931 &ndash; January 13, 1963) was an American [[jazz]] pianist who mainly worked in the [[hard bop]] idiom.<REF>Palmer, Robert (March 18, 1987). "[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DC1030F93BA25750C0A961948260 The Pop Life; Recalling Sonny Clark]". ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved on September 1, 2007.</ref>

==Early life==
Clark was born and raised in [[Herminie, Pennsylvania]], a coal mining town east of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].<ref name="Paris">Stephenson, Sam (January 13, 2011) [http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2011/01/13/sonny-clark/ "Notes from a Biographer: Sonny Clark"]. ''The Paris Review''.</ref> His parents were originally from [[Stone Mountain, Georgia]].<ref name="Paris" /> His miner father, Emory Clark, died of a lung disease two weeks after Sonny was born.<ref name="Paris" /> Sonny was the youngest of eight children.<ref name="Paris" /> At age 12, he moved to Pittsburgh.

==Later life and career==
When visiting an aunt in California at age 20, Clark decided to stay and began working with saxophonist [[Wardell Gray]]. Clark went to San Francisco with [[Oscar Pettiford]] and after a couple months, was working with clarinetist [[Buddy DeFranco]] in 1953. Clark toured the United States and Europe with DeFranco until January 1956, when he joined The Lighthouse All-Stars, led by bassist [[Howard Rumsey]].

Wishing to return to the east coast, Clark served as accompanist for singer [[Dinah Washington]] in February 1957 in order to relocate to New York City. In New York, Clark was often requested as a [[sideman]] by many musicians, partly because of his rhythmic comping. He frequently recorded for [[Blue Note Records]], playing as a sideman with many [[hard bop]] players, including [[Kenny Burrell]], [[Donald Byrd]], [[Paul Chambers]], [[John Coltrane]], [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Art Farmer]], [[Curtis Fuller]], [[Grant Green]], [[Philly Joe Jones]], [[Clifford Jordan]], [[Jackie McLean]], [[Hank Mobley]], [[Art Taylor]], and [[Wilbur Ware]]. He also recorded sessions with [[Charles Mingus]], [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Stanley Turrentine]], and [[Lee Morgan]].

As a band leader, Clark recorded albums ''[[Dial "S" for Sonny]]'' (1957), ''[[Sonny's Crib]]'' (1957), ''[[Sonny Clark Trio]]'' (1957), with Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones, and ''[[Cool Struttin']]'' (1958). ''Sonny Clark Trio'', with [[George Duvivier]] and [[Max Roach]] was released in 1960.

Clark died of a heart attack in New York City,<ref name=blue>[http://books.google.com/books?id=lM7kWuxnkvkC&pg=PT166&dq=%22Sonny+Clark%22+dead+OR+died+OR+death&lr=&cd=11#v=onepage&q=%22Sonny%20Clark%22&f=false Blue Note Records: the biography] By Richard Cook</ref> although commentators attribute the early death to Clark's drug and alcohol abuse.<ref name=blue/><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZNqgYy3OcCwC&pg=PA252&dq=%22Sonny+Clark%22+dead+OR+died+OR+death&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22Sonny%20Clark%22%20dead%20OR%20died%20OR%20death&f=false Bebop] By Scott Yanow  p. 252</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=I5wrGL-a-Q8C&pg=RA3-PA17&dq=%22Sonny+Clark%22+dead+OR+died+OR+death&lr=&cd=14#v=onepage&q=%22Sonny%20Clark%22%20dead%20OR%20died%20OR%20death&f=false The rough guide to jazz By] Ian Carr, Digby Fairweather, Brian Priestley. p. 117</ref>

==Legacy==
Close friend and fellow jazz pianist [[Bill Evans]] dedicated the composition "NYC's No Lark" (an anagram of "Sonny Clark") to him after his death, included on Evans' ''[[Conversations with Myself]]'' (1963). [[John Zorn]], [[Wayne Horvitz]], [[Ray Drummond]], and [[Bobby Previte]] recorded an album of Clark's compositions, ''[[Voodoo (Sonny Clark Memorial Quartet album)|Voodoo]]'' (1985), as The Sonny Clark Memorial Quartet. Zorn also recorded several of Clark's compositions with [[Bill Frisell]] and [[George Lewis (trombonist)|George Lewis]] on ''[[News for Lulu (album)|News for Lulu]]'' (1988) and ''[[More News for Lulu (album)|More News for Lulu]]'' (1992).

There are two men by this name in the [[Hebrew Bible]].

In {{bibleverse|Genesis||36:38–39|HE}}, '''Baal-hanan''' is a [[Monarch|King]] of [[Edom]]. He is also mentioned in the King List in {{bibleverse|I|Chronicles|1:49–50|HE}}. He succeeded [[Saul (Edomite king)|Shaul]] and was himself succeeded by Hadad. He was the son of [[Achbor]], and his wife [[Mehetabel]] was the daughter of Matred and granddaughter of [[Mezahab]]. 

He is called the son of Achbor; but the name of his native city is not given. For this and other reasons, Marqaurt supposes that "son of Achbor" is a duplicate of "son of Beor" (Gen. 36:32), and that "Baal-hanan" in the original text is given as the name of the father of the next king, [[Hadar (Edomite king)|Hadar]].<ref>Josef Markwart (Joseph Marquart)<!--name spelling changed in 1922-->, ''Fundamente Israelitischer und Jüdischer Gesch.'' 1896, pp. 10 et seq.</ref>

The date and even historicity of his reign are unknown, as he is not mentioned in any other surviving source.

In the [[Books of Chronicles]] there is also a second man by this name, from the city of [[Geber (bible)|Geder]]. In {{bibleverse|I|Chronicles|27:28|HE}} he is described as being responsible to [[King David]] for the care of [[olive]] and [[ficus|sycamore]] trees.

[[File:Disdrometer.jpg|thumb|A disdrometer in place in the [[Everglades]].]]

A '''disdrometer''' is an instrument used to measure the drop size distribution and [[velocity]] of falling [[precipitation (meteorology)|hydrometeors]].  Some disdrometers can distinguish between [[rain]], [[graupel]], and [[hail]].

The uses for disdrometers are numerous.  They can be used for [[Air traffic control|traffic control]], scientific examination, airport observation systems, and [[hydrology]].  The latest disdrometers employ [[microwave]] or [[laser]] technologies.  2D video disdrometers can be used to analyze individual [[snowflake]]s.

The '''New Jersey Storm '''were a member of the [[National Lacrosse League]], based in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. They played from [[2002 NLL season|2002]] to [[2003 NLL season|2003]]. After the [[2003 NLL season|2003]], due to low attendance in New Jersey, the team relocated to [[Anaheim, California]], becoming the [[Anaheim Storm]]. After the 2005 season, the Anaheim Storm folded due to low attendance.

The franchise was owned by [[NBA]] star [[Jayson Williams]]. He founded the franchise after attending a [[Philadelphia Wings]] game and thought he could bring that excitement to the Meadowlands.

The NLL returned to the New York Metro area in 2007 with the inaugural season of the [[New York Titans (lacrosse)|New York Titans]], who would play at [[Madison Square Garden]] and [[Nassau Coliseum]]. The Titans would play for three seasons before relocating to [[Orlando, Florida]].

'''Paveway''' is a trademark of [[Raytheon Company]] for [[laser-guided bomb]]s and related goods and services, also used by [[Lockheed Martin]] for specific products under license.<ref>[http://www.law360.com/articles/579498/raytheon-lockheed-end-ip-war-over-paveway-bombs], retrieved on October 8, 2014.</ref>

''Pave'' or [[PAVE]] is sometimes used as an acronym for precision [[avionics]] vectoring equipment; literally, electronics for controlling the speed and direction of [[aircraft]]. Laser guidance is a form of Pave.

Pave, paired with other words, also names laser systems that designate targets for LGBs, for example [[Pave Penny]], [[Pave Spike]], [[Pave Tack]] and [[Pave Knife]], and for specialized military aircraft, such as [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130U Pave Spectre]], [[MH-53]] Pave Low, and [[HH-60 Pave Hawk]].

== History ==
The Paveway series of laser-guided bombs was developed by [[Texas Instruments]] starting in [[1964 in aviation|1964]]. The program was conducted on a shoestring budget, but the resultant emphasis on simplicity and economical engineering proved to be a benefit, and a major advantage over other more complex guided weapons. The first test weapon, using a [[M117 bomb]] as the warhead, took place in April [[1965 in aviation|1965]]. Prototype weapons were sent to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] for combat testing starting in [[1968 in aviation|1968]].

In January 1967 the Air Force authorized Project 3169 as the formal engineering program for development of precision guided munitions, renewing its contract with TI in March to redesign the M117 kit, with a very aggressive timeline, projecting deployment to Vietnam for combat testing in one year. Direction of the program was assigned to the Guided Bomb Program Office at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in August, and flight testing begun in November at [[Eglin Air Force Base]] under the direction of an interagency organization called the Pave Way Task Force. At that time the program had three divisions:
* Paveway 1 – laser-guided munitions
* Paveway 2 – an electro-optical (TV) guided munition developed by [[Rockwell International]] designated HOBO ("''Ho''ming ''Bo''mb"), of which 4,000 were eventually produced and 500 launched in combat, and
* Paveway 3 – an infrared guidance system that was never deployed.
* Paveway 4 – dual mode GPS/INS
Because Paveway 2, although considerably more accurate and capable, was four to five times more expensive per copy and much less applicable to most targeting situations in Vietnam, Paveway 1 became the emphasis of the program.

Paveway kits attach to a variety of warheads, and consist of a semi-active laser (SAL) seeker, a computer control group (CCG) containing guidance and control electronics, thermal [[battery (electricity)|battery]], and pneumatic control augmentation system (CAS). There are [[Canard (aeronautics)|front control canards]] and rear wings for stability. The weapon guides on reflected laser energy: the seeker detects the reflected light ("sparkle") of the designating laser, and actuates the canards to guide the bomb toward the designated point.

The original Paveway series, retroactively named '''Paveway I''', gave way in the early 1970s to the improved '''Paveway II''', which had a simplified, more reliable seeker and pop-out rear wings to improve the weapon's glide performance. Both Paveway I and Paveway II use a simple [[Bang-bang control|'bang-bang' control system]], where the CAS commands large [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] deflections to make course corrections, resulting in a noticeable wobble. This had relatively little effect on accuracy, but expends energy quickly, limiting effective range. As a consequence, most users release Paveway I and II weapons in a ballistic trajectory, activating the laser designator only late in the weapon's flight to refine the impact point.

In [[1976 in aviation|1976]], the [[USAF]] issued a requirement for a new generation, dubbed '''Paveway III''', that finally entered service in [[1986 in aviation|1986]]. The Paveway III system used a much more sophisticated seeker with a wider field of view and proportional guidance, minimizing the energy loss of course corrections. Paveway III has a considerably longer glide range and greater accuracy than Paveway II, but it is substantially more expensive, limiting its use to high-value targets. Although Paveway III kits were developed for the smaller [[Mark 82 bomb|Mk 82]] weapons, limited effectiveness caused the [[USAF]] to adopt the kit only for the larger 2,000&nbsp;lb-class weapons (the [[Mark 84 bomb|Mk 84]] and [[BLU-109 bomb|BLU-109]]). Paveway III guidance kits were also used on the [[GBU-28]]/B penetration bomb fielded at the close of the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]]. The Paveway III system was also used during the [[India]]n offensive in the [[Kargil War]] of 1999 by the [[Indian Air Force]] with the [[Mirage 2000]] as a launch platform. [[Raytheon]], the sole provider of Paveway III variants, is currently delivering both standard and enhanced versions to the [[US Government]] and foreign customers.

Existing LGBs in US service can be upgraded to Dual Mode Laser Guided Bombs (DMLGB) by adding [[GPS]] receivers which enable all [[weather]] employment. [[Lockheed Martin]] won the initial contract to provide DMLGBs to the US Navy (USN) in 2005, however subsequent-year money has been "zeroed" in favor of a follow-on Direct Attack Moving Target Capability (DAMTC) program. Raytheon's version, the "Enhanced Paveway II", has been contracted both within the US and abroad.

Raytheon's advanced Paveway IV 500&nbsp;lb bomb has been in service since 2008 with [[UK|Britain's]] [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], but it appears that the USAF remains committed to the GBU-39 [[Small Diameter Bomb]] program.

The Paveway series of bombs includes:
* [[GBU-10 Paveway II]] – [[Mark 84 bomb|Mk 84]] or [[BLU-109 bomb|BLU-109]] 2,000&nbsp;lb (907&nbsp;kg) bomb
* [[GBU-12 Paveway II]] – [[Mark 82 bomb|Mk 82]] 500&nbsp;lb (227&nbsp;kg) bomb
* [[GBU-16 Paveway II]] – [[Mark 83 bomb|Mk 83]] 1,000&nbsp;lb (454&nbsp;kg) bomb
* [[GBU-58 Paveway II]] – [[Mark 81 bomb|Mk 81]] 250&nbsp;lb (113.4&nbsp;kg) bomb
* [[GBU-22 Paveway III]] – [[Mark 82 bomb|Mk 82]] 500&nbsp;lb (227&nbsp;kg) bomb. Developed at the same time as GBU-24, with some limited export success, but was not adopted by USA as it was felt to be too small a warhead for the desired effects at the time.
* [[GBU-24 Paveway III]] – [[Mark 84 bomb|Mk 84]]/[[BLU-109 bomb|BLU-109]] 2,000&nbsp;lb (907&nbsp;kg) class bomb
* [[GBU-27 Paveway III]] – [[BLU-109 bomb|BLU-109]] 2,000&nbsp;lb (907&nbsp;kg) bomb with penetration warhead, specially designed for [[F-117]] because the large fins of GBU-24 couldn't fit into the bomb bay of [[F-117]].
* [[GBU-28]] Paveway III – During the [[Gulf War]], the deepest and most hardened Iraqi bunkers could not be defeated by the [[BLU-109]]/B penetrator warhead, so a much more powerful "bunker buster" GBU-28 was developed. The latest warhead used in the GBU-28/B series is the BLU-122/B, a development of earlier BLU-113 on early GBU-28s.
* [[Paveway IV]] – 500&nbsp;lb (227&nbsp;kg) bomb
* [[GBU-48 Enhanced Paveway II]] – [[Mark 83 bomb|Mk 83]] 1,000&nbsp;lb (454&nbsp;kg) bomb. Raytheon's Enhanced dual-mode GPS and Laser guided version of the laser-only GBU-16.
* [[GBU-49 Enhanced Paveway II]] – [[Mark 82 bomb|Mk 82]] 500&nbsp;lb (227&nbsp;kg) bomb. Raytheon's Enhanced dual-mode GPS and Laser guided version of the laser-only GBU-12.
* [[GBU-50 Enhanced Paveway II]] – [[Mark 84 bomb|Mk 84]] or [[BLU-109 bomb|BLU-109]] 2,000&nbsp;lb (907&nbsp;kg) bomb. Raytheon's Enhanced dual-mode GPS and Laser guided version of the laser-only GBU-10.
* [[GBU-59 Enhanced Paveway II]] – [[Mark 81 bomb|Mk 81]] 250&nbsp;lb (113.4&nbsp;kg) bomb. Raytheon's Enhanced dual-mode GPS and Laser guided version of the laser-only GBU-58.
Although GBU-48 etc. are the formal designation for the versions with GPS/INS, they are widely referred to as EGBU-16 etc. ("Enhanced GBU-16").<ref>http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/app5/paveway-2.html</ref>

== Trademark ==
[[Lockheed Martin]] and [[Raytheon]] compete to supply LGBs to the [[United States Air Force]], and others. Raytheon claimed the exclusive right to use ''Paveway'' as a [[trademark]] for selling LGB-related products. Lockheed Martin claimed ''Paveway'' is a generic term in the defense industry. Lockheed objected to Raytheon's registration of ''Paveway'' in [[opposition proceeding]]s before the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].<ref>ttabvue.uspto.gov, [http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?qt=adv&procstatus=All&qs=paveway], retrieved on July 4, 2009.</ref> On September 27, 2011, the USPTO [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] decided that ''Paveway'' is a generic term, in the United States, for LGBs.<ref>ttabvue.uspto.gov, [http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91167189&pty=OPP&eno=148], retrieved on October 3, 2011.</ref>

Raytheon subsequently sued [[Lockheed Martin]] in Arizona [[United States district court|federal court]] alleging [[trademark infringement]],  Lockheed filed [[counterclaim]]s in the suit. In September, 2014 the companies agreed that Raytheon is the exclusive owner of "paveway" for [[laser-guided bomb]]s and related goods and services and that "paveway" is a protectable [[trademark]], but that Raytheon will license the mark to Lockheed for use in connection with single-mode [[laser-guided bomb]] kits.<ref>http://www.law360.com/articles/579498/raytheon-lockheed-end-ip-war-over-paveway-bombs, retrieved on October 8, 2014.</ref>

First developed by the United States during the [[Vietnam War]], laser-guided bombs quickly proved their value in precision strikes of difficult point targets. These weapons use on-board electronics to track targets that are designated by laser, typically in the infrared spectrum, and adjust their glide path to precisely strike the target. Since the weapon is tracking a light signature, not the object itself, the target must be illuminated from a separate source, either by ground forces, by a pod on the attacking aircraft, or by a separate support aircraft.

Data from Vietnam showed that laser-guided bombs achieved direct hits nearly 50% of the time, versus just 5.5% for unguided bombs. Because of this dramatically higher precision, laser-guided munitions can carry less explosive and cause less collateral damage than unguided munitions. Today, laser-guided bombs are one of the most common and widespread guided bombs, used by a large number of the world's air forces.

== Development ==
Laser-guided weapons were first developed in the United States and United Kingdom in the early 1960s. The [[United States Air Force]] issued the first development contracts in 1964, leading to the development of the [[Paveway]] series, which was used operationally in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] starting in 1968.<ref>[http://www.military.cz/usa/air/in_service/weapons/bombs/paveway/paveway_en.htm] Paveway Laser-Guided Bombs</ref> Although there were a variety of technical and operational problems, the results were generally positive. LGBs proved to offer a much higher degree of accuracy than unguided weapons, but without the expense, complexity, and limitations of guided [[air-to-ground missile]]s like the [[AGM-12 Bullpup]]. The LGB proved particularly effective against difficult fixed targets like bridges, which previously had required huge loads of "dumb" ordnance to destroy.

It was determined that 48% of Paveways dropped during 1972–73 around [[Hanoi]] and [[Haiphong]] achieved direct hits, compared with only 5.5% of unguided bombs dropped on the same area a few years earlier.<ref name="AH">[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/saigon-desert-storm From Saigon to Desert Storm]{{Fixed link|date=June 2013}}</ref> The average Paveway landed within 23 feet of its target, as opposed to 447 feet for gravity bombs.<ref name="AH" /> The leap in accuracy brought about primarily by laser guidance made it possible to take out heavily defended, point objectives that had eluded earlier air raids. 

The most dramatic example was the [[Thanh Hoa Bridge]], 70 miles south of Hanoi, a critical crossing point over the [[Red River (Vietnam)|Red River]]. Starting in 1965, U.S. pilots had flown 871 sorties against it, losing 11 planes without managing to put it out of commission. In 1972 the “Dragon’s Jaw” bridge was attacked with Paveway bombs, and 14 jets managed to do what the previous 871 had not: drop the span, and cut a critical North Vietnamese supply artery.<ref name="AH" />

In the wake of this success, other nations, specifically the Soviet Union, France, and Great Britain, began developing similar weapons in the late 1960s and early 1970s, while US weapons were refined based on combat experience.

In October&nbsp;2010, India developed its first [[Sudarshan laser-guided bomb]] with the help of [[Instruments Research and Development Establishment|IRDE]], a lab of [[DRDO]]. This is a part of ongoing research to achieve self-dependency in defense area.<ref>[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/india-develops-first-laser-guided-bomb/133417-3.html?from=tn India develops its first Laser-Guided Bomb]</ref>

The [[United States Air Force]] and other air forces are now seeking to upgrade their LGBs with [[GPS]] guidance as a back-up. These weapons, such as the USAF Enhanced Guided Bomb Unit (part of the Paveway family), use laser designation for precision attacks, but contain an [[inertial navigation system]] with GPS receiver for back-up, so that if the target illumination is lost or broken, the weapon will continue to home in on the GPS coordinates of the original target.

== Problems and limitations ==
{{no references|section|date=July 2014}}
While LGBs are highly accurate under ideal conditions, they present several challenges for successful use, making them somewhat less than the "silver bullet" sometimes suggested.

The first problem is designation. To ensure accurate guidance, the target must be illuminated by a laser designator and the pilot must deliver the weapon within the "weapon basket" (the zone in which the weapon seeker can observe the laser target marker ''and'' the weapon has sufficient energy to guide to the target).  Laser-guided bombs can be launched without the laser designator turned on, in which case it will follow a ballistic path, until such time as the seeker picks up the reflected laser signal.  This allows the aircraft to deliver an LGB using techniques such as loft or [[toss bombing]].  However, if the designator is turned off, the laser spot moved, the laser signal is blocked (for example by cloud or smoke), the weapon's accuracy will be greatly reduced.  A particular problem with laser designation can be path length under certain environmental conditions.  Laser designators operate in the infrared wavebands, and attenuation of the laser signal by the moisture content of the atmosphere can reduce the signal strength below the threshold of the seeker.  Laser designators modulate their output on a number of discrete codes, and to guide correctly the bomb and designator must be matched.

For an accurate attack against a small target, uninterrupted designation is desirable. But, the simple guidance system of early LGBs (such as the American Paveway II) resulted in a rectilinear flight path, with a tendency to lag below the sightline. To compensate, crews will release their weapons on an unguided, ballistic flightpath, activating the designator only to refine the bomb's final impact point. This is more demanding of crew and aircraft, requiring a high standard of basic, unguided bombing accuracy and more attention to the bomb's flight.

In the 1970s and 1980s it was common for aircraft to rely on a separate designator, either carried by ground forces, operated by the forward air controller, or carried by another aircraft in the strike group. It was often deemed more practical for one aircraft to designate for its comrades. Modern conflicts and a growing emphasis on precision-guided weapons have pointed to the need for autonomous designation, and many [[fighter-bomber]] aircraft are now being fitted with designator pods to self-designate for laser-guided munitions.

Even if the launch aircraft is capable of autonomous designation, the problems described above remain. Laser illumination can be interrupted by smoke, fog, or clouds, limiting the usefulness of LGBs in poor weather or very dusty conditions. In desert warfare, such as the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]], laser designation sometimes reflected off the sand, causing weapons to home on false targets. Furthermore, the need to provide designation may leave the aircraft dangerously exposed to ground fire or enemy air support.

An additional concern is the limited "weapon basket", if the weapon is released too low or too far from the target, or in a trajectory that puts the weapon outside the seeker's field of view, it will miss. Optimum altitude for an effective LGB attack is from medium altitude (20,000 - 30,000&nbsp;ft), increasing the aircraft's vulnerability to [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) attacks. 

For these reasons, while all modern air forces have put an increasing emphasis on LGBs and other precision-guided munitions, some tacticians still see an important role for the accurate delivery of unguided bombs. During their [[Operation Opera|1981 raid on the Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak]], the [[Israeli Air Force]] chose to use unguided [[Mark 84 bomb]]s rather than laser-guided weapons because they felt the need to designate the target would leave the attackers unacceptably vulnerable.

'''Tommy John surgery,''' known in [[medicine|medical]] [[medical practice|practice]] as '''ulnar collateral ligament''' ('''UCL''') '''reconstruction''', is a [[Graft (surgery)|surgical graft]] procedure in which the [[ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint|ulnar collateral ligament]] in the medial [[Elbow-joint|elbow]] is replaced with a [[tendon]] from elsewhere in the body. The procedure is common among collegiate and professional athletes in several sports, most notably [[baseball]].

The procedure was first performed in 1974 by orthopedic surgeon Dr. [[Frank Jobe]], then a [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] team physician who served as a special advisor to the team until his death in 2014. It is named after the first baseball player to undergo the surgery, former major league pitcher [[Tommy John]], whose 288 career victories ranks seventh all time among left-handed pitchers. The initial operation, John's successful post-surgery career, and the relationship between the two men is the subject of a 2013 ESPN ''[[30 for 30#30 for 30 Shorts|30 for 30 Shorts]]'' documentary.<ref name=30for30>{{cite web|title=30 for 30 Shorts: Tommy and Frank|url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9499638/the-unlikely-legacy-dr-frank-jobe-pitcher-tommy-john-profiled-latest-30-30-documentary-series|publisher=Grantland|accessdate=August 17, 2013|author=Grantland staff|date=July 23, 2013}}</ref>

==Procedure==
[[File:Tommy John 2008 bronx.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Tommy John, for whom the surgery is named, in 2008.]]
The patient's arm is opened up around the elbow. Holes to accommodate a new tendon are drilled in the [[ulna]] and [[humerus]] bones of the elbow. A harvested tendon (often the [[Palmaris longus muscle|palmaris tendon]]<ref name=jobe>{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Will|title=Dr. Frank Jobe, Tommy John and the Surgery That Changed Baseball Forever|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1672080-dr-frank-jobe-tommy-john-and-the-surgery-that-changed-baseball-forever?utm_source=cnn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=editorial&hpt=hp_t3|work=Bleacher Report|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.|accessdate=July 17, 2013}}</ref>)—from the forearm of the same or opposite elbow, from below the knee (known as the [[Patellar ligament|patellar tendon]]), or from a [[cadaver]]—is then woven in a figure-eight pattern through the holes and anchored. The [[ulnar nerve]] is usually moved to prevent pain as scar tissue that forms can apply pressure to the nerve.<ref name=jobe />

==Prognosis==
At the time of Tommy John's operation, Jobe put his chances at 1 in 100. In 2009, prospects of a complete recovery had risen to 85–92 percent.<ref name=Rosenhek>{{cite web|last=Rosenhek|first=Eric|title=The gory details of Tommy John surgery|date=July 1, 2009|publisher=The Good Point|url=http://thegoodpoint.com/tommy-john-surgery-procedure|accessdate=April 6, 2014}}</ref>

Following his 1974 surgery, John missed the entire 1975 season rehabilitating his arm before returning for the 1976 season. Before his surgery, John had won 124 games. He won 164 games after surgery, retiring in 1989 at age 46.

For baseball players, full [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] takes about one year for pitchers and about six months for position players. Players typically begin throwing about 16 weeks after surgery.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2003-07-29-tommy-john-rehab-schedule_x.htm|work=USA Today|first1=Mike|last1=Dodd|title=A year of rehab for Tommy John patients|date=July 29, 2003}}</ref>

==Risk factors==
The UCL can become stretched, frayed, or torn through the repetitive stress of the throwing motion. The risk of injury to the throwing athlete's [[ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint]] is thought to be extremely high as the amount of stress through this structure approaches its ultimate tensile strength during a hard throw.<ref>Fleisig, G.S., The biomechanics of baseball pitching, in Biomechanical Engineering. 1994, University of Alabama: Birmingham. p. 163.</ref> [[R.A. Dickey]], however, became a very successful Major League Baseball pitcher despite having no UCL in his pitching arm.<ref name="Times">{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/sports/baseball/27dickey.html|work=The New York Times|title=New Twist Keeps Dickey's Career Afloat|first=Alan|last=Schwarz|date=February 27, 2008}}</ref>

While many authorities suggest that an individual's style of throwing or the type of pitches they throw are the most important determinant of their likelihood to sustain an injury, the results of a 2002 study suggest that the total number of pitches thrown is the greatest determinant.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Stephen |last1=Lyman |first2=Glenn S. |last2=Fleisig |first3=James R. |last3=Andrews |first4=E. David |last4=Osinski |title=Effect of Pitch Type, Pitch Count, and Pitching Mechanics on Risk of Elbow and Shoulder Pain in Youth Baseball Pitchers |journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine |pmid=12130397 |url=http://ajs.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12130397 |year=2002 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=463–8}}</ref> A 2002 study examined the throwing volume, pitch type, and throwing mechanics of 426 pitchers aged 9 to 14 for one year. Compared to pitchers who threw 200 or fewer pitches in a season, those who threw 201–400, 401–600, 601–800, and 800+ pitches faced an increased risk of 63%, 181%, 234%, and 161% respectively. The types of pitches thrown showed a smaller effect; throwing a [[slider]] was associated with an 86% increased chance of elbow injury, while throwing a [[curveball]] was associated with an increase in pain. There was only a weak correlation between throwing mechanics perceived as bad and injury-prone.  Thus, although there is a large body of other evidence that suggests mistakes in throwing mechanics increase the likelihood of injury<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Rod |last1=Whiteley |year=2007 |title=Baseball throwing mechanics as they relate to pathology and performance – A review |journal=Journal of Sports Science and Medicine |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1–20 |url=http://www.jssm.org/vol6/n1/1/v6n1-1pdf.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0838.1996.tb00062.x}}</ref> it seems that the greater risk lies in the volume of throwing in total. Research into the area of throwing injuries in young athletes has led to age-based recommendations for pitch limits for young athletes.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00005768-200111000-00002 |title=Longitudinal study of elbow and shoulder pain in youth baseball pitchers |year=2001 |last1=Lyman |first1=Stephen |last2=Fleisig |first2=Glenn S. |last3=Waterbor |first3=John W. |last4=Funkhouser |first4=Ellen M. |last5=Pulley |first5=Leavonne |last6=Andrews |first6=James R. |last7=Osinski |first7=E.

</ref>

In younger athletes, for whom the growth plate (the medial epicondylar epiphysis) is still open, the force on the inside of the elbow during throwing is more likely to cause the elbow to fail at this point than at the ulnar collateral ligament. This injury is often termed "[[Little League elbow]]" and can be serious but does not require reconstructing the UCL.

==Complications==
There is a risk of damage to the [[ulnar nerve]].<ref name="pmid17279038">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/BLO.0b013e31802eb447 |title=Ulnar Collateral Ligament Reconstruction |year=2007 |last1=Purcell |first1=Derek B |last2=Matava |first2=Matthew J |last3=Wright |first3=Rick W |journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research |volume=455 |pages=72–7 |pmid=17279038}}</ref>

==Misconceptions==
Some baseball pitchers believe they can throw harder after Tommy John Surgery than they did beforehand. As a result, orthopedic surgeons have reported that parents of young pitchers have come to them and asked them to perform the procedure on their un-injured sons in the hope that this will increase their sons' performance.<ref>{{cite news|last=[[Jere Longman|Longman]]|first=Jere|title=Fit Young Pitchers See Elbow Repair as Cure-All|date=July 20, 2007|publisher=nytimes.com|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/20/sports/baseball/20surgery.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|accessdate=October 23, 2013}}</ref> However, many people—including Dr. Frank Jobe, the doctor who invented the procedure—believe any post-surgical increases in performance are most likely due to the increased stability of the elbow joint and pitchers' increased attention to their fitness and conditioning.<ref>{{cite web|last=[[Jonah Keri|Keri]]|first=Jonah|title=Interview With Dr. Frank Jobe|date=September 13, 2007|publisher=ESPN.com|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/bp/1431308.html|accessdate=October 13, 2008}}</ref> Jobe believed that, rather than allowing pitchers to gain velocity, the surgery and rehab protocols merely allow pitchers to return to their pre-injury levels of performance.

A '''magistrate''' is an officer of the [[state (polity)|state]]; in modern usage, the term usually refers to a [[judge]]. This was not always the case; in [[ancient Rome]], a ''[[Roman magistrate|magistratus]]'' was one of the highest government officers and possessed both judicial and [[executive branch|executive]] powers. Today, in [[common law]] systems, a magistrate has limited [[law]] enforcement and administration authority. In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, a magistrate might be a judge in a superior court; the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] might have jurisdiction over [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] cases. A related, but not always equivalent, term is ''[[chief magistrate]]'', which historically can denote a political and administrative officer.

==Etymology==
''Magistrate'' derives from the [[Middle English]] word ''magistrat'', denoting a "civil officer in charge of administrating laws" (c.1374); from the [[Old French]] ''magistrat''; from the Latin ''magistratus'', which derives from ''magister'' (master), from the root of ''magnus'' (great).

==Original meaning==
In [[ancient Rome]], the word [[magistratus]] referred to one of the highest offices of state, and analogous offices in the local authorities such as ''municipium,'' which were subordinate only to the legislature of which they generally were members, often even ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]'', and often combined judicial and executive power, together constituting one jurisdiction. In Rome itself, the highest magistrates were members of the so-called [[cursus honorum]] -'career of honors'. They held both [[judicial]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] power within their sphere of responsibility (hence the modern use of the term "magistrate" to denote both judicial and executive officers), and also had the power to issue ''ius honorarium'', or magisterial law. The [[Consul]] was the highest [[Roman Republic|Roman]] magistrate. The [[Praetor]] (the office was later divided into two, the Urban and Peregrine Praetors) was the highest judge in matters of [[private law]] between individual citizens, while the Curule [[Aedile]]s, who supervised [[public works]] in the city, exercised a limited civil jurisdiction in relation to the [[Market (economics)|market]].<ref>p4 and p18, Nicholas, Barry, ''An Introduction to Roman Law'' (Oxford University Press, 1975) ISBN 0-19-876063-9</ref> Roman magistrates were not lawyers, but were advised by [[jurist]]s who were experts in the law.

The term was maintained in most feudal successor states to the western [[Roman Empire]], mainly Germanic kingdoms, especially in city-states, where the term magistrate was also used as an abstract generic term, denoting the highest office, regardless of the formal titles (e.g. Consul, Mayor, Doge), even when that was actually a council. The term "[[chief magistrate]]" applied to the highest official, in sovereign entities the [[head of state]] and/or [[head of government]].

==Continental Europe and its former colonies==
Under the civil law systems of European countries such as [[Italy]], [[Belgium]] and [[France]], "magistrat" (French) or "magistrato" (Italian) is a generic term which comprises both prosecutors and judges (distinguished as 'standing' versus 'sitting' magistrature). It should be noted that the legal systems of these countries are not identical, and thus show some relevant differences in the judiciary organization.

In [[Finland]], a magistrate is a state-appointed local administrative officer whose responsibilities include keeping [[Civil registry|population information and public registers]], acting as a [[public notary]] and conducting civil marriages and same-sex unions.

==Mexico==
In [[Mexico]] a ''Magistrado'' (magistrate), is a superior judge (and the highest-ranking State judge) hierarchically beneath the Supreme Court Justices (Ministros de la Corte Suprema) in the Federal Law System. The ''magistrado'' reviews the cases seen by a judge in a second term, if any of the parties disputes the verdict. For special cases, there are ''magistrados superiores'' (superior magistrates) who review the verdicts of special court and tribunal magistrates.

==English common law tradition==

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
{{Main|Magistrates of England and Wales}}
In the [[courts of England and Wales]], magistrates&mdash;also known as [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] (JPs)&mdash;hear prosecutions for and dispose of '[[summary offence]]s' and some '[[Hybrid offence#English law|triable-either-way offences]]' by making orders with regard to and placing additional requirements on offenders. Magistrates/JP's can only sentence for six months for one offence and twelve months consecutively, they can also give a maximum of a £5,000 fine; community orders which can include curfews, [[electronic tagging]], requirements to perform unpaid work up to 300 hours or supervision up to three years and or various other options. Magistrates hear [[committal (law)|committal proceedings]] for certain offences, and can establish whether sufficient evidence exists to pass the case to a higher court for trial and sentencing. In more serious cases, magistrates have power to pass 'either-way' offenders to the Crown Court for sentencing when, in the opinion of the magistrates, a penalty greater than can be given in the magistrates' court is warranted. A wide range of other legal matters are within the remit of magistrates. In the past, magistrates have been responsible for granting licences to sell alcohol, for instance,<ref>Under a law of 1729 which instituted Brewster sessions, a special meeting of quarter sessions (Richardson, John (1974) ''The Local Historian's Encyclopedia''. New Barnet: Historical Publications; p. 270; Hey, David, ed. (1996) ''The Oxford Companion to Local and Family History''. Oxford University Press; pp. 46-47)</ref> but this function is now exercised by local councils though there is a right of appeal to the magistrates' court. Magistrates are also responsible for granting search warrants to the police and some other authorities, therefore it used to be a requirement that they live within a {{convert|15|mi|km|sing=on}} radius of the area they preside over (the ''commission area'') in case they are needed to sign a warrant out-of-hours. However, ''commission areas'' were replaced with ''Local Justice Areas'' by the [[Courts Act 2003]], meaning magistrates no longer need to live within {{convert|15|mi|km}}, although, in practice, many still do. Section 7 of the Courts Act 2003 states that ''"There shall be a commission of the peace for England and Wales— . . . b) addressed generally, and not by name, to all such persons as may from time to time hold office as justices of the peace for England and Wales"''. Thus every magistrate in England and Wales may act as a magistrate anywhere in England or Wales.

There are two types of magistrates [http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/who-are-the-judiciary/judicial-roles/magistrates/] in [[England]] and [[Wales]]: justices of the peace and district judges (formerly known as stipendiary magistrates) permanently employed by the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] (until May 2007, the [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]]). Justices of the peace sit voluntarily, apart from an allowance being paid for loss of earnings, mileage and subsistence (which are at a standardised rate agreed by the Ministry of Justice). According to requirements, around 50% of them are women. Over 41% of magistrates are retired from employment while others may be self-employed or able to arrange leave from their employment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} That said, there are those who recognise{{Who|date=May 2010}} that three de facto jurors from the community may well have a more realistic understanding of local life than a single district judge whose background is in law rather than working in the wider community.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

No formal qualifications are required but magistrates need intelligence, common sense, integrity and the capacity to act fairly. Membership is widely spread throughout the area covered and drawn from all walks of life. Police officers, [[traffic warden]]s and members of the [[armed forces]], as well as their close relatives will not be appointed, nor will those convicted of certain criminal offences including recent minor offences. All magistrates receive a 3 day training before sitting, carried out in conjunction with a mentoring program (mentors are magistrates with at least 3 years' service),<ref>[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/CrimeJusticeAndTheLaw/Becomingamagistrate/DG_071384 The Magistracy and the work of magistrates]</ref> which covers basic law and procedure and then continue to receive training throughout their judicial career. Additional training is given to magistrates choosing to sit in the Youth Court, or those dealing with family matters. New magistrates sit with mentors on at least six occasions during their first eighteen months.

Magistrates are unpaid appointees but they may receive allowances to cover travelling expenses, subsistence and loss of earnings for those not paid by their employer whilst sitting as a magistrate up to £116.78 a day. A Justice of the Peace may sit at any magistrates' court in England & Wales but in practice, are appointed to their local bench, (a colloquial and legal term for the local court), and are provided with advice, especially on sentencing, by a legally qualified Clerk to the Justices. They will normally sit as a panel of three with two as a minimum. Many are members of the [[Magistrates' Association]], which provides advice, training and represents the approximately 28,000 magistrates to the Government. The Association also represents magistrates on the Sentencing Guidelines Council.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The second group are known as District Judges (Magistrates' Court) (known as Stipendiary Magistrates - which is to say, magistrates who received a stipend or payment - up until August 2000<ref>[http://www.lawteacher.net/english-legal-system/resources/magistrates-1.php www.lawteacher.net]</ref>). Unlike magistrates, District Judges (Magistrates' Court) sit alone. District Judges have tended to be appointed from the ranks of legal advisors to the magistrates' court and will be qualified solicitors or barristers. Questions have been raised by the Magistrates Association as to the legal safeguards of a single District Judge allowed to hear a case, decide the outcome and pass sentence without reference to another party.<ref>John Thornhill, Chairman of the Magistrates Association - Solicitors Journal - April 2011</ref>

[[Judicial Office]] http://www.judiciary.gov.uk ref: [http://magistrates magistrates] http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/who-are-the-judiciary/judicial-roles/magistrates/

====Scotland====
In [[Scotland]], the lowest level of law-court, the District Court, is presided over by a [[Justice of the Peace]]. The District Courts were replaced with Justice of the Peace Courts beginning in Sheriffdom of Lothian and Borders in December 2007.

===Australia===

====Federal Magistrate====
A Federal Magistrate occupies an office created in 1999. The [[Federal Magistrates' Court of Australia]] deals with more minor [[Commonwealth]] law matters which had previously been heard by the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] ([[administrative law]], [[bankruptcy]], [[consumer protection]], [[trade practices]], [[human rights]] and [[copyright]]) or the [[Family Court of Australia|Family Court]] (divorce, [[child custody|residence]] (or custody) and contact (or access) of the children, property division upon divorce, maintenance and [[child support]]). The court's name is misleading, in that it exercises a jurisdiction well in excess of that of the state magistrates' courts, and similar to that of the District and County courts of the Australian states.

The Federal and Family Courts continue, but the Federal Magistrates hear shorter or less complex matters or matters in which the monetary sum in disputes does not exceed given amounts. For instance property divisions where the total assets are A$700,000 or less and consumer law matters (trade practices) where the amount claimed is less than $750,000. However, in some areas, such as bankruptcy and copyright, the court has unlimited jurisdiction.

The Federal Magistrates’ Court has assumed a significant part of the work load of the two superior courts. By 2004/05 the court was dealing with 73% of the total number of applications made in the three courts (see the [http://www.fmc.gov.au/pubs/docs/04-05pt3.pdf Annual Report of the Federal Magistrates' Court 2004/2005]).

====State Magistrate====
The State Magistrates in Australia derive from the English Magistrates. All Magistrates are salaried officers, they can be from a legal background or promoted through the Court Registry. They do not require formal legal training or a law degree.

The [[jurisdiction]] of the magistrates varies from [[States and territories of Australia|state to state]]. They preside over courts which are, depending on the state, called Magistrates’ Courts, [[Local Court of New South Wales|Local Courts]] or Courts of Petty Sessions.

Magistrates hear [[bail]] applications, motor licensing applications, applications for orders restraining a given individual from approaching a specific person (“intervention orders” or “apprehended violence orders”), [[summary offence|summary criminal matters]], the least serious [[indictable offence|indictable criminal matters]], and civil matters where the disputed amount does not exceed A$40,000 to A$100,000 (depending on the State).

In some states, such as [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales|NSW]], the Magistrate may appear robed, although some Magistrates are known to prefer a business suit. Magistrates presiding in the [[Koori Court]] (which deals with [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] [[defendant]]s) were originally of a mind not to appear robed; however elders within the Indigenous community urged Magistrates to continue wearing robes to mark the solemnity of the court process to defendants. Robing is being considered for Magistrates in other states; however, neither Counsel nor solicitors appear robed in any Australian Magistrates' court. Robing in summary courts is unlikely to extend to the legal profession.

Historically Magistrates in Australia have been referred to as “Your Worship”. (From [[Old English]] ''weorthscipe'', meaning being worthy of respect.) However, members of the magistracy are now addressed as "Your Honour" in all states. This was partly to recognise the increasing role magistrates play in the administration of justice, but also to recognise the archaic nature of "Your Worship" and the tendency for witnesses and defendants to incorrectly use "Your Honour" in any event. It is also acceptable to address a magistrate simply as Sir or Madam.

=== Hong Kong===
{{main|Magistrates' Court (Hong Kong)}}
There are currently seven magistrates' courts in Hong Kong. Magistrates exercise criminal jurisdiction over a wide range of offences. Although there is a general limit of two years' imprisonment or a fine of HK$100,000, certain statutory provisions give Magistrates the power to sentence up to three years' imprisonment and to impose a fine up to HK$5,000,000.

===India===
{{See also|Judiciary of India}}
{{CourtsIndia}}
{{cleanup section|reason = Content is confusing and appears to repeat itself. Requires rewriting for clarity by an expert on the subject|date=March 2014}}
There are four categories of magistrates in [[Judiciary of India]]. This classification is given in the [[Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (India)|Criminal Procedure Code, 1973]] (CrPC). It stipulates that in each [[District Courts of India|sessions district]], there shall be:
*'''Chief Judicial Magistrate'''
*'''Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate'''
*[[Courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class|Judicial Magistrates First Class]] and
*'''Executive Magistrates''' [it includes DM,SDM]

1.'''Chief Judicial Magistrate[CJM]''' includes Additional Chief Judicial magistrates also. They hear all type of criminal cases. All magistrates' courts are controlled by CJM. He look the work of judicial Magistrates but he can't take any action against judicial magistrates. Only he report the misbehavior of judicial magistrates to High court. A court of Chief Judicial Magistrates can sentence a person to jail up to seven-ten years and impose finef up to{{INRconvert|30000}}. He is Senior among all Magistrates in district including District Magistrates & most powerful magistrate.

2.There is a '''Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate (SDJM)''' in every subdivision. They hear the case related to dwori act, EC act and other criminal cases. He also maintained and controlled judicial court below it. A court of Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrates sentences a person up to seven-ten years and impose fine up to{{INRconvert|25000}}. Judicial magistrates can try criminal cases.
 
3.A [[Courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class|Judicial Magistrate First Class]] can sentence a person to jail for up to five-seven Years and impose a fine of up to {{INRConvert|15000}}.
There are in each District the following kinds of Judicial Magistrates:
*one Chief Judicial Magistrate [CJM]
*one or Two Additional Chief Judicial Magistrates [ACJM] 
*one or Two Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrates [SDJM]
*Five Judicial Magistrates 1st class [JM]
 
An Executive Magistrate is an officer of the Executive branch (as opposed to the Judicial branch) who is invested with specific powers under both the [[CrPC]] and the [[Indian Penal Code]] (IPC). These powers are conferred by Sections 107-110, 133, 144, 145, and 147 of the [[CrPC]]. These officers cannot try any accused nor pass verdicts. A person arrested on the orders of a court located outside the local jurisdiction should be produced before an Executive Magistrate who can also set the [[bail]] amount for the arrested individual to avoid police custody, depending on the terms of the [[Warrant (law)|warrant]]. The Executive Magistrate also can pass orders restraining persons from committing a particular act or preventing persons from entering an area ([[Section 144]][[CrPC]]). There is no specific provision to order a "[[curfew]]". The Executive Magistrates alone are authorized to use force against people. In plain language, they alone can disperse an "[[unlawful assembly]]". Technically, the police is to assist the Executive Magistrate. They can direct the police about the manner of force ([[baton charge]]/ tear gas/blank fire/firing) and also how much force should be used. They can also take the assistance of the Armed Forces to quell a [[riot]].

There are, in each Revenue District (as opposed to a Sessions District) the following kinds of Executive Magistrates:
* One [[District Magistrate]] (DM)
* Two or more Additional District Magistrates (ADM)
* Three or more Subdivisional District Magistrates (SDM)and
* at least Ten Executive Magistrates
All the Executive Magistrates of the district, except the ADM, are under the control of the DM.

These magistracies are normally conferred on the officers of the Revenue Department, although an officer can be appointed exclusively as an Executive Magistrate. Normally, the Collector of the district is appointed as the ''DM''. Similarly, the Sub-Collectors are appointed as the SDMs. Tahsildars and Deputy/Additional Tahsildars are appointed as Executive Magistrates.

Under the old CrPC, there was no distinction between the Executive and Judicial Magistrates; some states still follow the old CrPC.

===New Zealand===
The position of '''stipendiary magistrate''' in [[New Zealand]] was renamed in 1980 to that of '''district court judge'''. The position was often known simply as ''magistrate'', or the postnominal initials '''SM''' after a magistrate's name in newspapers' court reports.

In the late 1990s, a position of '''community magistrate''' was created for district courts on a trial basis; two community magistrates were initially required to sit to consider a case. Some of these community magistrates are still serving.

===United States===
Magistrates are somewhat less common in the [[United States]] than in Europe, but the position does exist in some jurisdictions.

The term "magistrate" is often used (chiefly in judicial opinions) as a generic term for any independent [[judge]] who is capable of issuing [[Warrant (law)|warrants]], reviewing [[arrest]]s, etc.<ref>[http://student.education2020.com/activities/vocab.aspx?keystr=13230&order=08020305&stbl=2196465 Education 2020 Homeschool Console]; Government course - Vocabulary, "usage" section for '''magistrate''': "''The term, magistrate, is often used for any independent judge who is capable of issuing warrants and reviewing arrests.''"</ref><ref>[http://vwcommonpleas.org/admin.asp Vwcommonpleas.org]</ref> When used in this way it does not denote a judge with a particular office. Instead, it denotes (somewhat circularly) a judge or judicial officer who is capable of hearing and deciding a particular matter. That capability is defined by [[statute]] or by [[common law]]. In [[Virginia]], for example, the Constitution of 1971 created the office of magistrate to replace the use in cities and counties of the [[justice of the peace]], which is common in many states for this function.

As noted above, the terms "magistrate" or "chief magistrate" were sometimes used in the early days of the republic to refer to the [[President of the United States]], as in President [[John Adams]]'s message to the [[U.S. Senate]] upon the death of [[George Washington]]: "His example is now complete, and it will teach wisdom and virtue to magistrates, citizens, and men, not only in the present age, but in future generations, as long as our history shall be read" (December 19, 1799).

====Federal courts====
{{Main|United States magistrate judge}}
In the [[United States federal courts]], a '''magistrate judge''' is a judicial officer authorized by {{UnitedStatesCode|28|631}} ''[[et seq]]''.  They were formerly known as U.S. commissioners, and then as magistrates. Magistrate judges, as they have been designated since 1990, are appointed by the life-term federal [[United States district court|district judges]] of a particular court, serving terms of eight years if full-time, or four years if part-time, and may be reappointed. Magistrate judges conduct a wide range of judicial proceedings to expedite the disposition of the civil and criminal caseloads of the United States district courts. [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] set forth in the statute powers and responsibilities that could be delegated by district court judges to magistrate judges. To achieve maximum flexibility in meeting the needs of each court, however, Congress left the actual determination of which duties to assign to magistrate judges to the individual courts.

====State courts====
In many [[State court (United States)|state court]] systems in the United States, magistrate courts are the successor to [[Justice of the Peace]] courts, and frequently have authority to handle the trials of civil cases up to a certain dollar amount at issue, applications for [[bail]], arrest and search warrants, and the adjudication of petty or misdemeanor criminal offenses.  In [[Ohio]], magistrates are subordinate to the judge or judges who appoint them, and all of their decisions are subject to the review, amendment, approval or reversal by a judge.  In some states, including [[West Virginia]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], magistrates are elected and not appointed.

==Other traditions==

===People's Republic of China===
'''Magistrate''', or '''chief magistrate''', is also a common translation of the Chinese ''xianzhang'' (??/?? ''literally: county leader''){{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} the political head of a [[County (People's Republic of China)|county]] or ''xiàn'' (?/?) which ranks in the [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#County level|third level of the administrative hierarchy]] of the People's Republic of China. The translation dates from [[Imperial era of Chinese history|imperial China]] in which the county magistrate was the lowest official in the imperial Chinese bureaucracy and had judicial in addition to administrative functions.

In modern-day China, the county leader is technically elected by the local people's congress but in fact is appointed by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]. Although there have been some elections at the lower township level, these elections (with one exception, which was considered irregular and illegal) have not extended up to the county level. Although not an important official, county leaders, particularly in rural areas, can sometimes have a strong impact on the lives of ordinary people by enforcing central government regulations or by turning a blind eye to their violation.

===Switzerland===
In [[Switzerland]], ''magistrate'' is a designation for the persons holding the most senior executive and judicial offices. On the federal level, the members of the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]], the [[Federal Chancellor of Switzerland|Federal Chancellor]] and the judges on the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Federal Supreme Court]] are called magistrates.<ref>See art. 1 of the ''Bundesgesetz über Besoldung und berufliche Vorsorge der Magistratspersonen'', [http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/172_121/a1.html SR/RS 172.121].</ref> The designation of magistrate is not a [[title]] or [[Style (manner of address)|style]]. It does not, by itself, confer any particular privileges.

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan, magistrates are the heads of government of counties. The county magistrate [[election]]s are heavily and sometimes bitterly contested, and are often a stepping-stone to higher office. County magistrate elections were first open to election in the 1960s and, before the end of [[martial law]] in 1991, were the highest elected position of any real power and hence the focus of election campaigns by the [[Tangwai]] movement.

==In popular culture==
* British humourist [[P.G. Wodehouse]] wrote in one of his ''[[Jeeves and Wooster]]'' stories, "Jeeves and the [[Feudal]] Spirit" (1955), "Well, you know what magistrates are. The lowest form of pond life. When a fellow hasn't the brains and initiative to sell jellied eels, they make him a magistrate." [[Bertie Wooster]] often appeared before magistrates when he was arrested for minor offenses.
* A plump and foolish magistrate is a key character in [[Amy Tan]]'s children's book (and the related [[PBS]] television show) ''[[Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat]].''
* In the post-colonial novel ''[[Waiting for the Barbarians]]'' by [[J. M. Coetzee]], the story is told from the narrative perspective of the magistrate of one of the settlements in what is presumed to be [[Africa]].
* In the [[Walt Disney]] movie ''[[Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier]],'' Davy is appointed magistrate of the local community.
*Magistrates appear in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe as well. On ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]],'' Constable [[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]] often threatens detainees or those he suspects are guilty of various crimes and violations that he will send them to the magistrate, or tells them sarcastically, in response to their pleas of innocence, to "Tell it to the magistrate."
* In the first installment of the popular [[Starcraft]] real-time strategy series, one plays as a magistrate working for the Confederacy, a cruel government. One later joins the Sons of Korhal, aiding in the rebellion.

'''Jamaica''' is a middle-class [[neighborhood]] in the [[New York City]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]]. It was settled under [[Netherlands|Dutch]] rule in 1656 in [[New Netherland]] as ''{{lang|nl|Rustdorp}}''.<ref name=Ross>{{cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~jdevlin/ny/jamaica_li_hist.htm |title=Jamaica |accessdate=2007-12-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080127133757/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~jdevlin/ny/jamaica_li_hist.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-27}} {{cite book |title=The History of Long Island, from its earliest settlement to the present time |author=Peter Ross |location=NY |publisher=Lewis Pub. Co. |year=1902}}</ref> Under British rule, Jamaica became the center of the "[[Political subdivisions of New York State#Town|Town]] of Jamaica". Jamaica was the county seat of Queens County from the formation of the county in 1683 until March 7, 1788, when the town was reorganized by the state government and the county seat was moved to [[Mineola, New York|Mineola]] (now part of Nassau County). In 1814, Jamaica became the first incorporated village on Long Island. When Queens was incorporated into the [[City of Greater New York]] in 1898, both the Town of Jamaica and the Village of Jamaica were dissolved, but the neighborhood of Jamaica regained its role as county seat. The neighborhood is part of [[Queens Community Board 12]], which also includes Hollis, St. Albans, Springfield Gardens, Baisley Park, Rochdale Village, and South Jamaica.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/cau/html/cb/queens.shtml |title=Queens Community Boards |accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref> Jamaica is patrolled by the [[NYPD]]'s 103rd, 113th & 105th Precincts.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_103.shtml 103rd Precinct],[http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_113.shtml 113th Precinct], [http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_105.shtml 105th Precinct] [[NYPD]].</ref>

Previously known as one of the predominantly [[African American]] neighborhoods in the borough of Queens, Jamaica in recent years has been undergoing a sharp influx of other ethnicities. It has a substantial concentration of [[West Indian]] immigrants, [[India]]ns, [[Arabs]], as well as many long-established African American families.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The neighborhood of Jamaica is completely unrelated to the [[Caribbean]] nation of [[Jamaica]] (although many residents are immigrants from Jamaica); the name similarity is a coincidence.  The name derives from ''Yameco'', a corruption of a word for "beaver" in the [[Delaware languages|Lenape language]] spoken by the Native Americans who lived in the area at the time of first European contact. The "y" sound in English is spelled with a "j" in Dutch, the first Europeans to write about the area. This resulted in the eventual English pronunciation of "Jamaica" when read and repeated orally.<ref>[http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=12608 Major Mark Park], accessed 2006-12-16</ref>

Jamaica is the location of several government buildings including [[New York City Civil Court|Queens Civil Court]], the civil branch of the [[New York Supreme Court|Queens County Supreme Court]], the Queens County Family Court and the [[Joseph Patrick Addabbo|Joseph P. Addabbo]] Federal Building, home to the [[Social Security Administration|Social Security Administration's]] Northeastern Program Service Center.<ref>http://www.gruzensamton.com/pdf/Addabbo.pdf</ref> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Northeast Regional Laboratory as well as the New York District Office are also located in Jamaica. Jamaica Center, the area around [[Jamaica Avenue]] and 165th Street, is a major commercial center, as well as the home of the Central Library of the [[Queens Borough Public Library]].

[[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] and the hotels nearby also use Jamaica as their address.

[[Jamaica Avenue]] was an ancient trail for tribes from as far away as the [[Ohio River]] and the [[Great Lakes]], coming to trade skins and furs for [[wampum]].<ref>[http://www.queenslibrary.org/index.aspx?page_nm=CL-Communityinfo&branch_id=Sj Community History], accessed 2006-12-16</ref> It was in 1655 that the first settlers paid the Native Americans with two guns, a coat, and some powder and lead, for the land lying between the old trail and "Beaver Pond" (later Baisley Pond). Dutch [[Director-General of New Netherland|Director-General]] [[Peter Stuyvesant]] dubbed the area ''{{lang|nl|Rustdorp}}'' (“rest-town”) in granting the 1656 [[land patent]].

The [[England|English]] took over in 1664, renamed it ''Jameco'' (or ''Yamecah'') after the name they gave to the local Native Americans that lived in the area, and made it part of the county of [[Yorkshire County, Province of New York|Yorkshire]]. In 1683, when the British divided the [[Province of New York]] into counties, Jamaica became the county seat of [[Queens County, New York|Queens County]], one of the original counties of New York.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Jam78.jpg|thumb|[[King Manor]] along [[Jamaica Avenue]]]] -->

By 1776, Jamaica had become a trading post for farmers and their produce.  For more than a century, their horse-drawn carts plodded along Jamaica Avenue, then called King's Highway.

By 1834, the [[Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad]] company had completed a line to Jamaica.

[[Image:Jamaica stations 1873.jpg|thumb|Jamaica railroad stations in 1873]]
In 1850, the former Kings Highway (now Jamaica Avenue) became the Brooklyn and Jamaica [[Plank Road]], complete with toll gate. In 1866, tracks were laid for a [[horsecar]] line, and 20 years later it was electrified, the first in the state. On January 1, 1898, Queens became part of the [[City of Greater New York|City of New York]], and Jamaica became the county seat.

The present [[Jamaica (LIRR station)|Jamaica station]] of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] was completed in 1913, and the [[BMT Jamaica Line]] arrived in 1918, followed by the [[IND Queens Boulevard Line|IND Queens Blvd. Line]] in 1936 and the [[IND Archer Avenue Line|Archer]] [[BMT Archer Avenue Line|Avenue]] lines in 1988 (after the portion of Jamaica Line in Jamaica was torn down.) The 1920s and 1930s saw the building of the Valencia Theatre (now restored by the Tabernacle of Prayer), the "futuristic" Kurtz furniture store and the Roxanne Building. In the 1970s, it became the headquarters for the [[Islamic Society of North America]].

== Demographics and neighborhoods ==
{{Ethnic New York City sidebar}}
Jamaica is large and has a diverse population. It is mostly African American, with sizable Hispanic, Asian and White populations. While the corresponding figures represent a certain portion of Jamaica, official statistics differ by the area's numerous zip codes such as 11411, 11428, 11432, 11433, 11434, 11435, and 11436. The total population of Jamaica is estimated to be a bit over 200,000 with all neighborhoods taken into consideration.

Jamaica was not always as diverse as it is today. Throughout the 19th to early 20th centuries, Jamaica was mainly populated with whites as new Irish immigrants settled around the places known today as Downtown and Baisley Pond Park. However in the 1950s, what was later called [[white flight]] began and middle-income African Americans started taking their place. After the 1970s, as housing prices began to tumble, many Hispanic such as Salvadorans, Colombians, Dominicans, and West Indian immigrants moved in. These ethnic groups tended to stay more towards the Jamaica Avenue and South Jamaica areas. Yet it wasn't until the late 1990s and early 2000s that immigration from other countries became widespread. [[Gentrification]] and decrease in crime attracted many families toward Jamaica's safe havens. Hillside Avenue reflects this trend. Along 150th to 161st streets, much of the stores and restaurants are of South American and Caribbean culture.

Farther east is the rapidly growing East Indian community. Mainly spurred on by Jamaica Muslim Center, [[Bangladeshis]] have flocked to this area due to easy transit access and the numerous Bangladeshi stores and restaurants lining 167th and 168th streets. Neighborhood analysts{{Who|date=April 2012}} have concluded that Bangladeshis are becoming the most rapidly growing group. Other areas where they are known to reside include Merrick Blvd. and Sutphin Blvd. in South Jamaica. Yet heading down this same direction, you will find numerous churches, stores, salons, and hair-braiding shops thriving in the hip-hop and African-American cultures. Many [[Sri Lankans]] also live in this area for similar reasons as the Bangladeshi community, evidenced in the numerous food and grocery establishments catering to the community along Hillside Avenue. As well as the large South Asian community thrives significant [[Filipinos|Filipino]] and [[Africa]]n communities in Jamaica, along with the neighboring Filipino community in [[Queens Village]] and the historic, well established African-American community that exists in Jamaica.

From 151st Street and into 164th Street, many groceries and restaurants pertain to the West Indies.  Mainly of Guyanese and Trinidadian origin, these stores serve their respective population living in and around the Jamaica Center area. East from 167th Street to 171st Street, there are East Indian shops. Mainly invested by the ever growing Bangladeshi population, thousands of South Asians come here to shop for Bangladeshi goods. 
Also there are restaurants such as "Sagar", "Ambala", "Ghoroa", and countless more in the Bangladeshi stronghold here.
Some people call this area another "Little South Asia" similar to that of [[Jackson Heights, Queens|Jackson Heights]]. Jamaica, Queens is another South Asian ethnic enclave popping up in NYC, as South Asian immigration and the NYC South Asian population has grown rapidly, as well as new South Asian enclaves.

== Economy ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2009}}
Economic development was long neglected. In the 1960s and 1970s, many [[Big-box store|big box retailers]] moved to suburban areas where business was more profitable.  Departing retailers included brand name stores and movie theaters that once thrived in Jamaica's busiest areas. [[Macy's]] and the Valencia theater were the last companies to move out in 1969. The 1980s [[crack epidemic]] created even more hardship and crime. Prime real estate spaces were filled by hair salons and [[variety store|99 cent stores]]. Furthermore, existing zoning patterns and inadequate infrastructure did not anticipate future development.

Since then, the decrease of the crime rate has encouraged entrepreneurs who plan to invest in the area. The Greater Jamaica Development Corporation (GJDC), the local [[business improvement district]], acquired valuable real estate for sale to national chains in order to expand neighborhood commerce. As well they have completed underway proposals by allocating funds and providing loans to potential investors who have already established something in the area. One Jamaica Center is a mixed-use commercial complex that was built in 2002 by The Mattone Group housing [[Old Navy]], [[Bally Total Fitness]], [[Walgreens]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Dunkin' Donuts]], a 15-screen multiplex theater and for a while a [[Gap (clothing)|Gap]]. Banking has also made a strong revival as [[Bank of America]], Sterling National Bank, Chase Bank, and [[Carver Federal Savings Bank]] have each created at least one branch along various major streets: Jamaica Avenue, Parsons Boulevard, Merrick Boulevard, and Sutphin Boulevard. A $75 million deal between the developers, the Mattone Group and Ceruzzi Enterprises, and Home Depot cleared the way for a new location at 168th St. and Archer Ave. All approvals were obtained within three months of the application dates.

The most prominent piece of development has been the creation of the [[Jamaica (LIRR station)|Jamaica Station]], which was fully completed in 2003. It includes [[Sutphin Boulevard – Archer Avenue – JFK Airport (Archer Avenue Lines)|Sutphin Boulevard – Archer Avenue – JFK Airport]] subway station ({{NYCS trains|Archer}}), the [[Long Island Rail Road|LIRR]], and the [[Airtrain JFK]] to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]; the latter remains the central figure for ongoing economic progress. With the growing number of riders each day passing through this station, the city is providing some major changes to the surrounding blocks of this massive hub of transport.

Efforts have been made to follow the examples of major redevelopment occurring in [[Long Island City]], [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], and [[Downtown Brooklyn]]. In 2005, the [[New York City Department of City Planning]] drafted a plan that would rezone 368 blocks of Jamaica in order to stimulate new development, relieve [[traffic congestion]], and shift upscale amenities away from low-density residential neighborhoods. The plan includes up-zoning the immediate areas around Jamaica Station to accommodate passengers traveling through the area. To improve infrastructure the [[New York City Department of Parks & Recreation]] has agreed to create more greenery and open spaces to allow pedestrians to enjoy the scenery. At the same time, the city has reserved the right to protect the suburban/residential charm of neighboring areas. Several blocks will be down-zoned to keep up with the existing neighborhood character. On September 10, 2007 the City Council overwhelmingly approved the [http://home2.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/jamaica/index.shtml plan].  Structures of up to 28 stories can be built around the main transit hub as well as residential buildings of up to 7 stories can be built on Hillside Ave.

Several projects are in progress.  The [[New York City Economic Development Corporation]] has issued an RFP for redevelopment of a {{convert|45000|sqft|m2|abbr=on|adj=on}} abandoned garage located at 168th St. and 93rd Ave. Plans are underway to convert this space into retail and parking spots. "TechnoMart Queens" was the first approved project. Located at Sutphin Blvd. and 94th Ave., Korean-based Prime Construction Corp., Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, and several other partners have signed a deal to create a 13-story mega-mall. 9 floors will be dedicated towards wholesale electronics, 3 floors to retail space for shopping, and it is estimated to contain parking for up to 800 cars. Groundbreaking on this site will initiate in late 2008 and is slated for completion by mid-2011. The GJDC has announced in their newsletter that another site adjacent to the mall will be converted into a hotel for Airtrain passengers.  Official groundbreaking information has not been released nor declared yet its completion is set for 2010.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Transportation==
[[File:Interstate 678 in Jamaica, Queens.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Interstate 678 in Jamaica]]

===Public transport===
[[Jamaica (LIRR station)|Jamaica Station]] is a central transfer point on the [[Long Island Rail Road]] (LIRR), which is headquartered in a building adjoining the station; all but one of the commuter railroad's lines (the exception being the [[Port Washington Branch]]) run through Jamaica.

The [[New York City Subway]]'s [[IND Queens Boulevard Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Queens Hillside}}) terminates at [[Jamaica – 179th Street (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|179th Street]] station, at the foot of [[Jamaica Estates, Queens|Jamaica Estates]], a neighborhood of mansions east of Jamaica's central business district. The [[Archer Avenue Lines]], which opened in 1988 ({{NYCS trains|Archer}}), terminate at [[Jamaica Center – Parsons/Archer (Archer Avenue Lines)|Jamaica Center – Parsons/Archer]] station, but also serve [[Sutphin Boulevard – Archer Avenue – JFK Airport (Archer Avenue Lines)|Sutphin Boulevard – Archer Avenue – JFK Airport]] station. Jamaica Center is not just a transit hub; it is also the name of a business and government center that includes a federal office building, and a shopping mall and theater multiplex (One Jamaica Center), and is adjacent to various other businesses and agencies, such as the main forensic laboratory facility for the [[New York City Police Department]].

Jamaica's bus network provides extensive service across eastern Queens, as well as to destinations as distant as [[Hicksville, New York|Hicksville]] in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]], [[the Bronx]], [[Rockaway, Queens|the Rockaways]], and [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Nearly all bus lines serving Jamaica terminate there; most do so at the [[165th Street Bus Terminal]] or the Jamaica Center subway station, except the [[Q46 (New York City bus)|Q46]] bus which operates along Union Turnpike which serves as the northern border of Jamaica.

Greater Jamaica, a large, sprawling neighborhood, is also home to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]—one of the busiest international airports in the United States and the world— public transportation passengers are connected to airline terminals by [[AirTrain JFK]], which operates as both an airport terminal circulator and rail connection to central Jamaica at the integrated LIRR and bi-level subway station located at Sutphin Blvd and Archer Avenue.

===Major thoroughfares===

[[File:Jamaica Avenue.jpg|right|thumb|Jamaica Avenue]]
[[File:Jamaica, Queens by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Hillside Avenue]]
[[File:Jamaica Av Sutphin Blvd jeh.jpg|thumb|Jamaica Avenue and Sutphin Boulevard]]

Major streets include Archer Avenue, [[Hillside Avenue (Queens)|Hillside Avenue]], [[Jamaica Avenue (Queens)|Jamaica Avenue]], Liberty Avenue, [[Merrick Road|Merrick Boulevard]], Parsons Boulevard, [[Guy Brewer|Guy R. Brewer]] Boulevard (formerly known as New York Boulevard but renamed for a local political leader in 1982), Sutphin Boulevard, and Union Turnpike, as well as the [[Interstate 678|Van Wyck Expressway (I-678)]] and the [[Grand Central Parkway]].

[[Jamaica Avenue]] is Jamaica's busiest thoroughfare. It begins at [[Broadway Junction (Brooklyn)|Broadway Junction]] in Brooklyn, near the boundary of the [[East New York]] neighborhood. The Avenue enters Jamaica east of the Van Wyck Expressway, and passes the [[Joseph Patrick Addabbo|Joseph Addabbo]] Social Security Administration Building, courthouses and the main building of the [[Queens Library]], along with many discount stores.  The 200-year-old [[King Manor|King Manor Museum]], once home to [[Rufus King]], a founding father of the United States, is located at the corner of 153rd St. and Jamaica Ave. It includes a 2-story museum with over an acre of land and a public park.  Directly across from the Museum is the Jamaica Performing Arts Center, part of the [[Jamaica Center for Arts & Learning]], represents a long-sought [[adaptive reuse]] of the landmark, 150-year-old former [[Dutch Reformed]] Church. It was completed in 2007.

[[New York State Route 25A|Hillside Avenue]] is one of the main thoroughfares of Jamaica. It is served by the {{NYCS trains|Queens Hillside}}, from [[Sutphin Boulevard (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|Sutphin Boulevard]] to its [[Jamaica – 179th Street (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|179th Street]] terminus. Hillside Avenue runs east from [[Myrtle Avenue]] in [[Richmond Hill, Queens|Richmond Hill]], along the length of Jamaica, into [[Queens Village]], and finally, Nassau County. It is a wide six-lane street with numerous commercial activities. The Q43 bus runs its entire eastern length starting at Sutphin Boulevard to the city line. Hillside Avenue separates Jamaica from Briarwood, Jamaica Hills and Jamaica Estates on the southern boundary.

Sutphin Boulevard is Jamaica's second busiest thoroughfare. It has two subway stations, as well as stations for the [[Long Island Rail Road|LIRR]] and the [[AirTrain JFK]], and two Queens courthouses. It begins at Hillside Avenue and 147th Place in the north and works its way south and downhill connecting with Jamaica Avenue, Archer Avenue, [[Liberty Avenue (New York City)|Liberty Avenue]], South Road, Linden Boulevard, and terminates at Rockaway Boulevard. At first it is a small four-lane street, but in the downtown area it provides six lanes. At 95th Avenue, it reemerges from the LIRR underpass and becomes a four-lane street to its southern endpoint.

[[Union Turnpike (New York)|Union Turnpike]] travels through, and serving as the northern border between the towns of Flushing and Jamaica. Though both towns were absorbed into New York City in 1898, the division is evident today in the addresses. Buildings on the north side generally begin with a 113- ZIP code, indicating Flushing, and buildings to the south side begin with a 114- ZIP code, indicating Jamaica. Union Turnpike separates the northern boundaries of Briarwood, Jamaica Hills and Jamaica Estates from the southern boundaries of Flushing and [[Fresh Meadows]].

'''Storm Shadow''' is a British, French and Italian [[air-launched cruise missile]], manufactured by [[MBDA]]. Storm Shadow is the British name for the weapon; in French service it is called '''SCALP EG''' (''Système de Croisière Autonome à Longue Portée – Emploi Général'', meaning General Purpose Long Range Standoff Cruise Missile). The missile is based on the earlier [[MBDA Apache]] anti-runway missile, and differs in that it carries a warhead, rather than [[submunitions]].

==Characteristics==
The missile has a range of approximately {{convert|250|km|mi|0}},<ref name="MBDA Storm Shadow/SCALP">[http://www.mbda-systems.com/mediagallery/files/Storm-Shadow_ds.pdf "MBDA Storm Shadow/SCALP"]</ref> is powered by a turbojet at Mach 0.8 and can be carried by the [[RAF Tornado GR4]], [[Saab Gripen]], Italian [[Tornado IDS]], [[Dassault Mirage 2000]] and [[Dassault Rafale]] aircraft.<ref name="fas_storm_shadow">{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/row/casom.htm|title=Storm Shadow|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]}}</ref> Storm Shadow will be integrated with the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] as part of the Phase 2 Enhancement (P2E) in 2015,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/eurofighter-flies-with-storm-shadow-missiles-393618/ |title=Eurofighter flies with Storm Shadow missiles |last1=Hoyle |first1=Craig |date=28 November 2013 |website=flightglobal.com |publisher=Reed Business Information |accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{citation | title=Eurofighter Typhoon Gains Altitude | url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=dti&id=news/DTI-TYPHOON.xml | date=14 January 2009 | first=Bill | last=Sweetman | publisher=Aviation Week | accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>  and it will be fitted to the [[F-35 Lightning II]] once that aircraft comes into service.<ref name="jsf_storm_shadow">{{cite web|url=http://www.jsf.mil/f35/f35_technology.htm|title=F-35: Technology|publisher=F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Programme}}</ref> The [[BROACH warhead]] features an initial penetrating charge to clear soil or enter a bunker, then a variable delay [[fuze]] to control [[detonation]] of the main warhead. The missile weighs about {{convert|1300|kg|lb|0}}, has a maximum body diameter of {{convert|48|cm|ft|1|}} and a wingspan of {{convert|3|m|ft|1}}. Intended targets are command, control and communications; airfields; ports and power stations; AMS/ammunition storage;  ships/submarines in port; bridges and other high-value strategic targets.<ref name="fas_storm_shadow"/>

It is a [[fire and forget]] missile, programmed before launch. Once launched, the missile cannot be controlled, its target information changed or be self-destructed. Mission planners programme the missile with the target air defences and target. The missile follows a path semi-autonomously, on a low flight path guided by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and terrain matching to the area of the target.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Close to the target, the missile climbs and then [[Aerobatic maneuver|bunts]] into a dive. Climbing to altitude is intended to achieve the best probability of target identification and penetration. During the bunt, the nose cone is jettisoned to allow a high resolution [[infrared camera]] to observe the target area. The missile then tries to locate its target based upon its targeting information. If it can not, and there is a high risk of collateral damage, it will fly to a crash point instead of risking inaccuracy.<ref>{{Cite news | author=Eklund, Dylan | title=Fire and Brimstone: The RAF's 21st Century Missiles | work=RAF Magazine | pages=19–25 | year=2006}}</ref>

Recent enhancements of the Storm Shadow / SCALP EG include the capability to relay target information just before impact, utilization of one-way (link-back) datalink, to relay battle damage assessment information back to the host aircraft. This upgrade is already under development under a French DGA contract. Another feature planned for insertion into the weapon is in-flight retargeting capability, utilizing a two-way datalink.<ref>http://defense-update.com/products/s/storm-shadow.htm</ref>

MBDA has developed a longer-range sea-launched variant for the French Navy, called '''Missile de Croisière Naval''' ('''MdCN''' standing for Naval Cruise Missile). It will be deployed on [[FREMM multipurpose frigate]]s (from 2014) and on [[French Barracuda class submarine|Barracuda class submarine]]s (from 2017), using the A70 version of the Sylver launcher on the former and the 533&nbsp;mm torpedo tubes on the latter.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} As the missile is not launched from a plane, as is SCALP/Storm Shadow, a booster has been included. The submarine version is encapsulated in an hydrodynamic hard container which is ejected when the missile reaches the surface.  To provide a comparable range to the BGM-109 Tomahawk, the range of the MdCN (well over 1000&nbsp;km) is significantly larger than the SCALP/Storm Shadow.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

France originally ordered 50 MdCN for its FREMM frigates in 2006, with delivery expected in 2012.<ref name=Francebudget2012>{{Cite web | url=http://www.senat.fr/rap/a12-150-8/a12-150-815.html#toc290 | title=Projet de loi de finances pour 2013 : Défense : équipement des forces | language=French | publisher=Senate of France | date=22 November 2012 | accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref>  A further 100 surface-launched missiles were ordered in 2009, along with 50 for the planned Barracuda-class submarines.<ref name=Francebudget2012 /> The €1.2bn (FY2011) project will deliver 200 missiles at a unit cost of €2.48m (~US$3.3m), or €6m (~US$8m) including development costs.<ref name=Francebudget2012 />

MdCN first flight test from a vertical launcher took place on 28 May 2010<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defpro.com/news/details/16058/ |title=Successful First Firing of MBDA's SCALP Naval Missile |author=Jean Dupont|date=15 June 2010 |work= |publisher=[[MBDA]] |accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref> and its first submarine launch test took place on 8 June 2011. MdCN 's first complete qualification firing took place on 9 July 2012 at the Biscarosse test range. During its third development firing, MdCN met all its test requirements perfectly including the validation of the terminal autonomously guided phase with IR  target scenario reconnaissance, which provides the weapon with its exceptionally high precision. On 24 October 2012, MdCN was tested "end-to-end" in the submarine launch configuration for the first time, adjacent to the [[Île du Levant]] test centre.<ref>[[IHS Inc.]] [[Jane's Defence Weekly]], Volume 49, Issue 44, p3, 31 October 2012</ref>

'''Stellar radio sources''', '''radio source stars''' or '''radio stars''' are stellar objects that produce copious emissions of various [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]], whether constant or pulsed. Radio emissions from stars can be produced in many varied ways.

[[Pulsar]]s, a type of [[neutron star]], are examples of radio stars.<ref>{{cite web
| title = About Pulsars
| publisher = Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics
| date = 2008-12-23
| url = http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/research/pulsar/Education/index.html
| accessdate = 2009-01-22
}}</ref>  ''[[Rotation-powered pulsar]]s'' are, as the name suggests, powered by the slow-down of their rotation. The rotation powers a magnetic field, which generates the radio emissions. Not all rotation-powered pulsars generate their pulses in the radio spectrum. Some of them, from the [[millisecond pulsar]]s, generate X-rays instead. Aside from [[radio pulsar]]s and [[X-ray pulsar]]s, there are also [[gamma ray pulsar]]s, which are mostly [[magnetar]]s. Some radio pulsars are also [[optical pulsar]]s. 

Aside from pulsars, another type of neutron star is also characterized by radio emissions: the [[rotating radio transient]] (RRAT). As suggested by the name, the radio emission is erratic.

Some late-type stars can produce [[astrophysical maser]]s from their atmospheres and beam out coherent bursts of microwaves.

The [[Sun]], the nearest [[star]] to the Earth, is known to emit radio waves, though it is virtually the only regular star that has been detected in the radio spectrum, because it is so close. It is not considered a radio star because it is not a strong radio source.<ref>IEEE Canada, [http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/aro/ARO_found.html What has radio astronomy found?], National Research Council of Canada (accessed 11 September 2009)</ref>

[[Quasar]]s are not radio stars. They also emit radio frequencies, but from the effects of [[supermassive black hole]]s at the centre of [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Although they appear to be stars, they are not stars, but the hyperactive heart of a galaxy.

The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] received bids for a new anti-radiation missile in late 1982; [[BAe Dynamics|British Aerospace Dynamics]] offered ALARM while [[Texas Instruments]] teamed with [[Lucas Aerospace]] offered its [[AGM-88 HARM|HARM]] missile.<ref name="ftbidding">{{cite news |first=Bridget |last=Bloom|title=Thatcher to resolve anti-radar missile row|work=Financial Times|date=1983-05-16|accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref> Defence Secretary [[Michael Heseltine]] announced the selection of ALARM on 29 July 1983.

In early 1986 BAe recognised that [[Royal Ordnance]] was having difficulties delivering the missile's motor, named Nuthatch, and began to consider alternatives. Royal Ordnance's solution to the required burn-loiter-burn characteristic of the engine was complex.<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Buchan |title=BAe Cancels Missile Deal With Royal Ordnance |work=Financial Times |date= 1987-07-20|accessdate=2007-07-24 }}</ref> In July 1987 BAe, by then the owner of Royal Ordnance, replaced the Nuthatch motor with a lower risk motor designed by [[Bayern-Chemie]].<ref>{{cite news |title=British Aerospace Delays Missile Program |url= |work=Aviation Week & Space Technology |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=1987-09-21 |accessdate=2007-07-24 }}</ref> BAe's [[Pound sterling|GB£]]200 million contract for the missile was renegotiated with the price increased to GB£400 million and delivery pushed back from 1988 to 1990.<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Evans |title=Missile bill for RAF up £150 million |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers |date=1988-03-18 |accessdate=2007-07-24 }}</ref>

The ALARM missile was officially retired at the end of 2013.<ref>http://www.janes.com/article/32800/uk-retires-alarm-missile</ref>

==Features==
ALARM is a fire-and-forget system, with an added loiter capability.
In loiter mode, ALARM will, when launched, climb to an altitude of 13&nbsp;km. If the target radar shuts down, the missile will deploy a parachute and descend slowly until the radar lights up. The missile will then fire a secondary motor to attack the target.<ref>http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1987/1987%20-%201575.html</ref>

==Combat Use==
ALARM has been used in the following conflicts:
*[[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]] ([[Operation Granby]]), during which 121 missiles were used.<ref>{{cite news |title=RAF Tornados begin Yugoslavia operations from Corsican base |work=Aerospace Daily & Defense Report |publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies |date=1999-06-03 |accessdate=2007-07-24 }}</ref>

== References in video games ==

ALARM inspired the 1993 flight simulator game ''[[Tornado (1993 video game)|Tornado]]''. Both direct and loiter modes are supported. The modelling is fairly accurate, for instance in loiter the player will see the missile [[zoom climb]] and deploy its parachute before descending to the ground, or go on to attack a new radar source. In direct mode, the range for the missile is some 10km and can only be fired at one target at a time. 

ALARM is also found in [[EF2000 (computer game)]]. Both modes are again supported.

'''''Modding''''' is a [[slang]] expression that is derived from the verb "[[wiktionary:modify|modify]]". Modding refers to the act of modifying hardware, software, or virtually anything else, to perform a function not originally conceived or intended by the [[designer]], or achieve a [[bespoke]] specification. The term modding is often used within the computer game community, particularly in regard to creating new or altered content and sharing that via the web. It may also be applied to the [[overclocking]] of computers in order to increase the [[frequency]] at which the [[CPU]] operates. [[Case modding]] is also a popular activity amongst many computer enthusiasts which involves the customization of a [[computer case]] or the installation of [[water cooling]] technology. In connection with [[automobiles]], modding often refers to [[engine tuning]], remapping of a vehicle's [[engine control unit]] or customization of the [[Coachwork|bodywork]].

== Computers and digital equipment ==

=== Legal issues ===
Modding may sometimes infringe the legal rights of the copyright owner. Some nations have laws prohibiting modding and accuse modders of attempting to overcome [[copy protection]] schemes. In the United States, the [[DMCA]] has set up stiff penalties for mods that violate the rights of intellectual property owners. In the [[European Union]], member states have agreed the [[EU Copyright Directive]] and are transposing it into national law. A man was [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4650225.stm convicted] in the [[United Kingdom]] in July 2005 for selling a modded [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] with built in software and games. However it is also worthy of note that some other European countries have not interpreted the legal issues in the same way. In Italy a judge threw out a [http://management.silicon.com/government/0,39024677,39117891,00.htm Sony case] saying it was up to owners of a console what they did with it. Similarly in [http://www.theregister.com/2004/04/27/spanish_xbox_modding_ruling/ Spain], mod chips are seen as legal despite the EU copyright legislation.
Modding may be an unauthorized change made to a software or hardware to a platform in gaming.
Case mods are modifications to a device with the altering of certain styles. For example, people who mod a [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox 360]] can alter the [[led]] lights on the controller to glow different colors.

==== Multi-user licensing ====
Computer systems, hardware, and software are often sold or licensed to one home machine, to a business that has many computers, a government agency, or a non-profit organization.  When the software license says that it is for a specific person, then it is not legal{{dubious|date=November 2010}} for that software to be used by some other person on that same computer, even a member of the same family, or another employee of the same company. But this strict licensing is only one approach. In this form of licensing, for more than one person to be using that software or hardware, they need to have a multi-user license that usually dictates how many different people may use it.

==== Derivative software ====
Some [[software]] is [[licensed]] with a copy of the [[Computer program|program]] [[source code]] supplied along with the [[executable code]] in which the license specifically authorizes changes to the supplied software.  This is a common standard in business software packages.  Hundreds of thousands of computer programmers in some nations have jobs because businesses want the purchased software tailored to the specific needs of the individual businesses.  Most every major city has want ads in the newspaper where there are job openings for people to modify some company's computer systems, where the ad specifies what [[programming language]]s or [[operating system]]s the applicant needs to know.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

[[Derivative software]] is licensed copyrighted software used in whole or part in new programs written by programmers at businesses using the licensed software.  Programmers copy the copyright notices into the source code where the code was copied, and track all such places, because if the license is permitted to expire, then the business loses software use rights, including any place to which it was copied.  An annual fee is typically paid to keep the license in effect, and over time, the software supplier can increase the fees to the point that the business chooses to convert to some other commercial software that seems to be more cost effective.  It is not unusual in business software to find programs that have many different copyright notices, each referring to different sources of the derived source code.

=== Video game consoles ===
A common example of one kind of modding is [[video game console]] [[mod chip]]s, which can allow users to play [[Homebrew (video games)|homemade games]], games legitimately purchased in other [[Regional lockout|regions]], or legal backup copies, but can also allow [[copyright infringement of software|illegal unauthorized copies]] by allowing the player to play personally [[CD recorder|recorded]] [[compact disc|CD]] or [[digital video disc|DVD]] copies of [[video game]]s. [[Modchips]], in their current form, were first available for the Sony [[PlayStation]] (and later the [[PlayStation 2]]). Various other types of copyright circumvention systems also existed for the [[Nintendo 64]] and the older Game Boy consoles (though neither include actual modding, but instead backup devices).

==== Types of modding ====
There are two different ways of running unsigned code on a game console. One is through [[Softmod|soft modding]] (modifying software, normally using a [[softmod]]) to allow the user to change data contained on its [[hard drive]] in the case of the Xbox. Another type of modding, known as [[hard modding]], exploits the [[BIOS]] of the console to run unsigned code, or games. This form of 'modding' (more correctly termed as [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]]) is very popular as it is able to 'run' many different types of software. But soft modding is even more popular because of its ease of installation and its relatively low price (it can even be done for free with the right tools). 

Another type of console modding is about appearances, much like computer case modification. Which includes, adding lights (most likely [[Light-emitting diode|LEDS]], [[cathode]]s or other electro-luminescent lighting). Cutting the game system case, to fit hardware and/or expose the internal systems. Cooling is a large part of console hard 'modding', including: heat sink upgrades, more powerful or quieter fans, some even go so far as to abandon common heat exchange to air all together by liquid cooling a console (most notably in the [[Xbox 360]], which initially had some heat problems).

=== Game software ===
{{main|Mod (video gaming)}}

On the other side, some companies actively encourage modding of their products. In cases such as [[TiVo]] and [[Google]], there has been an informal agreement between the modders and the company in which the modders agree not to do anything that destroys the company's business model and the company agrees to support the modding community by providing technical specifications and information. Some commercial [[video game]]s thrive through a [[mod (computer gaming)|modding]] community. In the case of ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', a mod called ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' drove sales of the original software for years.

On August 5, 2009 Matthew Crippen, a student at California State University, was arrested for modifying game consoles such as Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Wii for profit.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=8244137 ]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>  According to him it was so that the owners could play their backup discs of games they legally own.  However, according to the DMCA, it is illegal to circumvent copyright protection software, even for non-pirating uses such as backing up legally owned games.

=== Device drivers ===
Modded [[device driver|drivers]] are made for improved performance which official versions of drivers do not offer or in cases where there are no official versions of drivers for new [[computer hardware|hardware]] designed for older [[operating system]]s such as [[Windows 98]].

=== Computer hardware ===
{{See also|Case modding}}
''Case modding'' may range from simple case painting to full blown case mod with cooling mods and fabricated pieces.

[[Overclocking]] may also be termed as 'modding', and the overclocking of a graphics card using driver software to gain the performance of a more expensive model is known as 'soft-modding'. Volt modding is a term in which jumpers and rheostats are used to mod a hardware's voltages to yield better overclocks.

== Cars and vehicles ==
{{Main|Car tuning|Modified car}}

=== Orthopedic ===

Ortho-modding is the car adaptation (seats, [[Automobile pedal|pedal]]s, etc.) to help drivers to prevent, correct and diminish light [[orthopedic]] and [[Vertebral column|backbone]]/[[vertebral column|spine]] problems.

=== Eco-modding ===

Eco-modding is the reduction of drag, petroleum car adaptation to use renewable energy (generally, changing or adding a new [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] or [[electric motor|motor]]), generally [[hydrogen]] or [[electricity]]. See [[hybrid car]]. Occasionally, it has been known to run a [[Diesel engine]] on plant and animal oils. See [[Biodiesel]].

=== Performance tuning ===

[[Car tuning|Car]] and [[engine tuning]] are modification of a car for enhanced performance, in engine power output, handling, aerodynamics, or cosmetic purposes. See also [[:Category:Vehicle modification]].

== Industrial machines ==
Factories get rather expensive machines that are used to mass-produce specialized parts.  These machines can be altered to make parts other than how the manufacturers of the machines designed or intended them.  The legality of doing this depends on who owns the machines, and whether the agreement, that supplied the machines to the factories, said anything about this, and what the laws are in the nation where this is being done.

For example, the machines might be leased from the manufacturer of the machines.  If they are ever to be returned, they need to go back in the same kind of condition and engineering shape as when they were first delivered.  There is an annual physical inventory to make sure the factory has everything that they are leasing.  This audit might be done by representatives of the leasing company, who are looking to see recognizable machines, that match their models and safety rules.

== Pens ==

Pen-modding is the act of combining many pen parts either to help with [[pen spinning]], in which a perfect balance is desired to create an ideal spinning pen, or simply for decoration. These pen mods can either be made by combining parts from different pens and/or mechanical pencils, or by buying modded pens online. In some cases, pen mods can exceed over $30–40 USD per pen.<ref>[http://penwish.com Custom Pen Spinning Gear, Japanese Mechanical Pencils and Pens]. PenWish. Retrieved on 2010-11-26.</ref> Recently, the practice of pen modding has grown dramatically in popularity, with several mod brands appearing, and multiple online communities dedicated to pen modding and spinning.<ref>[http://www.upsb.info/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page Main Page - UPSB].

'''Kruger National Park''' is one of the largest [[game reserves]] in [[Africa]]. It covers an area of {{convert|19633|km2}} in the provinces of [[Limpopo]] and [[Mpumalanga]] in northeastern [[South Africa]], and extends {{convert|360|km}} from north to south and {{convert|65|km}} from east to west. The administrative headquarters are in [[Skukuza]]. Areas of the park were first protected by the government of the [[South African Republic]] in 1898, and it became South Africa's first [[national parks of South Africa|national park]] in 1926.

To the west and south of the Kruger National Park are the two South African provinces of [[Limpopo]] and [[Mpumalanga]]. In the north is [[Zimbabwe]], and to the east is [[Mozambique]]. It is now part of the [[Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park]], a [[peace park]] that links Kruger National Park with the [[Gonarezhou National Park]] in Zimbabwe, and with the [[Limpopo National Park]] in Mozambique.

The park is part of the [[Kruger to Canyons Biosphere]] an area designated by the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) as an International Man and Biosphere Reserve (the "Biosphere").<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SAF+06&mode=all UNESCO - Biosphere Reserve Information]</ref>

The park has nine main gates allowing entrance to the different camps.

== History ==
{{main|History of the Kruger National Park}}

=== Sabi Game Reserve (1898 - 1926) ===
In 1895, Jakob Louis van Wyk introduced in the [[Volksraad]] of the old South African Republic, a motion to create the game reserve which would become the Kruger National Park. That motion, introduced together with another Volksraad member by the name of R. K. Loveday, and accepted for discussion in September 1895 by a majority of one vote, resulted in the proclamation by [[Paul Kruger]] president of the [[Transvaal Republic]], on 26 March 1898, of a "Government Wildlife Park."

During 1923, the first large groups of tourists started visiting the Sabie Game Reserve, but only as part of the South African Railways' popular "Round in Nine" tours. The tourist trains used the Selati railway line between [[Komatipoort]] on the Mozambican border and [[Tzaneen]] in Limpopo Province. The tour included an overnight stop at Sabie Bridge (now Skukuza) and a short walk, escorted by armed rangers, into the bush. It soon became a highlight of the tour and it gave valuable support for the campaign to proclaim the Sabie Game Reserve as a national park.<ref name=Bulpin>Bulpin, T.V., ''Treasury of Travel Series: Kruger National Park'', Creda Press, 1974.</ref><ref>Pienaar, U. de V., ''Neem uit die Verlede'', Sigma Pers, 1990.</ref>

===1926 - 1946===
After the proclamation of the Kruger National Park in 1926, the first three tourist cars entered the park in 1927, jumping to 180 cars in 1928 and 850 cars in 1929.<ref name=Stevenson/><br />Warden James Stevenson-Hamilton retired on 30 April 1946, after 44 years as warden of the Kruger Park and its predecessor, the Sabi Game Reserve.

===1946 - 1994===
[[File:Memorial Kruger Park.jpg|thumb|Plaque in the park. Now and then people do get killed, however this is extremely rare.]]
He was replaced by Colonel J. A. B. Sandenbergh of the South African Air Force.<ref name=Bulpin/>
During 1959, work commenced to completely fence the park boundaries. Work started on the southern boundary along the [[Crocodile River (Mpumalanga)|Crocodile River]] and in 1960 the western and northern boundaries were fenced, followed by the eastern boundary with Mozambique. The purpose of the fence was to curb the spread of diseases, facilitate border patrolling and inhibit the movement of poachers.<ref name=Bulpin/>

The Makuleke area in the northern part of the park was forcibly taken from the [[Makuleke (tribe)|Makuleke people]] by the government in 1969 and about 1500 of them were relocated to land to the South so that their original [[Tribe|tribal]] areas could be integrated into the greater Kruger National Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdgc.epp.cmu.edu/misc/IIED%20paper.pdf|title=The Makuleke Land Claim|accessdate=|author=Steenkamp, C.|authorlink= |year=2000 |work= |publisher= IIED Evaluating Eden Programme|pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref><ref name="Kruger history">{{cite web |url=http://www.krugerparkreservations.com/History.asp|title=Kruger History|accessdate=2007-08-04|author=Kruger National Park|authorlink= |year=2007 |work= |publisher=|pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

The park lies in the north-east of South Africa,<ref name=Foxcroft33/> in the eastern parts of [[Limpopo]] and [[Mpumalanga]] provinces. [[Phalaborwa]], Limpopo is the only town in South Africa that borders the Kruger National Park. It is one of the largest national parks in the world, with an area of {{convert|19485|km2|sqmi}} The park is approximately {{convert|360|km}} long,<ref name=Foxcroft33/> and has an average width of {{convert|65|km}}.<ref name=lonely468/> At its widest point, the park is {{convert|90|km}} wide from east to west.<ref name=Foxcroft33/>

To the north and south of the park two rivers, the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and the [[Crocodile River (Mpumalanga)|Crocodile]] respectively, act as its natural boundaries. To the east the [[Lebombo Mountains]] separate it from Mozambique. Its western boundary runs parallel with this range, roughly {{convert|65|km}} distant. The park varies in altitude between {{convert|200|m}} in the east and {{convert|840|m}} in the south-west near Berg-en-Dal. The highest point in the park is here, a hill called Khandzalive. Several rivers run through the park from west to east, including the [[Sabie River|Sabie]], [[Olifants River (Limpopo)|Olifants]], [[Crocodile River (Mpumalanga)|Crocodile]], [[Letaba River|Letaba]], [[Luvuvhu]] and [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] Rivers.

}}

The climate of the Kruger National Park and Lowveld is subtropical. Summer days are humid and hot with temperatures often soaring to above {{convert|38|°C|°F}}. The rainy season is from September until May. The Kruger National Park website lists September and October as the driest periods, culminating in rains late in October. The dry winter season is the ideal time to visit this region for various reasons. There is less chance of contracting malaria and the days are milder. Viewing wildlife is more rewarding as the vegetation is more sparse and animals are drawn to the waterholes to drink every morning and evening.

== Flora and fauna ==

=== Vegetation ===
Plants life in the park consists of four main areas:

==== Thorn trees and Red bush-willow veld ====
This area lies between the western boundary and roughly the centre of the park south of the Olifants River. ''Combretums'', such as the red bush-willow (''[[Combretum apiculatum]]''), and ''Acacia'' species predominate while there are a great number of marula trees (''[[Sclerocarya caffra]]''). The ''Acacias'' are dominant along the rivers and streams, the very dense Nwatimhiri bush along the Sabie River between Skukuza and Lower Sabie being a very good example.

==== Knob-thorn and Marula veld ====
South of the Olifants River in the eastern half of the park, this area provides the most important grazing-land. Species such as red grass (''Themeda triandra'') and buffalo grass (''Panicum maximum'') predominate while the knob-thorn (''Acacia nigrescens''), [[leadwood tree|leadwood]] (''Combretum imberbe'') and [[marula]] (''Sclerocarya caffra'') are the main tree species.

==== Red bush-willow and Mopane veld ====
This area lies in the western half of the park, north of the Olifants River. The two most prominent species here are the red bush-willow (''Combretum apiculatum'') and the [[mopane]] tree (''Colophospernum mopane'').

==== Shrub mopane veld ====
Shrub mopane covers almost the entire north-eastern part of the park.

There are a number of smaller areas in the park which carry distinctive vegetation such as Pretoriuskop where the sickle bush and the silver cluster-leaf (''Terminalia sericae'') are prominent. The sandveld communities near Punda Maria are equally definitive, with a wide variety of unique species.

=== Birds ===
Out of the 517 species of [[bird]]s found at Kruger, 253 are residents, 117 non-breeding migrants, and 147 nomads. Some of the larger birds require large territories or are sensitive to habitat degradation. Six of these species, which are by and large restricted to Kruger and other extensive conservation areas, have been assigned to a fanciful grouping called the 'Big Six Birds'.<ref name=bsb>{{cite web |last=Engelbrecht |first=Derek |title=Kruger National Park's Big 6 Birds |url=http://www.sanparks.org/groups/birders/knp_big_6.php |work=Birders |publisher=Sanparks |accessdate=9 January 2013}}</ref> They are the [[Lappet-faced Vulture]], [[Martial Eagle]], [[Saddle-billed Stork]], [[Kori Bustard]], [[Southern Ground Hornbill|Ground Hornbill]] and the reclusive [[Pel's Fishing Owl]], which is localized and seldom seen. There are between 25 and 30 breeding pairs of Saddle-billed Storks in the park, besides a handful of non-breeding individuals.<ref name=bsb/> In 2012 178 family groups of Ground Hornbills roamed the park and 78 nests were known, of which 50% were active.<ref name=nj>{{cite news |last=Jackson |first=Neels |title=Wildtuin help sy bromvoëls só |url=http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/2012/12/27/B1/10/tnjbrom.html |accessdate=9 January 2013 |newspaper=Beeld |date=27 December 2012}}</ref>

All the [[Big Five Game|Big Five]] game animals are found at Kruger National Park, which has more species of large [[mammal]]s than any other African Game Reserve (at 147 species). There are webcams set up to observe the wildlife.<ref>[http://www.sanparks.org/webcams/ Kruger National Park webcams]</ref>

The park stopped [[culling]] elephants in 1994 and tried translocating them, but by 2004 the population had increased to 11,670 elephants, by 2006 to approximately 13,500 and by 2009 to 11,672. The park's habitats can only sustain about 8,000 elephants. The park started using annual [[contraception]] in 1995, but has stopped that due to problems with delivering the contraceptives and upsetting the herds.

Kruger supports packs of the [[endangered]] [[African Wild Dog]], of which there are thought to be only about 400 in the whole of South Africa.<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2009.

=== Reptiles ===
Kruger houses 114 species of reptile, including [[black mamba]] and 3000 [[nile crocodiles|crocodiles]].

=== Amphibians and fish ===
Thirty-three species of amphibians are found in the Park,<ref>Pienaar, Passmore & Carruthers, ''Die Paddas van die Nasionale Krugerwildtuin.'' Sigma Press, 1976</ref> as well as 50 fish species. A Zambesi shark, ''Carcharhinus leucas'', also known as the [[bull shark]], was caught at the confluence of the Limpopo and Luvuvhu Rivers in July 1950. Zambezi sharks tolerate fresh water and can travel far up rivers like the Limpopo.<ref>Pienaar, U. de V., ''The Freshwater Fishes of the Kruger National Park'', Koedoe Vol 11, No 1 (1968)</ref>

==Anti-poaching measures==
The park's anti-poaching unit consists of 650<ref name=transfront2/> [[South African National Parks|SANParks]] [[game warden|game ranger]]s, assisted by the [[South African Police Service|SAPS]] and the [[South African National Defence Force|SANDF]] (including the [[South African Air Force|SAAF]]).

Kruger experienced significant elephant poaching in the 1980s,<ref name=cc>{{cite news|last=Coetzee|first=Cobus|title=‘Aanslag’ op renosters in Krugerwildtuin se visier: Elektroniese skyfies in lyf en horings ingespan teen wilddiefstal | url=http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/2009/11/28/B1/10/ccnoster.html |accessdate=25 January 2013|newspaper=Beeld|date=28 November 2009}}</ref> which has since abated. It holds over 48 tons of [[ivory]] in storage. According to [[Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna]] (CITES), it is allowed to sell 30 tons.

Following approval by CITES, 47 metric tons of stockpiled ivory from Kruger were auctioned on 6 November 2008. The sale fetched approximately US$6.7 million which will be used towards increasing anti-poaching activity.  The average price for the 63 lots on auction was US$142/kg.

===Other===
It is foreseen that the placement of wire traps to procure meat would eventually become the most challenging form of poaching.<ref name=ms>{{cite news |last=Swart |first=Magda |title=Radikale reddingsplan |url=http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/2012/11/13/B1/15/msrensoter.html |accessdate=25 January 2013 |newspaper=Beeld |date=13 November 2012}}</ref> A scheme has been proposed to reward adjacent communities with the proceeds of game sales in return for their cooperation in game preservation.<ref name=ms/> The larger communities include Bosbokrand, Acornhoek, Hazyview, Hoedspruit, Komatipoort, Malelane, Marloth Park, Nelspruit and Phalaborwa.<ref name=cil/>

== Accommodation and Facilities ==
The Kruger National Park has 21 rest camps, as well as 2 private lodge concessions, and 15 designated private safari lodges. The concessions are parcels of land operated by private companies in partnership with communities, who outsource the operation of private lodges. Camping in the park has become popular with tourists and backpackers because it is much less expensive, and open to anyone, requiring no special permission to partake.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kruger National Park Camping|url=http://krugerparkbookings.com/category/kruger-national-park-camping/|publisher=Kruger National Park Camping|accessdate=9 January 2013}}</ref>

===Restaurants===
On 30th October 2013, South African National Parks (SANParks) announced the establishment of franchise restaurants in several rest camps. 

Mugg and Bean restaurants have been established at Lower Sabie, Olifants and Letaba rest camps. Wimpy restaurants have been established at Pretoriuskop and Satara rest camps. Skukuza’s Selati Station Grill House has been replaced by Ciao! and Skukuza’s main camp restaurant and take away will be run by Cattle Baron and Bistro.<ref>https://exploreknp.wordpress.com/tag/mugg-and-bean/</ref>

This decision was controversial, with some people welcoming the improvement in food services, and others viewing the introduction of franchises as detracting from the amenity of the Kruger Park.<ref>http://www.news24.com/Travel/MyTravels/Kruger-mall-water-park-and-a-cinema-next-20131101</ref><ref>http://www.fin24.com/Companies/TravelAndLeisure/Kruger-Park-closes-as-eateries-move-in-20131216</ref>

== Wilderness trails ==
Nine different trails are on offer in the Kruger National Park. Some are overnight and they last several days in areas of wilderness virtually untouched by humans. There are no set trails in the wilderness areas; a visitor walks along paths made by animals or seeks out new routes through the bush.

It is based in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], [[United States]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.valero.com/NewsRoom/Pages/PR_20110311_1.aspx |title=Valero |accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref> The company owns and operates 16 [[Oil refinery|refineries]] throughout the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Caribbean]] with a combined throughput capacity of approximately {{convert|3|Moilbbl|m3}} per day, 10 [[ethanol]] plants with a combined production capacity of {{convert|1.2|e9USgal|m3}} per year, and a 50 megawatt [[wind farm]]. Valero is also one of the United States' largest retail operators with approximately 6,800 retail and branded wholesale outlets in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and the Caribbean under the Valero, Diamond Shamrock, Shamrock, [[Ultramar]], Beacon, and [[Texaco]] brands.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.valero.com/NewsRoom/Pages/PR_20110311_1.aspx |title=Valero Press Release|publisher=Valero |accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref>

==History==

Valero was created on January 1, 1980,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.valero.com/ourbusiness/pages/companyhistory.aspx |title=Company history}}</ref> as a spinoff of [[Coastal States Gas Corporation]]. At the time, it was the largest corporate spinoff in U.S. history. Valero took over the [[natural gas]] operations of the [[LoVaca Gathering Company]], a defunct subsidiary of Coastal States Gas.  The name Valero comes from ''Misión San Antonio de Valero'', which today is better known worldwide as [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|The Alamo]].

Valero acquired a small oil refinery in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]] in 1981, and began refining operations in 1984.

In 1997, Valero spun off its refinery and retail divisions into a separate company, which kept the Valero name. At the same time, the remaining divisions, which consisted primarily of natural gas operations, were acquired by the [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]]. Later that year, the firm acquired [[Basis Petroleum]], which left it with four refineries in [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]]. In 1998, it then acquired a [[Paulsboro, New Jersey]], refinery, the company's first outside of the [[Gulf Coast]] area.

In 2000, Valero purchased [[ExxonMobil]]'s [[Benicia, California]], refinery and interest in 350 Exxon-branded service stations in [[California]], mainly in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. The company also began retailing gasoline under the Valero brand. In June 2001, Valero acquired the [[Huntway Refining Company]], along with two asphalt plants on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].

On December 31, 2001, Valero completed its acquisition of Ultramar [[Diamond Shamrock]].  The merger left Valero with over 4,700 [[Ultramar]], Diamond Shamrock, and Beacon retail sites in the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. With this acquisition, Valero also received ownership of Shamrock Logistics L.P., which was renamed Valero L.P.  In 2006, the division was spun off as [[NuStar Energy]].  Starting in 2002, Valero has expanded its marketing to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], specifically the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Florida]], using the Valero brand. The acquisition also includes all past Diamond Shamrock assets, including the former Sigmor Petroleum assets founded by Thomas E. Turner, founder of TETCO Inc. (the Sigmor brand name was the initials of Sigfried Moore, Turner's former employer) which merged with Shamrock Oil and Gas in 1960 forming Sigmor Shamrock - which was merged into Diamond Shamrock in 1982. Turner later repurchased Mission Petroleum Carriers when it was acquired by Diamond Shamrock which was the foundation of TETCO,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.kzep.com/cc-common/mainheadlines3.html?feed=119078&article=10343229 |title=URGENT: 7-Eleven Buying TETCO Retail, Wholesale Operations |publisher=''[[WOAI LOCAL NEWS]]'' |date=14 August 2012}}</ref> and the business portfolio of the former [[National Convenience Stores]], which was acquired by Diamond Shamrock in November 1995.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1995_1306995 |title=Diamond Shamrock buys Stop N Go chain |publisher=''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' |date=9 November 1995}}</ref> 

On April 25, 2005, Valero agreed to buy [[Premcor]], Inc., for $8 billion in cash and stock to become the largest U.S. refinery, as record prices for gasoline and other fuel boosted profits. On June 30, 2005, Valero announced that it was beginning a two-year process of converting Diamond Shamrock stations to the Valero brand.  In the next year, on May 5, 2008, Valero agreed to buy 72 [[Albertsons LLC|Albertsons]] gas stations.

Valero laid off 500 employees at its [[Delaware City Refinery|refinery]] in [[Delaware City, Delaware]] on November 20, 2009, due to profitability concerns.  It was reported the refinery had lost $1 million per day since the beginning of the year.{{cn|date=August 2013}}

On March 11, 2011, Valero announced that it had agreed to a major European purchase from [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron Corp.]] for $730 million in cash, not including working capital that will be determined at closing.  Estimates on the value of the working capital would place the total price at $1.73 billion.  The acquisition includes Chevron's [[Pembroke Refinery]] in [[Wales]] — one of Europe's largest and most complex — together with marketing and logistical assets throughout the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], which include 4 pipelines, 11 terminals, an aviation fuel business, about 1,000 retail outlets, inventory and other items.

==Environmental record==
The [[Political Economy Research Institute]] ranks Valero 28th among those corporations that emit airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on both the quantity (3.4 million pounds in 2005) and the toxicity of the emissions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/Toxic-100-Table.265.0.html |title=(PERI) THE TOXIC 100: Top Corporate Air Polluters in the United State}}</ref>

Valero owns two oil refineries in California.  The [[Benicia Refinery]] is located on the [[Carquinez Strait]], a tributary of the [[San Francisco Bay]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.valero.com/OurBusiness/OurLocations/Refineries/Pages/Benicia.aspx |title=Benicia}}</ref> The Wilmington Refinery<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.boothkoskoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/leavitt2.pdf |title=Negligence Petroleum storage tank exploded |date=July 2000}}</ref> is located {{convert|23|mi|km}} south of downtown Los Angeles.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.valero.com/OurBusiness/OurLocations/Refineries/Pages/Wilmington.aspx |title=Wilmington}}</ref>

==Defense contracts==
According to [[Robert Bryce (writer)|Robert Bryce]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/01/16/gaza_invasion/ |title=Gaza invasion: Powered by the U.S. - Robert Bryce - Salon.com}}</ref> author and managing editor of ''Energy Tribune'', Valero Energy Corp. has been awarded multiple multimillion-dollar contracts by the U.S. Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) in order to provide fuel to Israel.

==Divestitures==
Valero Energy reached an agreement to sell the assets of its terminal operation and discontinue operations in Delaware City to the wholly owned subsidiaries of PBF Energy – Delaware City Refining and Delaware Pipeline – for approximately $220 million in 2010.<ref name=bbpbf>{{cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-27/valero-agrees-to-sell-paulsboro-refinery-to-pbf-energy.html | work=Bloomberg | title=Valero to Sell Paulsboro Oil Refinery to PBF Energy}}</ref> 

Shortly after the divestiture of [[Delaware City]], the company sold its refinery at the [[Port of Paulsboro]] to [[PBF Energy]], as well. The sale concluded Valero's refinery ownership on the East Coast.<ref name=bbpbf/>

==Recent acquisitions==
On August 1, 2011, Valero acquired the Pembroke Refinery from Chevron, as well as the marketing and logistics assets, for $730 million, excluding working capital, which was valued at approximately $1 billion. The Pembroke plant is one of the largest and most complex refineries in [[Western Europe]] with a total throughput capacity of {{convert|270000|oilbbl|m3}} per day and a [[Nelson complexity index]] rating of 11.8. This puts Valero at a total of 15 refineries and {{convert|2.9|Moilbbl|m3}} per day of throughput capacity overall, solidifying the company’s standing as the world’s largest independent refinery.

In addition to the refinery, Valero also purchased ownership interest in 4 major pipelines and 11 fuel terminals, and acquired a {{convert|14000|oilbbl|m3|adj=on}}-per-day aviation fuel business, as well as a network of more than 1,000 Texaco-branded wholesale sites, which is the largest branded dealer network in the United Kingdom and the second-largest in [[Ireland]]. Valero has continued with the Texaco brand in these markets.

==Retail==
[[Image:Valerogasstation.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A typical Valero gas station in [[Mountain View, California]]]]
Valero retails [[gasoline]] branded as Valero, Shamrock, Diamond Shamrock,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/DD/dod3.html |title=Diamond Shamrock |work=The Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)}}</ref> [[Ultramar]], Beacon, and Total, the last under license from [[Total S.A.]]. While this arm of the company is the most visible to the public, it is, according to CEO [[William R. Klesse]], "a very small part of [Valero's] operations".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/yhoo/story.asp?source=blq/yhoo&siteid=yhoo&dist=yhoo&guid=%7B2EEF79CA%2D2302%2D4C16%2D8087%2D07A21B521581%7D |title=Valero Energy CEO to Wall St.: You've got us wrong Soapbox - MarketWatch}}</ref>

Valero is attempting to shift its focus from being a [[Filling station#Types of filling stations in the US|discount gasoline brand]] to becoming a premium brand.  As part of the shift, Valero has begun to [[rebrand]] its Ultramar, Beacon, Total, and Diamond Shamrock stations to the Valero brand.  The Beacon and Shamrock brands are used by retailers as a low-cost alternative to the premium Valero brand. The Shamrock brand is based on the former [[Shamrock Oil]] and Gas Company, which merged with [[Diamond Alkali]] in 1967 to form Diamond Shamrock, thus declaring the trademark from official abandonment. The name Ultramar, while being eliminated in the United States, will still be used as Valero's brand name in Canada. Valero introduced its updated "Corner Store" retail concept on December 28, 2007, opening the company's first {{convert|5500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} prototype in western San Antonio. The Corner Store retail division, originally part of Diamond Shamrock, was absorbed into Valero's business portfolio in 2001. Not all Valero gas stations have a Corner Store included - one Valero gas station in Euless, Texas east of Fort Worth is co-branded with a [[7-Eleven]] convenience store.

On July 31, 2012, during the 2nd Quarter Earnings Conference Call, Valero announced intentions to separate the retail business from the remainder of the company.  CFO Mike Ciskowski stated "We believe the separation of our retail business by way of a tax-efficient distribution to our shareholders will create operational flexibility within the business and unlock value for our shareholders."  Additional details of the spin-off were said to be forthcoming. <ref>Q2 2012 Valero Energy Corp. Earnings Conference Call Transcript of Speaker Notes</ref>

Valero issues its own private label [[credit card]]s for its stations through its credit card-only subsidiary, DSRM National Bank.  The initials stand for "Diamond Shamrock Refining & Marketing", the unit of Diamond Shamrock which created it before being purchased by Valero.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.occ.gov/static/cra/craeval/Jun09/23097.pdf|title=DSRM National Bank CRA Performance Evaluation|publisher=[[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] |date=12 January 2009}}</ref>

The '''Singer Building''' or '''Singer Tower''', at [[Liberty Street (Manhattan)|Liberty Street]] and [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] in [[Manhattan]], was a 47-story office building completed in 1908 as the headquarters of the [[Singer Corporation|Singer Manufacturing Company]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ripley |first=Charles M. |date=October 1907 |title=A Building Forty-Seven Stories High |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=XIV |issue= |pages=9459–9461 |accessdate=2009-07-10 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sojNAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA9459}}</ref> It was the [[Skyscraper#History of the tallest skyscrapers|tallest building in the world]] from 1908 to 1909. It was demolished in 1968, together with the adjacent [[City Investing Building]], and is now the site of [[1 Liberty Plaza]]. When it was demolished, it was the tallest building ever to be demolished,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20535821 |title = How do you demolish a skyscraper? |author = Jon Kelly |publisher = BBC |date = 6 December 2012 |work = BBC News Magazine |accessdate= 12 December 2012 }}</ref> and is still the third-tallest building ever to be destroyed (after the [[World Trade Center]] towers) and the tallest to be purposely demolished by its owner.

== History ==
The building was commissioned by [[Frederick Gilbert Bourne|Frederick Bourne]], the head of the [[Singer Sewing Machine Company]]. He hired architect [[Ernest Flagg]], who was an early exponent of the [[Beaux arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] architectural style.<ref name="Gray">{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2005/01/02/realestate/02scap.html|title=Streetscapes: Once the Tallest Building, but Since 1967 a Ghost|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=2 January 2005|work=The New York Times|accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref> Flagg had also designed the company's previous headquarters at 561 [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] between Prince and [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring]] Streets &ndash; in what is now the [[SoHo]] neighborhood &ndash; which was referred to as the "Little Singer Building" after the new building was erected.<ref>{{cite AIA4}}, p.100</ref><ref name="Gray-97">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/29/realestate/style-standard-for-early-steel-framed-skyscraper.html?scp=896&sq=corning&st=nyt|title=Style Standard for Early Steel-Framed Skyscraper|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=29 June 1997|work=The New York Times|page=7|accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref> Plans and working drawings were prepared by [[George W. Conable]] (1866–1933).<ref name="nrhpinv_ny">{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7335|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Jamaica Chamber of Commerce Building|date=April 1983|accessdate=2011-01-16 |author=Larry E. Gobrecht|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]}}</ref>

Flagg believed that buildings more than 10 or 15 stories high should be set back from the street, with the tower occupying only a quarter of the lot.<ref name="Gray"/> The 12-story base of the building filled an entire blockfront, while the tower above was relatively narrow.  The tower floors were squares only 65&nbsp;feet (20&nbsp;m) on a side.

''[[New York Times]]'' architectural critic [[Christopher Gray]] wrote in 2005:

<blockquote>The lobby had the quality of "celestial radiance" seen in world's-fair and exposition architecture of the period, as the author Mardges Bacon described it in her 1986 monograph "Ernest Flagg" (Architectural History Foundation, MIT Press). A forest of marble columns rose high to a series of multiple small domes of delicate plasterwork, and Flagg trimmed the columns with bronze beading. A series of large bronze medallions placed at the top of the columns were alternately rendered in the monogram of the Singer company and, quite inventively, as a huge needle, thread and bobbin.<ref name="Gray"/></blockquote>

At 612&nbsp;feet (187&nbsp;m) above grade, the Singer Building was the tallest office building in the world from its completion in 1908 until the completion in 1909 of the {{convert|700|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower]] at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] and [[Madison Avenue]] in Manhattan.<ref name="Gray"/> (Prior to the Singer Building, the 29-story, 391 feet (119 m) tall [[Park Row Building]], completed in 1899, was the tallest building in New York City, and briefly held the title of "Tallest Office Building in the World" until being surpassed in 1901 by the [[Philadelphia City Hall]], at 548&nbsp;ft (167 m) tall including the statue.)

Skyscraper zoning legislation, enacted in 1916 at Flagg's urging, incorporated many of his ideas for setbacks in tall buildings.<ref name="Gray"/>

In 1961, Singer sold the building and subsequently moved to [[Rockefeller Center]].<ref name="Gray"/><ref name="Fried">{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10710F6345F1A718DDDAB0A94D0405B878AF1D3|title=Landmark on Lower Broadway to Go|last=Fried|first=Joseph P.|date=Aug 22, 1967|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref> The building was then acquired by real estate developer [[William Zeckendorf]], who sought unsuccessfully for the [[New York Stock Exchange]] to move there.  In 1964 [[United States Steel]] acquired the building, along with the neighboring [[City Investing Building]], for demolition.  By the 1960s the building was uneconomical because of its small interior dimensions. The tower portion of the building contained only {{convert|4200|sqft|m2}} per floor, compared with {{convert|37000|sqft|m2}} per floor of the building that replaced it, the U.S. Steel Building (currently known as [[1 Liberty Plaza]]).<ref name="Gray"/>

Although New York had a newly created [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|Landmarks Preservation Commission]] by the time demolition commenced in 1967, and the Singer Building was considered to be one of the most iconic buildings in the city, it  did not receive landmark designation that would have prevented demolition. Alan Burnham, executive director of the commission, said in August 1967 that if the building were to have been made a landmark, the city would have to either find a buyer for it or acquire it. Demolition commenced in August 1967 and was completed the following year. At the time, it was the tallest building ever to be destroyed. This record was surpassed in 2001 when the [[September 11 attacks]] caused the collapse of the nearby [[World Trade Center]], making the Singer Building currently the third tallest building to be destroyed, but it is still the tallest building ever peacefully dismantled.<ref>{{cite AIA4}}, p.42</ref>

The '''Sierra Madre''' is a [[mountain range]] in the [[Philippines]]. It is located along the north-eastern coast of [[Luzon]] Island, running north/south. [[Quezon National Forest Park]] is situated in the range.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coursey|first=Oscar William|title=History and Geography of the Philippine Islands|date=1903|publisher=Educator School Supply Company}}</ref>

==Geography==
The Sierra Madre is the longest mountain range in the Philippines. The range starts in the north in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Cagayan]] and ends in the south in the province of [[Quezon]], just east of [[Laguna de Bay]]. To the west as it reaches the province of [[Nueva Vizcaya]] to form the [[Caraballo Mountains]], with which it connects with the [[Cordillera Central, Luzon|Cordillera Central]] range.

The range's highest point is unclear, and several peaks claim this title. Mount Anacuao (Aurora) stands at {{convert|6069|ft|m}}, while Mount Cetaceo (Cagayan) is of similar altitude. However, an expedition in April 2012 to [[Mount Guiwan]] (Nueva Vizcaya) preliminarily measured an altitude of 1,915 m on the summit.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Shirley|title=The Philippines - True books|date=1 March 2003|publisher=Children's Press|location=CT|isbn=0516242121|url=http://www.amazon.com/The-Philippines-True-Books-Geography/dp/0516242121}}</ref> 
[[Ecoregion]]s in the range are in the [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] (lower) and [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests]] (higher) [[biomes]].

From the top down: bia?a kie?basa (white sausage), [[kabanos]] (pl. 'kabanosy'), kie?basa wiejska (countryside sausage) (in the centre)]]

'''Kie?basa''', '''ko?basa''', '''klobasa''', '''kobasa''', '''kolbasi''', '''kovbasa''', '''kobasi''', and '''kubasa''' are common names for a type of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an [[sausage]]. Synonyms include '''Polish sausage''' and '''Ukrainian sausage'''. In English, these words refer to a particular type of sausage, common to all Central and Eastern European countries but with substantial regional variations. In the [[Slavic languages]], these are the generic words for all types of sausage, local or foreign.

==Etymology and usage==
The terms entered English simultaneously from different sources, which accounts for the different spellings.  Usage varies between cultural groups, but overall there is a distinction between American and Canadian usage.

In the United States, the form kie?basa (usually {{IPAc-en|k|i?|l|?|b|??|s|?}} or {{IPAc-en|k|?-|?|b|??|s|?}}) is more often used and comes from the [[Polish language|Polish]] ''kie?basa'' {{IPA-pol|k?ew?basa||Pl-kie?basa.ogg}} "sausage". In New Jersey, Pennsylvania and most areas of Greater New York City, a derivative of the Polish word is used, pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|?|?|b|??|s|i?}}.

In addition to kielbasa, Canadians also use the word ''kubasa'' ({{IPAc-en|k|u?|b|??|?|s|??}} or {{IPAc-en|?|k|u?|b|?|s|??}}), a corruption of the Ukrainian ''kovbasa'' ({{lang|uk|???????}}), and [[Alberta]]ns even abbreviate it as ''kubie'' to refer to the sausage eaten on a [[hot dog bun]].<ref>The Canadian Oxford Dictionary has headwords for the Canadian usage ''kubasa'', as well as the Albertan ''kubie'' and ''kubie burger'', for kubasa [[Hot dog|dogs]] and [[Hamburger|burger]]s, respectively. These have been made popular by Stawnichy's Meat Processing of Mundare who have been making Ukrainian-style sausage for several months and have a variety of 'Kubie'- derived patties and cutlettes.

==Varieties and regional variations==
===Poland===
[[Sausage]] is a staple of [[Polish cuisine]] and comes in dozens of varieties, [[smoking (food)|smoked]] or fresh, made with [[pork]], [[beef]], [[turkey (bird)|turkey]], [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[chicken]] or [[veal]] with every region having its own speciality. Of these, the ''Kie?basa Lisiecka'', produced in [[Ma?opolskie]],<ref name="POLS-Gov1">[http://www.minrol.gov.pl/index.php?/pol/Jakosc-zywnosci/Produkty-regionalne-i-tradycyjne/Lista-produktow-tradycyjnych/woj.-malopolskie/Kielbasa-lisiecka Polish Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development - Kie?basa Lisiecka info] (Polish) (Accessed 1/Nov/2010)</ref> has, since late 2010 had [[Protected Geographical Status|PGI]] protection.<ref name="EU-DOOR1">[http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/door/registeredName.html?denominationId=2096 EU Directory of PGI/PDO/TSG - Kie?basa Lisiecka profile] (Accessed 1/Nov/2010)</ref> There are official Polish government guides and classifications of sausages based on size, meat, ready-to-eat or uncooked varieties.<ref name=Marianski>{{cite book|last=Marianski|first=Stanley|first2=Miroslaw|last2=Maria?ski|last3=Gebarowski|title=Polish Sausages, Authentic Recipes and Instructions|year=2009|publisher=Bookmagic|isbn=978-0-9824267-2-2|pages=67–70|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DxgKb9oKuEAC&pg=PA67&dq=wiejska+Kielbasa#v=onepage&q=wiejska%20Kielbasa&f=false|accessdate=22 September 2010|chapter=4 - Polish Sausages Classification}}</ref>

* ''[[kabanos]]y'', a thin, air-dried sausage flavoured with [[caraway]] seed, originally made of pork
* ''kie?basa w?dzona'', polish smoked sausage, used often in soups.
* ''[[krakowska]]'', a thick, straight sausage hot-smoked with pepper and garlic; its name comes from [[Kraków]]
* ''wiejska'' ({{IPA-pol|?v?ejska|}}), a large U-shaped [[pork]] and [[veal]] sausage with [[marjoram]] and [[garlic]]; its name means "rural" or (an [[adjectival]] use of) "country", or ([[adjectival]] use of) "village".
* ''weselna'', "[[wedding]]" sausage, medium thick, u-shaped smoked sausage; often eaten during parties, but not exclusively
* ''[[kaszanka]]'' or ''kiszka'' is a traditional [[blood sausage]]. 
* ''[[my?liwska]]'' is a smoked, dried pork sausage. 
The most popular kie?basa is also called "Kie?basa Polska" ("Polish Sausage") or "Kie?basa Starowiejska" ("Ancient Countryside Sausage"). This one comes closest to what is generally known in America as "kie?basa" (a Polish sausage). Nowadays, many major meat packers across America offer a product called "kie?basa," usually somewhat different from the original.

In Poland, kie?basa is often served garnished with fried onions, and – in the form of cut pieces – smoked kie?basa can be served cold, hot, boiled, baked or grilled. It can be cooked in soups such as ''[[sour rye soup|?urek]]'' (sour rye soup), ''kapu?niak'' (cabbage soup), or ''grochówka'' (pea soup), baked or cooked with [[sauerkraut]], or added to bean dishes, stews (notably ''[[bigos]]'', a Polish national dish), and [[casserole]]s. Kie?basa is also very popular served cold as coldcuts on a platter, usually for an appetizer at traditional Polish parties. It is also a common snack (''zagrycha'') served with plain vodka. 

A less widely available variety of kie?basa is the White Fresh (''bia?a''), which is sold uncooked and unsmoked, then usually prepared by boiling, frying or cooking in a soup in place of raw meat. This variety of kie?basa's taste is similar to a white [[Thuringian sausage]]. Traditionally served with ''[[sour rye soup|barszcz bia?y]]''.

===United States===
In the [[United States|U.S.]], "kielbasa" can be bought in most Polish stores all over the [[USA]], as well as in most major grocery store chains, which may be unsmoked ("fresh") or fully or partly smoked.  A popular [[charcoal]]-grilled variety topped with grilled onions, yellow mustard, and (optionally) sport peppers, known as a [[Maxwell Street Polish]]; is considered local fare in the Midwest, particularly in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].

''Polish sandwich'' is a sandwich with kielbasa, a pickle spear, [[sauerkraut]] and [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]] on [[rye bread]].

===Canada===
In Canada, varieties typical of Poland, Ukraine, and elsewhere are available in supermarkets, and more specific varieties can be found in specialty shops.  This type of sausage is particularly associated with the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie Provinces]], where the Slavic cultural presence is particularly strong.  The world's largest display model of a Ukrainian sausage is a [[roadside attraction]] in [[Mundare]], [[Alberta]], the home of Stawnichy's Meat Processing.<ref name=mundare1>{{cite web|url=http://www.mundaresausage.com/ |title=Mundare Sausage Index Page |publisher=Mundaresausage.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mundare.ca/Giant-Sausage |title=Giant Sausage - Town of Mundare |publisher=Mundare.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-09-22}}</ref>

===Hungary===
{{Main|Kolbász}}
Kolbász is the Hungarian word for sausage. [[Hungarian cuisine]] produces a vast number of types of sausages. The most common smoked Hungarian sausages are Gyulai Kolbász, Csabai Kolbász, Csemege Kolbász, Házi Kolbász, Cserkész Kolbász, lightly smoked, like Debreceni Kolbász (or Debrecener) and Lecsókolbász, a spicy sausage made specifically for serving as part of the dish Lecsó, a vegetable stew with peppers and tomatoes. Hungarian boiled sausages are called "Hurka", Liver Sausage, "Májas", and Blood Sausage, "Véres". The main ingredient is liver and rice, or blood and rice. Spices, pepper, and salt are added.

===Ukraine===
In [[Ukraine]] the word is ''kovbasa'' {{IPA-uk|kowb??s?|}}.

===South Africa===
These types of sausage are popular in South Africa where they are known as "Russian" sausage, often deep fried, and served with chips as a fast food meal.

==Elsewhere==

Similar sausages are found in other Slavic nations as well, notably the [[Czech Republic]] (spelled "klobása", or regionally "klobás"), [[Slovakia]] (spelled "klobása"), [[Slovenia]] (spelled "klobása") and [[Croatia]] (spelled "kobasa" or "kobasica"). In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], and [[Serbia]] this sausage is called "kobasica", while in [[Bulgaria]] and Macedonia it's called "kolbas". In [[Russia]], keilbasa (spelled "???????", i.e. "kolbasa") refers to a meat product more similar to salami. In [[Austria]] it is called "Klobasse" (similar to the neighbouring Slavic countries).

In [[Iran]], the sausages are referred to as Kalbas (Persian: ??????).

'''Armando Anthony''' "'''Chick'''" '''Corea''' (born June 12, 1941)<ref name=ALLMUSIC>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p66463/biography|pure_url=yes}} allmusic Biography]</ref> is an American [[jazz]] and fusion pianist, keyboardist, and composer.

Many of his compositions are considered [[jazz standard]]s. As a member of [[Miles Davis]]' band in the 1960s, he participated in the birth of the electric jazz fusion movement. In the 1970s he formed [[Return to Forever]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> Along with [[Herbie Hancock]], [[McCoy Tyner]], and [[Keith Jarrett]], he has been described as one of the major jazz piano voices to emerge in the post–[[John Coltrane]] era.<ref name=losangelestimes>{{cite news | first= Don | last= Heckman| title=Playing in His Key | date=August 18, 2001 |work=Los Angeles Times | url =http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/18/entertainment/ca-35464 | accessdate =June 7, 2011}}</ref>

Corea continued to pursue other collaborations and to explore various musical styles throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He is also known for promoting and fundraising for a number of social issues, such as eradicating social illiteracy.<ref name=sacramentoobserver>{{cite news | title=Literacy 2005: Celebrities, Church of Scientology Vow To Eradicate Social Ill| date=September 15, 1999 | work=[[The Sacramento Observer]] | url = | volume=36|issue=43 | page=F2 }}</ref>

==Life and career==

===Youth===
Armando Corea was born in [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]]. He is of [[southern Italy|southern Italian]] and [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent.<ref>talking to les tomkins in 1972 – jazzprofessional.com</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazz.com/music/2007/11/5/chick-corea-brazil |title=Chick Corea: Brazil – Jazz.com &#124; Jazz Music – Jazz Artists – Jazz News |publisher=Jazz.com |date=November 20, 1999 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> His father, a jazz trumpet player who had led a [[Dixieland]] band in [[Boston]] in the 1930s and 1940s, introduced him to the piano at the age of four. Growing up surrounded by jazz music, he was influenced at an early age by [[bebop]] and stars such as [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Bud Powell]], [[Horace Silver]], and [[Lester Young]]. At eight Corea also took up drums, which would later influence his use of the piano as a percussion instrument.

Corea developed his piano skills by exploring music on his own. A notable influence was concert pianist Salvatore Sullo, from whom Corea started taking lessons at age eight and who introduced him to classical music, helping spark his interest in [[musical composition]]. He also spent several years as a performer and soloist for the St. Rose Scarlet Lancers, a [[drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]] based in Chelsea.

Given a black [[tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedo]] by his father, he started playing gigs when in high school. He enjoyed listening to [[Herb Pomeroy]]'s band at the time, and had a trio that played [[Horace Silver]]'s music at a local jazz club.

He eventually decided to move to [[New York City]], where he studied musical education for one month at [[Columbia University]] and six months at [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]]. He quit after finding both disappointing, but liked the atmosphere of New York, and the music scene became the starting point for his professional career.

===Early career===
Corea's first major professional gig was with [[Cab Calloway]]. Corea started his professional career in the 1960s playing with trumpeter [[Blue Mitchell]] and [[Latin American music|Latin]] musicians such as [[Herbie Mann]], [[Willie Bobo]] and [[Mongo Santamaría]]. One of the earliest recordings of his playing is with Mitchell's quintet on ''[[The Thing to Do (album)|The Thing To Do]]''. This album features his composition "Chick's Tune", a retooling of "You Stepped Out of a Dream" that demonstrates the angular melodies and Latin-and-swing rhythms that characterize, in part, Corea's personal style. (Incidentally, the same tune features a drum solo by a very young [[Al Foster]].)

His first album as a leader was ''[[Tones for Joan's Bones]]'' in 1966, two years before the release of his album ''[[Now He Sings, Now He Sobs]]'', with [[Roy Haynes]] on drums and [[Miroslav Vitouš]] on [[double bass|bass]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

He made another sideman appearance with [[Stan Getz]] on 1967's ''[[Sweet Rain]]'' ([[Verve Records]]).<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

===Avant garde period===
[[File:Chick Corea.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Chick Corea, 2007]]
From 1968 to 1971 Corea had associations with [[avant garde]] players, and his solo style revealed a dissonant orientation. His avant garde playing can be heard on his solo works of the period, his solos in live recordings under the leadership of [[Miles Davis]], his recordings with [[Circle (jazz band)|Circle]], and his playing on [[Joe Farrell]]'s ''Song of the Wind'' album on [[CTI Records]].

In September 1968 Corea replaced [[Herbie Hancock]] in the piano chair in Davis' band and appeared on landmark albums such as ''[[Filles de Kilimanjaro]]'', ''[[In a Silent Way]]'', and ''[[Bitches Brew]]''. In concert, Davis' [[rhythm section]] of Corea, [[Dave Holland]], and [[Jack DeJohnette]] combined elements of [[free jazz]] improvisation and rock music.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Corea experimented with using electric instruments, mainly the [[Fender Rhodes]] electric piano, in the Davis band.

In live performance he frequently processed the output of his electric piano with a device called a [[ring modulator]]. Using this style, he appeared on multiple Davis albums, including ''[[Black Beauty: Live at the Fillmore West]]'' and ''[[Miles Davis at Fillmore: Live at the Fillmore East]].'' His live performances with the Davis band continued into 1970, with a touring band of [[Steve Grossman (saxophonist)|Steve Grossman]], tenor sax, [[Keith Jarrett]], additional electric piano and organ, [[Jack DeJohnette]], drums, [[Dave Holland]], bass, [[Airto Moreira]], percussion, and Davis on trumpet.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

Holland and Corea left to form their own group, [[Circle (jazz band)|Circle]], active in 1970 and 1971. This free jazz group featured multi-reed player [[Anthony Braxton]] and drummer [[Barry Altschul]]. This band was documented on [[Blue Note]] and [[ECM Records|ECM]]. Aside from soloing in an atonal style, Corea sometimes reached in the body of the piano and plucked the strings. In 1971 or 1972 Corea struck out on his own. In April 1971 he recoded the sessions that became [[Piano Improvisations Vol. 1]] and [[Piano Improvisations Vol. 2]] for ECM.

<blockquote>
The concept of communication with an audience became a big thing for me at the time. The reason I was using that concept so much at that point in my life – in 1968, 1969 or so – was because it was a discovery for me. I grew up kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.<ref>{{cite news | title=Chick Corea Interview on ArtistInterviews| url =http://www.artistinterviews.eu/?page_id=6&parent_id=22 | accessdate =March 28, 2008 }}</ref></blockquote>

===Jazz fusion===
[[File:Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea.jpg|thumb|[[Bobby McFerrin]] and Chick Corea, [[New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival]] in 2008]]

In the early 1970s, Corea took a profound stylistic turn from avant garde playing to a crossover [[jazz fusion]] style that incorporated Latin jazz elements with [[Return To Forever]]. Named after their eponymous 1971 album, the band relied on both acoustic and electronic instrumentation and drew upon [[Latin American]] musical styles more than on rock music. On their first two records, Return to Forever featured [[Flora Purim]]'s vocals, Corea's [[Fender Rhodes]] electric piano, and [[Joe Farrell]]'s [[flute]] and [[soprano]] saxophone, with [[Stanley Clarke]] rounding up the group on acoustic bass. This group later included [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] on drums.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> Drummer [[Lenny White]] and guitarist [[Bill Connors]] later joined Corea and Clarke to form the second version of the group, which expanded upon the earlier [[Latin Jazz]] elements with a more hard-edged rock and funk-oriented sound inspired by Corea's admiration for his [[Bitches Brew]] bandmate [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]'s [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]]. This incarnation of the group recorded the album [[Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy]], before Connors' departure and replacement by [[Al Di Meola]], who would be present on the subsequent releases [[Where Have I Known You Before]], and the best selling [[Romantic Warrior]].

Corea's composition "[[Spain (composition)|Spain]]" first appeared on the 1972 Return to Forever album ''[[Light as a Feather]]''. This is probably his most popular piece, and it has been recorded by a variety of artists. There are also a variety of subsequent recordings by Corea himself in various contexts, including an arrangement for piano and symphony orchestra that appeared in 1999, and a collaborative piano and voice-as-instrument arrangement with [[Bobby McFerrin]] on the 1992 album [[Play (Chick Corea and Bobby McFerrin album)|''Play'']]. Corea usually performs "Spain" with a prelude based on [[Joaquín Rodrigo]]'s ''[[Concierto de Aranjuez]]'' (1940), which earlier received a jazz orchestration on Davis and [[Gil Evans]]' ''[[Sketches of Spain]]''.

In 1976, he issued ''[[My Spanish Heart]]'', influenced by [[Latin American music]] and featuring vocalist [[Gayle Moran]] (Corea's wife) and electric violinist [[Jean-Luc Ponty]]. The record was somewhat misunderstood at the time, but it is considered nowadays as a true example of Corea's ability to write fusion material. The album combined jazz and flamenco, supported by [[Minimoog]] backup and a powerful horn section.

===Duet projects===
In the 1970s Corea started working occasionally with [[vibraphone|vibraphonist]] [[Gary Burton]], with whom he recorded several duet albums on ECM, including 1972's ''[[Crystal Silence]]''. They reunited in 2006 for a concert tour. A new record called ''[[The New Crystal Silence]]'' was issued in 2008 and won a Grammy award in 2009. The package includes a disc of duets and another disc featuring the Sydney Symphony.

Toward the end of the 1970s, Corea embarked on a series of concerts and two albums with Hancock. These concerts were presented in elegant settings with both pianists formally dressed, and performing on [[Yamaha]] concert grand pianos. The two traded playing each other's compositions, as well as pieces by other composers such as [[Béla Bartók]].

In 1982, Corea performed ''The Meeting'', a live duet with the classical pianist [[Friedrich Gulda]].

In December 2007 Corea recorded a duet album, ''The Enchantment'', with [[banjo]]ist Bela Fleck.<ref>{{cite news | first=Doug | last=Levine | title=Chick Corea, Bela Fleck Collaborate On New CD | date=April 24, 2007 | publisher=Voice of America | url =http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-04/2007-04-24-voa68.cfm | work=VOA News | accessdate =January 1, 2009 }}</ref> Fleck and Corea toured extensively behind the album in 2007.

In 2008 Corea collaborated with Japanese pianist [[Hiromi Uehara]] on the live album ''Duet (Chick Corea and Hiromi)''. The duo played a concert at Tokyo's Budokan arena on April 30.<ref>[http://www.nme.com/video/id/S2m4Oy9TWmo/search/flh ]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref>

===Later work===
[[File:Béla Fleck and Chick Corea 2, March 1, 2008.jpg|thumb|Corea performs with [[Béla Fleck]], March 1, 2008]]

Corea's other bands include the [[Chick Corea Elektric Band]], its traditional jazz trio reduction called Akoustic Band, Origin, and its traditional jazz trio reduction called The New Trio.

Corea signed a record deal with [[GRP Records]] in 1986 which led to the release of ten albums between 1986 and 1994, seven with the Elektric Band, two with the Akoustic Band and a solo album "Expressions". 

The Akoustic Band released a self-titled album in 1989 and a live follow-up, "Alive"  in 1991, both featuring?[[John Patitucci]] on bass and [[Dave Weckl]] on drums. It marked a turn back toward traditional jazz in Corea's career, and the bulk of his subsequent recordings have been acoustic ones. The Akoustic Band also provided the music for the 1986 Pixar short ''[[Luxo Jr.]]'' with their song "The Game Maker".

In 1992 Corea started his own label, [[Stretch Records]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

In 2001 the Chick Corea New Trio, with [[Avishai Cohen (bassist)|Avishai Cohen]] and [[Jeff Ballard (musician)|Jeff Ballard]] on bass and drums, respectively, released the album ''Past, Present & Futures''. The 11-song album includes only one standard composition ([[Fats Waller]]'s "Jitterbug Waltz"). The rest of the tunes are Corea originals.

He also participated in 1998's ''[[Like Minds (album)|Like Minds]]'', which features [[Gary Burton]] on vibes, [[Pat Metheny]] on guitar, [[Dave Holland]] on bass and [[Roy Haynes]] on drums.

Recent years have also seen Corea's rising interest in [[contemporary classical music]]. He composed his first [[piano concerto]] – and an adaptation of his [[signature song|signature piece]], "Spain", for a full symphony orchestra – and performed it in 1999 with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]. Five years later he composed his first work not to feature any keyboards: his [[String quartet|String Quartet]] No. 1 was specifically written for the [[Orion String Quartet]] and performed by them at 2004's [[Summerfest]].

Corea has continued releasing jazz fusion [[concept album]]s such as ''To the Stars'' (2004) and ''Ultimate Adventure'' (2006). The latter album won the [[Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Individual or Group]].

In 2008, the third version of Return to Forever (Corea, keyboards; [[Stanley Clarke]], bass; [[Lenny White]], drums; Di Meola, guitar) reunited for a worldwide tour. The reunion received positive reviews from most jazz and mainstream publications.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/arts/music/03chin.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Return of Return to Forever | first=Nate | last=Chinen | date=August 3, 2008 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}</ref> Most of the group's studio recordings were re-released on the compilation ''Return to Forever: The Anthology'' to coincide with the tour. A concert DVD recorded during their performance at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] was released in May 2009. He also worked on a collaboration CD with the vocal group The Manhattan Transfer.

A new group, the 5 Peace Band, which features Corea and guitarist [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], began a world tour in October 2008. Corea had previously worked with McLaughlin in Davis' late 1960s bands, including the group that recorded Davis' album ''Bitches Brew''. Joining Corea and McLaughlin were saxophonist [[Kenny Garrett]] and bassist [[Christian McBride]]. Drummer [[Vinnie Colaiuta]] played with the band in Europe and on select North American dates; [[Brian Blade]] played all dates in Asia and Australia, and most dates in North America. The variety of Corea's music was celebrated in a 2011 retrospective with Corea playing with the [[Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra]] in the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]]; a ''New York Times'' reviewer had high praise for the occasion: "Mr. Corea was masterly with the other musicians, absorbing the rhythm and feeding the soloists. It sounded like a band, and Mr. Corea had no need to dominate; his authority was clear without raising volume."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/arts/music/24corea.html?_r=0| title=A Jazz Man Returns to His Past| last=Ratliff| first=Ben| date=23 January 2011| accessdate=20 June 2013| work=The New York Times}}</ref>

A new band for 2013, Chick Corea & The Vigil, featured Corea along with bassist [[Hadrien Feraud]], Marcus Gilmore on drums (carrying on the lineage of jazz from his grandfather, [[Roy Haynes]]), saxes, flute, and bass clarinet from [[Tim Garland]], and guitarist Charles Altura.

==Scientology==
Corea says that [[Scientology]] has helped deepen his relationships with others, and helped him find a renewed path.<ref name=losangelestimes /> Under the "special thanks" notes in all of his later albums, Corea mentions that [[L. Ron Hubbard]], founder of Scientology, has been a continual source of inspiration. In 1968 Corea discovered ''[[Dianetics]]'', Hubbard's principal work, and in the early 1970s developed an interest in Hubbard's science fiction novels. The two exchanged letters until Hubbard's death in 1986, and Corea had three guest appearances on Hubbard's 1982 album ''Space Jazz: The Soundtrack of the Book Battlefield Earth'', noting, "[Hubbard] was a great composer and keyboard player as well. He did many, many things. He was a true [[Polymath|Renaissance Man]]."<ref name=allaboutjazz>{{cite news | title=All About Jazz – Chick Corea interview | url =http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=15351 | accessdate =March 24, 2008 }}</ref> Corea said that Scientology became a profound influence on his musical direction in the early 1970s: "I no longer wanted to satisfy myself. I really want to connect with the world and make my music mean something to people."<ref>''[[Down Beat]]'', October 21, 1976, p.47</ref>

In 1993, Corea was excluded from a concert during the [[1993 World Championships in Athletics]] in [[Stuttgart]], Germany. The concert's organizers excluded Corea after the state government of [[Baden-Württemberg]] had announced it would review its subsidies for events featuring avowed members of Scientology.<ref name="Laut.de">{{Internetquelle | url=http://www.laut.de/Chick-Corea | titel=Biographie bei Laut.de | zugriff=2010-10-06 | sprache=Englisch}}</ref><ref name="Scientology SZ">{{Internetquelle | url=http://www.ingo-heinemann.de/Prominente.htm#Corea | titel=Chick Corea: Scientology-Zeuge gegen Deutschland | autor=Werner Bloch | titelerg=Ein peinlicher Auftritt in Berlin: Chick Coreas Konzert im Namen von Scientology | zugriff=2010-10-06 | datum=1999-01-23 | hrsg=Süddeutsche Zeitung}}</ref> After Corea's complaint against this policy before the administrative court was unsuccessful in 1996,<ref>VGH Baden-Württemberg, Urteil vom 15.

In 1998, Corea and fellow entertainers [[Anne Archer]], [[Isaac Hayes]], and [[Haywood Nelson]] attended the 30th anniversary of [[Freedom (magazine)|''Freedom'' magazine]], the [[Church of Scientology]]'s [[investigative journalism|investigative news]] journal, at the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] in Washington, D.C., to honor 11 human rights activists.<ref>[http://antonnews.com/mineolaamerican/1998/10/23/news/ Haywood You Remember Garden City Park]</ref>

'''Milton''' is a [[New England town|town]] in [[Chittenden County, Vermont|Chittenden County]], [[Vermont]], [[United States]]. The population was 10,352 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]]. According to local legend, the town was named for the English poet [[John Milton]], but the name most likely originated from [[William FitzWilliam, 4th Earl FitzWilliam]], who held the title Viscount Milton.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=uTBCXqOou0YC ''The Vermont Encyclopedia'', page 206.]</ref>

Milton has a municipal building, school system, library, police force, fire department, rescue squad, several churches, and both civic and social organizations.<ref name="govoffice1">[http://www.milton.govoffice2.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={337BC1DF-ADD9-4AD2-8D26-47EFC493BF71} ]{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>

==History==
Milton was chartered by Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] of New Hampshire on June 8, 1763. In February 1782, the town was first settled by William Irish, Leonard Owen, Amos Mansfield, Absalom Taylor, and Thomas Dewey. There were approximately 300 settlers living in Milton by 1795. It was necessary to build a new meeting place, as meeting in private homes would no longer suffice. The Town House was built in 1849. In 1878 it was destroyed by a fire.
Early settlers in Milton made most of their income from lumber and potash until 1840 when dairy became popular and butter and cheese were sold. Eventually milk was also shipped to Boston and New York.<ref name="govoffice1"/>

WARN  - 2014-11-30 14:42:49.753; org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.SolrWriter; Error creating document : SolrInputDocument(fields: [contents='''''The Spike''''' is a [[1980 in literature|1980]] spy thriller [[novel]] by [[Arnaud de Borchgrave]] and [[Robert Moss]] (New York: Crown Publishers, 1980). Drawing on de Borchgrave's experience as a jet-setting ''[[Newsweek]]'' journalist and conservative Washington insider, it tells the story of a radical '60s journalist, [[Bob Hockney]], who stumbles upon a Soviet plot for global supremacy by 1985. When he tries to expose the web of blackmail, sex and espionage, he's hamstrung by his editors' liberal [[media bias]].

In the news world, to "spike" a story means to cancel its publication. De Borchgrave and Moss envision a scenario in which the [[KGB]] exploits the attitudes of the unsuspecting Western media, which was allegedly more interested in unmasking [[CIA]] agents than stopping the Soviets, threatening to thwart Hockney's big scoop.

The best-selling book was marketed not only as a spy thriller but an expose of real-life Washington. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] called the book a ''[[roman a clef]]'' for its fictionalized versions of real people and organizations, including [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] and the radical left-wing magazine [[Ramparts (magazine)|''Ramparts'']].

In a 1980 interview with the ''[[New York Times]],'' de Borchgrave mentions that he came up with the idea for a novel after he and his wife had to hide in the English countryside, after anonymous threats were made in response to a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article he wrote that named some of the terrorists behind the [[1972 Munich massacre]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Behind the best sellers Arnaud de Borchgrave and Robert Moss | publisher = The New York Times | date = 22 June 1980}}</ref>

The authors' 1983 follow-up, ''[[Monimbo]]'', envisioned Miami race rioters as the pawns of Nicaraguan and Cuban communists.

The '''Yakama''', formerly '''Yakima''', is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] group with nearly 10,851 members, living in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state. 

Yakama people today are enrolled in the [[federally recognized tribe]], the [[Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation]]. The [[Yakama Indian Reservation]], along the [[Yakima River]], covers an area of approximately 1.2 million acres (5,260&nbsp;km²). Today the nation is governed by the Yakama Tribal Council, which consists of representatives of 14 tribes and bands.

Many Yakama people engage in ceremonial, subsistence, and commercial fishing for [[salmon]], [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]], and [[sturgeon]] in the [[Columbia River]] and its tributaries within land ceded by the tribe to the [[United States]]. Their right to fish is protected by treaties and has been re-affirmed in late 20th-century court cases such as ''United States v. Washington'' (the [[Boldt Decision]], 1974) and ''United States v. Oregon'' (''[[Sohappy v. Smith]]'', 1969).

==Etymology==
Scholars disagree on the origins of the name Yakama. The [[Sahaptin]] words, 'E-yak-ma,' means "a growing family", and ''iyakima,'' means "pregnant ones". Other scholars note the word, ''yákama,'' which means “black bear,” or ''ya-ki-ná,'' which means “runaway”.<ref name=UXL>"Yakama," ''U*X*L Encyclopedia of Native American Tribes'', U*X*L. 2008. Retrieved August 14, 2012 from HighBeam Research: http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3048800075.html</ref>

They have also been referred to as the ''Waptailnsim,'' "people of the narrow river" and ''Pa’kiut’l?ma,'' "people of the gap" which describes the tribe's location along the [[Yakima River]].<ref name=UXL /> The Yakama refer to themselves as the ''Mamachatpam.''<ref name=UXL />

==History==
[[File:Edward S. Curtis Collection People 030.jpg|thumb|Yakima woman, ca. 1911]]

The Yakama people are similar to the other native inhabitants of the [[Columbia River Plateau]]. They were hunters and gatherers well known for trading [[salmon]] harvested from annual runs in the Columbia River. In 1805 or 1806, they encountered the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] at the confluence of the [[Yakima River]] and [[Columbia River]]. 

As a consequence of the [[Walla Walla Council (1855)|Walla Walla Council]] and the [[Yakima War]] of 1855, the tribe was forced to cede much of their land and move onto their present reservation.  The Treaty of 1855 identified the 14 confederated tribes and bands of the Yakama, including "Yakama (Lower Yakama or Yakama proper, autonym: Mámachatpam), Palouse (now written [[Palus (tribe)|Palus]], Yakama name: Pelúuspem), "Pisquouse (P'squosa, now [[Wenatchi]]), Wenatshapam (Yakama name: Winátshapam, now [[Wenatchi]]), [[Klickitat Tribe|Klikatat]] (Yakama name: Xwálxwaypam or L'ataxat), Klinquit (a Yakama subtribe), Kow-was-say-ee (Yakama name: Kkáasu-i or K'kasawi, [[Tenino people|Tenino]] subtribe), Li-ay-was (not identified), Skin-pah (Sk'in tribe or Sawpaw, also known as Fall Bridge and Rock Creek people or K'milláma, a Tenino subtribe; perhaps another Yakama name for the Umatilla, which were known as Rock Creek Indians), Wish-ham (Yakama name: Wísh?am, now [[Wasco-Wishram|Wishram]], speaking [[Upper Chinook language|Upper Chinook (Kiksht)]]),<ref>[http://faculty.washington.edu/hunn/vitae/Yakam_U_and_A_draft.pdf Eugene Hunn: Anthropological Study of Yakama Tribe: ''Traditional Resource Harvest Sites West of the Crest of the Cascades Mountains in Washington State and below the Cascades of the Columbia River'', October 11, 2003]</ref> Shyiks (a Yakama subtribe), Ochechotes (Uchi'chol, a Tenino subtribe), Kah-milt-pay (Kahmiltpah, Q’míl-pa or Qamil'lma, perhaps a Klikatat subtribe), and Se-ap-cat (Si'apkat, perhaps a Kittitas (Upper Yakama) subtribe, Kittitas autonym: Pshwánapam), confederated tribes and bands of Indians, occupying lands hereinafter bounded and described and lying in [[Washington Territory]], who for the purposes of this treaty are to be considered as one nation, under the name 'Yakama'…". (Treaty with the Yakama, 1855) The name was changed from Yakima to Yakama in 1994 to reflect the native pronunciation.

== Language ==
[[Image:Yakimatent.jpg|thumb|Yakama [[tipi]], by [[Edward Curtis]], 1910]]
Yakama is a northwestern dialect of [[Sahaptin language|Sahaptin]], a [[Sahaptian languages|Sahaptian language]] of the [[Plateau Penutian]] family. Since the late 20th century, some native speakers have argued to use the traditional Yakama name for this language, ''Ichishkíin Sínwit''. The tribal Cultural Resources program wants to replace the word Sahaptin, which means "stranger in the land".<ref>Beavert, Virginia and Hargus, Sharon ''Ichishkíin sínwit yakama = Yakima Sahaptin dictionary''.

'''Angel Maturino Reséndiz''', aka '''The Railroad Killer/The Railway Killer/The Railcar Killer''' (August 1, 1959<ref>http://www.hcdistrictclerk.com/edocs/public/CaseDetails.aspx?Get=QpVNyxq5C3+f0/AZ7sCwtDJbg3MECOPBkETKaF0ipPPW7jKlKJxxav9sSZbU+KluRm1KEL7eW25flZjUmbkcB3dDTqnp2C4CrgFWLN7X9s8=</ref>{{spaced ndash}}June 27, 2006), was an itinerant [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[serial killer]] responsible for as many as 15 murders across the United States and Mexico during the 1990s. Some also involved sexual assault. He became known as "The Railroad (or Railway) Killer" as most of his crimes were committed near railroads where he had jumped off the trains he was using to travel about the country. On June 21, 1999, he briefly became [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 1990s|the 457th fugitive listed by the FBI]] on its [[Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list before surrendering to the [[Texas]] authorities on July 13. He was 39 years old.

Reséndiz had many aliases but was chiefly known and sought after as '''Rafael Resendez-Ramirez'''. One of his aliases, '''Ángel Reyes Reséndiz''', was very close to the name '''Ángel Leoncio Reyes Recendis''' given on his birth certificate from [[Izúcar de Matamoros]], [[Puebla]], Mexico.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/US/9906/30/railway.killings.01/ Items seized could aid railway killings probe]</ref> Reséndez was in the United States illegally.<ref>http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/notorious/resendez/track_1.html</ref><ref>http://lubbockonline.com/stories/062506/reg_062506117.shtml</ref>

==Murders and methodology==
By illegally jumping on and off trains both within and across Mexico, Canada and the United States, generally crossing borders illegally, Reséndiz was able to evade authorities for a considerable time. He also had no fixed addresses. <!--Local residents in the area of the Benton and the Sirnics' murders were terrified that he might reappear, especially those living near train tracks.-->

Reséndiz killed as many as 15 people<ref>{{Wayback |date=20060630114834 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/06/26/railroad.killer.ap/index.html |title="'Railroad Killer' faces execution"}}. ''[[CNN]]''. Tuesday June 27, 2006.</ref> with rocks, a pick axe and other blunt objects, mainly in their homes. After each murder he would linger in the homes for a while, mainly to eat; he took sentimental things and laid out the victims' driver's licenses to learn a bit about the lives he had taken. He stole jewelry and other items and gave them to his wife in Mexico.  Much of the jewelry was sold or melted down.  Some of the items that were removed from the homes were returned by his wife after his surrender/capture.  Money, however, was sometimes left at the scene. He [[rape]]d some of his female victims; rape served as a secondary intent. Most of his victims were found covered with a blanket, or otherwise obscured from immediate view.

==Victims==

1. In 1986, an '''unidentified homeless{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} woman''' was shot four times with a .38-caliber weapon. Her body was dumped in an abandoned farmhouse. Reséndiz stated that he met the woman at a homeless shelter. They took a motorcycle trip together, bringing a gun along to fire for target practice. Reséndiz said that he shot and killed the woman for disrespecting him.<ref>{{cite web|title=Case File 76UFTX|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/76uftx.html|publisher=The Doe Network|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref>

2. Resendiz stated that soon after killing the homeless woman, he shot and killed her boyfriend - '''a Cuban''' - and dumped his body in a creek somewhere between San Antonio and Uvalde. Reséndiz said that he killed the man because he was involved in black magic. This man's body has never been found, and nothing is known about him except what Reséndiz told authorities. Reséndiz confessed to these first two murders in September 2001, in hopes that doing so would speed up his execution.

3. On July 19, 1991, the body of '''Michael White''', 33, was found in the front yard of an abandoned downtown house. Reséndiz also confessed to this murder in September 2001. He drew a map of the crime scene and said that he killed White because he was homosexual. Police concluded in April 2006 that Reséndiz did in fact kill White. He was bludgeoned to death with a brick.

4 and 5. March 23, 1997, [[Ocala, Florida]], '''Jesse Howell''', 19 years old. He was bludgeoned to death with an air hose coupling and left beside the tracks. His fiancee '''Wendy Von Huben''', 16 years old, was raped, strangled, suffocated with his hands and duct tape and buried in a shallow grave in
[[Sumter County, Florida]].<ref>[http://www.ocala.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060625/NEWS/206250380/1001/NEWS01 The end of the line]</ref>

6. In July 1997, an '''unidentified transient''' was beaten to death with a piece of plywood in a rail yard located in the City of Colton, California. Reséndiz is considered the prime suspect in this case.

7. August 29, 1997, [[Lexington, Kentucky]], '''Christopher Maier''', 21 years old. He was a [[University of Kentucky]] student walking along nearby railroad tracks with his girlfriend, Holly, when the two were attacked by Reséndiz, who bludgeoned Maier to death with a 52 pound rock.  Reséndiz raped and severely beat Maier's girlfriend, who nearly died as a result. Holly Dunn Pendleton, the only known survivor, went on to appear on the Biography channel television program "I Survived", and "48 Hours: Left for Dead"; the ID channel series "Dates From Hell" (episode 8, "A Killer Night"); and her story was told in the UK newspaper, The Guardian.<ref>{{cite news|title=article|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/jun/24/experience-i-survived-a-serial-killer|publisher=The Guardian | first=Holly|last=Dunn|date=June 24, 2011}}</ref> Currently she helps other victims of rape, sexual assault, and crime. She also founded "Holly's House" in her native Evansville, Indiana to benefit those victims of rape, sexual assault, and crime as well as working closely with [[Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network|RAINN]].

8. October 4, 1998, [[Hughes Springs, Texas]], '''Leafie Mason''', 81 years old. She was hammered to death with an antique flat iron by Reséndiz, who entered through a window. Fifty yards outside her door was the Kansas City-Southern Rail line.

9. December 17, 1998, [[West University Place, Texas]], '''Claudia Benton''', 39 years old. Benton, a [[pediatric]] [[neurologist]] at the [[Baylor College of Medicine]], was raped, stabbed, and bludgeoned repeatedly after he entered her home, which is near the [[Union Pacific]] railroad tracks. Police found her Jeep Cherokee in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] and found Reséndiz's fingerprints on the steering column. After the murder, Reséndiz had a warrant for his arrest for burglary, but not yet for murder.

10 and 11. May 2, 1999, [[Weimar, Texas]], '''Norman J. Sirnic''', 46 years old, and '''Karen Sirnic''', 47 years old. The Sirnics were bludgeoned to death by a sledgehammer in a parsonage of the United Church of Christ, where Norman Sirnic was a pastor. The building was located adjacent to the [[Union Pacific]] railroad. The Sirnics' red [[Mazda]] was also found in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] three weeks later, and fingerprints link their case with the Claudia Benton case.

12. June 4, 1999, [[Houston, Texas]], '''Noemi Dominguez''', 26 years old. Dominguez, a schoolteacher at [[Houston Independent School District]]'s Benjamin Franklin Elementary School, was bludgeoned to death with a pickaxe in her apartment near the rail tracks. Seven days later, her white [[Honda]] Civic was discovered by state troopers on the International Bridge in [[Del Rio, Texas]].

13. June 4, 1999, [[Schulenburg, Texas|Fayette County]], [[Texas]], '''Josephine Konvicka''', 73 years old. Konvicka was killed by a blow of the same pickaxe used to kill Noemi Dominguez on the head while she lay sleeping. Her farmhouse is not far from Weimar. Reséndiz attempted to steal the car but was unable to take it away since he could not find the car keys.

14 and 15. June 15, 1999, [[Gorham, Illinois]], '''George Morber, Sr.''', 80 years old, and '''Carolyn Frederick''', 52 years old. Reséndiz shot George Morber in the head with a shotgun and then clubbed Carolyn Frederick to death with a tire iron. Their house was located only 100 yards (90 m) away from a railroad track. Later, someone spotted a man matching Reséndiz's description driving Carolyn Frederick's red pickup truck in [[Cairo, Illinois]], which is located 40 miles south of Gorham.  In addition, the Jackson County Sheriff's Office found fingerprints in the Morbers' ransacked home, positively identifying Reséndiz as the killer. <ref>http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2006Jun27/0,4675,RailroadKillerTownapossTerror,00.html</ref>

16. Reséndiz is suspected in the death of '''Fannie Whitney Byers''', 81, who was found Dec. 10, 1998, bludgeoned to death in her [[Carl, Georgia]] home located near CSX Transportation railroad tracks with a tire rim. A Lexington couple was charged in this [[Barrow County, Georgia|Barrow County]] murder, but Reséndiz admitted to an FBI agent that he killed Byers, according to authorities.<ref>[http://onlineathens.com/stories/062306/news_20060623061.shtml Judge says killer sane enough for execution]</ref>

He confessed to seven other killings as well, which he said took place in Mexico. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Arrest and trial==
[[File:PolunskyUnitWestLivingstonTX.jpg|thumb|[[Allan B. Polunsky Unit]] houses the State of Texas death row for men.]]
The police tracked down Reséndiz's sister, Manuela. She feared that her brother might kill someone else or be killed by the [[FBI]], so she agreed to help the police. A [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]], Drew Carter, accompanied by Manuela and a spiritual guide met up with Reséndiz on a bridge connecting [[El Paso, Texas]], with [[Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]]. (Manuela was originally reluctant to cooperate, but Carter convinced her otherwise.) Reséndiz surrendered to Carter.

During a court appearance, Reséndiz accused Carter of lying under oath because his (Reséndiz's) family was under the impression that he would be spared the death penalty; however, Reséndiz's ultimate fate would be decided by the jury, not Carter.<ref>http://lubbockonline.com/stories/052300/sta_052300082.shtml</ref>

In 1999, former Texas Attorney General [[Jim Mattox]]{{spaced ndash}}wary of the controversy miring the many confessions and recantations by [[Henry Lee Lucas]]{{spaced ndash}}remarked of Reséndiz that "I hope they don't start pinning on him every crime that happens near a railroad track."<ref>[http://www.ble.org/pr/archive/headline0625a.html Watchdog group questions worth of the Heartland Flyer]</ref>

Reséndiz would be tried and sentenced to death for Benton's murder.

He received the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] ID#999356.<ref>"[http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/stat/resendizangel.htm Resendiz, Angel Maturino]." [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]].</ref>

==Mental health==
On June 21, 2006, a Houston judge ruled that Reséndiz was mentally competent to be executed. Upon hearing the judge's ruling, Reséndiz said, "I don't believe in death. I know the body is going to go to waste. But me, as a person, I'm eternal. I'm going to be alive forever." He also described himself as half-man and half-[[angel]] and told [[psychiatrists]] he couldn't be executed because he didn't believe he could die.

Statements like the above have led specialists to conclude that Reséndiz was not competent to be executed. In the words of a bilingual [[psychiatrist]] who evaluated Reséndiz on two occasions in 2006, “delusions had completely taken over [Reséndiz’s] thought processes.”<ref>[http://www.internationaljusticeproject.org/illnessAMResendiz.cfm Angel Maturino Resendiz]</ref>

==Death==
[[File:HuntsvilleUnitHuntsvilleTX.jpg|thumb|[[Huntsville Unit]], where Reséndiz died.]]

Despite an appeal pending with the [[5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]], Reséndiz had the death warrant signed for the murder of Claudia Benton. He was housed in the [[Polunsky Unit]] in [[West Livingston, Texas]].<!--Since 1999 all TX death row inmates are at Polunsky-->

He was executed in the [[Huntsville Unit]] in [[Huntsville, Texas]], on June 27, 2006, by [[lethal injection]]. In his final statement, Reséndiz said "I want to ask if it is in your heart to forgive me. You don't have to. I know I allowed the Devil to rule my life. I just ask you to forgive me and ask the Lord to forgive me for allowing the devil to deceive me. I thank God for having patience in me. I don't deserve to cause you pain. You do not deserve this. I deserve what I am getting." Reséndiz was pronounced dead at 8:05 p.m. [[Central Time zone|CDT]] (01:05 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on June 28, 2006).<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/06/27/railroad.killer.ap/index.html]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref>

Claudia Benton's husband George was present at the execution and said Reséndiz was "evil contained in human form, a creature without a soul, no conscience, no sense of remorse, no regard for the sanctity of human life."<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5122238.stm US 'railroad killer' put to death]." ''[[BBC]]''. Wednesday June 28, 2006. Retrieved on May 20, 2010.</ref>

==Media==
The Reséndiz case was featured in four criminal documentaries:
* ''Crime Stories'' on the [[Discovery Channel]]
* ''Infamous Murders'', "Death in the Country", on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]
* ''Murder She Solved: True Crime'', "Episode 13: Railway Killer", on [[Oprah Winfrey Network (Canadian TV channel)]]
* ''The FBI Files'', "Tracks of a Killer", on the [[Biography Channel]] (2003)
Reséndiz also featured on the December 11, 2010, episode of ''48 Hours Mystery'' (CBS), "Live to Tell: The Railroad Killer", when Holly Dunn shared the story of her attack. The specific murder of Christopher Maier and the woman (Holly Dunn), who accompanied Christopher on the night of his murder and the torture she endured was shown on the television show "Dates from Hell"

In the episode of ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', "Catching Out", features a serial killer named Armando Salinas who appears to have been based on Reséndiz (Like Reséndiz, he was a Hispanic drifter who travelled along railroads and killed the majority of his victims by bludgeoning them).

The '''Lebanese Phalanges Party''' ([[Arabic]]: ??? ??????? ?????????, ''Hizb Al-Kata’eb Al-Lubnaniyah''), better known in [[English language|English]] as the '''Phalange''' ([[Arabic]]: ''Kata'eb''), is a [[Christian]] political party in [[Lebanon]]. Although it is officially secular, it is mainly supported by [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite Christians]]. The party played a major role in the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975–90). In decline in the late 1980s and 1990s, the party slowly re-emerged since the early 2000s. It is now part of the [[March 14 Alliance]].

==Names==
The Lebanese Phalanges Party is also known as '''''Phalanges Libanaises''''' in [[French language|French]] and either '''''Kataeb''''' (??????? ????????? ''Al-Kata’eb Al-Lubnaniyya'') or ''''Phalangist Party'''' (''Hezb al-Kata’eb al-Lubnaniyya'') in [[Arabic]]. ''Kataeb'' is the [[plural]] of ''Katiba'' which is a translation into Arabic of the Greek word [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] ("[[battalion]]") which is also the origin of the Spanish term ''[[Falange]]''.

==History==

===Origins===
The Kataeb party was formed in 1936 as a Maronite paramilitary youth organization by [[Pierre Gemayel]] who modeled the party after Spanish [[Falange]] and Italian [[Fascist]] parties<ref>Lee Griffith, [http://books.google.com/books?id=4VnqkuE4c4AC The war on terrorism and the terror of God] (Wm.

In an interview by [[Robert Fisk]], Gemayel stated about the Berlin Olympics:
<blockquote>
I was the captain of the Lebanese football team and the president of the [[Federation Libanaise de Football|Lebanese Football federation]]. We went to the Olympic Games of 1936 in Berlin. And I saw then this discipline and order. And I said to myself: "Why can't we do the same thing in Lebanon?" So when we came back to Lebanon, we created this youth movement. When I was in Berlin then, Nazism did not have the reputation which it has now. Nazism? In every system in the world, you can find something good. But Nazism was not Nazism at all. The word came afterwards. In their system, I saw discipline. And we in the Middle East, we need discipline more than anything else.<ref name="fisk90">Fisk, R. (1990). ''Pity the Nation, the abduction of Lebanon''. New York: Nation Books. 65 p.</ref>
</blockquote>
He founded the party along with four other young Lebanese: [[Charles Helou]] (who later became a [[President of Lebanon]]), Shafic Nassif, Emile Yared and Georges Naccache. Pierre was chosen to lead the organization, in part because he was not a political figure at that time.<ref name="el-kataeb.org">[http://www.el-kataeb.org/founder.htm El Kataeb - Founder]{{Dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref>

During the first years of the Kataeb Party, the Party was strongly opposed to having anyone dominate Lebanon. They opposed the [[pan-Arabists]] who tried to take over Lebanon and also the French, who they saw as trying to infiltrate their culture and impose themselves within Lebanon.<ref name="el-kataeb.org"/>  Pierre and the Kataeb Party have always believed in an independent and sovereign Lebanon free of all
foreign influence.<ref>http://www.kataeb.org/pages.asp?pageid=3{{Dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref>
It actively took part in the struggle against the [[French Mandate of Lebanon|French Mandate]], until Lebanese independence was proclaimed in November 1943. Its [[motto]] was "[[God]], [[Nation]] and [[Family]]."

The influence of the Phalangists was very limited in the early years of [[Lebanon]]'s independence, but came to prominence as a strong ally of the government in the [[Lebanon crisis of 1958|1958 crisis]]. In the aftermath of the crisis, Pierre Gemayel was appointed to the cabinet, and two years later, was elected to the [[National Assembly of Lebanon|National Assembly]].

In 1968, the party joined the [[Helf Alliance]] formed with the two other big mainly [[Christian]] parties in Lebanon: the [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberal Party]] of former President [[Camille Chamoun]], and [[Lebanese National Bloc|National Bloc]] of [[Raymond Eddé]], and won 9 seats (of 99) in the parliamentary elections held that year, making it one of the largest groupings in Lebanon's notoriously fractured political system. By the end of the decade, the party created its own [[militia]], the [[Kataeb Regulatory Forces]] (KRF) and soon clashes began with the rising [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] militant guerrillas.

By the 1970s, the party had become a political giant in Lebanon, with an estimated membership of 60,000 to 70,000. The vast majority (85%) of members were Maronites, but some were members of minority Christian communities, Shiites, Druze, and Jews.<ref name="Husseini"/>

==Ideology==
* The primacy of preserving the Lebanese nation, but with a "Phoenician" identity, distinct from its Arab, Muslim neighbors. Party policies have been uniformly anticommunist and anti-Palestinian and have allowed no place for pan-Arab ideals.
* A nationalistic ideology that considers the Lebanese people, particularly Maronites, a unique nation independent from the Arab nation. It considers Lebanese sometimes a [[Phoenicianism|Phoenician]] and sometimes a [[Aramaeanism|Syriac]] people.
*Independent, sovereign and pluralistic Lebanon that safeguards basic human rights and fundamental freedoms to all its constituents.
*Lebanon a liberal outlet where Eastern Christianity can socially, politically and economically flourish in peace with its surrounding.

==The Kataeb’s Vision for Achieving Peace in Lebanon==
* Developing the political system along decentralized lines in order to genuinely guarantee basic rights and freedoms to all constituencies and thereafter constructively manage Lebanon’s cultural pluralism.
* Ending the military presence of several Lebanese and non-Lebanese groups such as Hezbollah, Palestinian armed militias and other Islamists, and call for their immediate decommissioning.
* As a founding member of the United Nations, commit to all relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, primarily 1559 (2004), 1680 (2006), 1701 (2006) and 1757 (2007).
* In line with the Lebanese constitution and the broad Lebanese consensus on the issue, reject any form of permanent settlement of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon at the expense of their right of return.
* Safeguarding the Lebanese Christian community in Lebanon as a free and secure entity enjoying complete mastery over its destiny and future.

==The party's main concerns==
* Currently the Kataeb is in stark disagreement with Hezbollah over many of its domestic and regional policies. The Party believes that Hezbollah is trying to impose its culture and will on the Lebanese society by means of its illegitimate arms, thus undermining Lebanon’s sovereignty and pluralistic nature. And by being ideologically and strategically beholden to Iran and Syria, Hezbollah is unilaterally subverting the wishes of a considerable number of Lebanese who wish to live in a secure, stable, open and peaceful country into an imposed reality based on the culture of Jihad and martyrdom and confrontation with the international community.
* The Party is also concerned about another factor of instability over its territories, which is the presence of Palestinian refugees with what accompanies it from regional and domestic ramifications. Notwithstanding that the Kataeb has recently attempted to improve the inhumane living conditions of refugees through Parliament, it remains concerned about latent or gradual attempts to force their permanent settlement in Lebanon.  Because such an event will alter Lebanon’s fragile demographic (and political) balance, the Kataeb at present will remain watchful and opposed to any such development just as it was in the past and as its history attests.
* The Kataeb Party also believes in a free and active Christian presence in Lebanon and sees an organic relation between the idea of freedom and the Christians. They believe that freedom in Lebanon owes its existence in the first instance to a free and open Christian community that bestowed on Lebanon its liberal character from which other communities benefited. Lebanon minus its active and free Christians will automatically transform into another neighboring Arab country.

==Kataeb Regulatory Forces==

{{main|Kataeb Regulatory Forces}}
The Phalange party’ militia was not only the largest and best organized political paramilitary force in [[Lebanon]] but also the oldest.  It was founded in 1937 as the “Militants’ organization” by the President of the Party [[Pierre Gemayel]] and [[William Hawi]], a [[Lebanese-American]] glass industrialist, who led them during the [[1958 Lebanon crisis|1958 civil war]].  Fighting alongside the pro-government forces, the Phalangists defended the [[Metn]] region.

Disbanded in January 1961 by order of the Kataeb Party' Political Bureau, Hawi created in their place the Kataeb Regulatory Forces.  In order to coordinate the activities of all Phalange paramilitary forces, the Political Bureau set up the Kataeb War Council ([[Arabic]]: ''Majliss al-Harbi'') in 1970, with William Hawi being appointed as head.  The seat of the Council was allocated at the Kataeb Party’s Headquarters at the heart of [[Ashrafieh]] quarter in [[East Beirut]] and a quiet expansion of KRF units followed suit, complemented by the development of a training infrastructure.

Two company-sized [[Special Forces]] units, the “1st Commando” and the “2nd Commando” were created in 1963, soon followed by the “Pierre Gemayel” squad (later a company) and a VIP protection squad.  To this was added in 1973 another commando platoon ([[Arabic]]: ''Maghaweer'') and a “Combat School” was secretly opened at [[Tabrieh]], near [[Bsharri]] in the [[Keserwan District]]; another special unit, the “Bashir Gemayel brigade” – named after Pierre Gemayel’s youngest son, Bashir – was formed in the following year, absorbing the old “PG” company in the process.

Considered by many analysts as the best organized of all militia “fiefs” in the whole of Lebanon under the leadership of "chef" Boutros Khawand, it was administered by a network of Phalangist-controlled business corporations headed by the GAMMA Group “brain-trust”, backed by the DELTA computer company, and the SONAPORT holding.  The latter had run since 1975 the legal commercial ports of Jounieh and Beirut, including the infamous clandestine “Dock Five” – “Cinquième basin” in [[French language|French]] – from which the Phalange extracted additional revenues by leving illegal taxes and carried out arms-smuggling operations.
The KRF was also served by a clandestine-built airstrip, the '''[[Pierre Gemayel International Airport]]''', opened in 1976 at [[Hamat]], north of Batroun,<ref>Fisk, ''Pity the Nation'' (2001), p. 179.</ref> and had its own radio station '''"The Voice of Lebanon"''' ([[Arabic]]: ''Iza’at Sawt Loubnan'') or '''"La Voix du Liban" (VDL)''' in [[French language|French]] set up in that same year.

On July–August of that same year, the Phalangists headed alongside its allies, the [[Army of Free Lebanon]], [[Al-Tanzim]], NLP [[Tigers Militia (Lebanon)|Tigers Militia]], [[Guardians of the Cedars]] (GoC), the [[Tyous Team of Commandos]] (TTC) and the [[Lebanese Youth Movement]] (LYM) in the sieges – and subsequent massacres – of [[Karantina Massacre|Karantina]], [[al-Masklah]] and [[Tel al-Zaatar Massacre]]s<ref>http://forum.tayyar.org/f8/facts-ag-tal-el-za3tar-28096/index2.html.</ref> at the Muslim-populated slum districts and adjacent [[Palestinian refugee camps]] of East Beirut, and at the town of [[Dbayeh]] in the [[Metn]].

During the [[Lebanese Civil War#First phase of the war, 1975-77|1975-76 phase of the Lebanese Civil War]], the Kataeb Regulatory Forces’ own mobilization and street action skills allowed the Kataeb to become the primary and most fearsome fighting force in the Christian-conservative camp.<ref>Abraham, ''The Lebanon war'' (1996), p. 195.</ref>

At Beirut and elsewhere, Phalange militia sections were heavily committed in several battles against [[Lebanese National Movement]] (LNM) leftist militias and suffered considerable casualties, notably at the [[Battle of the Hotels]] in October 1975<ref>Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, ''Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas'' (1979), p. 6.</ref><ref>O'Ballance, ''Civil War in Lebanon'' (1998), p. 29.</ref> where they fought the [[al-Murabitoun]] and the [[Nasserite Correctionist Movement]] (NCM), and later at the ‘Spring Offensive’ held against [[Mount Lebanon]] in March 1976.

==Main events==

===1936-1943===
The founding and the battle for independence: in 1943 the Kataeb played an instrumental role in attaining Lebanon’s first independence from the French mandate. During this period, Kataeb led many social struggles to consolidate national cohesion and to promote individual liberties and social welfare. The Kataeb elaborated the first Lebanese “labour charter” in 1937. It was a pioneer initiative as it called for a minimum wage, a limitation of working hours and paid leaves. The Kataeb was one of the first Lebanese parties to have a solid avant-garde economic program and organized social activism throughout the country. The year of 1941 saw the creation of the first women section in a Lebanese Party. It called openly for stopping any kind of discrimination towards women. Since 1939, the Party has issued ''[[Al Amal]]'', a leading bilingual political publication.

===1943-1958===
The battle against the dilution of Lebanon: the Kataeb Party entered the political and parliamentary scene during the late 1940s after a period in which it refrained from entering the political arena to focus mainly on the promotion of the youth and on social issues, away from the trivialities of post-mandate politics.

Kataeb struggled to preserve Lebanon’s independence facing the growing appetite of its neighbors. The Party expanded considerably its presence throughout the territory and attracted thousands of new members, undoubtedly forming one of the largest parties in the Middle-East. Kataeb adopted a modern organization which made its fame and became its trademark. In 1958 the Kataeb was the key actor in confronting the coup influenced by pan-Arabists led by Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of the ephemeral United Arab Republic (Egypt, Syria and Yemen), and succeeded in maintaining Lebanon’s independence and liberal identity.

===1958-1969===
Kataeb into government: after having succeeded in preserving the Lebanese formula, Kataeb Party ranks grew considerably and reached 70 thousand members (of a total population of 2,2 million). The Party achieved many electoral successes and became the main Christian component of successive governments. During the ministerial mandates held by its members, it made elementary education mandatory and improved public school infrastructures. On a social level, the Kataeb Party introduced “labor laws” and contributed decisively in Social Security law. The Party played a key role in promoting modern institutions that are still today the pillar of the Lebanese administrative system such as the Civil Service Council, the Central Inspection Board and many other public achievements.

Cheikh Pierre Gemayel, leader of the Party and Minister of Public Works, gave Lebanon a large part of its modern infrastructure by achieving 440 development projects during his term. Lebanon was at its peak and became a first-tier destination for tourism in the world. But what was labeled as the “Switzerland of the Middle-East” was a shaky construction and the influx of Palestinian refugees after 1949 warned of an ominous future.

===1970-1982===
Resistance against disintegration: in the early 1970s the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO) attempted to take over Lebanon and turn it into what many perceived as an alternative state for Palestinians. Following this development, and coupled with the disintegration of the state institutions and the army, the country became an open battlefield.  Many foreign states were directly and militarily involved in the Lebanese conflict, especially Syria which under the banner of Arab solidarity tried to impose its authority upon the country, and Israel which invaded Lebanon in 1978. The Kataeb Party along with other political parties formed the Lebanese Resistance and battled to preserve Lebanon and its independence and integrity. Driven by this ideal and the preservation of freedom and Christian dignity in the Middle East, more than 4000 members of the Party gave their lives for this cause. The Kataeb Party succeeded in getting two of its leaders elected to the presidency. In 1982, president-elect Bachir Gemayel, son of Pierre Gemayel and leader of the Lebanese resistance, was assassinated when an explosion rocked the Party’s headquarters in the Achrafieh area of Beirut. The architect of the blast was a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. In the aftermath of the assassination, Amin Gemayel, the eldest son of Pierre Gemayel, was elected President of the Lebanese Republic.

The 1982 Israeli Judicial inquiry into [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|events in Beirut]] estimated that when fully mobilized the Phalange had 5000 fighters of whom 2000 were full-time.<ref>[[Yitzhak Kahan|Kahan, Yitzhak]], [[Aharon Barak|Barak, Aharon]], [[Yona Efrat|Efrat, Yona]] (1983) ''The Commission of Inquiry into events at the refugee camps in Beirut 1983 FINAL REPORT (Authorized translation)'' p.108 has "This report was signed on 7 February 1982." p7</ref> From the start of the [[1982 Lebanon War|invasion]] Israeli Chief of Staff [[Rafael Eitan]] told the Phalange not to engage in any fighting.<ref>Kahan. p.10</ref>

===1982-1988===
Amin Gemayel’s presidency: despite the turmoil caused by the civil strife in Lebanon and the raging wars that devastated the country, President Gemayel was able to accomplish many achievements during his presidential mandate. One of his first achievements was to rebuild the State’s institutions and to reorganize and resupply the Army in preparation for the struggle to recover sovereignty and provide security for Lebanon.  The same efforts to liberate the country culminated in the Agreement on Security Arrangements of May 17, 1983, which was somewhat an affirmation of the Armistice Agreement of 1949 with Israel even though this agreement was never concluded because of the opposition of Syria and then Israel. Amin Gemayel called for and chaired national dialogue conferences in Geneva and Lausanne and succeeded in creating a national accord and the formation of a fully representative government. He also rebuilt the Lebanese University and laid its modern foundation, introduced many economic reforms and even started to rebuild Beirut central district. 
The war was however still raging and Lebanon’s neighbors, mainly Syria and Israel, expanded their influence in the country. On the other hand, Kataeb Party suffered a great loss with the death of its founder, Cheikh Pierre Gemayel in 1984.

The Sabra and Shatila massacre was the slaughter of between 762 and 3,500 civilians, mostly Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites, by a Lebanese Christian militia in the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut, Lebanon from approximately 6:00 pm 16 September to 8:00 am 18 September 1982.[3 ]The massacre was presented as retaliation for the assassination of the newly elected Lebanese president Bachir Gemayel, the leader of the Lebanese Kataeb Party. It was wrongly assumed that Palestinian militants had carried out the assassination; it is now known to have been perpetrated by Lebanese militants with ties to Syria.

===1989-2000===
The Syrian era: in 1990, the Lebanese War came to a close when Syrian Forces maintained their grip over the entire country leading to fifteen years of occupation during which President Amin Gemayel was exiled to France and the Kataeb Party fell under Syrian influence. Organized institutions that could endanger Syrian rule in Lebanon were systematically muzzled. Christian parties paid the highest price for their resistance to Syrian hegemony and their leaders were either eliminated, exiled or imprisoned. 
Kataeb spirit was however still strong between its members and sympathizers. This started to be visible in the late 90’s when Kataeb students participated actively in the student and intellectual resistance that started to be heard.

===2000-2007===
The revival of Lebanon and the Party: Amin Gemayel returned to Lebanon in June 2000 and was welcomed by large crowds that filled the streets and squares of Bikfaya. Pierre Amin Gemayel was elected MP for Metn district, signalling the rebirth of the Kataeb Party. “Kataeb opposition” was structured and began its activities within the framework of the “Kornet Shahwan Coalition”, and then through the “Bristol Meeting”, which formed a platform for the joint Christian-Muslim opposition. Eventually, all this led to the Independence Uprising in February 2005 and on March 14, 2005 more than a million Lebanese filled the streets of central Beirut to demand Syrian withdrawal and the restoration of sovereignty. The Kataeb Party extensively participated in the “Cedar Revolution” and MP Pierre Gemayel played a significant role in shaping this uprising which led to Lebanon’s second independence.                                                                          
Syrian troops effectively left Lebanon on 26 April of the same year, and at the same time, the Kataeb Party reunited and retrieved its historical role.
Pierre Amin Gemayel played a key role in reuniting the Party in 2006. Pierre Gemayel was assassinated on November 21, 2006, and in 2007, the Party was dealt another blow when MP Antoine Ghanem was assassinated as well.

==Chronology of Main Events==
# In 1943 the Kataeb played an instrumental role in attaining Lebanon’s independence from the French mandate and co-designed the currently adopted Lebanese flag that was adopted by the Lebanese government of the time.
# In 1958 the Kataeb and its allies opposed the coup d’état by the United Arab Republic under the leadership of Gamal Abdel Nasser, and succeeded in maintaining Lebanon’s independence and liberal identity.
# In 1969 the Kataeb opposed the Cairo Agreement, which legitimized military operations against Israel by Palestinian militiamen in South Lebanon; prompting many at the time to refer to the South as “Fateh Land.”
# The conflict between the Kataeb and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) escalated in 1975 in the Ain ar-Rummaneh [[Bus Massacre]] carried out by Kataeb militants and regarded as the starting point of the Lebanese civil war.<ref>Khalaf, Samir (2002): Civil and Uncivil Violence in Lebanon: A History of the Internationalization of Human Contact; New York: Columbia University Press; p. 228f</ref>
# From 1978 until 1990, the Kataeb and the Lebanese Resistance clashed in fierce battles with Syrian Forces who were occupying large parts of the country resulting in an ongoing death toll among Kataeb members.
# In 1982 the leader of the Lebanese Resistance and president-elect Bachir Gemayel was assassinated when an explosion rocked the Kataeb headquarters in the Achrafieh area of Beirut. The architect of the blast was a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. In the aftermath of the assassination, Amin Gemayel, current president of the party, was elected President of the Lebanese Republic.
# In 1990, the Lebanese War came to a close when Syrian Forces took control of the entire country, leading to fifteen years of occupation during which President Amin Gemayel was exiled to France and the Kataeb Party fell under Syrian control.
# In 2005, the Kataeb extensively participated in the Cedar Revolution, which saw a cross-communal revolt against Syrian occupation. MP Pierre Gemayel played a significant role in shaping this revolution which led to Lebanon’s second independence.
# In 2006, the Kataeb Minister Pierre Gemayel was assassinated by opening fire his car at close range.
# In 2007, the Kataeb MP Antoine Ghanem was assassinated in a car bomb explosion in the Sin el-Fil area of North Metn.

==War era and decline==
Throughout the 1975 Civil War, the Phalange Party was the most important force within the Christian camp, and its militia carried out most of the fighting as part of the Lebanese Front, the mostly Christian rightist coalition.
[[File:William Hawi, Chief of the Kataeb Security Council, and Pierre Gemayel.jpg|thumb|200px| [[Pierre Gemayel]] and [[William Hawi]], Chief of the [[Kataeb]] Security Council]]

In April 1975, four persons, among them two men close to the Gemayel family, were killed during an attack on a church inauguration ceremony by unknown attackers in the Beirut suburb of [[Ain al-Roummaneh]]. In retaliation Phalangist militias killed 28 passengers of a bus later that day, most of them Palestinian commandos on their way back to the close-by refugee camp [[Tel el-Zaatar]], since they suspected Palestinians to be behind the church attack. This so-called [[Bus Massacre]] is commonly considered as the spark that set off the [[Lebanese Civil War]].<ref>Khalaf, Samir (2002): Civil and Uncivil Violence in Lebanon: A History of the Internationalization of Human Contact; New York: Columbia University Press; p. 228f</ref> In the following days, the 8,000-strong party militia, the [[Kataeb Regulatory Forces]], together with its allies, the [[Tigers Militia (Lebanon)|Tigers militia]], [[Al-Tanzim]], [[Marada Brigade]], [[Guardians of the Cedars]], [[Lebanese Youth Movement]], [[Tyous Team of Commandos]] and other formations, was heavily engaged in street fights against the Palestinian militias and their allies in the anti-government secular [[Lebanese National Movement]].

During the Lebanese Civil war, many predominantly Christian militias were formed who gained support from the north of Lebanon. These militias were staunchly right-wing, nationalist and anti-Palestinian with a majority of their members being Maronite. The Kataeb party was the most powerful of these militias at the time of the Lebanese Civil war. The party later went on to help found the right-wing [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces militia]] in 1977 which played a large role within the Lebanese Civil war.<ref>http://www.kataeb.org/index.asp?stay=1{{Dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref>

In September 1982, [[Bachir Gemayel]] was elected [[List of Presidents of Lebanon|President of Lebanon]] by the [[Parliament of Lebanon|National Assembly]]. He was assassinated less than a month later in an operation thought to have been arranged by Syrian intelligence and was in turn succeeded by his brother, [[Amine Gemayel]]. Bachir was thought to have been radical in his approach, and hinted at possible peace agreements with Israel while trying to expel all Palestinian refugees from Lebanon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine_Gemayel |title=Amine Gemayel - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-18}}</ref> In contrast, Amine was thought to have been much more moderate.

On 16 September 1982, [[Elie Hobeika]] led the massacre of between 762 and 3,500 Palestinian refugees in the [[Sabra and Shatila Massacre|Sabra and Shatila]] refugee camps, while the periphery of the camps were under the control of the [[Israeli Defense Forces]].

After the death of Pierre Gemayel in 1984, his successors [[Elie Karame]] and [[Amine Gemayel]] struggled to maintain influence over the actions of the [[Lebanese Army]], which become virtually independent as Muslim recruits deserted and rebelled against the mostly Christian officer ranks. The Kataeb party began to decline, not playing a major role for the remainder of the war.

=="Syrian era"==
The party, lacking direction, broke down into several rival factions. [[Georges Saadeh]] took control of the Party from 1986 until his death in 1998. He took a moderate position toward the Syrian presence. [[Mounir Hajj]] became the president of the party in 1999, followed by a [[Karim Pakradouni]] in 2002.
Amine Gemayel left Lebanon in 1988 after his mandate had ended, mainly to avoid a clash with [[Samir Geagea]]'s [[Lebanese Forces]] and avoid more Intra-Christian bloodshed. He returned in 2000 to oppose the Syrian role in Lebanon and to back his son's (Pierre) parliamentary election campaign (which he won). His sons Pierre and Samy, had returned in 1997 and had been working on reorganizing the popular base of the party. However his return was not welcome by the established leadership of the party who had become regime puppets. To distinguish themselves from the official leadership, Gemayel's supporters started referring to themselves as "The Kataeb Base" or "The Kataeb Reform Movement". General consensus amongst Lebanese always recognized Gemayel as the legitimate Leader of the party, not because of lineage but because most of popular support.

==Cedar Revolution==
In March 2005 after the [[Rafik Hariri]] assassination, the Kataeb took part in an anti-Syrian presence demonstration, commonly known as the [[Cedar Revolution]]. It also became a member of the [[March 14 Alliance]], along with the [[Future Movement]], [[Progressive Socialist Party]], [[Lebanese Forces]] and other minor parties. The Kataeb won 4 seats in the June 2005 elections, 3 representing the Gemayel Leadership (Pierre Gemayel, Solange Gemayel and Antoine Ghanem) and 1 representing the official leadership of the Party. However, they formed one parliamentary bloc after a reconciliation that took place in 2005. This reconciliation was marketed as gesture of good will from [[Pierre Amine Gemayel]] who deemed it was time to turn the page and give those who were unfaithful to the party principles a second chance. Practically, it was a way for Pakradouni and his men to leave the Party with as little humiliation as possible since the reconciliation deal stipulated the resignation of the entire political bureau after 2 years. This reconciliation saw Amine come back to the Party as Supreme President of the Party while Pakradouni stayed on as President. [[Samy Gemayel]] (Amine's second son) who had formed his own political ideas and identity at the time (much closer in principle and in manner to those of his uncle Bachir) was a very strong opposer of Pakradouni and his Syrian ties and thus was not a fan of this reconciliation. This drew Samy away from the party and prompted him to create a Think-Tank/Research-Center on Federalism named Loubnanouna (Our Lebanon).

==Siniora Government==
In July 2005, the party participated in the [[Lebanese government of July 2005|Fouad Siniora Government]], with [[Pierre Amine Gemayel]] as the minister of industry. Pierre played an important role in the reorganization and development of the party. His assassination in November 2006 was a major blow to the party. Syrian intelligence and "Fateh Al Islam" have been accused of the assassination. With 14 March Alliance forces, the party supports the Lebanese government against Hezbollah.<ref>http://www.kataeb.org/</ref>

In September 2007 another Kataeb MP, [[Antoine Ghanem]] was assassinated in a car bombing. Solange Gemayel remained the party's only MP, since Pierre Gemayel's seat was lost to the [[Free Patriotic Movement]] of [[Michel Aoun]] in a special election in August 2007.

In 2007 also, [[Samy Gemayel]] and (most of) his Loubnanouna companions rejoined the Kataeb, prompting a renaissance in the party.

==2009 elections==
In the 2009 [[Parliament of Lebanon|Global Parliamentary Elections]] the Kataeb Party managed to win 5 seats. 1 in the Metn Caza, 1 in the Beirut-1 Caza, 1 in Zahle, 1 in the Aley Caza and another in the Tripoli Caza. The victories in Beirut-1 and Zahle as well as not allowing the opposition's list to win fully in Metn were major upsets to the General Aoun's FPM who is an ally of Iranian-backed [[Hezbollah]]. These victories enabled Samy Gemayel, Nadim Gemayel (son of slain President [[Bachir Gemayel]]), Elie Marouni, Fady el-Haber and Samer Saade to join Parliament.
In the first Government of PM [[Saad Hariri]], the Kataeb were assigned the Social Affairs portfolio.

==The Kataeb Party today==
Since the end of Syria’s occupation of Lebanon in 2005, the Kataeb Party has attracted once again new generations and has regained its role as one of the major political actors in Lebanon. The Party has a large network in Lebanon and abroad and one cannot find a major city or town without a Kataeb presence.

The Party has an active parliamentary group and has MPs elected in nearly all major Christian constituencies such as Beirut, Metn, Zahlé, Aley and the North. Moreover, Kataeb Ministers have been particularly active in governments led by the March 14 coalition, namely in Ministries of Industry, Social Affairs and Tourism. 
      
The Kataeb Party calls for an objective assessment of the Lebanese political system’s limitations in order to guarantee the required political stability, security and economic prosperity. The series of political crises that Lebanon witnessed since its first independence in 1943 highlighted the shortcomings of the consensual and unitary system and its inadequacy with pluralistic countries such as Lebanon.

During the 2009 parliamentary elections that saw the victory of the Party and its allies, Kataeb presented a comprehensive program under the title of “Pact of Stability”. The vision of the Party revolves around the following main ideas:
Adopting decentralization in order to be closer to the citizen and guarantee basic rights and freedoms, in order to manage constructively Lebanon’s cultural pluralism and to ensure development in all parts of the Lebanese territory.
Proclaiming the neutrality of Lebanon towards all armed conflicts in the region in order to protect Lebanon from external meddling into its affairs, except for the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Safeguarding the secular State in Lebanon and completing its legal framework to guarantee the freedom of the individual and the respect of his rights and integrity. 
Ending the military status of several Lebanese and non-Lebanese groups such as Hezbollah, Palestinian armed militias and other Islamist groups, and call for their immediate disarmament.
Committing to all relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, primarily 1559 (2004), 1680 (2006), 1701 (2006) and 1757 (2007).  
Rejecting any form of permanent settlement of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon at the expense of their right of return.
Reforming the Lebanese Administration and adopting modern economic policies to stimulate the economy, ensure prosperity and therefore stop emigration.
The Party is also strongly concerned about the presence of Palestinian refugees with their regional and domestic ramifications. Notwithstanding that the Kataeb has recently attempted to improve the inhumane living conditions of refugees through Parliament, it remains concerned about latent or gradual attempts to force their permanent settlement in Lebanon.

A '''trial court''' is a [[court]] in which [[trial]]s take place. Such courts, known also as courts of first instance,  are said to have [[original jurisdiction]].

== In the United States ==
A trial court of [[general jurisdiction]] is authorized to hear any type of [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[Legal case|case]] that is not committed exclusively to another court. In the [[United States]], the [[United States district court]]s are the trial courts of general jurisdiction of the [[United States federal courts|federal judiciary]]; each [[U.S. state]] has a [[State court (United States)|state court]] system establishing trial courts of general jurisdiction, such as the [[Florida Circuit Courts]] in [[Florida]], the [[Superior Courts of California]] in [[California]], and the [[New York Supreme Court]] in [[New York]]. 

Not all cases are heard in trial courts of general jurisdiction. A trial court of [[limited jurisdiction]] is authorized to hear only specified types of cases. Trial courts of limited jurisdiction may be limited in [[subject-matter jurisdiction]] (such as [[Juvenile court|juvenile]], [[probate]], and [[family court]]s in many U.S. states, or the [[United States Tax Court]] in the federal judiciary) or by other means, such as [[small claims court]]s in many states for civil cases with a low [[amount in controversy]]. Other trials do not take place in courts at all, but in [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial bodies]] or in [[administrative agencies]] with [[Adjudication|adjudicatory]] power created by [[statute]] to make binding determinations with simplified procedural practices, such as [[arbitration]].  

Because different U.S. states apply different names to their courts, it is often not evident whether a court has general or limited [[jurisdiction]]. For instance, the Maine District Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, but the [[Nevada District Courts]] are courts of general jurisdiction.

In the trial court, [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] and [[testimony]] are admitted under the [[rules of evidence]] established by applicable [[procedural law]] and determinations called ''findings of fact'' are made based on the evidence. The court, presided over by one or more [[judge]]s, makes ''findings of law'' based upon the applicable law. In most [[common law]] jurisdictions, the trial court often sits with a [[jury]] and one [[judge]]; in such [[jury trial]]s, the jury acting as [[trier of fact]]. In some cases, the judge or judges act as triers of both fact and law, by either statute, custom, or agreement of the parties; this is referred to as a [[bench trial]]s.  In the case of most judges hearing cases through the [[bench trial]] process, they would prefer that all parties are given an opportunity to offer a vigorous and robust case presentation, such that, errors in [[testimony]], procedures, statutes, etc., do not grow "crab legs" -- meaning compounded errors -- and are [[Remand (court procedure)|remanded]] or returned to their court on [[appeal]]. 

[[Appeal]]s from the decisions of trial courts are usually made by higher courts with the power of appellate review ([[appellate court]]s). Most trial courts are [[Court of record|courts of record]], where the record of the presentation of evidence is created and must be maintained or transmitted to the appellate court. The record of the trial court is certified by the [[Court clerk|clerk of the trial court]] and transmitted to the appellate body. Most appellate courts do not have the authority to hear testimony or take evidence, but instead rule solely on matters of law.

}}'''Archibald Scott Couper''' (31 March 1831 &ndash; 11 March 1892) was a Scottish chemist who proposed an early theory of chemical structure and bonding.  He developed the concepts of tetravalent carbon atoms linking together to form large molecules, and that the bonding order of the atoms in a molecule can be determined from chemical evidence.

== Life and work ==

Couper was the only surviving son of a wealthy textile mill owner near [[Glasgow]].  He studied at the universities of [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] and [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] and intermittently in Germany during the years 1851-54.  He began the formal study of chemistry at the [[University of Berlin]] in the fall of 1854, then in 1856 entered [[Charles Adolphe Wurtz]]'s private laboratory at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris (now the [[University of Paris V: René Descartes]]).  

Couper published his "New Chemical Theory" in French in a condensed form on 14 June 1858, then in detailed papers simultaneously in French<ref>{{cite journal | title = Sur une nouvelle théorie chimique | author = Couper, A. S. | journal = [[Annales de chimie et de physique]] | volume = 53 | year = 1858 | pages = 469–489 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k34794n/f468.table}}</ref> and English in August 1858.  Couper's idea that carbon atoms can link to each other following valence regularities was independent of a paper by [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz|August Kekulé]] proposing the same concept. (Kekulé had already proposed the tetravalence of carbon in 1857.)  However, through a misunderstanding with Wurtz, Kekulé's paper appeared in print first, in May 1858,<ref>{{cite journal | title = Ueber die Constitution und die Metamorphosen der chemischen Verbindungen und über die chemische Natur des Kohlenstoffs | author = Kekulé, Aug. | journal = [[Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]] | year = 1858 | volume = 106 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–159 | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18581060202}}</ref> and so Kekulé captured the priority for the discovery of the self-linking of carbon atoms.  When Couper angrily confronted Wurtz, Wurtz expelled him from the laboratory.  

In December 1858, Couper received an offer of an assistantship from the University of Edinburgh.  However, Couper's health began to decline after this disappointment.  In May 1859 he suffered a nervous breakdown, and entered an institution as a private patient.  Released in July 1859, he almost immediately suffered a relapse—it was said to have been from sunstroke—and was treated again until November 1862.  But his health was now broken, and he did no more serious work, spending the last 30 years of his life in the care of his mother.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Dobbin, L. | title = The Couper Quest | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | volume = 11 | year = 1934 | issue = 6 | pages = 331&ndash;338 | doi = 10.1021/ed011p331}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = [[Richard Anschütz|Anschütz, Richard]] | title = Life and Chemical Work of Archibald Scott Couper | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh | volume = 29 | year = 1909 | pages = 193&ndash;273}}</ref>

[[Image:Coupers-molecule.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Archibald Couper]]'s molecular structures, for [[alcohol]] and [[oxalic acid]], using elemental symbols for atoms and lines for bonds (1858)]]

Couper's research differed from Kekulé's in several ways.  He was open to the idea of divalent carbon, which Kekulé was not.  He provided many more resolved formulas in his paper than Kekulé had, and in two cases even suggested (hetero)cyclical formulas, which could have influenced Kekulé in his later suggestion of the benzene ring.  Couper adopted the atomic weight of oxygen as 8 rather than 16, so there are twice as many oxygen atoms in Couper's formulas as in those of Kekulé.  Finally, Couper used dotted lines or dashes between the atoms in his formulas, approximating the appearance of later formula styles.  In this respect, his work was probably influential on the early structural theorists [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Butlerov]] and [[Alexander Crum Brown]].

{{Politics of Lebanon}}
'''Elie Hobeika''' (22 September 1956 – 24 January 2002) (Arabic: ???? ?????) was a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[Phalangist]] and [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces]] militia commander during the [[Lebanese Civil War]], and former [[Member of Parliament|MP]].  Hobeika gained notoriety when he was named by the Israelis as one of the commanders of militiamen responsible for the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|massacre in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps]] on the outskirts of [[Beirut]] in 1982.
[[File:Lebanon January 2014 687.JPG|thumb|Picture of billboard, Brummana, Lebanon. Advertising a church service in memory of Elie Hobeika.]]

==Early life==
Hobeika was born in Kleiat in [[Keserwan District]], [[Lebanon]], to a [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] family on 22 September 1956.<ref name=maher>{{cite news|last=Hassan|first=Maher|title=Politics and war of Elie Hobeika|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/politics-and-war-elie-hobeika|accessdate=29 December 2012|newspaper=Egypt Independent|date=24 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|title=Elie Hobeika|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1382591/Elie-Hobeika.html|accessdate=29 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=25 January 2002}}</ref> According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', he was deeply influenced by the [[massacre]] of much of his family and of his fiancée by [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] militiamen at the [[Damour massacre]] of 1976.<ref name="guardian_obit">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/jan/25/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon Mostyn, Trevor, The Guardian, 25 January 2002]</ref>

== Lebanese Civil War ==

Hobeika distinguished himself as a ruthless fighter, gaining the nickname "HK," after the Heckler and Koch machinegun he carried.<ref name=meforum>{{cite journal|last=Gambill|first=Gary C.|author2=Bassam Endrawos|title=The Assassination of Elie Hobeika|journal=Middle East Intelligence Bulletin|date=January 2002|volume=4|issue=1|url=http://www.meforum.org/meib/articles/0201_l1.htm|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref> In July 1977, Hobeika, then only known under the pseudonym "Chef Edward", led a massacre against civilians and Palestinian militants in the south Lebanese village of Yarin where about 80 people of which probably 20 to 30 were civilians were lined up in front of the school and shot.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Tveit, Odd Karsten|authorlink=Odd Karsten Tveit|title=Nederlag. Israels krig i Libanon|year=1985|publisher=[[J.W. Cappelens Forlag|Cappelen]]|language= Norwegian|ISBN= 82-02-09346-5|pages=47&ndash;50}}</ref>

He steadily became prominent in the Phalange, which had defeated rival Christian militias by July 1980 and incorporated them into [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|the Lebanese Forces (LF)]].<ref name=meforum/> In 1978, Hobeika became head of the LF's security agency (jihaz al-amin). He also became a personal bodyguard of Bashir Gemayel.<ref name=telegraph/> In the years that followed, he developed close ties with both the Israeli military and [[American Central Intelligence Agency|the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)]].<ref name=meforum/>

During Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, Hobeika was the liaison officer to [[Mossad]]. On 15 September, following the assassination of President-elect [[Bashir Gemayel]] the previous day, the Israeli army took over [[west Beirut]]. Minister Of Defence, [[Ariel Sharon]] and Chief of Staff, General [[Raful Eitan]] had decided that the IDF would not enter the Palestinain refugee camps but this task should be undertaken by Lebanese Christian militias. On the night of 16 September 1982, Hobeika, was on the top floor of the Israeli forward command post, when the first 150  militiamen entered [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|the Sabra and Shatila]] camps, which had been evacuated by [[PLO|the PLO]] at the beginning of September. Two hours after the first Phalangist force entered Shatilla camp one of the militiamen radioed Hobeika asking what to do with 50 women and children they had taken prisoner. Hobeika's response was overheard by an Israeli officer, who testified that Hobeika replied: "This is the last time you're going to ask me a question like that; you know exactly what to do." Other Phalangists on the roof started laughing. Brigadier General [[Amos Yaron|Yaron]] asked Lieutenant Elul, Chef de Bureau of the Divisional Commander, what the laughter was about and Elul translated what Hobeika had said. Yaron then had a five minute conversation, in English, with Hobeika. What was said is unknown.<ref>Kahan. pp.21,22</ref> Over the next three days, LF forces killed between 762 and 3,500 residents of the camp.<ref name=meforum/> Until 1985, Hobeika sided with Israel.<ref name=thestimate>{{cite news|title=Who Killed Elie Hobeika?|url=http://www.theestimate.com/public/020802.html|accessdate=29 December 2012|newspaper=The Estimate|date=8 February 2002}}</ref> However, then he began to support Syria's presence in Lebanon.<ref name=thestimate/>

Hobeika was involved in another incident in March 1985. The CIA reportedly paid Hobeika (through Lebanese army intelligence officers) to assassinate [[Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah]], the spiritual leader of the militant Shi'ite group [[Hezbollah]], because Fadlallah was considered by US officials to have taken part in planning the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|October 1983 bombing]] of the US marine barracks in [[Beirut]], which killed 241 servicemen. However, the assassination attempt was unsuccessful in that the car bombing near Fadlallah's residence killed dozens of bystanders, but left Fadlallah unscathed. The massacre led the CIA to terminate its relationship with Hobeika and gave Hezbollah a lasting grudge against him.<ref name=meforum/> Hobeika was removed from the Lebanese Forces by their leader [[Samir Geagea]] due to his betrayal.<ref name=telegraph/> After this event, Hobeika fled to Zahle and then to West Beirut.<ref name=maher/> He established a political movement there, the Waad Party.<ref name=maher/> In 1990, his forces fought with the Syrian forces against General [[Michael Aoun]].<ref name=telegraph/> After the civil war ended following [[Taif Accord|the Taif Accord]], Hobeika benefited from an amnesty for crimes committed during [[Lebanon Civil War|the Lebanon civil war]] in 1991.<ref name=telegraph/>

In June 2001, [[Chibli Mallat]], a left-wing [[Maronite]] lawyer, filed a case against [[Ariel Sharon]] in [[Belgium]] under a law that allowed foreigners to be sued for [[crimes against humanity]]. Just before his death, Hobeika publicly declared his intention to testify against Sharon about his involvement in the Sabra and Shatila massacre in the Belgian court. [[Josy Dubié]], a Belgian senator, was quoted as saying that Hobeika had told him several days before his death that he had "revelations" to disclose about the massacres and felt "threatened". When Dubié had asked him why he did not reveal all the facts he knew immediately, Hobeika is reported to have said: "I am saving them for the trial". At a news conference, he said, "I am very interested that the [Belgium] trial starts because my innocence is a core issue."<ref name="guardian_obit"/>

==Political career==
As head of the Waad Party, Hobeika was elected to Parliament in 1992 and in 1996.<ref name=maher/> During his term in the Parliament, he served in several ministerial positions: minister of state for emigrants' affairs (May 1992-October 1992); minister of state for social affairs and the handicapped (October 1992-September 1994) and minister of water resources and electricity (June 1993-December 1998).<ref name=maher/> When he was minister of water resources and electricity, massive power projects were realized in [[Baddawi]] and [[Zahrani]], [[Zouk]] and [[Baalbeck]], and massive electrical grid installation and distribution throughout Lebanon, including the outlying areas still in turmoil with Israeli Forces in the south, hence the progress was too slow compared to the massive increase in the [[Megawatt]]s needed, since little electricity projects were accomplished over 18 years of civil unrest, mainly because of the Israeli [[Operation Grapes of Wrath]]. In 2000, Hobeika lost his parliament seat, due to active Syrian interference against him in the election.<ref name=profilebbc>{{cite news|title=Profile: Elie Hobeika|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1779321.stm|accessdate=29 December 2012|newspaper=BBC|date=24 January 2002}}</ref><ref name=yeh6sep>{{cite journal|last=Yehia|first=Ranwa|title=A lighter Syrian shadow|journal=Al Ahram|date=31 August – 6 September 2000|volume=497|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/497/re4.htm|accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref>

== The Tripartite Agreement ==
The Tripartite Agreement was intended to end the Lebanese conflict.  In December 1985, the various [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] militias, the [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shiite]] [[Amal Movement]] and the [[Druze]] [[Progressive Socialist Party]] met in [[Damascus]] reaching agreement on political reforms as well as special relations with [[Syria]]. 
However on 15 January 1986, President [[Amine Gemayel]] and [[Samir Geagea]] organised a coup against Hobeika thus rendering the agreement null and void.<ref name="Krayem">[http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/pspa/conflict-resolution.html Hassan Krayem, ''The Lebanese Civil War and the Taif Agreement'' American University of Beirut]</ref>

==Personal life==
Hobeika married Gina Raymond Nachaty in 1981.<ref name=telegraph/> They had a daughter, who died in infancy and a son, Joseph.<ref name=telegraph/><ref name="guardian_obit"/>

== Assassination ==
Hobeika was killed on 24 January 2002 at the age of 45 when a car bomb detonated near his house in the Beirut suburb of [[Hazmiyeh]].<ref name=guardian_obit/><ref name=lfor>{{cite web|title=Elie Hobeika Assassinated|url=http://www.lebaneseforces.com/hobeika.asp|publisher=Lebanese Forces|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref> The explosion killed three other people, including his two bodyguards, and wounded six more people.<ref name=tnyt02>{{cite news|last=MacFarquhar|first=Neil|title=Car Bomb Kills Figure in 1982 Lebanese Massacre|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/25/world/car-bomb-kills-figure-in-1982-lebanese-massacre.html|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 January 2002}}</ref>

===Perpetrators===
A group, Lebanese for a Free and Independent Lebanon, issued a statement after the assassination, claiming responsibility for the killing of Hobeika.<ref name=alantt>{{cite news|last=Philps|first=Alan|title=Warlord killed in Beirut car bombing|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/lebanon/1382678/Warlord-killed-in-Beirut-car-bombing.html|accessdate=26 January 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=25 January 2002}}</ref> The group announced that it killed Hobeika, since he was a "Syrian agent" and an "effective tool" in the hands of [[Ghazi Kenaan]], the then head of Syrian military intelligence.<ref name=alantt/>

Lebanese and Arab commentators blamed Israel for the murder of Hobeika, with alleged Israeli motive that Hobeika would be ‘apparently poised to testify before the Belgian court about Sharon’s role in the massacre<ref name=Campagna>Joel Campagna, [http://www.worldpress.org/Mideast/460.cfm The Usual Suspects], ''World Press Review'', April 2002. Accessed 24 February 2006.</ref> Prior to his assassination, Elie Hobeika had stated "I am very interested that the [Belgian] trial starts because my innocence is a core issue."<ref name="guardian_obit">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/jan/25/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon Mostyn, Trevor, Guardian.co.uk, Friday 25 January 2002]</ref>

Others have speculated that Syrian intelligence assassinated Hobeika, who had "specifically stated that he did not plan to identify Sharon as being responsible for Sabra and Shatila", to prevent him from testifying on Syria's involvement in the massacre.<ref>{{citebook|last1=Alexander|first1=Edward|last2=Bogdanor|first2=Paul|title=The Jewish Divide Over Israel|publisher=Transaction|year=2006|page=90}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.jcpa.org/art/brief1-17.htm|title=Elie Hobeika's Assassination: Covering up the Secrets of Sabra and Shatilla|publisher=''Jerusalem Issues Brief''|date=2002-01-30}}</ref>

'''Yuggoth''' (or '''Iukkoth''') is a fictional [[planet]] in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. It is deemed to be located at the very edge of the [[Solar System]].

==Links with Pluto==
At the time of the discovery of the planet [[Pluto]] in 1930 Lovecraft himself very casually suggested, in a letter to a friend, that Yuggoth might "probably" be the same as Pluto {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}. Other writers have since claimed that it is actually an enormous [[Trans-Neptunian object|trans-Neptunian world]] that orbits perpendicular to the [[ecliptic]] of the [[solar system]].  The Italian astronomer Albino Carbognani has suggested that any planet discovered beyond Pluto might be named Yuggoth.<ref>Albino Carbognani, "Pluto and the astronomy of H.P. Lovecraft", ''Urania'', 30th June 2012</ref>

==In the Cthulhu Mythos==
<blockquote>
Yuggoth... is a strange dark orb at the very rim of our solar system... There are mighty cities on Yuggoth&mdash;great tiers of terraced towers built of black stone... The sun shines there no brighter than a star, but the beings need no light. They have other subtler senses, and put no windows in their great houses and temples... The black rivers of pitch that flow under those mysterious cyclopean bridges&mdash;things built by some elder race extinct and forgotten before the beings came to Yuggoth from the ultimate voids&mdash;ought to be enough to make any man a [[Dante]] or [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]] if he can keep sane long enough to tell what he has seen... 
<br>&mdash;H. P. Lovecraft, "[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]"
</blockquote>

Yuggoth is the planet where the [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] [[Mi-go]] have established a colony. The Mi-go's city sits at the edge of a pit wherein dwells an ancient and horrifying entity feared by the Mi-Go. They periodically abandon the city on those occasions when it rises from the pit and can be seen directly.

The being [[Tsathoggua#Cxaxukluth|Cxaxukluth]], along with [[Tsathoggua]] and his parents, migrated to Yuggoth from [[Cthulhu Mythos celestial bodies#Xoth|Xoth]]. A [[dysfunctional family]] in their own right, Cxaxukluth's progeny abandoned their patriarch and sought refuge deep in the bowels of Yuggoth, owing to Cxaxukluth's cannibalistic tendencies. Soon thereafter they fled Yuggoth, though Cxaxukluth still dwells there to this day. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

<blockquote>
It ([[Rhan-Tegoth]]) came to the earth from lead-grey Yuggoth, where the cities are under the warm, deep sea.
<br>&mdash;H. P. Lovecraft, "[[The Horror in the Museum]]"
</blockquote>

===tok'l-metal===

On Yuggoth, the [[Mi-go]] mine a strange metal known as ''tok'l''. Tok'l-metal is used in the manufacture of the Mi-go's notorious "brain cylinders", but it also has other ritual uses as well. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==In other fiction==

<blockquote>
Yuggoth itself hung directly overhead, obscenely bloated and oblate, its surface filling the heavens... and all the time pulsing, pulsing, pulsing like an atrocious heart, throbbing, throbbing.
<br>&mdash;[[Richard A. Lupoff]], "The Discovery of the Ghooric Zone&mdash;March 15, 2337"
</blockquote>

In Richard A. Lupoff's [[short story]] "The Discovery of the Ghooric Zone&mdash;March 15, 2337", Yuggoth is hinted to be the hypothetical [[Planet X]]. Lupoff's Yuggoth is a colossal, crimson planet, twice as massive as [[Jupiter]]. It is flattened at the poles and pulses eerily, no doubt because of its tremendous rotational speed&mdash;perhaps as fast as 80,000 kilometers per hour. It has numerous moons, including Nithon and  Zaman, and the twin-moons Thog and Thok.

[[File:Fungi from Yuggoth 1993.jpg|thumb|right|Jason Eckhardt's cover for the Necronomicon Press 1993 edition]]
"'''Fungi from Yuggoth'''" is a sequence of 36 [[sonnet]]s by [[cosmic horror]] writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. Most of the sonnets were written between 27 December 1929 – 4 January 1930; thereafter individual sonnets appeared in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' and other genre magazines. The sequence was published complete in ''[[Beyond the Wall of Sleep (collection)|Beyond the Wall of Sleep]]'' (Sauk City, WI: [[Arkham House]], 1943, 395–407) and ''The Ancient Track: The Complete Poetical Works of H. P. Lovecraft'' (San Francisco, CA: [[Night Shade Books]], 2001, 64–79). [[Ballantine Books]]’ mass paperback edition, ''Fungi From Yuggoth & Other Poems'' ([[Random House]], New York, 1971) was followed in 1982 by the chapbook printing of Lovecraft's sonnet cycle ([[Necronomicon Press]], West Warwick, RI). This may have been the first time that the sequence was published in its corrected text.<ref>S. T. Joshi, David E. Schultz, ''An H.P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia'', Westport CT 2001, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Myawoc_PbF4C&lpg=PA96&ots=lvkj-sGwZI&dq=continuity%20in%20%22Fungi%20from%20Yuggoth%22&pg=PA95#v=onepage&q=continuity%20in%20%22Fungi%20from%20Yuggoth%22&f=false pp 95-6]</ref>

==Themes==
The first three poems in the sequence concern a person who obtains an ancient book of esoteric knowledge that seems to allow one to travel to parallel realities or strange parts of the universe. Later poems deal more with an atmosphere of cosmic horror, or create a mood of being shut out from former felicity, and do not have a strong narrative through-line except occasionally over a couple of sonnets (e.g. 17-18). In that the book at the beginning provides 'the key' to the author's 'vague visions' (Sonnet 3) of other realities behind the everyday, it might be argued that the poems that follow, though disparate in themselves, detail a succession of such visions that a reading of it releases. With one or two exceptions, the concluding poems from "Expectancy" (28) onward seek to explain the circumstances of the narrator's sense of alienation within the present. Rather than visions themselves, these poems serve as a commentary on their source.<ref>The question is discussed in Jim Moon, "Fungi from Yuggoth II: [http://www.hypnogoria.com/html/fungifromyuggoth2.html a tour of Yuggoth"]</ref>

The sonnets see-saw between various themes in much the same way as do Lovecraft's short stories. There are references to the author's night terrors in "Recognition" (4), a potent source for his later fiction and carrying forward into dream poems related to his [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Dunsany]] manner; to intimations of an Elder Race on earth; and to nightmare beings from Beyond.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/h-p-lovecraft ''Encyclopedia of World Biography''], Gale Group 2010</ref> That these themes often cross-fertilize each other is suggested by "Star Winds" (14), which taken purely by itself is an exercise in Dunsanian dream-lore. However, beginning in the month after finishing his sequence, Lovecraft set to work on his story [[The Whisperer in Darkness]] (1931) where [[Yuggoth]] is recreated as a planet of fungoid beings given the name [[Mi-go]].<ref>[http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/wid.asp Online text]</ref> In the sonnet, the fungi sprout in a location called Yuggoth, not on an alien planet; and in its following line Nithon is described as a world with richly flowering continents rather than, as in the story, Yuggoth's occulted moon. This is a good instance of how Lovecraft gave himself license to be self-contradictory and vary his matter according to the artistic need of the moment, of which the diversity of conflicting situations within the whole sequence of sonnets is itself an example.<ref>David Szolloskei, ''Creating Real Fiction: Analysis of the Lovecraftian Prose-Fiction'', VDM Verlag 2008</ref>   Or, as he himself puts it in "Star Winds",

:::Yet for each dream these winds to us convey,
:::A dozen more of ours they sweep away!

==Style==

''Fungi from Yuggoth'' represents a marked departure from the mannered poems Lovecraft had been writing up to this point. Sending a copy of "Recapture" (which just predates the sequence but was later incorporated into it) the poet remarks that it is 'illustrative of my efforts to practice what I preach regarding direct and unaffected diction'.<ref>[http://www.themodernword.com/SCRIPTorium/lovecraft.html Themodernword.com] S. T. Joshi, H. P. Lovecraft</ref>

The sonnet forms used by Lovecraft veer between the Petrarchan and the Shakespearean. His multiple use there of [[feminine rhyme]] is reminiscent of [[A.E. Housman]] (e.g. in sonnets 15, 19). In addition, his sonnet 13 ('''Hesperia''') has much the same theme as Housman's "''Into my heart an air that kills''" (A Shropshire Lad XL).

Varying opinions have been expressed in the critical literature on Lovecraft as to whether the poems form a continuous cycle which tells a story, or whether each individual sonnet is discrete. Phillip A. Ellis, in his essay "Unity in Diversity: Fungi from Yuggoth as a Unified Setting", discusses this problem and suggests a solution.<ref>Lovecraft Annual 1, 2007, [http://www.scribd.com/doc/88020921/The-Lovecraft-Annual-No-1-2007 pp.84-90]</ref>

In addition to "The Whisperer in Darkness," the cycle references other works by Lovecraft and introduces a number of ideas that he would expand upon in later works.
* The town of [[Innsmouth]] is mentioned in sonnets VIII ("The Port") and XIX ("The Bells")
* The story told in sonnet XII ("The Howler") presages "[[The Dreams in the Witch House]]" ([[1932 in literature|1932]]). Its description of the witch's [[familiar spirit|familiar]], described as "a four-pawed thing with human face," echoes the description of Brown Jenkin, a rat-like creature with a human face.
*Sonnet XXVI references events preceding those in "The Dunwich Horror."
* Sonnets XXI and XXII, respectively, are named for and concern the [[Outer God]]s [[Nyarlathotep]] and [[Azathoth]].

'''Lee Buck Trevino''' (born December 1, 1939) is an American [[professional golfer]] who won six [[Men's major golf championships|major championships]] over the course of his career. He is one of only four players to twice win the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship]] and the [[PGA Championship]]. The only major that eluded him was the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]]. He is an icon for [[Mexican American]]s, and is often referred to as "The Merry Mex" and "Supermex".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.golflegends.org/lee-trevino.php |title=Lee Trevino profile |publisher=Golf Legends |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204173158/http://www.golflegends.org/lee-trevino.php |archivedate=February 4, 2012}}</ref>

==Early life==
Born in [[Dallas]], Texas, into a family of [[Mexico|Mexican]] ancestry, Trevino was raised by his mother, Juanita Trevino, and his grandfather, Joe Trevino, a [[gravedigger]]. Trevino never knew his father, Joseph Trevino, who left when his son was small. Trevino's childhood consisted of attending school occasionally and working to earn money for the family. At age 5, he started working in the cotton fields.<ref>http://www.lycos.com/info/lee-trevino--golf.html{{Dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref>

Trevino was introduced to golf when his uncle gave him a few golf balls and an old golf club. He then spent his free time sneaking into nearby country clubs to practice, and began as a [[caddy]] at the [[Dallas Athletic Club]], near his home. He soon began caddying full-time. Trevino had to leave school at 14 to go to work. He earned $30 a week as a caddy and a [[shoeshiner]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} He was also able to practice golf, since the caddies had three short holes behind their shack. After work, he would hit at least 300 balls.

When he turned 17 in December 1956, he enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], and served four years as a machine gunner and was discharged in December 1960 as a Corporal with the 3rd Marine Division. Part of his time was spent playing golf with Marine Corps officers. Trevino claims being a golf partner helped earn him promotion to [[lance corporal#United States|lance corporal]]. He played successfully in Armed Forces golf events in Asia, where one rival was [[Orville Moody]], who would follow Trevino to the [[PGA Tour]] in the late 1960s.

==Professional career==
After his discharge, Trevino became a club professional in [[El Paso, Texas]], and made extra money by gambling for stakes in head-to-head matches. He qualified for the U.S. Open in [[1966 U.S. Open (golf)|1966]], made the cut, and tied for 54th, earning $600. He qualified again in [[1967 U.S. Open (golf)|1967]] and shot 283 (+3), eight shots behind champion [[Jack Nicklaus]], and only four behind runner-up [[Arnold Palmer]]. Trevino earned $6,000 for finishing fifth, which earned him Tour privileges for the rest of the 1967 season. He won $26,472 as a rookie, 45th on the PGA Tour money list, and was named ''Rookie of the Year'' by ''[[Golf Digest]]''. The fifth place finish at the U.S. Open also earned him an exemption into the following year's event.

In 1968, his second year on the circuit, Trevino won the [[1968 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] at [[Oak Hill Country Club]], in [[Rochester, New York]], four strokes ahead of runner-up Nicklaus, the defending champion. During his career, Trevino won 29 times on the PGA Tour, including six [[men's major golf championships|majors]]. He was at his best in the early 1970s, when he was [[Jack Nicklaus]]'s chief rival. He won the money list title in 1970, and had six wins in [[1971 PGA Tour|1971]] and four wins in [[1972 PGA Tour|1972]].

Trevino had a remarkable spell during a span of 20 days in the summer of 1971. He defeated Nicklaus in an 18-hole playoff to win the [[1971 U.S. Open (golf)|1971 U.S. Open]]. Two weeks later, he won the [[Canadian Open (golf)|Canadian Open]] (the first of three), and the following week won [[1971 Open Championship|The Open Championship]] (British Open), becoming the first player to win those three titles in the same year. Trevino was awarded the [[Hickok Belt]] as the top professional athlete of 1971. He also won ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's "[[Sportsman of the Year]]"<ref name=side71>{{cite magazine |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1135553/index.htm |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |title=Sportsman of the year: a common man with an uncommon touch |last=Kirkpatrick |first=Curry |date=December 20, 1971 |page=34}}</ref> and was named [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Wide World of Sports (US TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' Athlete of the Year.

In [[1972 Open Championship|1972]] at [[Muirfield]] in [[Scotland]], Trevino became the first player to successfully defend The Open Championship since [[Arnold Palmer]] in [[1962 Open Championship|1962]]. In a remarkable third round at Muirfield, Trevino had five consecutive birdies from the 14th through the 18th, holing a bunker shot on the 16th and sinking a 30–foot chip on the 18th for a round of 66. In the final round, Trevino was tied for the lead on the 17th tee with [[Tony Jacklin]]. Trevino chipped in from rough on the back of the green for a par on the 17th. A shaken Jacklin three-putted the same hole from 15 feet for a bogey. Trevino parred the 18th hole for a final round of 71, winning him the Open by a stroke over Nicklaus, with Jacklin finishing third. Trevino holed out four times from off the greens during the tournament. Nicklaus had won the first two majors of the year and fell just short in the third leg of the [[Grand Slam (golf)|grand slam]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1086330/1/index.htm |magazine=Sports Illustrated |last=Jenkins |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Jenkins |title=Slamming The Door On Jack |date=July 24, 1972}}</ref> After holing his chip shot on the 17th in the final round, Trevino said: "I'm the greatest chipper in the world."<ref>{{cite news |title=Nicklaus Misses Slam As Trevino Wins Open |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BXNJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LAsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=732,3088140&dq=trevino+wins+open&hl=en |accessdate=February 15, 2013 |newspaper=The News and Courier |date=July 16, 1972}}</ref>

In the [[PGA Championship]] in [[1974 PGA Championship|1974]], Trevino won the fifth of his six major championships. He won the title by a stroke, again over Nicklaus, the fourth and final time he was a runner-up in a major to Trevino.

At the [[Western Open]] near [[Chicago]] in [[1975 PGA Tour|1975]], Trevino was [[Lightning strike|struck by lightning]] and suffered injuries to his spine. He underwent surgery to remove a damaged spinal disk, but back problems continued to hamper his play. Nevertheless, he was ranked second in [[McCormack's World Golf Rankings]] in [[1980 PGA Tour|1980]] behind [[Tom Watson (golfer)|Tom Watson]]. Trevino had 3 PGA Tour wins in 1980 and finished runner-up to Tom Watson in the [[1980 Open Championship]]. At the age of 44, Trevino won his sixth and final major at the PGA Championship in [[1984 PGA Championship|1984]], with a 15-under-par score of 273, becoming the first player to shoot all four rounds under 70 in the PGA Championship.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122462/index.htm |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |last=McDermott |first=Barry |title=It's an old man's game after all |date=August 27, 1984 |page=28}}</ref> He was the runner-up the following year in 1985, attempting to become the first repeat champion since [[Denny Shute]] in [[1937 PGA Championship|1937]].

In the early 1980s, Trevino was second on the PGA Tour's career money list, behind only Nicklaus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/stats/stat.110.html#1981 |title=Career Money Leaders – 1981 |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}</ref> From 1968 to 1981 inclusive, Trevino won at least one PGA Tour event a year, a streak of 14 seasons. In addition to his PGA Tour victories, Trevino won more than 20 international and unofficial professional tournaments. He was one of the charismatic stars who was instrumental in making the Senior PGA Tour (now the [[Champions Tour]]) an early success. He claimed 29 senior wins, including four [[senior major golf championships|senior majors]]. He topped the seniors' money list in 1990 and 1992.

From 1983 to 1989 Trevino worked as a [[color analyst]] for PGA Tour coverage on [[PGA Tour on NBC|NBC]] television.

===Boycotts of the Masters tournament===
In the 1989 Masters, at the age of 49, Trevino shot an opening five-under-par round of 67 to become the oldest man ever to lead the field after a round in the tournament. It came despite Trevino's words 20 years earlier, when he said after the 1969 Masters: "Dont talk to me about the Masters. I'm never going to play there again. They can invite me all they want, but I'm not going back. It's just not my type of course."<ref>{{cite news |last=White Jr. |first=Gordon |title=Wind forces high scores in first round of Masters |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19890407&id=1kwsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Vs4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6116,2615881 |accessdate=July 16, 2013 |newspaper=Herald-Journal |date=April 7, 1989}}</ref> Trevino said that he felt uncomfortable with the atmosphere at the Augusta National club and that he disliked the course because his style of play, where he liked to fade shots left to right, was not suited to the course.<ref>{{cite news |last=White Jr. |first=Gordon |title=Trevino, at the Age of 49, Shoots 67 to Lead the Masters |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/07/sports/trevino-at-the-age-of-49-shoots-67-to-lead-the-masters.html |accessdate=July 16, 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 7, 1989}}</ref>

Trevino boycotted the Masters in 1970, 1971 and again in 1974. In 1972, after boycotting the previous two Masters tournaments, he stored his shoes and other items in the trunk of his car, rather than use the locker room facilities in the clubhouse. Trevino complained that had he not qualified as a player, the club would not have let him onto the grounds except through the kitchen. But he later described his boycotts of the Masters as "the greatest mistake I've made in my career" and called Augusta National "the eighth wonder of the world."<ref>{{cite news |last=Downey |first=Mike |title=Like It or Not, Lee Trevino Is Master of the Masters for a Day |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-07/sports/sp-1177_1_lee-trevino |accessdate=July 16, 2013 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=April 7, 1989}}</ref>

After his opening round of 67 in the 1989 Masters, Trevino finished the tournament tied for 18th place. His best finish at the Masters was a tie for 10th place twice: in 1975 and in 1985.

==Playing style==
His self–taught style, distinguished by an out-to-in swing designed to [[Golf stroke mechanics#Secondary characteristics|fade]] the ball (which he devised to combat a chronic [[Golf stroke mechanics#Misplayed shots|hook]]), led to many exciting shots and [[skins game]] victories. He used an open stance and a strong grip, was never a long hitter, but was renowned for his accuracy under pressure, as well as a very creative short game. Trevino never had an instructor or coach, stating he never met one he couldn't beat on the golf course.

==Distinctions and honors==
*Trevino was the first player to shoot all four regulation rounds under par at the U.S. Open. At Oak Hill in 1968, Trevino played rounds of 69-68-69-69.
*A major [[Dual carriageway|avenue]] in [[El Paso, Texas]], was named after him, and streets in Rio Rancho and Belen, New Mexico.
*Trevino played for the United States in the [[Ryder Cup]] six times ([[1969 Ryder Cup|1969]], [[1971 Ryder Cup|1971]], [[1973 Ryder Cup|1973]], [[1975 Ryder Cup|1975]], [[1979 Ryder Cup|1979]], [[1981 Ryder Cup|1981]]), and had an impressive 17–7–6 ({{winning percentage|17|7|6}}) record.

==Humor==
Throughout his career, Trevino was seen as approachable and humorous, and was frequently quoted by the press. Late in his career, he remarked, "I played the tour in 1967 and told jokes and nobody laughed. Then I won the [[U.S. Open (golf)|Open]] the next year, told the same jokes, and everybody laughed like hell."<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1602390142/ |title=The Gigantic Book of Golf Quotations |editor-first=Jim |editor-last=Apfelbaum |year=2007 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |isbn= 978-1-60239-014-0}}</ref>

At the beginning of Trevino's 1971 U.S. Open playoff against Jack Nicklaus, he threw a rubber snake that his daughter had put in his bag as a joke, at Nicklaus, who later admitted that he asked Trevino to throw it to him so he could see it. Trevino grabbed the rubbery object and playfully tossed it at Nicklaus, getting a scream from a nearby woman and a hearty laugh from Nicklaus. Trevino shot a 68 to defeat Nicklaus by three strokes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://usga.usopen.com/history/video.html |title=Memorable Video Vignettes – 1971 |publisher=USGA |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}</ref>

During one tournament, Tony Jacklin, paired with Trevino, said: "Lee, I don't want to talk today." Trevino retorted: "I don't want you to talk. I just want you to listen."<ref>{{cite news |last=Carter|first=Bob |title="Merry Mex" was golf's showman |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Trevino_Lee.html |work=ESPN |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}</ref>

After he was struck by lightning at the 1975 Western Open, Trevino was asked by a reporter what he would do if he were out on the course and it began to storm again. Trevino answered he would take out his 1 iron and point it to the sky, "because not even God can hit the 1-iron."  Trevino said later in an interview with David Feherty that he must have tempted God the week before by staying outside during a lighting delay to entertain the crowds, saying "I deserved to get hit...God can hit a 1-iron".

Trevino has also said: "I've been hit by lightning and been in the Marine Corps for four years. I've traveled the world and been about everywhere you can imagine. There's not anything I'm scared of except my wife."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://golf.about.com/od/leetrevino/p/lee_trevino.htm |title=Lee Trevino |publisher=About.com |first=Brent |last=Kelley |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}</ref> Trevino has called his wife, Claudia, "his rock."  He also credits her with jumpstarting his career again when he considered retiring due to old age, saying "those clubs don't know how old you are."

In Trevino's early career, much attention was given by the press to a plastic "BandAid" he wore on his forearm to cover a tattoo of the name of his ex-wife. He has since had this tattoo removed by a plastic surgeon using a laser technique.

Trevino had a cameo appearance in the [[1996 in film|1996]] comedy ''[[Happy Gilmore]]''.

A '''lower court''' is a court from which an [[Appeal (law)|appeal]] may be taken. In relation to an appeal from one [[court]] to another, the lower court is the court whose decision is being reviewed, which may be the original [[trial court]] or an [[court of appeals|appellate court]] lower in rank than the [[superior court]] which is hearing the appeal.

In an absolute sense, a lower court is always the [[trial court]]; where an appellate court is describing the actions under review from the lower court, it is referring to the court that examined the evidence and testimony directly and made rulings upon it, rather than any intermediate appellate courts. However, a court that functions as a trial court in some instances may still be above another court. Relative to other trial courts, a lower court is a court of limited [[jurisdiction]], especially one that is limited to hearing minor [[offense (law)|offense]]s, or [[civil law (common law)|civil]] [[lawsuit|action]]s involving a limited amount, as distinct from a superior court.

In the United States, most states have two levels of trial courts, and two levels of appellate courts. The jurisdiction of the lower trial court in such jurisdictions is typically restricted to hearing minor claims and trying minor offenses, while the higher court may hear claims without an upper limit on the amount in controversy, and may try all crimes. The higher trial court may also have some power of appellate review over the lower. In Virginia, for example, the lowest level of court is the [[Virginia General District Court]], which can hear claims of up to US$25,000, and can try misdemeanors. Above that court is a second level of trial courts, the [[Virginia Circuit Court]], which may hear claims in excess of US$4,500 and may try certain types of felony cases. The General District Courts do not have [[jury trial]]s at all, but appeals may be taken from a General District Court to the Circuit Court of that jurisdiction, and the appellant may receive a new trial with a jury.

The '''Protestant Union''' or '''Evangelical Union''' ({{lang-de|Protestantische Union}}) was a coalition of [[Protestant]] [[Germany|German]] states that was formed in 1608 by Elector Palatine Frederick IV to defend the rights, lands and person of each member.

It was formed after the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and Duke [[Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria|Maximilian I]] of [[Bavaria]] reestablished [[Roman Catholic]]ism in [[Donauwörth]] in 1607 and after a majority of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] had decided in 1608 that the renewal of the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555 should be conditional upon the restoration of all church land appropriated since 1552. The Protestant Princes met in [[Auhausen]], near [[Nördlingen]] and on May 14, 1608, formed a military league under the leadership of [[Frederick IV, Elector Palatine|Frederick IV]] of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]. In response, the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]] was formed in the following year, headed by Duke Maximilian of Bavaria.

Members of the Protestant Union included the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]], [[Anhalt]], [[Palatinate-Neuburg|Neuburg]], [[Duchy of Württemberg|Württemberg]], [[Baden-Durlach]], [[Ansbach]], [[Bayreuth]], [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], [[Brandenburg]], [[Ulm]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Nuremberg]].

The Protestant Union was weakened from the start by the non-participation of several powerful Protestant rulers, such as the [[Elector of Saxony]]. The Union was also beset by internal strife between its [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinist]] members.

In 1619 [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] (successor to [[Frederick IV, Elector Palatine|Frederick IV]]) accepted the crown of [[Bohemia]], and in 1620 the Protestant Union signed the [[Treaty of Ulm (1620)|Treaty of Ulm]], declining to support him. In January 1621, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] imposed the [[Imperial ban|Ban of the Empire]] upon Frederick V and gave his electorate and the Upper Palatinate to Maximilian. The Protestant Union met in [[Heilbronn]] in February and formally protested the actions of Ferdinand. Ferdinand ignored this complaint and ordered the Protestant Union to disband its army. In May, under the [[Mainz Accord]], the members of the Protestant Union complied with Ferdinand's demand and, on 24 May 1621, formally dissolved the Protestant Union.

The Protestant Union developed in order to resist all hierarchic and un-Protestant tendencies within the different churches, and the preservation of the rights, honor, and liberty of German Protestantism. The Union also strove to maintain the Christian respect among the various denominations and their members. [http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc09/htm/iv.v.xlvi.htm]

==Bohemian Revolt==
The Protestant Union became very active during the early 1600s following the election of Ferdinand II to the crown. The letter of Majesty had guaranteed the rights of Protestants, among them religious freedom. However, it was ambiguous on one point: whether lands of the Catholic Church were held from the King. If they were, then Protestants could build churches and worship freely on these crown lands; if not, then the Catholic landholder could prohibit Protestantism on his ecclesiastical property. But in 1617 the ecclesiastical rulers of Broumov and Hroby took over or destroyed Protestant churches and forbid further heretical worship. This angered the Protestant Union and so they defiantly assembled in Prague on May 23, 1618 and went into the chamber of four Catholic Lord Regents in what is known as the [[Second Defenestration of Prague]]. This was a key point in the Protestant Union because it was a time when they were defiant of the Emperor in order to preserve the Protestant rights they had received in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] and in the Letter to Majesty.[http://www.pipeline.com/~cwa/Bohemian_Phase.htm]

==Guidelines of the Protestant Union==
Wanting to strengthen the peace given by the [[Peace of Augsburg]], Protestants formed a Union in order to advance their well-being, land, and people. Within this union, the Protestant leaders created guidelines and agreements to live by as follows:
#Each member shall keep in good faith with the order and their heirs, land and people, and no one shall enter into any other alliance.
#Each member of the union should keep a secret correspondence effectively to inform each other of all dangerous and offensive affairs which may threaten each other's heirs, land and people, and to this purpose each will keep in good contact with one another.
#Whenever important matters arise that concern the well-being of the union, the members of the union will help each other with faithful advice in order to uphold each and every one as much as possible.
#The wish of the union in matters concerning the liberties and high jurisdictions of the German Electors and Estates should be presented and pressed at subsequent Imperial and Imperial Circle assemblies, and not merely left to secret correspondence with each other.
#The union shall not affect our disagreement on several points of religion, but that notwithstanding these, we have agreed to support each other.  No member is to allow an attack on any other in books or through the pulpit, nor give cause for any breach of the peace, while at the same time leaving untouched the theologian's rights of disputation to affirm the word of God.
#If one of the members of the union is attacked, the remaining members of the union shall immediately come to his aid with all the resources of the union. [http://www.oocities.org/athens/sparta/5414/ProtestantUnion.htm]

==Key Dates==
*1555: The Peace of Augsburg was signed by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and Lutheran Princes. This treaty allowed Roman Catholic and Lutheran Princes the right to decide which freedom their respective state would be under. However, it did not recognize Calvinist people and so many of the Protestant people were still in danger under this new treaty.
*1608: Protestant Princes formed the alliance known as Protestant Union.
*1609: The Catholic League was created after the creation of the Protestant Union
*1609: Emperor [[Rudolph II]] passed the Letter of Majesty, which granted freedoms of religion to nobles.
*1612: Matthias became Holy Roman Emperor. However, he was childless, so he passed his crown onto his cousin, Ferdinand of Styria.
*1617: Ferdinand II was elected King of Bohemia and then later elected Holy Roman Emperor.

'''Uloboridae''', the '''cribellate orb weavers''' or '''hackled orb weavers''', is a [[family (biology)|family]] of non-[[venom (poison)|venomous]] [[spider]]s. Their lack of venom glands is a secondarily evolved trait. Instead, they kill their prey by crushing with over 140 metres of thread.

All members of this family produce a feathery, fuzzy [[spider silk|silk]] called [[cribellate]] (or hackled) silk.<ref name=CoddingtonLevy1991>{{Cite journal |author=Jonathan A. Coddington & Herbert W. Levi |year=1991 |title=Systematics and evolution of spiders (Araneae) |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics]] |volume=22 |pages=565–592 |jstor=2097274 |url=http://afec-x.ecologicalevolution.org/files/readings/CoddingtonLevi1991SystematicsEvolutionSpiders.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.22.1.565}}</ref> These spiders do not use an adhesive on their orb [[spider web|web]]s, but rather the very fine fibers on each strand of silk tend to ensnare prey. Uloboridae webs often have a [[web decorations|stabilimentum]] or zig-zag pattern through the center.

==Distribution==
This family has an almost worldwide distribution.
There are only two species known from northern Europe: ''[[Uloborus walckenaerius]]'' and ''[[Hyptiotes paradoxus]]''. Similarly occurring solely in northern North America (e.g. [[southern Ontario]]) is ''[[Uloborus glomosus]]''.

'''Internaut''' is a term for a designer, operator, or technically capable user of the [[Internet]].<ref>[http://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml A Brief History of the Internet] from the Internet Society</ref>  Beginning with participants in the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), it gradually expanded to members of the [[Internet Society]] (ISoc) and the larger community.

The Internaut day is celebrated on August 23, anniversary of the [[WWW]] - World Wide Web, which was developed in the [[CERN]] laboratories (Enquire / EV project) in Switzerland during 1989 - 1990, and opened to new users after that day in 1991.<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.hypertext/msg/395f282a67a1916c "Short summary of the World Wide Web project"]</ref>{{failed verification|date=January 2014}}

The WWW creation by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] enabled non-technical computer experts to use the Internet in a simple and quick way, making it accessible to billions of people around the world: the internauts.<ref>[http://blog.lib.uiowa.edu/hardinmd/2010/11/24/inventing-the-web-tim-berners-lees-1990-christmas-baby/ "Inventing the Web: Tim Berners-Lee’s 1990 Christmas Baby"] Seeing the Picture.</ref>{{failed verification|date=January 2014}}

In [[French language|French]], "un(e) internaute" is the standard word for any user of the internet.<ref>[http://www.insee.fr/fr/methodes/default.asp?page=definitions/internaute.htm] Insee - Définitions et Méthodes - Internaute</ref>

==Analogous terms==
An internaut is [[Internet slang|cyber-slang]] for an online veteran who is familiar with the Internet as an entity, and with cyberspace in general. The word is a portmanteau of ''Internet'' and ''astronaut''.  Other terms roughly analogous with internaut are ''cybernaut'' and ''netizen'', though each has its own connotation.  The common thread among them, however, is an implication of experience and knowledge of the Internet or cyberspace that goes beyond the casual user.

==Internet experience==
An internaut is online savvy, normally through years of online experience, with a thorough knowledge of how to use search engines and search strings, Internet resources, forums, newsgroups and chat rooms to find information. The more someone knows about the Internet, its history and politics, the more likely the term ''internaut'' fits them. The less he or she knows the more likely a different term would be more fitting.

The '''[[Flag]] of the [[State of Michigan]]''' depicts the state's [[coat-of-arms]] on a dark blue field, as set forth by Michigan state law.<ref name="MCL 209">[http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(xsplfn311t0tbe45nqbnaibg))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Act-209-of-1911 Act 209 of 1911 Coat-of-Arms and State Flag] in Michigan Compiled Laws</ref> (The [[Governor of Michigan|Governor]] has a variant of the flag with a white instead of blue field.<ref name="MCL 209"/>)

==Design==

The state coat of arms depicts a light blue shield, upon which the [[sun]] rises over a [[lake]] and [[peninsula]], and a [[man]] with raised hand representing peace and holding a long gun representing our fight for state and nation as a frontier state.<ref>[http://michigan.gov/sos/0%2C1607%2C7-127-1638_8731-22823--%2C00.html History of the Great Seal]</ref>

As supporters, the [[elk]] and [[moose]] are derived from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] coat of arms, and depict great animals of Michigan. The [[bald eagle]] represents the [[United States]] which formed the State of Michigan from the [[Northwest Territory]].<ref name=netstate>[http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/flags/mi_flag.htm www.netstate.com]</ref>

The design features three [[Latin]] mottos. From top-to-bottom they are:
#On red ribbon: "[[E Pluribus Unum]]," means "Out of many, one," a motto of the United States.
#On light blue shield: "Tuebor," means "I will defend."
#On white ribbon: "Si Quæris Peninsulam Amœnam Circumspice," means "If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look about you." (The official state motto).

==History==
The present flag, adopted in 1911, is the third state flag. The first flag featured a portrait of Michigan's first governor, [[Stevens T. Mason]], on one side and the state coat of arms and "a soldier and a lady" on the other side. The second flag, adopted in 1865, displayed the state coat of arms on one side and the United States coat of arms on the other.<ref name="netstate"/>

==Pledge==
Michigan's pledge of allegiance to the state flag was written by Harold G. Coburn and was officially adopted as Public Act 165 of 1972.<ref name="MCL 165">[http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(xsplfn311t0tbe45nqbnaibg))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Act-209-of-1911 Act 165 of 1972 Pledge to State Flag] in Michigan Compiled Laws</ref>
{{cquote|I pledge allegiance to the flag of Michigan, and to the state for which it stands, two beautiful peninsulas united by a [[Mackinac Bridge|bridge of steel]], where equal opportunity and justice to all is our ideal.}}

==Rating==
The [[North American Vexillological Association]] (NAVA), in its 2001 survey of [[U.S. state]], [[US Territory]] and [[Provinces of Canada|Canadian provincial]] flags rated the current Michigan flag 59th out of 72 flags evaluated; it was given an average score of just 3.46 out of a possible 10 points.<ref>[http://www.nava.org/flag-design/survey/state-provincial-survey-2001 www.nava.org] North American Vexilological Association.</ref>
