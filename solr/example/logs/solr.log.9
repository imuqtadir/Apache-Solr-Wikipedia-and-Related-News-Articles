'''GY Andromedae''' (GY And) is an [[Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variable|?<sup>2</sup> Canum Venaticorum type]] [[variable star]] in the northern [[constellation]] [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]. Its brightness fluctuates in [[visual magnitude]] between 6.27<sup>m</sup> and 6.41<sup>m</sup>, making it a challenge to view with the naked eye even in [[Bortle Dark-Sky Scale|good seeing conditions]]. The [[stellar magnetic field|magnetic activity]] on this star shows an unusually long period of variability, cycling about once every 23 years.<ref name=aaas114_79/> Based upon [[parallax]] measurements, this star is located at a distance of about {{Convert|520|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} from the [[Earth]].<ref name=aaa474_2_653/>

This is [[stellar classification|classified]] as an [[Ap and Bp stars|Ap/Bp star]], with a [[peculiar star|peculiar spectrum]]<ref name=aaas114_79/> showing [[spectral line|lines]] of [[chromium]] and [[europium]] that change in intensity over a period matching the variability cycle, although opposite in [[Phase (waves)|phase]].<ref name=apj160_1071/> Its most striking characteristic is the presence of the unstable element [[promethium]] in its [[emission spectrum]]. All isotopes of this element are [[radioactive]] with [[Half-life|half lives]] of 17.7 years or less. The promethium in the outer envelope may be generated by the spontaneous [[nuclear fission|fission]] of higher mass [[transuranic element]]s.<ref name=apj181_475/>

In 1958, American astronomer [[Horace W. Babcock]] discovered that this is a [[spectroscopic binary]] star. It has an orbital period of 273 days with a large [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] of 0.47. The two components are separated by an estimated distance of at least {{nowrap|3.74 × 10<sup>7</sup> km}}, or 0.25 [[Astronomical Unit]]s.<ref name=an299_2_81/>

'''Henry Massey Rector''' (May 1, 1816 – August 12, 1899) was an American politician and the [[List of Governors of Arkansas|sixth]] [[Governor of Arkansas|Governor]] of [[Arkansas]].

==Biography==
Rector was born at Fontaine's Ferry{{where|date=July 2014}} near [[Louisville, Kentucky]].  Both his parents were of [[English American|English]] descent.<ref>Biographical and pictorial history of Arkansas, Volume 1  By John Hallum page 405</ref> Rector was educated by his mother and attended two years of school in Louisville. He moved to Arkansas in 1835.  Rector served as [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] after moving to Arkansas.

==Career==
Rector was elected to the Arkansas Senate and served in that body from 1848 to 1850.  He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1854. From 1853 to 1857, he served as U.S. Surveyor-General of Arkansas for several years.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=119|title= Henry Massie Rector (1816–1899) |publisher= The Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture |accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> From 1855 to 1859, he served in the Arkansas House of Representatives. and spent one term as a justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_arkansas/col2-content/main-content-list/title_rector_henry.html|title=Arkansas Governor Henry Massey Rector|publisher= National Governors Association|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref>

Rector was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1860.  During his term Arkansas [[secession|seceded]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and was admitted to the [[Confederate States of America]].  The constitution of Arkansas was rewritten reducing the term of office for Governor to two years.  Rector left office in 1862 and served as a private in the state [[militia]] for the rest of the war.  Rector participated in the 1874 constitutional convention.

==Family life==
Rector was the first cousin of Representative [[Henry Wharton Conway]], Governor [[James Sevier Conway]] and Governor [[Elias Nelson Conway]]. Rector was also a third cousin of General [[James Lawson Kemper]]. He was a first cousin of fellow Confederate general [[Alexander E. Steen]].

His grandson, [[James Rector (athlete)|James Rector]], was the first Arkansan to participate in the [[Olympic Games]].  His son, Colonel Elias W. Rector, ran for Governor of Arkansas twice and served in the Arkansas House of Representatives for several terms, served as Speaker of the House, and married the daughter of Senator [[James Lusk Alcorn]] of [[Mississippi]].

==Death and legacy==
Henry Massey Rector died in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] and is buried in Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=10401 |title= Henry Massie Rector|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref>

Rector Street in Little Rock is named after him. The north-bound frontage road along [[Interstate 30]] bears his name. The northeast Arkansas town of [[Rector, Arkansas|Rector]] is named for Rector.

'''Elias Nelson Conway''' (May 17, 1812{{spaced ndash}}February 28, 1892) was an American politician and [[List of Governors of Arkansas|fifth]] [[Governor of Arkansas|governor]] of [[Arkansas]].

==Biography==
Conway was born in [[Greeneville, Tennessee]]. Born into a political family, Elias Nelson Conway was the younger brother of [[Henry Wharton Conway]], who served as territorial delegate to several Congresses, and [[James Sevier Conway]], who became the first governor of Arkansas when it was admitted as a state in 1836.

When he was a boy, his family moved from Tennessee to [[Missouri]]. Conway attended Bonne Femme Academy in [[Boone County, Missouri]]. His older brother Henry died in 1827 as a result of a duel with a former friend, [[Robert Crittenden]].

In 1833, Conway moved to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], where his older brothers had settled. He studied surveying. In 1835, he was appointed as the state auditor, and served until 1849.

==Career==
In 1844, Elias Conway was offered, and declined, the Democratic nomination for Governor. When offered the nomination again in 1852, he accepted. With a successful campaign, he was elected as Governor of Arkansas. He was reelected to a second term in 1856.

His administration focused on physical improvements to the state: roads and other infrastructure to encourage development. He formed the Chancery Courts and eased the state's financial problems. When Conway left office in 1860, the state treasury held a surplus.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_arkansas/col2-content/main-content-list/title_conway_elias.html|title= Arkansas Governor Elias Nelson Conway |publisher=National Governors Association|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref>

[[Image:Natstep1.jpg|left|thumb|Drawn in 1859 by David Dale Owen of the Natural Steps]]
Conway ordered [[David Dale Owen]] to survey the territory west of [[Little Rock]]. He commissioned a report on the area. The [[Natural Steps, Arkansas|Natural Steps]], were first written about and drawn by David Dale Owen (Principal Geologist)in his ''Second Report of a Geological Reconnaissance of the Middle and Southern Counties of Arkansas (1859).''

==Family life==
Conway was first cousin to Senator [[Ambrose Hundley Sevier]] and Governor [[Henry Massey Rector]].

==Death==
After Conway retired from public life, he became somewhat of a recluse. Conway is buried at the historic [[Mount Holly Cemetery]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=9756 |title= Elias Nelson Conway|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref>

[[Washington, D.C.]] has been home to many prominent musicians and is particularly known for the musical genres of [[Washington, D.C. hardcore|hardcore punk]], house dance, [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and a local [[funk]] genre called [[go-go]].  The first major musical figure from D.C. was [[John Philip Sousa]], a military brass band composer.  Later figures include [[jazz]] musicians such as [[Duke Ellington]] and [[soul music|soul]] singers including [[Roberta Flack]].

The city is home to the [[Washington Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Washington National Opera]], the [[National Symphony Orchestra (United States)|National Symphony Orchestra]] (founded in 1931 by [[Hans Kindler]]), and the [[DC Youth Orchestra Program]], (founded in 1960).  The [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] is a nationally important venue for a variety of musical performances, many of which are presented by Washington Performing Arts Society, an independent, non-profit organization founded by impresario Patrick Hayes.  ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'' magazine maintains a [[Washington Music Hall of Fame]].  

The [[United States Marine Band]], and [[United States Navy Band]] are both based in Washington, D.C. The Marine Band is the oldest musical group in the United States (formed in 1798, before the city's founding).  The U.S. Marine Band's most famous conductor is undoubtedly [[John Philip Sousa]], who composed many of the most famous [[United States|American]] marches, as well as several musical comedies. The U.S. Navy Band's director throughout the 1960s was LCDR Anthony A. Mitchell who composed the march ''Our Nation's Capital'', the official march of Washington D.C.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navyband.navy.mil/alum_hist_former_leaders.shtml |title=Former Leaders and Officers |publisher=Navyband.navy.mil |date= |accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref> as well as the ''John F. Kennedy Cultural Center March'', and the ''National Capitol Parks March''.

==Music history==
[[Image:JohnPhilipSousa-Chickering.LOC.jpg|thumb|left|150px|John Philip Sousa (1900)]]
The earliest music of Washington, D.C. can be traced to the 1798 foundation of the [[United States Marine Band|U.S. Marine Band]].  Some fifty years later, in 1851, the city's first choral society, [[Washington Saengerbund]], was formed.  Other 19th century musicians included the [[minstrel]] singer and songwriter [[James A. Bland|James Bland]] ("[[Carry Me Back to Ole Virginny]]").  In 1872, the [[Coloured American Opera Society]] formed. 

Washington native [[John Philip Sousa]] was conductor of the U.S. Marine Band from 1880 to 1892. He wrote 132 [[March (music)|marches]] including "[[The Washington Post (march)|The Washington Post]]" and "[[Stars and Stripes Forever]]". Sousa formed his own band after leaving the Marine Corps that performed 15,623 concerts worldwide.

[[Image:Richard Nixon and Duke Ellington 1969.jpg|thumb|Duke Ellington receiving the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1969]]
Later groundbreaking musicians included [[James Reese Europe]], [[ragtime]] musician [[Claude Hopkins]], [[Lithuania]]n immigrant and [[vaudeville]] performer [[Al Jolson]] and [[Lillian Evans Tibbs]], who became the first African-American opera singer to perform in a foreign country.  The most widely renowned musician from 20th century D.C. is undoubtedly [[Duke Ellington]], a [[jazz]] pioneer.  Later D.C. jazz musicians included [[Charlie Rouse]] ([[saxophone|saxophonist]], with [[Thelonious Monk]]), [[Billy Hart]] (drummer), [[Ira Sullivan]] (tenor saxophonist) and [[Leo Parker]] ([[Bebop|bop]] baritone saxophonist). [[Ahmet Ertegün]], a [[Turkey|Turkish]]-born jazz fan, came to D.C. at age twelve and later went on to found [[Atlantic Records]].  [[Todd Duncan]] was a D.C.-born singer who made history by being the first to play the lead of the opera ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''; he later became the first black man to play Tonio in ''[[I Pagliacci]]''. D.C. was also a home (and recording stop) for [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and [[Bo Diddley]]. Local stars of the early part of the century include the singer [[Pearl Bailey]].

In 1957, [[Elizabeth Cotten]] recorded for the family that employed her, which included a number of composers and musicologists.  One song, "[[Freight Train (song)|Freight Train]]", became a folk music standard.  [[Charlie Byrd]], a D.C.-based jazz musician, recorded an innovative album in 1962 called ''[[Jazz Samba]]'' with [[Stan Getz]], helping to launch the [[bossa nova]] craze. By the middle of the 1960s, D.C. had begun to produce some major stars, like [[soul music|soul]] singer [[Marvin Gaye]].  Other musicians included [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]], one of the first "folk" musicians to gain national appeal, [[Peter Tork]] (of [[The Monkees]]), [[Tim Buckley]], guitarist [[Link Wray]], pop singer and songwriter [[Billy Stewart]], country singer [[Patsy Cline]], guitarist [[Danny Gatton]], [[doo wop]] bands [[The Orioles]] (based out of D.C., though from Baltimore), [[Boa (Washington, DC band)|Boa]] with [[Churchwand]], [[Clowns]] and [[Take Me Back]]{{dn|date=April 2014}}. [[The Clovers]], [[Scott McKenzie]] (known for "If You're Going to San Francisco"), [[Sinbad]], with [[Vince Santoro and vocalist Danny Goers]], [[R&B]] singer [[Ruth Brown]], and country star [[Roy Clark]]. 

During this period, Washington began to develop its own music scene, with a number of styles evolving by the end of the century. Some popular singers from later decades include [[Roberta Flack]] ("[[Killing Me Softly with His Song]]"), [[Root Boy Slim]] & the Sex Change Band ("You Broke My Mood Ring"), [[singer-songwriter]] [[Tori Amos]], [[Herb Fame]] (of [[Peaches & Herb]]), [[Van McCoy]] ([[disco]] producer, "[[The Hustle (song)|The Hustle]]"), [[Toni Braxton]], [[Ginuwine]], [[Mýa]], [[Dave Grohl]] (of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and the [[Foo Fighters]]), [[Starland Vocal Band]] ("[[Afternoon Delight (song)|Afternoon Delight]]"), [[Joan Jett]] (rock singer) and [[Nils Lofgren]] (guitarist for [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Neil Young]]).

Washington is also home to the [[Duke Ellington School of the Arts]], founded in 1974 and part of the [[District of Columbia Public Schools|DC public school system]].  Some other notable music education organizations which are located in Washington include the [[DC Youth Orchestra Program]], founded in 1960; the [[Blues Alley Jazz Society]], founded in 1985; and the [[Levine School of Music]], founded in 1976.

==Musical genres==
===Opera===
The first established opera company in D.C. was the semi-professional [[Washington National Opera (1919–1936)|Washington National Opera]] active from 1919 through 1936; it performed in venues ranging from local school auditoriums to DAR Constitution Hall.<ref name=meek>McPherson, Jim, "Mr. Meek Goes to Washington: The Story of the Small-Potatoes Canadian Baritone Who Founded America’s 'National' Opera," ''The Opera Quarterly,'' volume 20, no. 2, Spring 2004.</ref>  The present, entirely unrelated [[Washington National Opera|company of the same name]], resident at the Kennedy Center, was known simply as the Washington Opera until 2000; a thoroughly professional organization under the direction of [[Plácido Domingo]], it has, among other achievements, been a rare advocate for [[zarzuela]] in the United States.<ref name=zarzuela>Holland, Bernard, "NATIONAL OPERA REVIEW; Domingo Applies His Personal Touch to an Operetta's Familiar Tale," ''The Washington Post'', November 9, 2004.</ref>  Among other, smaller-scale companies in the D.C. metropolitan area are the [[Washington Concert Opera]], which specializes in unstaged presentations; [[Opera Lafayette]], which specializes in French baroque opera; and [http://www.auroraopera.org Aurora Opera Theatre], formerly known as  [http://www.novaopera.org Opera Theatre of Northern Virginia].

===Blues===
Early in the 20th century, D.C. was home to many bluesmen, such as [[Jelly Roll Morton]] and later rock and roll and [[rhythm and blues]] musicians such as [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Roy Buchanan]].  In the 1960s, a number of white youths formed local blues bands, including the [[Northside Blues Band]] and the [[The Nighthawks|Nighthawks]].  Starting in the early 1960s, [[Takoma Park]] native [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]] became a nationally noted blues and folk guitarist who established the [[Takoma Records]] label, which attracted a number of other blues, folk, acoustic and [[fingerstyle guitar]]ists to the Washington, D.C. area. Another local [[blues rock]] performer is [[Tom Principato]].<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|author=Richard Skelly |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tom-principato-mn0000514024/biography |title=Tom Principato &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>

===Bluegrass===
In the 1950s, [[Buzz Busby and the Bayou Boys]] became a noted [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band that helped D.C. become known as the "Bluegrass Capital of America" in the 1950s and early 1960s.  Later bluegrass bands from the city included the [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]].  [[Seldom Scene]] eventually became the city's most prominent and longest-lasting bluegrass band.  The Washington bluegrass community extends into outlying areas such as Western Maryland and the panhandle of [[West Virginia]] which are home to bluegrass musicians who commute to perform in the area.  There has been substantial overlap between Washington, D.C.'s [[Music of Washington, D.C.#Folk|folk]] and bluegrass scene in the past several decades, in part due to the patronage of [[disc jockey]]s at public radio station [[WAMU]], including [[Mary Cliff]], longtime host of the music show ''Traditions''.

===Folk===
In 1961, the first major folk venue in D.C., The Shadows, opened in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]].  A band called "the Mugwumps" formed, eventually splitting up.  Two of the members, [[John Sebastian]] and [[Zal Yanovsky]], became [[The Lovin' Spoonful]], and the other two, [[Denny Doherty]] and [[Cass Elliott]], formed [[The Mamas & the Papas]].  Later, in Georgetown, then-folk singer [[John Denver]], [[Taffy Nivert]] and [[Bill Danoff]] wrote a song called "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]", which launched Denver's career as one of the most popular singers in the country.  Other popular folk singers include [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]]; the duo [[Cathy Fink & Marcy Marxer]] have been nominated for several Grammy Awards, for both folk and children's music.

===Jazz===
Washington has been home to many jazz pioneers, perhaps none better known than [[Duke Ellington]], but also singer and pianist [[Shirley Horn]], pianist [[Billy Taylor]], and saxophonist [[Frank Wess]]. Ellington, Taylor and Wess each attended [[Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.)|Dunbar High School]] with its prominent music program. Ellington's first group, The Washingtonians, featured drummer [[Sonny Greer]]. They left for [[Harlem]] in 1923.<ref name="NPR">{{cite web |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |title=''Jazz Profiles'' from NPR: Jazzed in D.C. |first=Molly |last=Murphy |url=http://www.npr.org/programs/jazzprofiles/archive/jazzindc.html |accessdate=2008-08-29 }}</ref> Jazz great [[Jelly Roll Morton]] came from [[New Orleans]], but took up residency in Washington as a regular performer at a club called the Jungle Inn in 1935.<ref name="NPR" />

During the first half of the 20th century, Washington's [[U Street]] NW corridor (in what is now known as the [[Shaw, Washington, D.C.|Shaw]] neighborhood) first became known as a jazz haven. Historic jazz club [[Bohemian Caverns]] launched many music careers, including that of R&B singer [[Ruth Brown]]. Pianist [[Ramsey Lewis]] recorded his ''[[The In Crowd (1965 album)|The In Crowd]]'' album there in 1965. During the second half of the 20th century until the mid-1990s, a period that saw decline on U Street, jazz became associated with long time venues in the [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] area such as [[Blues Alley]] and One Step Down; closer to the heart of the city was dc space. Subsequently, jazz saw a resurgence on U Street, with venues such as Bohemian Caverns and [[Republic Gardens]] re-opening.

Local singer [[Eva Cassidy]], a native of [[Bowie, Maryland]], died of cancer at the age of 33 but received posthumous international fame when several of her songs received [[BBC Radio]] airplay, though she was already well known in the Washington area, after a farewell concert at [[The Bayou]].<ref>{{cite news |work=[[Baltimore Sun]] |first=Mary |last=Johnson |title=A voice silenced in 1996 is brought back to life |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/annearundel/bal-ar.eva28aug28,0,7544971.story |date=August 28, 2008 }}</ref> A singer in multiple genres, Cassidy also notably performed a crossover album with D.C. [[go-go]] artist [[Chuck Brown]] (see below).

Multi-instrumentalist [[Andrew White (saxophonist)|Andrew White]] has been performing and releasing records in DC since his debut record in 1961, The JFK Quintet, who released two monumental LPs on [[Riverside Records]] for [[Cannonball Adderley]].  Since then he has continued releasing albums, books, transcripts, and other publications for his self-produced label, Andrew's Music.

Tenor saxophonist [[Ron Holloway]] is a [[Washington, D.C.]] native. He spent his journeyman years sitting in with local groups from every genre of contemporary music. In the mid-1970s, Holloway expanded his practice of sitting in and more and more he was heard sharing the stage with the likes of [[Freddie Hubbard]], [[Sonny Rollins]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]]. In February 1982 Holloway joined [[Gil Scott-Heron]]'s group. In June 1989, he left Scott-Heron to join Dizzy Gillespie's Quintet. Known for his versatility he has toured and recorded with a wide array of musical artists including Gillespie, Scott-Heron, [[Root Boy Slim]], [[Little Feat]], [[the Allman Brothers Band]], [[Gov't Mule]], [[Derek Trucks]] and [[Susan Tedeschi]]. He has released five CD's under his own name.

===Soul and funk===
Washington D.C.'s Soul/Funk movement took shape during the mid 60s; about the same time the Doo-Wop craze came to a close, and "James Brown" became a household name. Artists such as [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Roberta Flack]], Peaches & Herb, [[Sir Joe Quarterman]], Black Heat, The Blackbyrds, the Soul Searchers & the [[Young Senators]] (both known for their later go-go influences), impacted more than just the regional scene. Lesser known groups such as Brute, Aggression, 95th Congress, and Scacy and The Sound Service, topped the ever growing club circuit. Local venues such as the Howard Theatre, The Mark IV, and The Room, were known for hosting Soul and Funk bands on the regular. Monumental D.C. Soul Labels included [[Shrine]] and Cap City.  Parliament's 1975 song "Chocolate City," with vocals spoken by George Clinton, references and celebrates Washington, D.C. as a majority black city.

===R&B===
The soul and funk scene set the stage for D.C.'s considerable influence in modern R&B. Besides Toni Braxton, D.C. is the hometown of mid-1990s crooners [[Ginuwine]], [[Mýa]], and Tank (raised in Clinton, MD), as well as the more current J. Holiday, [[Raheem DeVaughn]] and [[Reesa Renee]] (who are both from the neighboring Prince George's County, Maryland).  Central Heat, an East Coast touring R&B band based out of Northern Virginia originated in the late 1970s and features founding members Doug and Dennis Flynn, Mike Cavaliere and Bob Costlow.  Central Heat remains active in the DC club scene today.

===Go-go===
{{main|Go-go}}
The go-go sound developed during the mid-1970s and began to take its current shape by the late '70s, and has become known as D.C.'s answer to [[hip-hop]]. Its characteristic formula combined simple [[funk]] grooves with instrumental percussion and often [[rapping]]. It is a blend of [[funk]], [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[old-school hip-hop|early hip-hop]], with a focus on [[lo-fi]] percussion instruments and melodic [[jam band|jamming]] in place of dance tracks, although some [[sampling (music)|sampling]] is used. As such, it is primarily a dance music with an emphasis on live audience [[call and response]]. Go-go rhythms are also incorporated into street percussion. Many Washington, D.C. soul & funk artists contributed to the characteristic go-go sound, but the main pioneers were The Young Senators, also known as "The Emperors of Go-go", known for their hit tune "Jungle", and [[Chuck Brown]] & [[the Soul Searchers]], known for "[[Bustin' Loose (Part 1)|Bustin' Loose]]", which became a surprise national hit.  Later go-go bands include [[Rare Essence]], [[Trouble Funk]], [[Experience Unlimited]], and [[New Entertainment]] and the Southeast go-go band Aggressive Funk. Bands such as Backyard, TCB, and UCB have gained recognition by being featured in music by rapper, Wale.

Washington is primarily known in the [[rock music|rock]] community for its seminal influence on the evolution of [[hardcore punk]], known locally as [[Washington, D.C. hardcore|harDCore]], particularly through bands such as [[Bad Brains]], [[Minor Threat]] and [[The Faith (American band)|The Faith]], and labels like [[Dischord Records]], but it had a vibrant musical community prior to hardcore's arrival with bands like the [[Razz (band)|Razz]], [[Slickee Boys]] and [[The Penetrators]], putting out records on local independent labels like [[Limp Records|Limp]], O'Rourke, and [[Dacoit (record label)|Dacoit]]. [[Ian MacKaye]], the frontman for Minor Threat, became an inspiration in part for the international [[Straight Edge]] movement, after the song "Straight Edge" was released. MacKaye went on to co-found [[Fugazi]], which attained international recognition under the Dischord record label, alongside [[Rites of Spring]] guitarist [[Guy Picciotto]].  [[Henry Rollins]], a native of the D.C. hardcore scene, moved to [[Los Angeles]] in 1981 to join [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]].

===Emo===
{{main|Emo (music)}}
In the mid-1980s, veterans of the [[Washington, D.C. hardcore|D.C. hardcore]] scene created a new punk subgenre called "[[emo]]", meaning "emotive hardcore." This term has since evolved to become associated with a much broader group of musical styles. The most renowned D.C. area bands associated with the "first wave" of emo were [[Rites of Spring]] and [[Embrace (U.S. band)|Embrace]].

===Punk===
In the 1980s, Washington, D.C., was rich with [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[new wave music]].  Bands like The Slickee Boys, Urban Verbs, Tiny Desk Unit, Mother May I, Insect Surfers, [[Tru Fax & the Insaniacs]], and Black Market Baby were popular at places like the [[9:30 Club]], The Psychedeli, dc space, [[Madam's Organ]], [[The Bayou]] (in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]]).  See also: [[Bad Brains]], [[Minor Threat]], [[Henry Rollins]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] had a diverse live music scene, and became known as a center for the early punk community. In the 1990s, [[U Street]] NW in the [[Shaw, Washington, D.C.|Shaw]] neighborhood became known as a new haven for [[post-hardcore|post-hardcore punk]], [[alternative rock]], [[acid jazz]] and [[electronica]], following the establishment of a variety of bars and clubs in the area, most notably [[The Black Cat (nightclub)|The Black Cat]] (which was co-founded by [[Dave Grohl]], another native of the [[Washington, D.C. hardcore|DC punk]] scene). The 9:30 club subsequently moved to the area as well.

===Post-hardcore===
{{main|Post-hardcore}}
In the 1990s, bands taking heavy influence from the [[Washington, D.C. hardcore]] scene and the local [[go-go]] phenomenon contributed to the [[post-hardcore]] scene. Important players in this scene were [[The Dismemberment Plan]], [[Fugazi]], [[Nation of Ulysses]], and [[Q and Not U]]. Currently, important post-punk/indie/dance-rock bands like [[Supersystem]] (formerly El Guapo), [[Medications]], [[Metrorail (band)|Metrorail]], [[Maritime (band)|Maritime]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Mass Movement of the Moth]], [http://thefordists.bandcamp.com The Fordists], and [[Beauty Pill]] hail from DC.  [[Ian MacKaye]] continues his involvement in the DC music scene with his two-piece rock group [[The Evens]]. Record labels like [[Dischord]], [[DeSoto Records]], [[Exotic Fever]], and [http://www.amorylucha.org Amor Y Lucha] have been and remain to be a crucial means of distribution for DC bands.

===Hip hop===
The DC hip hop scene has always taken a back seat to the other more prevalent genres in the area. Even so, influential groups have planted seeds in the city for future generations to follow. Groups like The Amphibians & Freestyle Union laid the foundation for artists like  [[Asheru]], [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]] and [[Low Budget (collective)|Low Budget]] to help put DC's hip hop scene on the map.  Wale was the first D.C. artist to really break out on the national scene.  He was a member of [[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'s 2009 Freshman Class and released his debut album, [[Attention Deficit (album)|Attention Deficit]] on [[Interscope Records]].  Representing the street oriented side of hip hop, D.C.-bred rapper [http://www.garveythechosenone.com Garvey “The Chosen One”] released his debut album [http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/hard-hat-area-volume-1/id336469261%20#iTunes Hard Hat Area Volume#1], on independent record label [http://www.tripleteamentertainment.com/ Triple Team Entertainment] and distributed by [http://www.dtlr.com/ DTLR].

Washington, D.C.'s hip-hop scene was notably featured in the 1998 film ''[[Slam (film)|Slam]]'', about a would-be slam poet's ordeal in the D.C. Jail.

===Electronic===
Washington D.C. has a booming [[House music]] scene. Driven by internationally recognized acts at [[Club Glow]] and underground talents at venues like [[U Street Music Hall]] and [[Eighteenth Street Lounge]], house music parties regularly take place at clubs and warehouses across the city.

Another electronic-dance music sub-genre that was born in D.C. is [[Moombahton]]. The style of music was created by local D.J. Dave Nada, who accidentally created a new and unique EDM sound at a party in Fall 2009, by slowing down the tempo of an Electro House song and placing a [[reggaeton]] beat on top of the house track. Little did he know that his invention would spark a whole underground EDM movement not only in D.C., but also worldwide, all through the early 2010s. Well known Moombahton producers include [[Munchi]], [[Dillon Francis]], and [[Bro Safari]]. 

D.C. is also the home to the group [[Thievery Corporation]], who are well known in the electronic music community for their fusion of [[downtempo]] and [[trip hop]] with [[lounge music|lounge]] music and Brazilian music such as [[bossa nova]]. They founded the label [[ESL Music|Eighteenth Street Lounge Music]], which is also based in Washington, D.C.

In the past five years local recording artist [[Fort Knox Five]] has been successful with a string of releases on their own label, [[Fort Knox Recordings]], many notable remixes and most recently{{when|date=August 2011}} their full length album ''[[Radio Free DC]]''.

Yoko K. is an electronic musician who is also based in Washington D.C.  Her self-produced debut album "012906" (Asahra Music, 2006) was nominated for "Best Album in Electronica" by the 6th Annual Independent Music Awards. The first single cut, “searching,” was acclaimed by Adam Harrington (Whispering & Hollerin, UK) to be “truly the work of a visionary” and received Grand Prize in the Electronic Jazz category by the Artists Forum Electronic Music Competition (2006).  See also "Aphrodizia."

Anaud Strong is a premier dance-house, soul, r&B-funk, gospel international recording artist, remixer, singer-songwriter, producer and digital dj, born and raised in Washington DC area. Strong has been influential in the continuation and pioneering of the early garage house, electronic dance music, underground dance and art scene since the 90s to the present through various city wide events and philanthropic efforts within the related community. The dance band and ep "Anaud Strong Project" Into The Future...The Deep House Experience RECHARGED! has been nominated in the 24th Annual Wammies Nominees 2009-2010 Washington Area Music Awards in 4 categories for best Electronica Vocalist,Performance Artist, Electronica Artist/Producer(STUDIO) and electronica recording for "Into The Future".

Artists from Washington DC area's premiere dark electronic label Octofoil Records <http://www.octofoil-records.com>, such as [[Maduro (musician)|Maduro]], Retrogramme, and Notecrusher, have appeared on numerous compilations around the world and have been featured on BBC.

===Mod and soul===
[http://www.theambitions.com The Ambitions], led by former Checkered Cabs singer Caz Gardiner, are at the forefront of the mod/soul type bands drawing their inspiration from late 60s soul bands to 1970s British mod revivalists.

===Garage revival===
As of late, DC has been home to a growing scene of musicians who take inspiration from the primal stomp of the 1960s garage rock movement. Eschewing the more esoteric stylings of their art-school peers, bands like Soul Lip, the Hall Monitors, the breakUps, the Have Mercys, the Points, Shark Week and The Fed mine a more primitive vein of rock 'n' roll, finding inspiration in fuzzed-out chords and grooves.

==The Wammies==
The [[Washington Area Music Awards]], also known as the Wammies, was founded in 1985 by Michael Jaworek and Mike Schreibman, and is committed to raising the profile of the Washington area's diverse music community.

The city was named after [[William Cairns|William Wellington Cairns]], then-current [[Governor of Queensland]]. It was formed to serve miners heading for the Hodgkinson River goldfield, but experienced a decline when an easier route was discovered from [[Port Douglas, Queensland|Port Douglas]]. It later developed into a railhead and major port for exporting sugar cane, gold and other metals, minerals and agricultural products from surrounding coastal areas and the [[Atherton Tableland]] region. As of June 2012, the population is approximately 142,528.<ref name="population">{{cite web|title=3218.0 – Regional Population Growth, Australia, 2011–12|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3218.02011-12|work=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=25 February 2014|date=29 August 2013}}</ref>

Cairns is located about {{Convert|1700|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from [[Brisbane]]. It is a popular travel destination for foreign tourists because of its [[tropical climate]]. It serves as a starting point for people wanting to visit the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and [[Far North Queensland]].

==Geography==
[[File:Cairns-espanade2.JPG|thumb|right|Cairns, view of the foreshore.]]
[[File:Goldsbrough.jpg|thumb|right|The Mulgrave River running through the Goldsbrough Valley to the south of Gordonvale.]]

Cairns is located on the east coast of [[Cape York Peninsula]] on a coastal strip between the [[Coral Sea]] and the [[Great Dividing Range]]. The northern part of the city is located on [[Trinity Bay (Queensland)|Trinity Bay]] and the city centre is located on [[Trinity Inlet]]. Some of the city's suburbs are located on flood plains. The [[Mulgrave River]] and [[Barron River (Queensland)|Barron River]] flow within the greater Cairns area but not through the CBD. The city centre's foreshore is located on a mud flat.

===Urban layout===

[[File:Fruit bats, Cairns.JPG|thumb|Fruit bats hanging from a mango tree, central Cairns]]

Cairns is a provincial city, with a linear urban layout that runs from the south, at Edmonton, to the north, at [[Ellis Beach]]. The city is approximately {{convert|52|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from north to south. Cairns has experienced recent [[urban sprawl]], with suburbs occupying land previously used for sugar cane farming.

The ''Northern Beaches'' consist of a number of beach communities extending north along the coast. In general, each beach suburb is located at the end of a spur road extending from the [[Captain Cook Highway]]. From south to north, these are [[Machans Beach, Queensland|Machans Beach]], [[Holloways Beach, Queensland|Holloways Beach]], [[Yorkeys Knob, Queensland|Yorkeys Knob]], [[Trinity Park, Queensland|Trinity Park]], [[Trinity Beach, Queensland|Trinity Beach]], [[Kewarra Beach, Queensland|Kewarra Beach]], [[Clifton Beach, Queensland|Clifton Beach]], [[Palm Cove, Queensland|Palm Cove]], and Ellis Beach.

The suburb of [[Smithfield, Queensland|Smithfield]] is located inland against the mountains of the Great Dividing Range, between Yorkeys Knob and Trinity Park. It serves as the main hub for the Northern Beaches, with a modern shopping arcade, called Smithfield Shopping Centre.

Located south of Smithfield and inland from the Northern Beaches along the edge of the Barron River [[flood plain]] are the suburbs of [[Caravonica, Queensland|Caravonica]], [[Kamerunga, Queensland|Kamerunga]], [[Freshwater, Queensland|Freshwater]], and [[Stratford, Queensland|Stratford]]. This area is sometimes referred to as Freshwater Valley, though it is actually the lower part of Redlynch Valley; further up the valley are the suburbs of [[Redlynch, Queensland|Redlynch]], on the western side of Redlynch Valley, and [[Brinsmead, Queensland|Brinsmead]] on the eastern side. Stratford, Freshwater, and Brinsmead are separated from Cairns city by Mount Whitfield (elevation {{convert|365|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}) and Whitfield Range. [[Crystal Cascades]] and [[Copperlode Dam]] are also located behind this range. ([[Kuranda, Queensland|Kuranda]], a town on the Barron River on the western side of the Macalister Range, forms part of the Cairns economic catchment but is located in the [[Tablelands Region|Tablelands local government]] area and is not part of the Cairns urban area.)

The city centre of Cairns is adjacent to the suburbs of [[Cairns North, Queensland|Cairns North]], and [[Parramatta Park, Queensland|Parramatta Park]], [[Bungalow, Queensland|Bungalow]], [[Portsmith, Queensland|Portsmith]], and close to [[Westcourt, Queensland|Westcourt]], [[Manunda, Queensland|Manunda]], [[Manoora, Queensland|Manoora]], [[Edge Hill, Queensland|Edge Hill]], [[Whitfield, Queensland|Whitfield]], [[Kanimbla, Queensland|Kanimbla]], [[Mooroobool, Queensland|Mooroobool]], [[Earlville, Queensland|Earlville]], [[Woree, Queensland|Woree]] and [[Bayview Heights, Queensland|Bayview Heights]]. The small suburb of [[Aeroglen, Queensland|Aeroglen]] is pressed between Mount Whitfield and the airport, on the Captain Cook Highway between Cairns North and Stratford.

''Southside Cairns'', situated in a narrow area between Trinity Inlet to the east and Lamb Range to the west, includes the suburbs of [[White Rock, Queensland|White Rock]], [[Mount Sheridan, Queensland|Mount Sheridan]], [[Bentley Park, Queensland|Bentley Park]] and [[Edmonton, Queensland|Edmonton]]. The townships of [[Goldsborough, Queensland|Goldsborough]], [[Little Mulgrave, Queensland|Little Mulgrave]], and Aloomba are near [[Gordonvale, Queensland|Gordonvale]], located on the Mulgrave River. This area is serviced by the [[Bruce Highway]]. Several other small towns and communities within Cairns' jurisdiction are sparsely located along the Bruce highway, the furthest being [[Mirriwinni, Queensland|Mirriwinni]], {{Convert|66|km|mi|1}} south of Cairns city; the largest of these townships is [[Babinda]], about {{Convert|60|km|mi|1}} from the city.

===Climate===
Cairns experiences a tropical [[climate]], specifically a [[Tropical monsoon climate]] (Am) under the [[Köppen climate classification]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tapper|first=Andrew|last2=Tapper|first2=Nigel|title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=300}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Linacre | first = Edward |author2=Geerts, Bart | title = Climates and Weather Explained | publisher=Routledge | location = London | year = 1997 | page = 379 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=mkZa1KLHCAQC&lpg=PA379&pg=PA379#v=onepage&q= | isbn = 0-415-12519-7}}</ref> A [[wet season]] with tropical [[monsoon]]s runs from November to May, with a relatively [[dry season]] from June to October, though showers are frequent for most of this period.<ref name=CoC>{{cite web|title=Climate of Cairns|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/qld/cairns/climate.shtml|work=Bureau of Meteorology|accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref> Cairns' mean annual rainfall is {{convert|2015.9|mm|in|1}}.<ref name=ave>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_031011_All.shtml | title = Climate statistics for Cairns Aero AWS | accessdate =23 October 2011| publisher=Bureau of Meteorology }}</ref> The township of [[Babinda, Queensland|Babinda]] south of the city is one of Australia's wettest towns, recording an annual rainfall of over {{convert|4200|mm|in|1}}.

==History==
{{Main|History of Cairns}}
[[File:Kuranda-Skyrail.JPG|thumb|right|[[Skyrail Rainforest Cableway]] over the rainforest.]]

Prior to [[colonialism|British settlement]], the Cairns area was inhabited by the Walubarra Yidinji people,<ref name="Dixon01"/> who still recognise their [[native title|indigenous property rights]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|AIATSIS]]|year=2007|url=http://ntru.aiatsis.gov.au/conf2007/welcome.html|title=Welcome – 2007 Native Title Conference}}</ref> The area is known in the local [[Yidiny language]] as ''Gimuy''.<ref name="Dixon01">{{cite book|author=Dixon, R. M. W.|authorlink=R. M. W. Dixon|year=1977|chapter=A grammar of Yidiny|title=Cambridge Studies in Linguistics|page=19|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-14242-3}}</ref>

In 1770, [[James Cook]] first mapped the future site of Cairns, naming it [[Trinity Bay (Queensland)|Trinity Bay]]. Closer investigation by several official expeditions 100 years later established its potential for development into a port.

Cairns was founded in 1876, hastened by the need to export gold discovered on the tablelands to the west of the inlet. The site was predominantly [[mangrove]] swamps and sand ridges. The swamps were gradually cleared by labourers, and the sand ridges were filled in with dried mud, sawdust from local sawmills, and ballast from a quarry at Edge Hill. Debris collected from the construction of a railway to [[Herberton, Queensland|Herberton]] on the Atherton Tableland, a project which started in 1886, was also used. The railway opened up land that was later used for agriculture on the lowlands (sugar cane, corn, rice, bananas, pineapples), and for fruit and dairy production on the Tableland. The success of local agriculture helped Cairns to establish itself as a port, and the creation of a harbour board in 1906 helped to support its economic future.

[[File:StateLibQld 1 139085 State Government Building at Cairns, ca. 1936.jpg|thumb|Cairns War Memorial, circa 1936]]
On 25 April 1926 ([[ANZAC Day]]), the Cairns Sailors and Soldiers War Memorial was unveiled by Alexander Frederick Draper, the mayor of the [[City of Cairns]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article20993850 |title=MEMORIAL UNVEILED AT CAIRNS. |newspaper=[[Courier-Mail|The Brisbane Courier (Qld. : 1864 - 1933)]] |location=Qld. |date=27 April 1926 |accessdate=6 April 2014 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sailors and Soldiers War Memorial|url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/display/90962-sailors%60-and-soldiers%60-war-memorial|publisher=Monument Australia|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref> 

During [[World War II]], Cairns was used by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] as a staging base for operations in the Pacific,<ref>{{cite web|title=Cairns|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/bases/cairns.htm|work=[[RAAF Museum]]|publisher=Royal Australian Air Force|accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref> with [[US Army Air Force]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force]] operational bases (now the airport), as well as a major military seaplane base in Trinity Inlet, and [[US Navy]] and [[Royal Australian Navy]] bases near the current wharf. Combat missions were flown out of Cairns in support of the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] in 1942. Edmonton and White Rock south of Cairns were major military supply areas and US [[Paratroopers]] trained at [[Gordonvale]] and the Goldsborough Valley.

A Special Forces training base was established at the old "Fairview" homestead on Munro's Hill, Mooroobool. This base was officially known as the [[Z Experimental Station]],<ref>{{cite book |title=The Heroes |last=McKie |first=Ronald |year=1960 |publisher=Angus & Robertson Ltd |location=Sydney|isbn=0-207-12133-8 |page=9}}</ref> but referred to informally as "The House on the Hill".

After World War II, Cairns gradually developed into a centre for tourism. The opening of the [[Cairns Airport|Cairns International Airport]] in 1984 helped establish the city as a desirable destination for international tourism.

==Governance==
[[File:Lagoon Fish.jpg|thumb|right|'The Lagoon' on Cairns Esplanade at sunset.]]
Cairns is part of the [[Cairns Region]] [[local government areas of Queensland|local government area]] which is governed by a Regional Council. The Council consists of a directly elected mayor and 10 councillors, elected from 10 single-member divisions (or wards) using an optional [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]] system. Elections are held every four years.

The Cairns Region consists of three former local government areas. The first was the original [[City of Cairns]], consisting of the Cairns City region as listed above. The second, which was amalgamated in 1995, was the [[Shire of Mulgrave (Queensland)|Shire of Mulgrave]] (comprising the other areas, namely the Northern Beaches, Redlynch Valley and Southside). The town of Gordonvale was once called Nelson. The third area is the [[Shire of Douglas]], which amalgamated in 2008 during major statewide local government reforms.

At the time of the 1995 amalgamation, Cairns City had a population of approximately 40,000 and Mulgrave Shire had a population of approximately 60,000. Both local government authorities had chambers in the Cairns [[Central business district|CBD]]. The old Cairns City Council chambers has been converted into a new city library. In a controversial decision,<ref>{{cite news|work=The Cairns Post|title=Land Row|page=1|agency=News Limited|date=19 July 2001}}</ref> new Council chambers were constructed on previously contaminated land in the mainly industrial suburb of Portsmith.

Cairns has three representatives in the [[Queensland Parliament]], from the electoral districts of [[Electoral district of Barron River|Barron River]], [[Electoral district of Cairns|Cairns]] and [[Electoral district of Mulgrave (Queensland)|Mulgrave]]. The city is represented in the [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]] by representatives elected from the districts of [[Division of Leichhardt|Leichhardt]] and [[Division of Kennedy|Kennedy]].

==Economy==

[[File:Cairns - The Lakes (Entrance Gate).jpg|thumb|right|The Lakes, Cairns]]
[[File:Cairns Esplanade - Pier (Shangrila Hotel).jpg|thumb|right|Cairns Pier]]

Cairns serves as the major commercial centre for the Far North Queensland and Cape York Peninsula Regions. It is a base for the regional offices of various government departments.

===Tourism===
Tourism plays a major part in the Cairns [[Economic system|economy]]. According to [[Tourism Australia]], the Cairns region is the fourth-most popular destination for international tourists in Australia after Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tourismaustralia.com/content/Research/Factsheets/TopTen_Regions_Dec2006.pdf |title=International Market Tourism Facts |format=PDF|publisher=Tourism Australia}}</ref> While the city does not rank amongst Australia's top 10 destinations for domestic tourism, it attracts a significant number of Australian holiday makers despite its distance from major capitals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tourism.australia.com/Research.asp?lang=EN&sub=0361 |title=Research & Stats|publisher=Tourism Australia}}</ref> There is also a growing interest in Cairns from the Chinese leisure market with occasional direct flights from Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou.

Cairns [[esplanade]] includes a swimming lagoon with adjoining barbecue areas. In May 2003, the then Cairns Mayor [[Kevin Byrne]] declared that [[Toplessness|topless]] sunbathing is permitted here, as the area is a gathering point for people from around the world who may wish to do so.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/05/23/1053585684244.html |title=Backpacker Boobs Cause Stir |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=23 May 2003 |accessdate=29 January 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cairnsesplanade.com/redevelopment.html |title=Cairns Esplanade Redevelopment Progress – Topless Sunbathing}}</ref>

===Commercial===
Several shopping centres of various sizes are located throughout Cairns. The largest of these are [[Cairns Central]] shopping centre, located in the central business district, and Stockland Cairns, located in the suburb of Earlville. In Westcourt, one of the city's oldest shopping centres has been refurbished, with the city's first [[Direct Factory Outlets|DFO]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Direct Factory Outlets|url=http://www.dfo.com.au/cairns/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Direct Benefit|work=The Cairns Post|date=3 December 2008|url=http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2008/12/03/18345_print-version.html|agency=News Limited}}</ref> To service the needs of suburbs further from the city centre, shopping complexes are also located at Mount Sheridan, Redlynch, Smithfield, and Clifton Beach.

In 2010, the state government opened the second stage of William McCormack Place, an A$80&nbsp;million office building credited as the first 6-star [[Green Star (Australia)|green star rated]] building in the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=William McCormack Place, Stage Two, Cairns|url=http://www.cleanenergy.qld.gov.au/zone_files/Office_of_Clean_Energy/william_mccormack.pdf|work=Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation|publisher=Queensland Government|accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref>

===Media===
''[[The Cairns Post]]'' is a daily newspaper published in the city; a weekly paper, The Cairns Sun, is also published. ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'' is a daily Queensland-wide newspaper published in Brisbane. ''[[The Australian]]'' newspaper also circulates widely. The [[Cairns Bulletin]] is an independent newspaper in circulation in the Cairns area.

Cairns is served by five television stations, three commercial television stations ([[WIN Television]], [[Seven Queensland]] and [[Southern Cross Ten]]) which are regional affiliates of the [[Television broadcasting in Australia|three Australian commercial television]] networks ([[Nine Network|Nine]], [[Seven Network|Seven]] and [[Network Ten|Ten]]), and public broadcasters the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] (ABC1) and [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] (SBS ONE).<ref>[http://www.digitalready.gov.au/media/DigitalTVTimetable_by_Region.pdf Regional digital TV timetable], Australian Government</ref>
services.

Of the three main commercial networks, Seven Queensland and WIN produce 30-minute local news bulletins each weeknight (both produced from local newsrooms, but broadcast from studios in [[Maroochydore]] with WIN also producing a state-wide late news bulletin for regional Queensland. Southern Cross Ten also provides short local news updates throughout the day.

Cairns radio stations include a number of public, commercial and community broadcasters. The ABC broadcasts [[Radio National|ABC Radio National]], [[ABC Local Radio|ABC Local]], [[ABC Classic FM]] and the [[Triple J]] youth network. Commercial radio stations include [[Zinc 102.7|Zinc 102.7 FM]], 4CA 846 AM, [[Hot FM (Australian radio network)|Hot FM]], [[Sea FM]] and 104.3 4TAB sports radio, while the community radio stations are 4CCR-FM, 101.9 Coast FM, Orbit FM 88.0FM & 87.8FM and 4CIM 98.7FM.

===Industry and agriculture===
The land around Cairns is still used for [[sugar cane]] farming, although this land is increasingly under pressure from new suburbs as the city grows. Within the Cairns City Council area there is a [[sugar cane#Processing|sugar mill]] at Gordonvale.

The [[Barron Gorge Hydroelectric Power Station]] is located nearby on the lower [[Barron River (Queensland)|Barron River]], and provides [[green power]] for some of the city's needs.

==Transport==
Cairns is an important transport hub in the Far North Queensland region. Located at the base of Cape York Peninsula, it provides important transport links between the Peninsula and [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] regions, and the areas to the south of the state. [[Cairns International Airport]] is essential to the viability of the area's tourism industry.

===Roads===
[[File:forestgardens.png|thumb|right|The [[Bruce Highway]] in Cairns southern suburbs at morning [[peak hour]].]]

The [[Bruce Highway]] runs for {{convert|1700|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Brisbane, and terminates in the Cairns CBD. From there the [[Captain Cook Highway]] (also referred to as the Cook Highway) commences, and runs for approximately {{convert|76|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} northwest to [[Mossman, Queensland|Mossman]].

A need for future upgrades to the Bruce Highway to motorway standards through the southern suburbs to Gordonvale has been identified in regional planning strategies to cope with increasing congestion from rapid population growth. This will result in overpasses at all major intersections from Woree to Gordonvale. The motorway will divert from Bentley Park to Gordonvale, bypassing Edmonton to reduce the effects of road noise on residential areas.<ref>{{cite journal|title=FNQ Regional Plan – Supporting Technical Documents – Integrated Transport|date=February 2000|pages=41–43}}</ref>

The [[Kennedy Highway]] commences at Smithfield on the Barron River flood plain north of Cairns, and ascends the Macalister Range to the township of Kuranda. The highway then extends to the town of [[Mareeba]] on the [[Atherton Tableland]], and continues to communities of Cape York Peninsula.

The Gillies Highway commences at the township of Gordonvale, and ascends the [[Gillies Range]] (part of the Great Dividing Range) to the town of [[Atherton, Queensland|Atherton]] on the Atherton Tableland, passing through the township of [[Yungaburra, Queensland|Yungaburra]] on the way.

The controversial private road, [[Quaid Road]], was constructed in 1989 through what is now a [[Wet Tropics]] [[World Heritage|World Heritage Area]], and links Wangetti, on the coast just north of Cairns, to Southedge, just south of [[Mount Molloy, Queensland|Mount Molloy]]. The road is not open to the public and is not used for general traffic.

====Coaches====
Cairns is served by long-distance coaches to Brisbane, and regional cities to the south. Coaches also operate west to [[Mount Isa]] via [[Townsville]], and to [[Alice Springs]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in the [[Northern Territory]].

===Public transport===
A public transport network is operated throughout the city by [[Marlin Coast Sunbus]]. A transit mall is located in the [[Central business district|CBD]], through which all services operate. Services include most parts of the city, from Palm Cove in the north, to Gordonvale in the south. Bus services operated by 'TRANSLink'<ref>[http://translink.com.au/travel-information/service-notices/19611/details, recently brought the public transport from 'Trans North'. Transnorthbus.com. Retrieved on 9 September 2014.</ref> run to Kuranda and to the [[Atherton Tableland]]. A smaller minibus service, ''Jon's Kuranda Bus'' runs between Cairns and Kuranda. Cairns also has one major taxi company, Cairns Taxis, which services the Cairns region.

===Rail===
[[File:StateLibQld 1 100880.jpg|thumb|right|Railway workers on the Cairns Railway with a view of Glacier Rock in the background, ca. 1891.<ref>The Cairns Range Railway was built to connect the mining centre of Herberton with Cairns. Work began on 10 May 1886; the first sod was turned in Cairns by Samuel Griffith, Premier of Queensland, and the first train arrived in Herberton on 20 October 1910 (Information taken from: A.D. Broughton, A pictorial history of the construction of the Cairns Range Railway, 1886–1891, 1991).</ref>]]

[[Cairns railway station]] is the terminus for Queensland's [[North Coast railway line, Queensland|North Coast railway line]], which follows the eastern seaboard from Brisbane. Services are operated by [[Queensland Rail]] (QR). In April 2009, the high speed [[QR Tilt Train|tilt train]] service from Brisbane to Cairns was suspended due to safety concerns but resumed service on 4 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/05/04/2559640.htm|title=Rail union safety fears grow as Qld tilt train resumes|date=4 May 2009|publisher=ABC}}</ref> Freight trains also operate along the route, with a QR Freight handling facility located at Portsmith.

Pacific National Queensland (a division of [[Pacific National]], owned by [[Asciano Limited]]) operates a rail siding at Woree. It runs private trains on the rail network owned by the Queensland State Government and managed by QR's Network Division.

The [[Kuranda Scenic Railway]] operates from Cairns. The tourist railway ascends the Macalister Range and is not used for commuter services. It passes through the suburbs of Stratford, Freshwater (stopping at Freshwater Station) and Redlynch before reaching Kuranda.

Freight services to [[Forsayth, Queensland|Forsayth]] were discontinued in the mid-1990s. These were mixed freight and passenger services that served the semi-remote towns west of the Great Dividing Range. There is now a weekly passenger-only service, ''The [[Savannahlander]]'', that leaves Cairns on Wednesday mornings. The Savannahlander is run by a private company, Cairns Kuranda Steam Trains.

Cairns is served by a [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] cane railway (or cane train) network that hauls harvested sugar cane to the Mulgrave Mill located in Gordonvale. The pressure of urban sprawl on land previously cultivated by cane farmers has seen this network reduced over recent years. {{Cn|date=July 2014}}

The use of the existing heavy rail line for commuter services between Redlynch and Gordonvale is occasionally discussed; however this is not a favoured option under the [http://www.lgp.qld.gov.au/?id=173 FNQ 2010 Regional Plan], which recommends the use of buses.

===Airport===
[[File:Cairns Airport.JPG|right|thumb|[[Cairns International Airport]]]]
[[File:Cairns-marina.JPG|thumb|right|Cairns Marina.]]

[[Cairns International Airport]] is located {{convert|7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of Cairns City between the CBD and the Northern Beaches. It is Australia's seventh busiest domestic airport and sixth busiest international airport. In 2005/2006 there were 3.76&nbsp;million international and domestic passenger movements.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://www.cairnsport.com.au/content/standard.asp?name=MC_Annual_Reports |title= Cairns Port Authority 2005/6 Annual Report}}</ref>

The domestic terminal at Cairns Airport underwent an extensive redevelopment which began in 2007 and was completed in 2010.

The airport has a domestic terminal, a separate international terminal, and a general aviation area. The airport handles international flights, and flights to major Australian cities, tourist destinations, and regional destinations throughout North Queensland. It is an important base for general aviation serving the Cape York Peninsula and Gulf of Carpentaria communities. The Cairns airport is also a base for the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]].

===Sea port===
The Cairns Seaport, located on Trinity Inlet, is operated by the Cairns Port Authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cairnsport.com.au/|title=Cairns Port Authority}}</ref>
It serves as an important port for tourist operators providing daily reef trips. These consist of large [[catamarans]] capable of carrying over 300 passengers, as well as smaller operators that may take as few as 12 tourists. Cairns Port is also a port of call for [[cruise ships]], such as Captain Cook Cruises, cruising the South Pacific Ocean. It also provides freight services to coastal townships on Cape York Peninsula, the [[Torres Strait]] and the Gulf of Carpentaria.

Yearly cargo through the port totals 1.13&nbsp;million tonnes. Almost 90% of the trade is bulk cargoes<ref name="autogenerated1"/> – including petroleum, sugar, molasses, fertiliser and LP gas. A large number of [[Commercial trawler|fishing trawlers]] are also located at the port. There is also a marina that houses private yachts and boats used for tourist operations.

The [[Royal Australian Navy]] has a base in Cairns ([[HMAS Cairns (naval base)|HMAS Cairns]]).<ref name=RANCairns>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/index.php/HMAS_Cairns |title=HMAS Cairns |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=21 August 2008}}</ref> The base has a complement of 900 personnel, and supports fourteen warships, including the four [[Armidale-class patrol boat|''Armidale'' class patrol boats]] of ''Ardent'' Division, four of the six [[Balikpapan-class landing craft heavy|''Balikpapan'' class landing craft]], and all six ships of the [[Royal Australian Navy Hydrographic Service]].<ref name=RANCairns/>

The Trinity Wharf has recently been the subject of a major redevelopment to improve the area for tourist and cruise ship operations. {{Cn|date=May 2014}} The freight wharves are located to the south of Trinity Wharf further up Trinity Inlet.

'''Nokturnal Mortum''' is a Ukrainian [[black metal]] band from [[Kharkiv]].

==History==
Nokturnal Mortum started as a [[death metal]] band called '''Suppuration''' in 1991,<ref name=rivadavia>{{cite web |last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |title=Nokturnal Mortum – Biography |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/nokturnal-mortum-mn0000450479 |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=21 April 2011}}</ref> then turned to black metal and changed name to '''{{not a typo|Crystaline}} Darkness''' but "had to change the name back in 1993/94 to Nocturnal Mortum because there already existed a band with that name in western underground."<ref name=firegoat>Sonia: [http://www.firegoat.com/eng/?id=3&d=16 ''INTERVIEW WITH NOKTURNAL MORTUM''].</ref> Then the band "changed the letter so that we wouldn't find a band with the same name again like it was the case with {{not a typo|Crystaline}} Darkness."<ref name=firegoat/> Nokturnal Mortum gained their first Western recognition with the release of their album ''[[Goat Horns]]'', their second full length album, notable for having two keyboardists play on the album, often on the same song, and for mixing traditional Ukrainian music with black metal.

The band's first albums were released through The End Records and (as licence pressings) through [[Nuclear Blast]],<ref>Aaron McKay: [http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-363_the_end_records.aspx ''The Genesis of the End''. ''CoC interviews Andreas Katsambas of The End Records''].</ref> but the label and band separated after releasing the album ''[[Nechrist]]'' and a re-release of the ''[[Lunar Poetry]]'' demo due to a disagreement. According to Varggoth, "We had a contract with The End Records but it was broken. We have different points of view. They didn't like our policy, we didn't like the way they do business. They owe us some money. That was enough for a conflict." 

Band frontman [[Knjaz Varggoth]] (real name Ievgen Gapon, Ukrainian: ????? ?????) is one of the foremost figures in Eastern European [[National Socialist Black Metal]] (NSBM) and has played in various NSBM bands, like Aryan Terrorism, Warhead and [[Temnozor]]. Nokturnal Mortum's albums "Weltanschauung" and "Live in Katowice" were released by [[No Colours Records]], a German label associated with NSBM.

'''Yungaburra''' is a town located on the [[Atherton Tableland]] in [[Far North Queensland|Far North]] [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], not far from [[Cairns]]. At the 2006 [[Census in Australia|census]], Yungaburra had a population of 932.<ref name=Census2006Y>{{Census 2006 AUS|id=UCL363600|name=Yungaburra (Urban Centre/Locality) |accessdate=25 June 2011|quick=on}}</ref>

==History==
Prior to European settlement the area around Yungaburra was inhabited by about sixteen different [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] groups, with the custodians being Yidinji People and neighbouring Ngadjoni people. In the early 1880s the area around Allumbah Pocket was used as an overnight stop for miners travelling west from the coast. In 1886 the land was surveyed, and in 1891 settlers moved in. 

In 1910 the railway arrived, and the town was renamed Yungaburra, to avoid confusion with another town called Allumbah. By 1911 indigenous numbers had fallen to 20% of the pre-settlement population due to disease, conflict with settlers and loss of habitat.

===Cyclone Larry===
{{main|Cyclone Larry}}
In 2006, The Atherton Tableland region was devastated by the Category 4 (on the [[Tropical cyclone classification schemes#Categories and ranking|Australian scale]]) [[Tropical Cyclone|Cyclone]] [[Cyclone Larry|Larry]]. The roofs of the community hall, police station and one of the bush cottages were badly damaged or removed by the weather, as was the front of the Yungaburra Butchery and the sign on the Gem Gallery. As well as the above, many trees, sheds, caravans and gardens were blown away or ruined.

==Present day==
Yungaburra's economy today revolves around tourism, and the town contains a primary school, post office, library/[[telecentre]] and a range of businesses and services for the use of residents and visitors. It has 18 Heritage Listed buildings, and is the largest National Trust village in Queensland. The Yungaburra Markets, held on the fourth Saturday of each month, are one of the largest in [[Far North Queensland]], and each year around the end of October, Yungaburra holds the two-day [[Yungaburra Folk Festival]], featuring concerts from Australian (and sometimes international) [[folk music]]ians.
Yungaburra is also the site of the war memorial to soldiers lost, opened 22nd June, 2013.
The popultation of Yungaburra is 1,034 persons as of 30 June 2009.

==Geography==
The landscape around Yungaburra has been shaped by millennia of volcanic activity. The most recent eruptions were approximately 10,000 years ago. Notable geological features nearby include:
* [[Seven Sisters, Queensland|Seven Sisters]] and [[Mount Quincan]] are volcanic cones.
* [[Lake Eacham|Lake Eacham (Yidyam)]] and [[Lake Barrine]] are lakes inside volcanic craters.
* [[Mount Hypipamee Crater]] is a [[diatreme]] (crater).
* [[Tinaroo Dam]] is a man-made [[dam]].
* [[The Tinaburra Dam]] has a cricket pitch on the bottom of it from having the old town based from there.

==Tourism==

Allumbah Pocket is a picnic area on Petersons Creek which runs past Yungaburra. It is the centre for a series of walking tracks along the creek. Tracks lead to Frawley's Pool, a popular swimming hole and picnic area, then further to Yungaburra's historical train bridge. In the opposite direction there is a track to the [[platypus]] viewing deck. Aside from this all of the tracks are relatively easy and short enough for anyone to do. The site is dedicated to Geoff Tracy, a local renowned environmentalist who died in 2004.

Yungaburra has access to the southern arm of [[Lake Tinaroo]] which is popular for fishing, canoeing, sailing, swimming, [[water-skiing]] and camping. The other main places to get to Tinaroo are [[Kairi, Queensland|Kairi]] and the township of [[Tinaroo, Queensland|Tinaroo]].

The [[Curtain Fig Tree]], which is just out of Yungaburra, is a giant [[rainforest]] [[fig tree]] with roots hanging down, giving it the appearance of curtains. There is a short boardwalk around the tree.

[[Lake Barrine]] and [[Lake Eacham]] are [[crater lake]]s, formed from [[volcano]]es. Lake Eacham is popular for swimming and Lake Barrine has a [[teahouse]] and gift shop as well as cruises around the lake however is unsuitable for swimming due to the cruise boats. Both lakes have walking tracks around them. Lake Barrine's track is {{convert|6|km|mi}} and Lake Eacham's is {{convert|3|km|mi}}.

There are a number of places to dine, from Takeaway to fine dining.

'''Varg Vikernes''' ({{IPA-no|???r? ??i?k??e?s|lang}}; born 11 February 1973 as '''Kristian Vikernes''', current legal name '''Louis Cachet''')<ref name="aftenposten2013"/> is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] musician and writer.

In 1991, he founded the one-man music project [[Burzum]] and became part of the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]]. In 1992, he was allegedly involved in burning down at least three Christian churches in Norway, along with other members of the scene. By early 1993, Vikernes had recorded four albums as Burzum and [[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas|another]] with fellow black metal band [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]. When Mayhem guitarist [[Euronymous|Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth]] was stabbed to death in August that year, Vikernes was arrested and charged with the murder. In May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison for the murder of Euronymous and the [[arson]] of churches. He maintains that he killed in self-defense and denied responsibility for the church arsons, though supported them.

During his time in prison he became affiliated with the [[Heathen Front]] and had several writings on [[Germanic paganism]] published.<ref name="GC204">Goodrick-Clarke 2003: 204</ref> He also recorded and released two [[Electronic music|electronic]] albums as Burzum. Having served almost 15 years of his sentence, Vikernes was released on parole in early 2009.<ref>{{Cite news| title= Varg Vikernes ute på prøve | url= http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=557287 | work= [[Verdens Gang]] | location= Oslo, Norway | agency= [[Norsk Telegrambyrå|NTB]] | date= 10 March 2009 | accessdate= 10 March 2009 | language= Norwegian | archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vg.no%2Fnyheter%2Finnenriks%2Fartikkel.php%3Fartid%3D557287&date=2009-03-10 | archivedate= 10 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title= Ute av fengsel | url= http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/05/22/nyheter/black_metal/varg_vikernes/6354526/ | work= Dagbladet.no | date= 22 May 2009 | accessdate= 23 May 2009 | language= Norwegian}}</ref> He settled in [[France]] with his wife and children, where he continued releasing music and writing.<ref name=bbc18july>{{cite news|title=Neo-Nazi musician Vikernes freed after arrest in France|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23362718|accessdate=18 July 2013|agency=BBC|date=18 July 2013}}</ref> Through his writings he promotes a [[Neo-völkisch movements|neo-völkisch]] ideology ([[Odalism]]) based on the idea that White Europeans should re-adopt "native European" values, including elements of [[Historical pagan|traditional paganism]]. He advocates [[White nationalism]], [[social conservatism]], and [[survivalism]].

==Biography==

===Background, childhood and adolescence===
Vikernes does not have a published biography (authorized or unauthorized), but some information can be gathered from interviews he has given and from articles on the web page [http://www.burzum.org www.burzum.org]. [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]], one of the authors of ''Lords of Chaos'', has been described as "quite active in the propaganda support network for Vikernes".<ref name="Coogan">Coogan 1999</ref>

In the interviews printed in ''Lords of Chaos'', Vikernes discusses his background and childhood. ''Lords of Chaos'' also includes an interview with his mother, Helene Bore (the book and a newspaper depicted there refer to her with the given name 'Lene',<ref>Michael Moynihan, Didrik Søderlind: ''Lords of Chaos'', First Edition, Feral House 1998, p. 142.</ref><ref>Michael Moynihan, Didrik Søderlind: ''Lords of Chaos'', First Edition, Feral House 1998, p. 316.</ref> whereas Vikernes' own website uses the name 'Helene'<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/gallery01.php ''Varg Vikernes in Childhood''], accessed on 28 March 2013.</ref>). In the 2004 interview, Vikernes mentions that "she is working in a large oil company".<ref name="BZINT">http://www.burzum.org: [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/interview01.shtml 12 August 2004 interview]</ref> He also claims his father is an "electronics engineer",<ref name="BZINT"/> whereas his brother, who (according to the ''Lords of Chaos'' interview) is "one and a half years older",<ref name=LoC148/> is a "graduate civil engineer".<ref name="BZINT"/>

In the ''Lords of Chaos'' interview, Vikernes recalls an incident from his childhood: When he was about 6 years old, the family moved for about a year to [[Baghdad]], Iraq, because Vikernes' "father was working for [[Saddam Hussein]]",<ref name=LoC147>LoC 1998: 147</ref> developing a computer program. Since there were no places available in the English school in Baghdad, the young Vikernes went to an Iraqi elementary school during this time. According to his interview, Vikernes here became "aware of racial matters".<ref name=LoC148>LoC 1998: 148</ref> [[Corporal punishment]] was not uncommon in the school, and on one occasion Vikernes had a "quarrel" with a teacher and called him "a monkey". But as Vikernes perceived it the teachers "didn't dare to hit me because I was white".<ref name=LoC148 /> Vikernes' mother also recalls how they "spent a year in Iraq", and that "the other children in his class would get slapped by their teachers; he would not".<ref name=LoC142>LoC 1998: 142</ref> She mentions that this created problems, but generally she "has no good explanation" of how Varg developed his views.<ref name=LoC144>LoC 1998: 144</ref> Vikernes reveals slightly more in his interview. When asked about his father, he says that he "had a [[swastika]] flag at home"<ref name=LoC147 /> and that his father was hysterical about it. However, Vikernes feels that his father was a hypocrite, because he was worried about Vikernes "being a Nazi", whereas he too was "pissed about all the colored people he saw in town".<ref name=LoC147 /> About his mother, Vikernes says that she was "very race conscious", in the sense that she was afraid that Vikernes "was going to come home with a black girl!"<ref name=LoC146>LoC 1998: 146</ref> At the time of the interview (1995), Vikernes still had a positive relationship with his mother, but "very little contact" with his father.<ref name=LoC147 /> His parents are divorced. Vikernes' father is said to have "left about 10 years ago",<ref name=LoC147 /> which would have been 1985, when Vikernes was 12.

There is some evidence that Vikernes was involved with the skinhead scene in Bergen before he became a part of the black metal scene. Goodrick-Clarke introduces [[Burzum]] as the "musical vehicle" of the "ex-skinhead" Vikernes.<ref name="GC204"/> According to the ''[[Encyclopedia of White Power]]'', "Vikernes first became involved with the extreme right as a National Socialist skinhead while he was an adolescent."<ref name="Kapl-319">Kaplan 2000: 319.</ref> When he is asked in the interview in ''Lords of Chaos'' whether he hung out with skinheads in Bergen, Vikernes boldly replies: "There were no skinheads in Bergen."<ref name="LoC149"/> He mentions, though, that he had short hair at that time and that he was into weapons, that he liked the Germans and hated the British and Americans.<ref name="LoC149"/>

Influenced by [[classical music]], [[Tchaikovksy]] in particular, as a child, at 12 he started listening to [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], citing [[Iron Maiden]] as his biggest inspiration.<ref name = "Heart of Darkness">{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2010_interview_guitar_world.shtml |title=Burzum: Heart of Darkness "Guitar World" Magazine (April 2010) by Brad Angle |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=2014-07-18}}</ref> Later he discovered other metal bands whose sound would be influential on his own band such as [[Kreator]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]], [[Pestilence (band)|Pestilence]], [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]] and [[Von (band)|Von]].<ref name = "Heart of Darkness"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://metalasfuck.net/zine/articles/2012/%E2%80%9Cyou-can-add-rotting-christ-list%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-burzum%E2%80%99s-varg-vikernes-shares-his-metal-faves-meta |title=“You can add Rotting Christ to the list” – Burzum’s Varg Vikernes shares his metal faves with Metal as Fuck!|publisher=metalasfuck.net |accessdate=2014-07-19}}</ref> Although [[Venom (band)|Venom]] are widely considered the primary influence on black metal, Vikernes has always denied to be influenced by them, as well as defining the band as "a joke". He wore once a T-shirt of Venom's ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' to promote the genre but he regretted after doing that.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noisecreep.com/burzum-varg-vikernes-does-not-care-about-black-metal/ |title=Varg Vikernes Of Burzum Talks New Album "Fallen" |publisher=Noisecreep.com|accessdate=2014-07-18}}</ref>

===Early musical career===
{{Further|Burzum}}
Vikernes had been learning the guitar since he was 14.<ref name="LoC149">LoC 1998: 149</ref> When he was about seventeen, Vikernes came into contact with the members of the Bergen [[death metal]] band [[Old Funeral]]. He played guitar with them during 1990–1991 and performed on their ''Devoured Carcass'' EP.

In 1991, Vikernes began a solo musical project named [[Burzum]], and quickly became involved with the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]]. During 1992–1993, he recorded four albums as Burzum.

Vikernes has stated that for the recording of these early albums he used an old Westone guitar, bought in 1987 from an acquaintance.<ref name = "burzummusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story06.shtml |title=A Burzum Story: Part VI – The Music |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> He used the cheapest bass guitar there was in the shop and he borrowed drumsets from Old Funeral, Immortal and "another musician living nearby".<ref name = "burzummusic"/> On ''[[Hvis lyset tar oss]]'', he borrowed [[Hellhammer (musician)|Hellhammer]]'s drumset, the same one Hellhammer used to record ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'' by [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Teufel |url=http://www.teufelstomb.com/interviews/mayhem-1999/ |title=Interview with Hellhammer |publisher=Teufels Tomb |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> He used a Peavey amplifier, but for the recording of ''[[Filosofem]]'' he used the amplifier on his brother's stereo and some old fuzz pedals.<ref name = "burzummusic"/> For vocals, he would use whatever microphone the sound tech handed him, but during the recording of ''Filosofem'' he intentionally used the worst mic they had, a headset mic.<ref name = "burzummusic"/> On the track "Dungeons of Darkness" he used the large gong at [[Grieghallen]] for background noise ([[Euronymous]] assisted him by beating his fists on it).<ref name = "burzummusic"/>

In 1992, Vikernes joined the black metal band [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], a year after band member [[Per "Dead" Ohlin|Dead]] committed suicide on 8 April 1991.

===Arson of churches===
On 6 June 1992, the [[Fantoft stave church]], dating from the 12th century and considered architecturally significant, was burned to the ground by arson. By January 1993, arson attacks had occurred on at least seven other major [[stave churches]], including one on Christmas Eve of 1992.<ref name="GC204"/> Vikernes was found guilty of several of these cases: the arson and attempted arson of Åsane Church and Storetveit Church, respectively, in [[Bergen]], the arson of Skjold Church in [[Vindafjord]], and the arson of Holmenkollen Chapel in [[Oslo]]. He was also charged with the arson of Fantoft stave church, although the jurors voted not guilty. The judges called this an error but did not overthrow the whole case.<ref name=burzumstory2>{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story02.shtml |title=Varg Vikernes – A Burzum Story: Part II – Euronymous |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref>

[[File:Burzum aske.jpg|thumb|right|The charred ruins of the Fantoft stave church as seen on Burzum's 1992 EP, ''[[Aske (album)|Aske]]''.]]
Vikernes was rumored to have been motivated both by [[paganism]] and [[theistic Satanism]], but has denied he was ever a Satanist <ref>See 1995 [[Morgenbladet]] article "Satanism in Norway", English translation Michael Moynihan, ''Lords of Chaos'', pp. 344–45.</ref> or have any belief in that God (or the devil) exists.

In an interview with [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]], Vikernes made a statement about the church burnings that hints at a [[Germanic paganism|heathen]] rather than a Satanist motivation:

<blockquote>I am not going to say that I burnt any churches. But let me put it this way: There was one person who started it. I was not found guilty of burning the Fantoft stave church, but anyway, that was what triggered the whole thing. That was the 6th of June and everyone linked it to Satanism ... What everyone overlooked was that on the 6th June, 793, in [[Lindesfarne]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]] was the site of the first known [[Viking]] raid in history, with Vikings from [[Hordaland]], which is my county ... They [the Christians] desecrated our graves, our burial mounds, so it's revenge.<ref>Michael Moynihan, ''Lords of Chaos'', p. 88; quoted in: M. Gardell, ''Gods of the Blood'', p.306;</ref></blockquote>

Echoing this sentiment, he writes in ''Vargsmål'': "For each devastated graveyard, one heathen grave is avenged, for each ten churches burnt to ashes, one [[Heathen hofs|heathen hof]] is avenged, for each ten priests or [[freemason]]s assassinated, one heathen is avenged."<ref>quoted after M. Gardell, ''Gods of the Blood'', pp. 306, 307. Translation by M. Gardell</ref>

When asked whether the church burnings were linked to [[Odinism]] or [[Ásatrú]] he replied: "The point is that all these churches [i.e. church burnings] are linked to one person ... who was not [[Øystein Aarseth|Øystein]] obviously. All the church burnings, with the exception of Stavanger, because that was another group (who, by the way, have also turned into nationalistic pagans)."<ref>''Lords of Chaos'', p. 89</ref>

===''Bergens Tidende'' article===
In January 1993, an article in one of Norway's biggest newspapers, ''[[Bergens Tidende]]'' (''BT''), brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight.<ref name=LoC95-97>''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), pp. 95–97.</ref> Two friends of Vikernes interviewed him and brought the interview to the newspaper, hoping they would print it.<ref name=LoC95-97/> In the anonymous interview, 'Count Grishnackh' (Vikernes) claimed to have burnt the churches and killed a man in Lillehammer.<ref name=LoC95-97/> ''BT'' journalist Finn Bjørn Tønder set-up a meeting with 'Count Grishnackh', with help from the friends. The journalists were summoned to an apartment and, allegedly, warned that they would be shot if the police were called.<ref name=LoC95-97/> There, Vikernes and his companions told the journalists that they had burnt the churches, or knew who had done it, and said that the attacks would continue. They claimed to be Devil worshippers and said: "Our intention is to spread fear and devilry [...] that is why we are telling this to ''Bergens Tidende''". They told the journalists details about the arsons that hadn't been released to the press and so ''BT'' spoke with the police before publishing it, who confirmed these details.<ref name=LoC95-97/> The article was published on 20 January as the front page of the ''BT''. It was headlined "We Lit The Fires" and included a photo of Vikernes, his face mostly hidden, holding two large knives. However, by the time the article was printed, Vikernes had already been arrested. The police allegedly found him by going to an address printed on a Burzum flyer,<ref name=LoC95-97/> although Vikernes believes that Tønder "snitched" on him.<ref name=varg-satanrides>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/satan_rides_the_media.shtml Varg Vikernes's review of ''Satan Rides the Media'']. Burzum.org</ref>

According to Vikernes, the anonymous interview was planned by himself and Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal and get more customers for Helvete.<ref name="Count Regrets Nothing">[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2009_interview_dagbladet.shtml "Count" Regrets Nothing]. Burzum.org</ref> At the time, Burzum was about to release the ''[[Aske (EP)|Aske]]'' mini-album.<ref name=LoC95-97/> Vikernes said of the interview: "I exaggerated a lot and when the journalist left we [...] had a good laugh, because he didn't seem to understand that I was pulling his leg".<ref name=burzumstory2/> He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime.<ref name=LoC95-97/> Vikernes claims that, after he was arrested, "the journalist edited the interview and [...] published an insane version of it the following day, without even letting me read through it".<ref name=varg-satanrides/> Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence.<ref name=LoC95-97/> [[Jørn Inge Tunsberg]] of [[Hades Almighty|Hades]] said that the interview had "grave consequences" for the rest of the scene and that they did not know he was going to talk to the press, as "he had said nothing". He added that they became "bloody angry" and he, Tunsberg, was "pissed off".<ref>Torstein Grude: ''[[Satan rir media]]'', 1998.</ref>

Norwegian magazine ''Rock Furore'' published an interview with Vikernes in February 1993. In it, he said of the prison system: "It's much too nice here. It's not hell at all. In this country prisoners get a bed, toilet and shower. It's completely ridiculous. I asked the police to throw me in a real dungeon, and also encouraged them to use violence".<ref>''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 42.</ref> He was released in March for lack of evidence.<ref name=LoC95-97/>

Shortly after this episode, the Oslo police dispatched its Church Fire Group to Bergen, where they set up a makeshift headquarters in the Hotel Norge. According to ''Lords of Chaos'', citing a police report, Vikernes knocked on their door and "virtually forced his way into the suite". He was "dressed in [[Mail (armour)|chain mail]], carrying two large knives in his belt, and flanked by the two young men who apparently behaved as if they were his bodyguards or henchmen". Vikernes "stated that he was fed up with being harassed by the authorities, and that the police investigation into the Black Metal scene should be stopped". When told that he had no right to issue orders to the police, Vikernes "took one step back and raised his right arm in a [[Roman salute]]".<ref>''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 143.</ref>

===Murder of Øystein Aarseth===
In early 1993, animosity arose between Øystein Aarseth ('Euronymous') and Vikernes, and between Euronymous and the Swedish black metal scene.<ref name=LoC117>''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 117.</ref> After the ''Bergens Tidende'' episode, Euronymous decided to shut Helvete as it began to draw the attention of the police and media.<ref name=LoC120>''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 120.</ref>

On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes and Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch drove from Bergen to Euronymous's apartment at Tøyengata<ref name=purefucking>{{cite video |people=Stefan Rydehed (director) |year=2008 |title=Pure Fucking Mayhem |url= |medium=motion picture |language= |trans_title= |publisher=Index Verlag}}</ref> (English: Tøyen Street) in Oslo. Upon their arrival a confrontation began and Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous. His body was found on the stairs outside the apartment with 23 cut wounds – two to the head, five to the neck, and sixteen to the back.<ref>Steinke, Darcey. "Satan's Cheerleaders". ''[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]''. February 1996.</ref> At first, many blamed Swedish black metalers for the murder.<ref name=LoC117/>

It has been speculated that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at "out doing" the stabbing in Lillehammer.<ref name=Yahoo>[http://music.yahoo.com/mayhem/biography/ Mayhem Biography on Yahoo! Music]</ref> Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an [[electroshock weapon]], tie him up and [[torture]] him to death while [[snuff film|videotaping the event]]. Vikernes explains: "If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn't have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me".<ref name=untilthelight>{{cite video |people=Aaron Aites (director, producer), Audrey Ewell (director, producer) |year=2009 |title=[[Until the Light Takes Us]] |url= |medium=motion picture |language= |trans_title= |publisher=Variance Films}}</ref> He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned [[contract]] to ambush him.<ref name=burzumstory2/><ref name=untilthelight/> Blackthorn stood outside smoking while Vikernes climbed the stairs to Euronymous's apartment on the fourth floor.<ref name=burzumstory2/> Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door and handed him the contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous "panicked" and kicked him in the chest.<ref name=burzumstory2/> The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. Vikernes contends that most of Euronymous's cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle.<ref name=burzumstory2/> After the slaying, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes.<ref name=burzumstory2/> The self-defense story is doubted by [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] drummer [[Faust (musician)|Faust]]<ref>''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 123.</ref> and other members of the scene. {{Who|date=May 2013}}

According to Vikernes, Blackthorn only came along to show Euronymous some new guitar riffs and was "in the wrong place at the wrong time".<ref name=burzumstory2/> Blackthorn claims that, in the summer of 1993, he was almost [[Involuntary commitment|committed]] to a [[psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]] but fled to Bergen and stayed with Vikernes. He said Vikernes planned to murder Euronymous and pressured him into coming along. Blackthorn said of the murder, "I was neither for nor against it. I didn't give a shit about Øystein".<ref>''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 130.</ref> Vikernes called Blackthorn's claims a "defense [...] to make sure I couldn't blame him [for the murder]".<ref name=burzumstory2/>

Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen.<ref name=LoC120/> The police found 150&nbsp;kg of explosives and 3,000 rounds of ammunition in his home.<ref name="Dagbladet.no">{{cite web |author=Midtskogen, Rune |title="Greven" angrer ingenting |date=4 July 2009 |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/07/04/magasinet/innenriks/kriminalomsorg/kirkebrann/drapsdom/7051663/ |accessdate=25 August 2009 |language=Norwegian |trans_title="The Count" regrets nothing}}</ref> According to the ''Encyclopedia of White Power'', Vikernes said that these explosives were "intended to blow up [[Blitz (movement)|Blitz House]], the radical leftist and anarchist enclave in Oslo",<ref name="Kapl-319"/> a plan which "was reportedly on the verge of execution"<ref name="Kapl-319"/> and only prevented by Vikernes's arrest. In an article originally published in 1999, [[Kevin Coogan]] points to Vikernes's planned attack on the Blitz House as a possible motive for the murder of Euronymous. Coogan writes: "''Lords of Chaos'' offers strong evidence that Vikernes [...] was a fascist well before he became a metalhead." Then he, too, mentions Vikernes's intent to "destroy an Oslo-based punk anti-fascist squat called Blitz House",<ref name="Coogan">Coogan 1999</ref> and concludes: "Vikernes may have felt that he had no choice but to kill Euronymous before bombing Blitz House because 'the Communist' would almost certainly have opposed such an act".<ref name="Coogan"/> The media also speculated that Euronymous and Vikernes had plotted to blow up [[Nidaros Cathedral]], which appears on the cover of ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]''. Vikernes denied these claims in a 2009 interview, stating "I was getting [the explosives and ammunition] in order to defend Norway if we were attacked any time. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union could have decided to attack us. We have no reason to trust neither the government, the royal family or the military because of what happened last time we were attacked. We are left to ourselves".<ref name="Dagbladet.no"/>

===Trial===
Vikernes's trial began on 2 May 1994. Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were put on trial around the same time. Some of them confessed to their crimes and implicated others. According to ''Lords of Chaos'', "Vikernes is disgusted by the fact that, while he held fast to a code of silence, others confessed".<ref name=LoC141>''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 141.</ref> During the trial the media made Vikernes "the nation's first real bogeyman in fifty years".<ref>''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 145.</ref> At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn and another friend had planned the murder. The third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi. To make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes's credit card.<ref>''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 129.</ref> On 16 May 1994,<ref name="Count Regrets Nothing"/> Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150&nbsp;kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, "presumably as a statement of symbolic support".<ref name=LoC141/> Blackthorn, although he hadn't taken part to Aarseth's murder, having gone down the condominium's stairs to smoke, was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice.<ref name=LoC141/> Vikernes smiled when his verdict was read, and an image was widely reprinted in the news media.

That month saw the release of Mayhem's album ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'', which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Campion |coauthors= |title=In the Face of Death |date=20 February 2005 |publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1419364,00.html |work=[[The Observer]] |pages= | accessdate=6 October 2007}}</ref> Before the release, Euronymous's family had asked Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said "I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts, but I never did".<ref name=guardian/>

===Time in prison===
Vikernes served his sentence at the prisons in Bergen, [[Tønsberg]], [[Ringerike Prison|Ringerike]], [[Trondheim Prison|Trondheim]] and [[Tromsø]].

[[File:Vargsmål.gif|thumb|right|Vargsmål]]

In late 1994, Vikernes wrote a Norwegian-language book called ''Vargsmål''. He said he wrote it to defend himself against "all the media lies" and that the book is marked by his isolation and anger at the time. However, Vikernes claims that "the prison authorities confiscated the manuscript, and for several years I wasn't allowed to even proof-read it. It was an unfinished manuscript, consisting of many separate articles, and ideally I would have been able to make some changes before it was published, but I wasn't. Eventually I gave up and just published it as it was - with all the errors and not-so-balanced articles".<ref name=vargbooks>Vikernes, Varg. [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_comment_to_vargsmal_and_other_books_by_varg_vikernes.shtml "A Comment To "Vargsmål" And Other Books By Varg Vikernes"]. Burzum.org. 15 December 2004. Retrieved 4 April 2013.</ref>

On 8 April 1997, Norwegian police arrested five [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] in [[Hemnes]]. According to police, the young men were part of a self-styled "[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe]]" and were plotting attacks on political and religious figures in Norway. They also had plans to break Vikernes out of prison.<ref name=LOC362>''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 362</ref> The group "had all the trappings of a paramilitary unit", including guns, explosives, bulletproof vests, steel helmets and balaclavas.<ref name=LOC362/> One of its members, Tom Eiternes, had befriended Vikernes in prison before escaping while on leave.<ref name=LOC362/> Vikernes's mother, Lene Bore, was arrested for supplying the group with 100,000 [[Norwegian krone|kroner]]. She confessed, but claimed she did not know they were "right-wing extremists" and said her son was being attacked by fellow inmates. In late 1996 his jaw had reportedly been broken in a fight with another inmate. However, the prison director said her claims were unfounded, and police suspected that the money came from Vikernes himself.<ref name=LOC362/> ''Lords of Chaos'' says that Vikernes adopted a "[[White power skinhead|skinhead]]" look and wore a belt buckle with SS insignia around this time.<ref name=LOC362/> Despite her confession, Bore was not convicted,<ref name=LOC362/> and in 1998 the case against the "Einsatzgruppe" was dropped.<ref>''Lords of Chaos'' (2003), p. 369</ref>

During his time in prison, Vikernes recorded two albums made up wholly of [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[dark ambient]] music. The first, ''[[Dauði Baldrs]]'', was recorded in 1994–1995 and released in October 1997. The second, ''[[Hliðskjálf (album)|Hliðskjálf]]'', was recorded in 1998 and released in April 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intro.de/kuenstler/interviews/23043719/norwegischer-black-metal-als-die-kirchen-brannten |title=Norwegischer Black Metal |language=de |publisher=Intro.de |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> Vikernes was denied access to an electric guitar, bass guitar or drums, and instead used a synthesizer. In 2000, Vikernes ended his musical project. He believed that his philosophy was constantly misinterpreted by an ignorant fan base that was too closely related to black metal and Satanism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/lords_of_chaos_review.shtml |title=Varg Vikernes – A review of M.

Between 1998 and 2004, Vikernes would write a further five books in prison.<ref name=vargbooks/> In 1998 he wrote a Norwegian-language book called ''Germansk Mytologi og Verdensanskuelse'' ("Teutonic Mythology and Worldview"). Apart from ''Vargsmål'', this is the only other book that was published. In 2004 he translated it into English, added new material, and renamed it ''The Mysteries and Mythology of Ancient Scandinavia''. In 1999 he wrote ''EihwaR'', a "philosophical/political/historical novel in form of a dialogue between a student and an oppositional". This too he translated into English and renamed ''The Religion of the Blood''. That year he also wrote a Norwegian and English translation and interpretation of ''[[Völuspá]]''. In 2000–2001 he wrote ''Teorier'' ("Theories"). It offered some theories on the origin of different customs and beliefs, and contained several short stories about the prehistoric era. However, he decided to scrap this book. In 2003–2004 he wrote a "gothic-fantasy novel" called ''The Cult of Hel''.<ref name=vargbooks/> By late 2003 he had begun writing articles for Burzum.org, which became the official Burzum website.<ref>[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2010_interview_terrorizer.shtml Interview with Varg Vikernes for "Terrorizer" Magazine (#194, March 2010), by James Minton].

In it, he wrote that he had received death threats and another inmate had tried to strangle him shortly after the newspaper article was published.<ref name=blabberoct27/> For his actions, thirteen months were added to Vikernes's sentence and he was moved to a prison in Ringerike. In July 2004 he was moved to a maximum-security prison in Trondheim. The last three years of his sentence were spent in [[Tromsø Prison]].

When Vikernes was convicted, it was possible to be released on parole after serving 12 years of a 21-year sentence, but in 2002, before he became eligible, the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] had extended this to 14 years. In June 2006, after serving 12 years, Vikernes was denied parole by the Department of Criminal Justice for this reason.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> His lawyer, John Christian Elden, has complained that the policy change is a form of [[Ex post facto law|retroactive legislation]]. Article 97 of the Norwegian constitution forbids any law being given retroactive force.

In 2014, the Russian version of ''Vargsmaal'', ''Rechi Varga'', was removed from the Burzum site by order of the Russian government.

==Personal beliefs and views==
According to Goodrick-Clarke, "while in jail, Vikernes began to formulate his nationalist heathen ideology using material from Norse mythology combined with racism and occult National Socialism."<ref name="GC204"/> Goodrick-Clarke bases this account of Vikernes' beliefs on some articles that Vikernes had written for the short-lived "neo-Nazi magazine" ''Filosofem'', published by Vidar von Herske. Goodrick-Clarke also uses the book ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos]]'', and a manifesto called ''Vargsmål'' ('Speech of the Wolf'), which Vikernes began to write after his imprisonment. According to ''Lords of Chaos'', ''Vargsmål'' became available on the internet for some time in 1996, but not in a printed form.<ref>''Lords of Chaos'' (1998):159</ref> In 1997, a Norwegian publisher released a paperback edition of the book; its publication was financed by Vikernes' mother, Helene Bore.<ref name = "hist">{{cite book |last=Christe |first=Ian |title=Sound of the Beast: the Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Inc. |year=2003 |location=New York, New York |page=279 |url= |id= |isbn=}}</ref> Vikernes has denounced the English translation of his book in an article on his website.

In ''[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]]'', director [[Sam Dunn]] described Vikernes as "the most notorious [[Heavy metal music|metal]] musician of all time"<ref>{{cite video |people=Dunn, Sam (Director) |date=5 August 2005 |url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0478209/ |title=Metal: A Headbanger's Journey |medium=motion picture |location=Canada |publisher=Dunn, Sam}}</ref>

===Political affiliation===
After his conviction, Vikernes began identifying himself as a [[neo-Nazi]].<ref name="Coogan"/> The ''[[Encyclopedia of White Power]]'' describes him as "busy promoting his [[Odinist]] and [[National Socialist]] philosophy from behind bars."<ref name="Kapl-319"/>

In a July 2005 statement on his website entitled "The Nazi Ghost",<ref name="Ghost">Varg Vikernes: [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story07.shtml ''A Burzum Story: Part VII - The Nazi Ghost''], July 2005, accessed on 5 December 2012.</ref> Vikernes states that although he "occasionally used the term 'nazism' to describe [his] ideological foundation", he no longer describes himself as a 'Nazi'.

<blockquote>The reason I have been drawn to and occasionally have expressed support for "nazism" is mainly because many of the Norwegian (and German) "nazis" embraced our Pagan religion as our blood-religion and they rejected [[Judeo-Christianity]] as Jewish [[heresy]]<ref name="Ghost"/></blockquote>

Vikernes expresses a desire to not be associated with [[Anti-Slavism|anti-Slavic]] sentiments. He identifies three things which distinguish him from the "Nazis": "unlike them I am not socialistic (not even on a [[Nazism|national]] level), I am not [[materialistic]] and I believe in (''the ancient [[Scandinavia]]n''!) democracy".<ref name="Ghost"/>

In the late 90s, "to avoid confusion" and "to find a term more suitable and accurate", Vikernes coined the term "odalism" based on the [[Odal (rune)|Odal]] rune. "[F]rom Norse ''óðal'' ([[homeland]], [[allod]]ium, [[Allodial title|allodial law]], [[nobility]], [[Nobility|noble]], [[inherited goods]], [[fatherland]], [[land property]], [[distinguished family]], [[distinguished]], splendid, [[Kinship|kin]] and the nation)."<ref name="Ghost"/> He explains, "In it lies [[Paganism]], [[traditional]] nationalism, [[Racism|racialism]] and environmentalism." Vikernes contrasts it with "modern 'civilization'" which he equates with "capitalism, [[materialism]], [[Judeo-Christianity]], pollution, urbanization, [[race-mixing]], [[Americanization]], socialism, [[globalization]], ''[[et cetera]]''". He places importance on the fact that odalism "is not a term tainted by history"; in contrast with nazism:
<blockquote>
The 'nazi ghost' has scared millions of Europeans from caring about their blood and homeland for sixty years now, and it is about time we banish this ghost and again start to think and care about the things that (whether we like it or not) are important to us.<ref name="Ghost"/>
</blockquote>

In other texts on his website, he embraces [[Nordicism]], racism<ref>With respect to what appears to be his interpretation of the [[Edda]], though there could be another source, Vikernes writes: "This is the mythology, a pretty unmistakably racist statement left to us from our forefathers."[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/paganism01.shtml Paganism: Part I – The Ancient Religion]</ref> and [[eugenics]] (''"race hygiene"'').<ref>"The mental hygiene and race hygiene practiced by the ancient Europeans also was disrupted by the introduction of Christianity." [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/paganism06.shtml Paganism: Part VI – Hygiene In The Pagan Era]</ref> However, he makes the point that following one's own culture is an equally valid and beneficial choice for all peoples.<ref name="Ghost"/> Vikernes states that although he is a racist, he hates no one and that "hatred is irrational".<ref name="Dagbladet.no"/>

In a response to a question from a fan, Vikernes expressed his contempt for the [[European Union]], describing it as being "thoroughly corrupt, extremely bureaucratic, predominately catholic and utterly chaotic".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2004_interview_bg.shtml |title=Interview with Varg Vikernes |publisher=Burzum.org |date=2004-08-12 |accessdate=2014-07-29}}</ref>

====Involvement in the Heathen Front====
According to several sources{{Who|date=December 2009}}, during his time in prison, Vikernes became a central figure in the [[Neo-völkisch movements|Neo-völkisch]] [[Heathen Front]]. The Heathen Front started as a group in Norway, ''Norsk Hedensk Front'' (Norwegian Heathen Front) or NHF, and grew into the international ''Allgermanische Heidnische Front'' (Pan-Germanic<!--This is the correct translation: Germanisch=Germanic, referring to the historic Germanic tribes, not to inhabitants of contemporary Germany--> Heathen Front) or AHF. At the time of their publication, the article on Vikernes in the ''Encyclopedia of White Power''<ref>"Vikernes is also the self-proclaimed leader of the Norsk Hedensk Front (Norwegian Heathen Front) and of an international heathen brotherhood he calls Cymophane." Article by Xavier Cattarinich, Kaplan 2000: 319.</ref> and ''[[Gods of the Blood]]'' by the Swedish scholar [[Matthias Gardell]]<ref>"Advocating national socialism, anti-Semitism, eugenics, and racist paganism, Vikernes launched Norsk Hedensk Front in 1993, which soon evolved into a network of independent tribes called the Allgermanische Heidnische Front (AHF)." Gardell 2003: 307.</ref> considered Vikernes to be the leader (and the founder) of the Norwegian Heathen Front. Goodrick-Clarke mentions that Vikernes underlined "his role as chieftain of his Norwegian Heathen Front" with the writing of ''Vargsmål''.<ref>Goodrick-Clarke 2003: 205.</ref>

In a 2009 interview with Vikernes, the Norwegian newspaper ''[[Dagbladet]]'' pointed out that he has been linked to neo-Nazi and racist groups during his time in prison.<ref name="Dagbladet.no"/> Vikernes replied: "I have never formed or been a member of such organizations. The only organization I am a member of is [[Riksmålsforbundet]]" (''The Society for the Preservation of Traditional Standard Norwegian'').<ref name="Dagbladet.no"/>

When he was asked about his involvement in the AHF in a 2004 interview published on burzum.org, Vikernes pointed out that it was [[Antifa]] groups who "repeatedly wrote" that the NHF was a Neo-Nazi group and that he was their leader, claims which he describes as "persecution".<ref name="BZINT"/> He also said that "the [Norwegian] secret police claimed adamantly" that he was the leader of the Heathen Front.<ref name="BZINT"/> Vikernes then continued by stating that, as a result of these claims, he left the Heathen Front, to see what "the Antifa/Monitor morons and the secret police would do". In practice, Vikernes stated, he never was a member of the group, since, being in prison, he could not participate in their activities and he had never "met half of them".<ref name="BZINT"/> If he would want to write articles for their magazine, he could do that, regardless of whether he was a member or not.<ref name="BZINT"/>

===Religion===
In a 2010 interview with "Vampiria" Magazine Spain (18-03-2010) Vikernes was asked about Odinism playing a major role in his life, to which he responded:

"Well, I am not religious in any way, but I have a Pagan ideology and Pagan values. I believe in blood, soil and honour; family, homeland and [[hamingja]]; strength, traditions and courage. And I believe in a Europe waking up."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2010_interview_vampiria.shtml |title=Interview with Varg Vikernes |publisher=Burzum.org |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2013-07-16}}</ref>

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Burzum-Flyer-92.jpg|thumb|right|Pro-Burzum Flyer with a list of church fires]] -->
Vikernes has written lyrics for several songs by [[Darkthrone]] that make use of themes from old [[German folklore|Germanic folklore]]. In these, [[Satan]] is referenced as an aspect of the Germanic god [[Odin]] in the context of an 'eye' that is a source of light (i.e. the sun), there are also mentions of a 'spear' and a 'hall of battle', which are also masked references to [[Odin]]. This was done with the double meaning of Odin as the 'adversary' of Jewish and Christian tradition. Many have thus inferred that Vikernes is or was a [[Satanism|Satanist]], though he has stated many times that he is opposed to Satanism as he considers it to be a reactionary form of Christianity.

According to Vikernes:
<blockquote>Christianity was created by some decadent and degenerated Romans as a tool of oppression, in the late Roman era, and it should be treated accordingly. It is like "handcuff's" to the mind and spirit and is nothing but destructive to mankind. In fact I don't really see Christianity as a religion. It is more like a spiritual plague, a mass psychosis, and it should first and foremost be treated as a problem to be solved by the medical science. Christianity is a diagnosis. It's like Islam and the other Asian "religions" a [[HIV/AIDS]] of the spirit and mind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalcrypt.com/pages/interviewsframe.php?intid=170 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090606001302/http://www.metalcrypt.com/pages/interviewsframe.php?intid=170 |archivedate=2009-06-06 |title=Varg Vikernes |publisher=The Metal Crypt |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref></blockquote>

Vikernes now embraces a "modern scientific worldview resting on a foundation made up of the Pagan values and ideals: loyalty, wisdom, courage, love, discipline, honesty, intelligence, beauty, responsibility, health and strength."<ref name="bards8">{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_bards_tale08.shtml |title=Bard's Tale: part VIII: Religion or Reason |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> He draws a direct connection between both [[race and intelligence]] and [[intelligence and religion]], denouncing [[theism]] as "mental enslavement" fit only for "inferior races".<ref name="bards8" /> Vikernes goes on to say "If it is supposed to serve a purpose Paganism needs to be an ideology, not a religion".<ref name="bards8" /> Despite accusing mainstream theists of holding onto "[[Stone Age]] misconceptions", Vikernes still holds that religious myths should be turned to in areas where science has not yet achieved a complete understanding of the natural world—such as the origin of life and where we go after death, if anywhere at all.<ref name="bards8" />

Later in 2009, he posted an article on his website, writing "I obviously live in a different world, where one can discuss ones perception of reality without any fear of harassment; a world of tolerance and respect, a world of intellectual debate and honesty. Some of You apparently don't, so when I speak I must be careful."<ref name="Varg Vikernes" group=Burzum.org>{{cite web|last=Vikernes|first=Varg|title=A Burzum Story: Part XI – Birds Of A Feather Flock Together|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story11.shtml|work=A Burzum Story|publisher=Majordomo|accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>

In addition to ''Vargsmål'', works by Vikernes on his personal [[world view]] include ''Irminsûl'' and ''Germansk Mytologi og Verdensanskuelse'' ('Germanic Mythology and Worldview').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arktos.com/germansk-mytologi-verdensanskuelse.html?___store=gbz|title=Germansk Mytologi & Verdensanskuelse|publisher=Arktos|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref>

In 2011, Vikernes published his first book in English, ''Sorcery and Religion in Ancient Scandinavia'', a revised version of ''Germansk Mytologi'' about the religious practices of Scandinavian peoples, particularly during the [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Vikernes| first = Varg| title = Varg Vikernes "Sorcery And Religion In Ancient Scandinavia"| date = 27 August 2011| url = http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/sorcery_and_religion_in_ancient_scandinavia.shtml | accessdate = 15 June 2012}}</ref> Rejecting most contemporary academic theories, he takes inspiration from [[Sir James Frazer]]'s work ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' in interpreting the myths as representing aspects of yearly rituals related to death, burial and ruling.<ref>{{cite book| last = Vikernes| first = Varg| title = Sorcery and Religion in Ancient Scandinavia| publisher = Abstract Sounds Books Ltd| edition = 1st| date = 5 December 2012| page = 6| isbn = 978-0-9566959-3-2}}</ref> It includes a new translation of the [[Völuspá]] with notes about what each stanza means according to Vikernes.<ref>{{cite web | last = Pomo| first = Brian| title = "Sorcery and Religion in Ancient Scandinavia" by Varg Vikernes| publisher = Heathen Harvest| date = 17 May 2012| url = http://heathenharvest.org/2012/05/17/sorcery-and-religion-in-ancient-scandinavia-by-varg-vikernes-3/| accessdate = 15 June 2012}}</ref>

In 2013, he and his wife Marie Cachet released a film called ''[[ForeBears]]'' based on ancient Norwegian pagan rituals.

===Influence of Vidkun Quisling===
[[Vidkun Quisling]], Nazi [[Collaborationism|collaborator]] [[minister-president]] of occupied Norway between 1942 and 1945 and involuntary originator of the term [[quisling]]-regime, had developed an extremely obscure [[Esotericism|esoteric]] doctrine labeled 'Universism'. An online article<ref>[http://www.bitsofnews.com/content/view/3965/2/ "The World According to Quisling"] by Gisle Tangenes, BitsofNews.com, 19 September 2006</ref> about him mentions that the only "modest intellectual influence" he ever had with this doctrine was "on certain extreme strains of Norwegian black metal music". This impression is indeed given in ''Lords of Chaos''. In the interview there, Varg Vikernes is faced with the question whether Quisling's religion was pagan or Christian.<ref>Lords of Chaos (First Edition), 163</ref> Moynihan & Søderlind write: "Vikernes has discovered his predecessor in Vidkun Quisling."<ref>Lords of Chaos (First Edition), 162</ref> At one point, he temporarily took the artist name 'Kvisling',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/discography/official/1997_daudi_baldrs.shtml |title=Discography – Official Releases – "Daudi Baldrs" ("Balder's Dod") 1997 |publisher=Burzum |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> but he explained this choice in ''Vargsmål'':
<blockquote>One of my foremothers was called Susanne Malene Qisling. She was born 06-02-1811 and dies {{sic}} 10-05-1891. Qisling means "that which stems from a division of kingly descendants" [...]</blockquote>

Vikernes stated in an interview, "They [the Norwegian government at the beginning of World War II] ran like chickens, leaving Norway, with absolutely NO authorities, and when Vidkun Quisling tried to bring order back, he was thanked with a bullet in his heart after the war."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.com/burzum/library/interviews/heresy/ |title=The Music of Burzum and the Writings of Varg Vikernes (with 1993 interview) |publisher=Burzum.com |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> This is the only known instance of Vikernes mentioning Vidkun Quisling, besides ''Lords of Chaos''; on www.burzum.org Vikernes does not mention Vidkun Quisling at all.<ref>other than the above-referenced mention of his great-great-grandmother's name: [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story05.shtml A Burzum Story: Part V – Satanism]</ref>

===''The Lord of the Rings''===
From an early age, Vikernes was fascinated with the fictional realm of [[Middle-earth]] created by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. His stage name ''[[Grishnakh#Grishnákh|Grishnackh]]'' is taken from that of an orc in ''[[The Two Towers]]''. The name ''Burzum'', meaning ''darkness'', was taken from the [[Black Speech]] inscribed on the [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The inscription read "Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk agh ''burzum''-ishi krimpatul" or in English "One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the ''darkness'' bind them." Additionally, before joining Old Funeral, he was in a band called [[Uruk-hai|Uruk-Hai]], also derived from ''The Lord of the Rings'' text.

Vikernes interpreted ''The Lord of the Rings'' on his website, pointing out the connections to paganism in the books, but also recognizing the Judeo-Christian context of Tolkien's Catholic beliefs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/paganism03.shtml |title=Paganism: Part III – The One Ring |publisher=Burzum.org |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref>

==Publicity==

===''Satan rir media''===
Torstein Grude created a Norwegian documentary entitled ''[[Satan rir media]]'' (''Satan Rides the Media''), to which Vikernes has given a more positive review. As its title implies, the movie focuses on the often hysterical media coverage of the church-burning cases and the black metal scene in general. In the film, Vikernes accuses a journalist who writes for ''[[Bergens Tidende]]'' of deliberately informing the police about his identity after he had completed an anonymous interview. Vikernes was arrested only hours after the interview, one day before it was published, and was released after a week in prison due to lack of proof. In the film, the head of criminal investigations, Bergen Police District evades the question whether the journalist preserved Vikernes' anonymity by stating "It was all OK and legal".

According to ''Satan rir media'', it was also the BT who gave Vikernes the name "Greven" (The Count). However, Vikernes has said in ''Vargsmål'' that "the reason I chose this name was not to have a tough name. The word 'count (greven)' comes from the Latin word 'comites', that means partner or companion. I am the true Germanic folk's 'partner' and 'companion' and with that I chose this title". However, in the documentary (ca. 12:20-12:30) he gives this answer to a question as to why he uses the name: "I mean, it is a relatively arrogant name, that means, it sets me above all other human beings. Like "Do this and that", and then they do it"

''Satan rir media'' claims that by emphasizing the Satanist angle, the Norwegian news media unwittingly created a mass following for Burzum and Vikernes, both in Norway and internationally.

===''Until the Light Takes Us''===
Vikernes is one of the central figures in the 2009 documentary film ''[[Until The Light Takes Us]]''. Interviewed in prison by American directors Aaron Aites and Audrey Ewell, Vikernes explains, in great detail, the circumstances surrounding both the creation of black metal and the murder of Euronymous.

===Influence on other church arsons===
[[File:Church.20060530 PM.porvoo of finland.ojp.jpg|thumb|right|Vikernes's actions allegedly inspired Kalle Holm to burn Porvoo Cathedral in Finland.]]
* Novak Majstorovic, then 19-year-old guitarist of the metal band Schwarzreich, was charged with arson and burglary in relation to the burning of a 100+-year-old [[United and uniting churches|Uniting Church]] in [[Ascot Vale, Victoria|Ascot Vale]], Australia in August 2004. He was convicted and sentenced to three years in Youth Detention. In all media depictions of the event, he is said to have been heavily influenced by Burzum. However, he has stated on several message boards across the internet that the influence does not stretch beyond the superficial, and that the media has overblown his statements to the police to suit their own ends. He claims that the arson had very little in common with Vikernes' attacks. Majstorovic was released in August 2006. His current whereabouts are unknown.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/dont-simply-demonise-death-metal/2005/09/28/1127804542833.html/ |title=Johnston, Chris.

A community centre was built behind the facade.
* Kalle Holm, an 18-year-old [[Finland|Finn]] known to have played drums in several Finnish metal bands, has stated on his website that he was influenced by Burzum. He set fire to the [[Porvoo Cathedral]] in Finland in May 2006: the roof of the church burned, but the ceiling, vaults and interiors survived undamaged. The attorney's claims that the motives behind the arson were related to a "hatred towards Christianity" were overruled in court. He was sentenced to three years and two months of imprisonment without parole.<ref>Helsingin Sanomat: [http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Porvoon+tuomiokirkon+tulipalosta+yli+kolmen+vuoden+vankeustuomio/1135221308860 Porvoon tuomiokirkon tulipalosta yli kolmen vuoden vankeustuomio] {{fi icon}}</ref> The sentence was later doubled to six years and six months by the Court of Appeal.<ref>Helsingin Sanomat: [http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Hovioikeus+kovensi+Porvoon+kirkon+sytytt%C3%A4j%C3%A4n+tuomiota/1135227276873 Hovioikeus kovensi Porvoon kirkon sytyttäjän tuomiota] {{fi icon}}</ref>
* The ''[[Winnipeg Sun]]'' reported that three people were convicted on 27 June 2006 of arson in a fire that destroyed the Minnedosa [[United Church of Canada|United Church]] in [[Minnedosa, Manitoba]], Canada on 12 February 2006. One was sentenced to three years in prison, the second to two years and the third to two years less a day. All three were ordered to pay CAD $1.2 million in restitution. Justice officials said the church was set on fire on 11 February, Vikernes' birthday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=54325 |title=Canadian Black Metal Arsonists Receive Jail Time – 28 June 2006 |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref>

'''Morbid Angel''' is an American [[death metal]] band based in [[Tampa, Florida]]. [[United Kingdom|UK]] music magazine ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' ranked Morbid Angel's 1989 debut ''[[Altars of Madness]]'' first in its list "Top 40 greatest death metal albums". ''[[Decibel Magazine]]'' also rated guitarist [[Trey Azagthoth]] as the number one "death metal guitarist ever".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2007/06/26/decibel-magazine-names-the-top-20-death-metal-guitarists-of-all-time/ |title=DECIBEL MAGAZINE NAMES THE TOP 20 DEATH METAL GUITARISTS OF ALL TIME |publisher=MetalSucks |date=2007-06-26 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}</ref> The band's songs are complex in arrangement, owing to the considerable technical skills of both Azagthoth and drummer [[Pete Sandoval]], who also played in the [[grindcore]] band [[Terrorizer]]. According to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], Morbid Angel is the third best-selling death metal band in the United States (after [[Cannibal Corpse]] and [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]] up until 2003 with sales of over 445,000),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2003/11/18/115317.php|title=Morbid Angel is the Third Best Selling Death Metal Band (Hitting this mark with only 8 Albums)|publisher=Blogcritics|year=2003|accessdate=2003}}</ref> with their third album ''[[Covenant (Morbid Angel album)|Covenant]]'' being the best-selling death metal album during the beginning of the Soundscan era time with over 150,000 units sold.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2003/11/18/115317.php|title=Best Selling Death Metal Album is covenant|publisher=Blogcritics|year=2003|accessdate=2003}}</ref>

==History==
Morbid Angel was formed in 1984 in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]]. The band made their debut in 1987 on the [[New Renaissance Records]] record label. They recorded their debut album, ''Abominations of Desolation'', in 1986, but the band was unsatisfied with the final product and it remained unreleased until 1991. Their first proper studio album, ''[[Altars of Madness]]'', was released in 1989.

Morbid Angel was one of the original [[death metal]] bands signed to [[Earache Records]], and was also influential in the transition of death metal from its [[thrash metal]] roots to its current form by incorporating guttural vocals, up-tempo [[blast beat]]s, [[atonality]] in guitar soloing, and dark, chunky, mid-paced rhythms. They were also the first death metal band to have a touch of mainstream success in connection with being signed to [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records]] in 1992 and having the music video for the song "God of Emptiness" shown on an episode of ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]''.

The band's original lyrical themes focused mostly on [[Satanism]], [[occultism]] and [[anti-Christian]] subject matter, but from ''[[Blessed Are the Sick]]'' onward, the lyrics moved toward the ancient [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian gods]]. Much of this is a nod to the [[Simon Necronomicon]], which was influenced by Sumerian mythology, the author [[H. P. Lovecraft]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hplovecraft.com/popcult/music.asp |title=HPLA – Lovecraftian Music |publisher=Hplovecraft.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> and fascination with the [[Roman Empire]]. However, some anti-religious elements continue to permeate the lyrics. Their albums are notable for being released in alphabetical order (their first album starts with the letter A, the second with B, etc.). Guitarist [[Trey Azagthoth]] commented in an interview that it was a coincidence with the first two albums, but has been done consciously since then.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/MorbidAngel-Sept2003.htm |title=Morbid Angel Interview |publisher=Metal-Rules.com |date=2003-09-23 |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref>

Morbid Angel's appearance on some of the mid-summer 2008 European festivals was announced as a "short break from writing and pre-production of their new 8th studio album".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morbidangel.com/lavareport1.html |title=NEWS / LavaReport |publisher=MorbidAngel.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> In May 2008, it was announced that [[Destructhor|Thor Anders Myhren]] of [[Zyklon]] and [[Myrkskog]] would be the band's new guitarist.<ref>{{cite web|author=9:58 AM |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=36732 |title=Morbid Angel Announces New Guitarist – in Metal News |publisher=Metal Underground.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> Myhren will also appear on the new album. During European tours and festivals in 2008, a new song entitled "Nevermore" was played from the forthcoming album.

On March 5, 2011, the band headlined the [[Scion Rock Fest]] in [[Pomona, California]]. This performance was their first in the US in six years, aside from a one-off show in Los Angeles in May 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2011/01/scion_pomona_morbid_angel.php|title=EXCLUSIVE: Scion Rock Fest 2011 to Be Held in Pomona, Metal Legends Morbid Angel (Featuring "the Greatest Death Metal Guitarist Ever") to Headline|date=January 12, 2011|publisher=laweekly.com|accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> On March 18, 2010, the band announced that [[Tim Yeung]] would play drums on the upcoming album, allowing Pete Sandoval to recover from back surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=54109|title=Morbid Angel Drummer Pete Sandoval Undergoes Back Surgery|date=March 18, 2010|publisher=MetalUnderground.com|accessdate=2010-03-18}}</ref> On June 22, 2010, the band entered the studio to begin the recording of their new full-length album.<ref name="BM2011Album">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=142041 |title=MORBID ANGEL Begins Recording New Album |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> On March 9, 2011, Morbid Angel confirmed that their new album would be called ''[[Illud Divinum Insanus]]''.<ref name="BMIllud" /> The album was released on June 7, 2011 on Season of Mist.<ref name="BM2011Album" /><ref name="BMIllud">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=155065|title=Morbid Angel: New Album Title Revealed|date=March 9, 2011|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=2011-03-09}}</ref> In an interview in December 2013, David Vincent confirmed that Pete Sandoval is no longer a member of the band, claiming that Sandoval had "found Jesus", and stating, "Pete Sandoval and Morbid Angel are not compatible", laying to rest speculation that Sandoval would eventually be returning to the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2013/12/interview-dave-vincent-of-morbid-angel/|title=Interview: Dave Vincent of Morbid Angel|date=December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013|publisher=Invisible Oranges}}</ref>

A '''royalty''' (sometimes, '''running royalties''', or '''private sector taxes''') is a usage-based payment made by one party (the "[[licensee]]") to another (the "licensor") for the right to ongoing use of an [[asset]], sometimes an [[intellectual property]] (IP). Royalties are typically agreed upon as a percentage of gross or net revenues derived from the use of an asset or a fixed price per unit sold of an item of such, but there are also other modes and metrics of compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aar.com.au/pubs/tax/fotaxapr04.htm|title=Focus: Tax and Intellectual Property – April 2004|publisher=Allens Arthur Robinson|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1870&bold=|publisher=law.com|title=Royalty (definition)|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Manual on Technology Transfer Negotiation|year=1996|publisher=United Nations Industrial Development Organization|location=Vienna|isbn=92-1-106302-7|author=United Nations Industrial Development Organization}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated3>Guidelines for Evaluation of Transfer of Technology Agreements, United Nations, New York, 1979</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|title=Licensing Guide for Developing Countries: A Guide on the Legal Aspects of the Negotiation and Preparation of Industrial Property Licenses and Technology Transfer Agreements Appropriate to the Needs of Developing Countries|year=1977|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=92-805-0395-2}}</ref><ref>UNIDO International Workshop on Technology Transfer Negotiation and Plant Level Technology Needs Assessment, 7–8 December 1999, New Delhi.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vertexips.com/information/articles/licensing.html | author=Dave Tyrrell | title=Intellectual Property & Licensing | publisher=Vertex|accessdate=2007-09-14}}</ref>  A '''royalty interest''' is the right to collect a stream of future royalty payments, often used in the [[oil industry|oil]] and [[music industry|music industries]] to describe a percentage ownership of future production or revenues from a given [[leasehold]], which may be divested from the original owner of the asset.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=royalty%20interest | publisher=Schlumberger|title=Royalty interest (definition)|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref>

A [[license agreement]] defines the terms under which a resource or property such as [[petroleum]], [[minerals]], [[patent]]s, [[trademark]]s, and [[copyright]]s are [[license]]d by one party to another, either without restriction or subject to a limitation on term, business or geographic territory, type of product, etc. License agreements can be regulated, particularly where a government is the resource owner, or they can be private contracts that follow a general structure. However, certain types of [[franchising|franchise]] agreements have comparable provisions.{{Clarify|How is this related to royalties?|date=January 2012}}

== Non-renewable resource royalties ==
The owner of petroleum and mineral resources may licence a party to extract those resources while paying a [[resource rent]], or a royalty on the value or the resultant [[Profit (accounting)|profits]]. When a [[government]] is the owner of the resource the terms of the licence and the royalty rate are typically legislated or [[regulated]]. In the United States, [[Fee simple]] ownership of the mineral is possible by a private individual, therefore payments of mineral royalties to private citizens occurs quite often. Local taxing authorities may impose a [[severance tax]] on the unrenewable natural resources extracted (or severed) from within their authority. The Federal Government receives royalties on production on federal lands, managed by the  [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement]], formerly the Minerals Management Service.

An example from [[Canada]]'s north is the [[Government of Canada|federal]] [[Frontier Lands]] petroleum royalty regime. The royalty rate is determined as an incremental rate from 1–5% of gross [[revenues]] until costs have been recovered, at which point the royalty rate increases to 30% of net [[revenues]] or 5% of gross revenues. In this manner risks and profits are shared between the government of Canada (as resource owner) and the petroleum developer. This attractive royalty rate is intended to encourage oil and gas exploration in the remote Canadian frontier lands where costs and risks are higher than other locations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In many jurisdictions oil and gas royalty interests are considered real property under the NAICS classification code and qualify for a 1031 like-kind exchange.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oilgas1031.com/ |title=oilgas1031.com |publisher=oilgas1031.com |accessdate=2013-05-04}}</ref>

Oil and Gas Royalties are paid as a set percentage on all revenue, less any deductions that may be taken by the well operator as specifically noted in the lease agreement between the well operator and the mineral right owner.  The revenue decimal, or royalty interest that a mineral owner receives is calculated as a function of the percentage of the total drilling unit to which a specific owner holds the mineral interest, the royalty rate defined in that owner's mineral lease, and any tract participation factors applied to the specific tracts owned.<ref>http://www.broadmoorminerals.com/resources/learn-more-sell-oil-and-gas-royalties-and-interests.html</ref>

As a standard example, for every $100 bbl of oil sold on a U.S. federal well with a 25% royalty, the U.S. government receives $25. The U.S. government does not pay and will only collect revenues. All risk and liability lie upon the operator of the well.

Royalties in the forestry industry are called "[[stumpage]]".

== Patent royalties ==
{{Licensing of patents}}
A [[patent]]<ref name=autogenerated3 /><ref name=autogenerated1 /> gives the owner an [[exclusive right]] to prevent others from practising the patented technology in the country issuing the patent for the [[Term of patent|term of the patent]]. The right may be enforced in a lawsuit for [[monetary damages]] and/or imprisonment for violation on the patent. In accordance with a patent licence, royalties are paid to the patent owner in exchange for the right to practise one or more of the four basic patent rights: to manufacture with, to use, to sell, or to [[advertise for sale]] of a patented technology.

Patent rights may be divided and licensed out in various ways, on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. The licence may be subject to limitations as to time or territory. A licence may encompass an entire technology or it may involve a mere component or improvement on a technology.   In the United States, "reasonable" royalties may be imposed, both after-the-fact and prospectively, by a court as a remedy for [[Copyright infringement|infringement]].

===Patent royalty rates===
The following are prevalent rates within the United States :<ref>{{cite web | title=Ranges of royalty rates, and royalty guidelines, U.S. Pharmaceutical Industry | url=http://www.cptech.org/ip/health/royalties/ | accessdate = 2007-07-19}}</ref>

:* a pending patent on a strong [[business plan]], royalties of the order of 1%
:* issued patent, 1%+ to 2%
:* the pharmaceutical with pre-clinical testing, 2–3%

With regards to the actual rates of royalty payments in the industry, the Licensing Economics Review,<ref>The Royalty Rate Journal of Intellectual Property, December 2002, p. 8.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Sample: License Parameters | url=http://www.intellectualpropertyanalysis.com/article4.html|accessdate = 2007-10-26}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref> reported in 2002 that in a review of 458 licence agreements, over a 16-year period, it found that an average royalty rate of 7.0%. However, the range extended from 0%  to 50%. All of these agreements may not have been at "arms length".

In the Arab countries, it may be found, that a royalty as a percentage of sales may be difficult to transact; a flat fee may be preferred as percentages may be interpreted as percentage of profit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mallat.com/articles/joint_ventures.htm |title=Joint ventures in Lebanese and European law |first=Chibli |last=Mallat |publisher=mallat.com |accessdate=29 November 2010}}</ref>

==Trade mark royalties==
[[Trade marks]] are words, logos, slogans, sounds, or other distinctive expressions that distinguish the source, origin, or sponsorship of a good or service (in which they are generally known as [[service mark]]s). Trade marks offer the public a means of identifying and assuring themselves of the quality of the good or service. They may bring consumers a sense of security, integrity, belonging, and a variety of intangible appeals. The value that inures to a trade mark in terms of public recognition and acceptance is known as goodwill.

A trade mark right is an exclusive right to sell or market under that mark within a geographic territory. The rights may be licensed to allow a company other than the owner to sell goods or services under the mark. A company may seek to license a trade mark it did not create in order to achieve instant [[name recognition]] rather than accepting the cost and risk of entering the market under its own brand that the public does not necessarily know or accept. Licensing a trade mark allows the company to take advantage of already-established goodwill and brand identification.

Like patent royalties, trade mark royalties may be assessed and divided in a variety of different ways, and are expressed as a percentage of sales volume or income, or a fixed fee per unit sold. When negotiating rates, one way companies value a trade mark is to assess the additional profit they will make from increased sales and higher prices (sometimes known as the "relief from royalty") method.

Trade mark rights and royalties are often tied up in a variety of other arrangements. Trade marks are often applied to an entire [[brand]] of products and not just a single one. Because trade mark law has as a public interest goal of the protection of a consumer, in terms of getting what they are paying for, trade mark licences are only effective if the company owning the trade mark also obtains some assurance in return that the goods will meet its quality standards. When the rights of trade mark are licensed along with a know-how, supplies, pooled advertising, etc., the result is often a [[franchising|franchise]] relationship. Franchise relationships may not specifically assign royalty payments to the trade mark licence, but may involve monthly fees and percentages of sales, among other payments.

===Trade mark royalty rates===
In a long-running dispute in the United States involving the valuation of the DHL trade mark of [[DHL Express|DHL Corporation]],<ref>{{cite web | title=DHL Corporation and Subsidiaries vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Docket Nos. 19570-95, 26103-95, United States Tax Court.|url=http://www.ausinc.com/news/More_on_Trademark.pdf  |format=PDF|accessdate =2007-09-09}}</ref> it was reported that experts employed by the [[IRS]] surveyed a wide range of businesses and found a broad range of royalties for trade mark use from a low of 0.1% to a high of 15%.

===Franchises===
While a payment to employ a trade mark licence is a royalty, it is accompanied by a "guided usage manual", the use of which may be audited from time to time. However, this becomes a ''supervisory'' task when the mark is used in a [[franchising|franchise]] agreement for the sale of goods or services carrying the reputation of the mark. For a franchise, it is said, a ''fee'' is paid, even though it comprises a royalty element.

To be a franchise, the agreement must be a composite of the items:
::*  the right to use a trade mark to offer, sell or distribute goods or services (the trademark element)
::*  payment of a required royalty or fee (the fee element)
::*  significant assistance or control with respect to the franchisee’s business (the supervisory element)

One of the above three items must ''not'' apply for the franchise agreement to be considered a trade mark agreement (and its laws and conventions). In a franchise, for which there is no convention, laws apply concerning training, brand support, operating systems/support and technical support in a written format ("Disclosure").<ref>Dicenstein_brands_2005-2.pdf</ref>

== Copyright ==
Copyright law gives the owner the right to prevent others from copying, creating [[derivative work]]s, or using their works. Copyrights, like patent rights, can be divided in many different ways, by the right implicated, by specific geographic or market territories, or by more specific criteria. Each may be the subject of a separate license and royalty arrangements.

Copyright royalties are often very specific to the nature of work and field of endeavor. With respect to music, royalties for [[performance right]]s in the United States are set by the [[Library of Congress]]' [[Copyright Royalty Board]]. Performance rights to [[recording]]s of a performance are usually managed by one of several [[performance rights organization]]s. Payments from these organizations to performing [[artist]]s are known as [[residual (entertainment industry)|residuals]] and performance royalties. [[Royalty-free music]] provides more direct compensation to the artists. In 1999, recording artists formed the [[Recording Artists' Coalition]] to repeal supposedly "technical revisions" to American copyright statutes which would have classified all "sound recordings" as "works for hire", effectively assigning artists' copyrights to [[record label]]s.<ref>{{cite web | title=Four little words | url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/music/feature/2000/08/28/work_for_hire/print.html | accessdate = 2007-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Don Henley Speaks on Behalf of Recording Artists | url=http://www.yourcongress.com/ViewArticle.asp?article_id=1263  | accessdate = 2007-03-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060117191640/http://www.yourcongress.com/ViewArticle.asp?article_id=1263 |archivedate = 2006-01-17}}</ref>

Book [[author]]s may sell their [[copyright]] to the [[publishing|publisher]]. Alternatively, they might receive as a royalty a certain amount per book sold. It is common in the [[UK]] for example, for authors to receive a 10% royalty on book sales.

Some [[photographer]]s and [[musician]]s may choose to publish their works for a one-time payment. This is known as a [[royalty-free]] license.

==Book publishing royalties==
All book-publishing royalties are paid by the publisher, who determines an author's royalty rate, except in rare cases in which the author can demand high advances and royalties.

For most cases, the publishers advance an amount (part of the royalty) which can constitute the bulk of the author’s total income plus whatever little flows from the "running royalty" stream. Some costs may be attributed to the advance paid, which depletes further advances to be paid or from the running royalty paid. The author and the publisher can independently draw up the agreement that binds them or alongside an agent representing the author. There are many risks for the author—definition of cover price, the retail price, "net price", the discounts on the sale, the bulk sales on the POD ([[print on demand|publish on demand]]) platform, the term of the agreement, audit of the publishers accounts in case of impropriety, etc. which an agent can provide.

The following illustrates the income to an author on the basis chosen for royalty, particularly in POD, which minimizes losses from [[inventory]] and is based on computer technologies.

Hardback royalties on the published price of trade books usually range from 10% to 12.5%, with 15% for more important authors. On paperback it is usually 7.5% to 10%, going up to 12.5% only in exceptional cases. All the royalties displayed below are on the "cover price". Paying 15% to the author can mean that the other 85% of the cost pays for editing and [[proof-reading]], printing and binding, overheads, and the profits (if any) to the publisher.

The publishing company pays no royalty on bulk purchases of books since the buying price may be a third of the cover price sold on a singles basis.

Unlike the UK, the United States does not specify a "maximum retail price" for books that serves as base for calculation.

== Music royalties ==
Unlike other forms of intellectual property, music royalties have a strong linkage to individuals – composers (score), songwriters (lyrics) and writers of musical plays – in that they can own the exclusive copyright to created music and can license it for performance independent of corporates. Recording companies and the performing artists that create a "sound recording" of the music enjoy a '''separate''' set of copyrights and royalties from the sale of recordings and from their digital transmission (depending on national laws).

With the advent of pop music and major innovations in technology in the communication and presentations of media, the subject of music royalties has become a complex field with considerable change in the making.

A [[musical composition]] obtains protection in copyright law immediate to its reduction to tangible form – a score on paper or a taping; but it is not protected from infringed use unless registered with the copyright authority; for instance, the [[Copyright Office]] in the United States, administered by the [[Library of Congress]]. No person or entity, other than the copyright owner, can use or employ the music for gain without obtaining a license from the composer/songwriter.

Inherently, as copyright, it confers on its owner, a distinctive "bundle" of five exclusive rights:

: (a) to make copies of the songs through print or recordings
: (b) to distribute them to the public for profit
: (c) to the "public performance right"; live or through a recording
: (d) to create a derivative work to include elements of the original music; and
: (e) to "display" it (not very relevant in context).

Where the score and the lyric of a composition are contributions of different persons, each of them is an equal owner of such rights.

These exclusivities have led to the evolution of distinct commercial terminology used in the music industry.

They take four forms:
: (1) royalties from "print rights"
: (2)  ''mechanical royalties'' from the recording of composed music on CDs and tape
: (3)  ''performance royalties'' from the performance of the compositions/songs on stage or television through artists and bands, and
: (4)  ''synch (for synchronization) royalties'' from using or adapting the musical score in the movies, television advertisements, etc. and

With the advent of the internet, an additional set of royalties has come into play: the ''digital rights'' from simulcasting, webcasting, streaming, downloading, and online "on-demand service".

In the following the terms "composer" and "songwriter" (either lyric or score) are synonymous.

===Print rights in music===

====Brief history====
While the focus here is on royalty rates pertaining to music marketed in the print form or "sheet music", its discussion is a prelude to the much more important and larger sources of royalty income today from music sold in media such as CDs, television and the internet.

[[Sheet music]] is the first form of music to which royalties were applied, which was then gradually extended to other formats. Any performance of music by singers or bands requires that it be first reduced to its written sheet form from which the "song" (score) and its lyric are read. Otherwise, the authenticity of its origin, essential for copyright claims will be lost as has been the case with folk songs and American "westerns" propagated by the aural tradition.

The ability to print music arises from a series of technological developments in print and art histories over a long span of time (from the 11th to the 18th century) of which two will be highlighted.

The first, and commercially successful, invention was the development of the "movable type" printing press, the [[Gutenberg press]] in the 15th century. It was used to print the well-known Gutenberg bible and later the printing system enabled printed music. Printed music, till then, tended to be one line chants. The difficulty in using movable type for music is that all the elements must align – the note head must be properly aligned with the staff, lest it have an unintended meaning.

[[Musical notation]] was well developed by then, originating around 1025. [[Guido d'Arezzo]] developed a system of pitch notation using lines and spaces. Until this time, only two lines had been used. Guido expanded this system to four lines, and initiated the idea of ledger lines by adding lines above or below these lines as needed. He used square notes called neumes. This system eliminated any uncertainty of pitch which existed at that time. Guido also developed a system of clefs, which became the basis for our clef system: bass clef, treble clef, and so on. (Co-existing civilizations used other forms of notation).

In Europe, the major consumers of printed music in the 17th and 18th centuries were the [[Court (royal)|royal courts]] for both solemn and festive occasions. Music was also employed for entertainment, both by the courts and the nobility. Composers made their livings from commissioned work, and worked as conductors, performers and tutors of music or through appointments to the courts. To a certain extent, music publishers also paid composers for rights to print music, but this was not royalty as it is generally understood today.

The European [[Christian Church|Church]] was also a large user of music, both religious and secular. However, performances were largely based on hand-written music or aural training.

=====American contribution: The Origins of Music Copyright and Royalties=====
Until the mid-18th century, American popular music largely consisted of songs from the British Isles, whose lyric and score were sometimes available in engraved prints. Mass production of music was not possible until the movable type was introduced. Music with this type was first printed in the US in 1750.<ref>{{cite web | title= Printing & Publishing of Music - A Short History & How it is Done | url = http://parlorsongs.com/insearch/printing/printing.php | accessdate =2008-08-13}}</ref>  At the beginning the type consisted of the notehead, stem and staff which were combined into a single [[font]]. Later the fonts were made up of the notehead, stems and flags attached to the staff line. Until that time, prints existed only on engraved plates.

The first federal law on copyright was enacted in the US [[Copyright Act of 1790]] which made it possible to give protection to original scores and lyrics.

America's most prominent contribution is [[jazz]] and all the music styles which preceded and co-exist with it – its variations on church music, African-American work songs, [[field holler|cornfield hollers]], wind bands in funeral procession, blues, rag, etc. – and of innovations in church music, rhythmic variations, stamping, tapping of feet, strutting, shuffling, wailing, laments and spiritual ecstasy.

Until its recent sophistication, jazz was not amenable to written form, and thus not copyrightable, due to its improvisational element and the fact that many of the creators of this form could not read or write music.<ref>Carter Harman, ''A Popular History of Music'', Dell Publishing Company, New York, 1956</ref>  It was its precursor, [[minstrelsy]], which came to be written and royalties paid for the use of popular music.

Blackface minstrelsy, in which white men parodied black music of the day with makeup-blackened faces, was the first distinctly theatrical form. In the 1830s and 1840s, it was at the core of the rise of an American music industry. For several decades it provided the means through which white America saw black America. The blackfaces were not products of the American South, but first prevailed in the midwest and the north, starting in low-level white establishments, and later moving to upscale theaters. White, [[working-class]] northerners could identify with the characters portrayed in early performances with images of "white slavery" and "[[wage slavery]]".<ref>Song Sheets to Software: A Guide to Print Music, Software, and Web Sites for Musicians, Elizabeth C.

In 1845, the blackfaces purged their shows of low humor. [[Christy's Minstrels]], formed by C.F. Christy, among the major minstrels of that time, was to epitomize the songs of its best known composer, Stephen Foster.

[[Stephen Foster]] was the pre-eminent songwriter in the United States of that time. His songs, such as  "[[Oh! Susanna]]", "[[Camptown Races]]", "[[My Old Kentucky Home]]", "[[Beautiful Dreamer]]" and "[[Swanee River (song)|Swanee River]]") remain popular 150 years after their composition and have worldwide appreciation.<ref>[http://www.sibeliusmusic.com/index.php?sm=home.score&?scoreid=127497 The scores, and some digital versions, of Stephen Foster's songs can be sampled at sibeliusmusic.com]</ref>

Foster had little formal music training. While he was able to publish several songs before he was twenty, his sophistication came from Henry Kleber and Dan Rice. Kleber was a classically trained German immigrant, and Rice was a popular blackface performer who befriended Foster. But it was his joining the Christy Minstrels which made him, and his songs, favorites in North America.

W.C. Peters was the first major publisher of Foster’s works, but Foster saw very little of the profits. "Oh, Susanna" was an overnight success and a [[Goldrush]] favorite but Foster received just $100 from his publisher for it - in part due to his lack of interest in money and the free gifts of music he gave to him. Foster's first love lay in writing music and its success. Foster did later contract with Christy (for $15 each) for "Old Folks at Home" and "Farewell my Lilly Dear". "Oh, Susanna" also led Foster to two New York publishers, Firth, Pond and Co. and F.D. Benson, who contracted with him to pay royalties at 2 cents for every printed copy sold by them.<ref>Elizabeth C. Axford, ''Song Sheets to Software: A Guide to Print Music, Software, and Web Sites for Musicians,'' Scarecrow Press, 2004,ISBN 0-8108-5027-3, ISBN 978-0-8108-5027-9</ref>

Minstrelsy slowly gave way to songs generated by the American Civil War, followed by the rise of [[Tin Pan Alley]] and [[Parlour music]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://parlorsongs.com/insearch/printing/printing.php |title=Printing & Publishing of Music. A Short History & How it is Done |publisher=parlorsongs.com |accessdate=29 November 2010}}</ref> both of which led to an explosion of sheet music, greatly aided by the emergence of the [[player piano]]. While the player piano was to make inroads deep into the 20th century, more and more music was reproduced through [[radio]] and the [[phonograph]], leading to new forms of royalty payments, but leading to the decline of sheet music.

American innovations in church music also provided royalties to its creators. While Stephen Foster is often credited as the originator of print music in America, [[William Billings]] is the real father of American music. In 1782, of the 264 music compositions in print, 226 were his church-related compositions. Similarly, Billings was the composer of a quarter of the 200 anthems published until 1810. Neither he nor his family saw any royalties, although the Copyright Act of 1790 was in place by then.

Church music plays a significant part in American print royalties. When the Lutheran Church split from the Catholic Church in the 16th century, more than religion changed. [[Martin Luther]] wanted his entire congregation to take part in the music of his services, not just the choir. This new chorale style finds its way in both present church music and jazz.

===Print royalties (music)===
The royalty rate for printing a book (a novel, lyrics or music), or its download, for sale varies from 8–20% of the suggested retail sales value, typically 12–14%, for a new writer. The payment is made by the publisher and corresponds to the agreement (license) between the writer and the publisher as with other music royalties. The agreement is typically non-exclusive to the publisher and the term may vary from 3–5 years. Established writers favor certain publishers and usually receive higher royalties.

All of the royalty does not occur to the writer. It is shared with the publisher on of book sales income on a 50:50 basis.

If a book involved is a play, it might be [[drama]]tized. The right to dramatize is a separate right – known as a [[grand right]]. This income is shared by the many personalities and organizations who come together to offer the play: the playwright, composer of the music played, producer, director of the play and so forth. There is no convention to the royalties paid for grand rights and it is freely negotiated between the publisher and the mentioned participants.

If the writer’s work is only part of a publication, then the royalty paid is ''[[pro-rata]]'', a facet which is more often met in a book of lyrics or in a book of hymns and sometimes in an anthology.

Church music – that is, music that is based on written work – is important particularly in the Americas and in some other countries of Europe. Examples are hymns, anthems and songbooks. Unlike novels and plays, hymns are sung with regularity. Very often, the hymns and songs are sung from lyrics in a book, or more common nowadays, from the work projected on computer screen. In the US, the Christian Copyright Licensing Incorporated is the collection agency for royalties but song or hymn writers have to be registered with them and the songs identified.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ingalls|first=Monique M.|title=The Evangelical British Invasion: Challenging Boundaries, Transforming Congregational Song|journal=IASPM Conference|date=30 May 2009|url=http://iaspm-us.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Ingalls.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2011|location=San Diego, California}}</ref>

===Foreign publishing===
Viewed from a US perspective, foreign publishing involves two basic types of publishing – sub-publishing and co-publishing occurrences in one or more territories outside that of basic origin. Sub-publishing, itself, is one of two forms: sub-publishers who merely license out the original work or those which make and sell the products which are the subject of the license, such as print books and records (with local artists performing the work).

Sub-publishers who produce and market a product retain 10–15% of the marked retail price and remit the balance to the main publisher with whom they have the copyright license. Those sub-publishers who merely license out the work earn between 15–25%.<ref>Alan S. Bergman, [http://www.alanbergman.com/musicbusinesslanguage.pdf ''The Language of the Music Business'']</ref>

===Mechanical royalties===
The term "mechanical" and [[mechanical license]] has its origins in the "piano rolls" on which music was recorded in the early part of the 20th Century. Although its concept is now primarily oriented to [[royalty income]] from sale of compact discs (CDs), its scope is wider and covers any copyrighted audio composition that is rendered mechanically; that is, without human performers:
:* tape recordings
:* music videos
:* [[ringtone]]s
:* [[MIDI]] files
:* downloaded tracks
:* DVDs, VHS, UMDs
:* computer games
:* musical toys etc.

The United States treatment of mechanical royalties is in sharp contrast to international practice.

In the United States, while the right to use copyrighted music for making records for public distribution (for private use) is an exclusive right of the composer, the [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]] provides that ''once'' the music is so recorded, anyone else can record the composition/song without a negotiated license but on the payment of the statutory compulsory royalty. Thus, its use by different artists could lead to several separately owned copyrighted "sound recordings".

The following is a partial segment of the compulsory rates as they have applied from 1998 to 2007 in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | title= Compulsory Rates for Mechanical royalties | url=http://www.copyright.gov/carp/m200a.html |accessdate= 2007-10-15 }}</ref>  The royalty rates in the table have two elements: (i) a minimum rate applies for a duration equivalent to 5 minutes, or less, of a musical composition/song and (ii) a per-minute rate if the composition exceeds it, whichever is greater.

In the predominant case, the composer assigns the song copyright to a publishing company under a "publishing agreement" which makes the publisher exclusive owner of the composition. The publisher's role is to promote the music by extending the written music to ''recordings'' of vocal, instrumental and orchestral arrangements and to administer the collection of royalties (which, as will shortly be seen, is in reality done by specialized companies). The publisher also licenses 'subpublishers' domestically and in other countries to similarly promote the music and administer the collection of royalties.

In a fair publishing agreement, every 100 units of currency that flows to the publisher gets divided as follows: 50 units go to the songwriter and 50 units to the publisher minus operating and administrative fees and applicable taxes. However, the music writer obtains a further 25 units from the publisher's share, if the music writer retains a portion of the music publishing rights (as a co-publisher). In effect, the co-publishing agreement is a 50/50 share of royalties in favor of the songwriter if administrative costs of publishing are disregarded. This is near international practice.

When a company (recording label) records the composed music, say, on a CD master, it obtains a distinctly ''separate'' copyright to the sound recording, with all the exclusivities that flow to such copyright. The main obligation of the recording label to the songwriter and her publisher is to pay the contracted royalties on the license received.

While the compulsory rates remain unaffected, recording companies in the U.S. typically will negotiate to pay not more than 75% of the compulsory rate where the songwriter is also the recording artist<ref>{{cite web | title= 'Reduced Rate' Royalties| url=http://www.ascap.com/musicbiz/money-clauses.html |accessdate= 2007-10-29 }}</ref> and will further (in the U.S.) extend that to a maximum of 10 songs, even though the marketed recording may carry more than that number. This 'reduced rate' results from the incorporation of a "controlled composition" clause in the licensing contract<ref>{{cite web | title= Royalties on Controlled Composition |url=http://www.ascap.com/musicbiz/money-clauses.html |accessdate= 2007-10-29 }}</ref> since the composer as recording artist is seen to control the content of the recording.

Mechanical royalties for music produced outside of the United States are negotiated – there being no [[Compulsory license|compulsory licensing]] – and royalty payments to the composer and her publisher for recordings are based on the wholesale, retail, or "suggested retail value" of the marketed CDs.

''Recording artists'' earn royalties only from the ''sale'' of CDs and tapes and, as will be seen later, from sales arising from [[digital rights]]. Where the [[Songwriter|song-writer]] is also the recording artist, royalties from CD sales add to those from the [[recording contract]].

In the U.S., recording artists earn royalties amounting to 10%–25% (of the [[suggested retail price]] of the recording<ref>[http://www.ascap.com/musicbiz/money-recording.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> depending on their popularity but such is before deductions for "packaging", "breakage", "promotion sales" and holdback for "returns", which act to significantly reduce net royalty incomes.

In the U.S., the [[Harry Fox Agency]], HFA, is the predominant licensor, collector and distributor for mechanical royalties, although there are several small competing organizations. For its operations, it charges about 6% as commission. HFA, like its counterparts in other countries, is a state-approved quasi-monopoly and is expected to act in the interests of the composers/song-writers – and thus obtains the right to audit record company sales.  Additional third party administrators such as [[RightsFlow]] provide services to license, account and pay mechanical royalties and are growing.  RightsFlow is paid by the licensees (artists, labels, distributors, online music services) and in turn does not extract a commission from the mechanical royalties paid out.<ref>Christman, Ed,  Billboard, 11 March 2011, [http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/others/rightsflow-builds-a-business-around-clearing-1005083892.story "RightsFlow Builds A Business Around Clearing Song Rights"]. Retrieved 2011-10-17.</ref>

In the UK the [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]], MCPS (now in alliance with PRS), acts to collect (and distribute) royalties to composers, songwriters and publishers for CDs and for digital formats. It is a [[non-profit organization|not-for-profit organization]] which funds its work through a commissions on aggregate revenues. The royalty rate for licensing tracks is 6.5% of retail price (or 8.5% of the published wholesale price).

In Europe, the major licensing and mechanical royalty collection societies are:

: [[Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique|SACEM]] in France<ref>{{cite news|last=Thorne|first=Michelle|title=Improbable Match: CC And Collecting Societies In Europe|url=http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10819|accessdate=12 December 2011|newspaper=Creative Commons|date=21 November 2008}}</ref>
: [[Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte|GEMA]] in Germany<ref>{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=Kevin J.|title=Royalty Dispute Stops Music Videos in Germany|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/03/technology/internet/03youtube.html|accessdate=12 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 April 2009}}</ref>
: SFA in Italy<ref>[http://www.scfitalia.it/webnew/]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>

SACEM acts collectively for "francophone" countries in Africa. The UK society also has strong links with English-speaking African countries.

Mechanical societies for other countries can be found at the main national collection societies.<ref>{{cite web |url=

The mechanical royalty rate paid to the publisher in Europe is about 6.5% on the PPD (published price to dealers).<ref>{{cite web | title= Language of the Music Business | url= http://www.alanbergman.com/articles.htm |accessdate= 2007-10-29 }}</ref>

Record companies are responsible for paying royalties to those artists who have performed for a recording based on the sale of CDs by retailers.

===Performance royalties===
"Performance" in the music industry can include any of the following:

:* a performance of a song or composition – live, recorded or broadcast
:* a live performance by any musician
:* a performance by any musician through a recording on physical media
:* performance through the playing of recorded music
:* music performed through the web (digital transmissions)

It is useful to treat these royalties under two classifications:

:(a) those associated with conventional forms of music distribution which have prevailed for most part of the 20th Century, and
:(b) those from emerging 'digital rights' associated with newer forms of communication, entertainment and media technologies (from 'ring tones' to 'downloads' to 'live internet streaming'.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Church of England]] is specifically exempted from performance royalties for music performed in services because it is a state-established church. Traditionally, American music publishers have not sought performance royalties for music sung and played in church services–the license to perform being implied by distributors of church sheet music. [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], and [[SESAC]] exempt church worship services from performance royalties, but make no exemption for church-hosted concerts.

====Conventional forms of royalty payment====
In the conventional context, royalties are paid to composers and publishers and record labels for public performances of their music on vehicles such as the jukebox, stage, radio or TV. Users of music need to obtain a "performing rights license" from music societies – as will be explained shortly – to use the music. Performing rights extend both to live and recorded music played in such diverse areas as cafés, skating rinks, etc.

Licensing is generally done by music societies called "Performing Rights Organizations" (PROs), ''some'' of which are government-approved or government-owned, to which the composer, the publisher, performer (in some cases) or the record label have subscribed.

[[File:Bemuso-A.jpg|right|frame]]

The diagram on the right titled "The Performance Rights Complex"<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web |title=Diagram courtesy |url=http://www.bemuso.com |publisher=bemuso.com }}</ref> shows the general sequences by which a song or a composition gets to be titled a "performance" and which brings royalties to song-writers/publishers, performing artists and record labels. How, and to whom, royalties are paid is different in the United States from what it is, for example, in the UK. Most countries have "practices" more in common with the UK than the US.

In the United Kingdom there are three principal organizations:

:(i) [[Phonographic Performance Limited]] (PPL)
:(ii) [[PRS for Music]] (formerly the Performing Right Society)
:(iii) [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]] (MCPS)

who license music (to music-users) and act as royalty collection and distribution agencies for their members.

PPL issues performance licenses to all UK radio, TV and broadcast stations, as well as establishments who employ sound recordings (tapes, CDs), in entertaining the public.<ref>{{cite news|title=‘CITCO hotels cannot play PPL music’|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/citco-hotels-cannot-play-ppl-music/731460/|accessdate=12 December 2011|newspaper=Indian Express|date=31 December 2010}}</ref> The licensing company collects and distributes royalties to the "record label" for the sound recording and to "featured UK performers"  in the recording. Performers do not earn from sound recordings on video and film.

PRS, which is now in alliance with MCPS,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prsformusic.com/Pages/default.aspx |title=PRS for Music homepage |accessdate=29 November 2010}}</ref> collects royalties from music-users and distributes them directly to "song-writers" and "publishers" whose works are performed live, on radio or on TV on a 50:50 basis. MCPS licenses music for broadcast in the range 3 to 5.25% of net advertising revenues.<ref>{{cite web |title = Songwriters challenge UK online royalty rate | url = http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/07/uk_music_downloads_royalty_dispute/ |publisher=The Register|date=7 November 2005 |accessdate =2007-12-18}}</ref>

MCPS also collects and disburses mechanical royalties to writers and publishers in a manner similar to PRS. Although allied, they serve, for now, as separate organizations for membership.

The next diagram shows the sequences in the licensing of performances and the royalty collection and distribution process in the UK.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Every song or recording has a unique identity by which they are licensed and tracked. Details of songs or recordings are notified to the PROs directly, or through Catco, an electronic tracking system. It needs to be clarified that while blanket licenses are commonly issued to music-users, the latter are responsible for "usage returns" – the actual frequency of performances under the license – which then becomes the basis for the PRO to apportion royalties to writers, publishers and record labels. ("DIY indies" are  "do-it-yourself" independent song-writers – and, often, the performers as well – who record and publish under their own labels). In the UK, music is licensed (and royalties paid on it) ''at the track level''.

There is also a separate organization in the UK called VPL, which is the collecting society set up by the record industry in 1984 to grant licenses to users of music videos, e.g. broadcasters, program-makers, video jukebox system suppliers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ppluk.com/ |title=VPL |publisher=Ppluk.com |accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> The licensing income collected from users is paid out to the society's members after administrative costs are deducted.

There are different models for royalty collection in the European countries. In some of them, mechanical and performing rights are administered jointly. SACEM (France), SABAM (Belgium), GEMA (Germany) and JASRAC (Japan) work that way.

In the United States, in contrast, the [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers|ASCAP]], BMI (Broadcast Music, Inc) and [[SESAC]] (Society of European Stage Authors & Composers) are the three principal Performance Rights Organizations (PROs), although smaller societies exist. The royalty that is paid to the composer and publisher is determined by the method of assessment used by the PRO to gage the utilization of the music, there being no external metrics as in mechanical royalties or the reporting system used in the UK. Very basically, a PRO aggregates the royalties that are due to all of the composers/songwriters "who are its members" and each composer and publisher is paid royalties based on the assessed frequency of the music’s performance, post deductions of charges (which are many). The PROs are audited agencies. They "directly" pay the songwriter and the publisher their respective shares. (If part of the publisher's share is retained by the songwriter, the publisher pays the songwriter that part of the publisher's share).

Typically, the PRO negotiates blanket licenses with radio stations, television networks and other "music users", each of whom receives the right to perform any of the music in the repertoire of the PRO for a set sum of money.

PROs use different types of surveys to determine the frequency of usage of a composition/song. ASCAP uses [[Sampling (statistics)|random sampling]], SESAC utilizes cue sheets for TV performances and ‘digital pattern recognition’ for radio performances while BMI employs more scientific methods.

In the United States only the composer and the publisher are paid performance royalties and not performing artists (digital rights being a different matter). Likewise, the record label, whose music is used in a performance, is not entitled to royalties in the US on the premise that performances lead sales of records.

Where a performance has co-writers along with the composer/songwriter – as in a musical play – they will share the royalty.

===Royalties in digital distribution===
The term "[[Digital audio|digital music]]" typically applies to [[Internet]] and [[wireless]] ([[Mobile phone|mobile]]) technologies. Digital music files can be identified by serial numbers embedded in the data ('[[Digital watermarking|watermarking]]') or natural patterns in the data ("[[fingerprint]]ing"). Digital music have begun to give [[music]] a different direction by their capacities to internationally distribute the music for instant hearing or storage by private and public persons. Digital music is generally expected to become the predominant form by which music is 'used' in the longer term.

Nonetheless, [[CD audio|compact discs]] will continue to be the major form of musical reach and storage for the present. For example, revenues from the sales of CDs in the [[United States|US]] in 2007 far outweighed that from digital downloads, representing some 85% of music sales, or 81 million units per quarter.<ref>{{cite news | title=Sale of Music Long in Decline|url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB117444575607043728-oEugjUqEtTo1hWJawejgR3LjRAw_20080320.html?mod=rss_free |accessdate =2007-12-20 | work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Ethan |last=Smith |date=2007-03-21}}</ref>  Also, as the following data illustrates, the amount of music (tracks) available on CDs (stored music) is extremely large compared to what is available in digital format:<ref>{{cite web | title=What is Digital Distribution|url=http://www.bemuso.com/musicbiz/digitaldistribution.html#whatisdigitaldistribution |accessdate =2007-12-20 |accessdate =2010-12-03}}</ref>

:* PPL’s CatCo holds details of over 7 million recordings
:* There are 15 million published works with [[International Standard Musical Work Code|ISWC]] codes (and many more without)
:* The [[Gracenote]] database<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gracenote.com |title=Gracenote homepage}}</ref> (CDDB) holds details of 51 million tracks
:* Around half a million new tracks are formally released every year.

In contrast to:

:* [[RealNetworks]] license 60,000 albums for home entertainment services.
:* The USA digital jukebox suppliers license about 200,000 tracks.
:* There are over 2 million on [[XM Satellite Radio]] ([[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] has over 500,000).
:* UK Inspired Broadcast Network jukebox THE music offers 2 million tracks.
:* RedDotNet’s kiosk system has over 2.5 million tracks online.
:* There are about 20 million retail tracks on [[iTunes Store|iTunes Music Store]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/itunes/features/#purchasingmusic |title=Apple – iTunes – Everything you need to be entertained |publisher=Apple.com |accessdate=2013-05-04}}</ref>
:* [[Kazaa]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kazaa.com/ |title=Kazaa |publisher=Kazaa.com |accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> has about 1 million tracks.
:* [[Last.fm]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://last.fm/ |title=Listen to internet radio and the largest music catalogue online |publisher=Last.fm |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> has a music-discovery database of 60 million titles.

Nonetheless, there has been a decline in CD sales since 2000 in the US (perhaps less so in the [[Europe|EU]]). At the same time, digital tracks legally downloaded from the internet continue to be a growing force, track downloads totalling 417.3 million units in the first half of 2007 – a 48.5% increase over the corresponding period last year according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]].<ref>{{cite web | title=U.S. H1 Album Sales Down 15.1% |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3idb123582ebc7d42b3f8bee9123801556 |accessdate =2007-12-22}}</ref>  [[Apple Inc.|Apple Inc]]'s sale of over 100 million [[iPod]]s and the strong presence of [[iTunes]] and [[eMusic]] (a subscription service) in the US, and now in EU and in other 18 countries, testify to the strong emergence of digital music. This is further emphasized by the large presence of [[Internet radio|internet broadcasts of live and internet-only radio stations]] ("[[Streaming media|streamed music]]"). They represent the "buy" and "listen" choices.

====US regulatory provisions====
Regulatory provisions in the US, EU and elsewhere is in a state of flux, continuously being challenged by developments in technology; thus almost any regulation stated here exists in a tentative format.

The US [[Copyright Act of 1976]] identified “musical works” and “[[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recordings]]” eligible for copyright protection. The term “musical work” refers to the [[Musical composition|notes]] and [[Songwriter|lyrics]] of a song or a piece of music, while a “sound recording” results from its fixation on physical media. Copyright owners of musical works are granted exclusive rights to license over-the-air radio and TV broadcasts, entitling them royalties, which are, as said earlier, collected and distributed by the PROs. Under the Act, [[Record label|record companies]] and recording artists are, presently, not entitled to royalties from radio and TV broadcasts of their music, except in the case of digital services and [[webcast]]s where copyright owners and performers obtain royalties (see later). This is in contrast to international standards where performers also obtain royalties from over-the-air and digital broadcasting.

In 1995, the Congress introduced the ''[[Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act|Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA)]]'', which became effective 1 Feb 1996. This Act granted owners of ''sound recordings'' the exclusive license to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of digital audio transmissions but it exempted non-subscription services (and some other services). Where the rights owner could not voluntarily reach agreement with the [[Broadcasting|broadcaster]], it could avail of compulsory licensing provisions. Under the Act, the compulsory royalty (the royalty schedule follows) was to be shared in the manner: 50% to the record companies, 45% to featured artists, 2½% to non-featured musicians through [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) in the United States and [[Canada]]<ref>{{cite web | title=American Federation of Musicians |url=http://www.afm.org/public/home/index.php)|accessdate=2008-02-24}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref> and 2½% for non-featured vocalists through [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]] (AFTRA).<ref>{{cite web | title=American Federation of Television and Radio Artists | url=http://www.aftra.org | accessdate =2008-02-24}}</ref>  [[United States Congress]] also created a new compulsory license for certain subscription digital audio services, which transmit sound recordings via cable television and [[Direct-broadcast satellite]] (DBS) on a non-interactive basis in the absence of a voluntary negotiation and agreement.

In 1998, the Congress amended DPRA to create the '''[[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)]]''' by redefining the above-noted subscription services of DPRA as “preexisting subscription services” and expanded the statutory license to include new categories of digital audio services that may operate under the license. In effect, DMCA created three categories of licensees:

# pre-existing satellite digital audio radio services
# new subscription services, and
# eligible non-subscription transmission services.

In addition to the above, a fourth license was created permit webcasters to make “ephemeral recordings” of a sound recording (temporary copies) to facilitate streaming but with a royalty to be paid.

Non-subscription webcasting royalties have also to be shared between record companies and performers in the proportions set out under DPRA.

The Table below titled SUMMARY OF STATUTORY ROYALTY RATES FOR DIGITAL WEBCASTING - UNITED STATES encapsulates the royalties set for non-interactive webcasting.

To qualify for compulsory licensing under non-subscription services, the webcasting needs to fit the following six criteria:

:* it is non-interactive
:* it does not exceed the sound recording performance complement
:* it is accompanied by information on the song title and recording artist
:* it does not publish a program schedule or specify the songs to be transmitted
:* it does not automatically switch from one program channel to another, and
:* it does not allow a user to request songs to be played particularly for that user.

An ''inter-active service'' is one which allows a listener to receive a specially created internet stream in which she dictates the songs to be played by selecting songs from the [[website]] menu. Such a service would take the website out from under the compulsory license and require negotiations with the copyright owners.

However, a service is non-interactive if it permits people to request songs which are then played to the public at large. Nonetheless, several rules apply such as, within any three-hour period, three cuts from a CD, but no more than two cuts consecutively can be played, or a site can play four songs from any singer from a boxed CD-set, but no more than three cuts consecutively.

The [[SoundExchange]], a non-profit organization, is defined under the legislation to act on behalf of record companies (including the majors) to license performance and reproduction rights and negotiate royalties with the broadcasters. It is governed by a board of artist and label representatives. Services include track level accounting of performances to all ''members'' and collection and distribution of foreign royalties to all members.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Sound Exchange|url=http://www.soundexchange.com|accessdate =2008-02-29}}</ref>

In the absence of a voluntary agreement between the SoundExchange and the broadcasters, [[Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel]] (CARP) was authorized to set the statutory rates as could prevail between a "willing buyer" and "willing sellers". SoundExchange handles only the collection of royalties from "compulsory licenses" for non-interactive streaming services that use satellite, cable or internet methods of distribution.

To recap, under the law three types of licenses are required for streaming of musical recordings:

:(a) a performance license applicable for underlying words( lyrics) and music (score)
:(b) a performance license applicable to the streaming the sound recording
:(c) a storage license for the passage of a sound recording through a file server

The royalties for the first of the above two licenses are obtained from SoundExchange and the third from the PROs. Failure to make required payments constitutes copyright infringement and is subject to statutory damages.

Both broadcasters involved in webcasting and pure-Internet non-broadcasters are required to pay these royalties under the rules framed under the Act. All webcasters are also required to be registered with the [[United States Copyright Office]].

====UK legislation====
The [[United Kingdom]] adopted the [[Copyright Directive|European Copyright Directive]] (EUCD) in 2003 and the meaning of broadcast performance was broadened to cover "communicating to the public". This then included music distribution through the internet and the transmission of [[ringtone]]s to mobiles. Thus a music download was a "copy" of proprietary music and hence required to be licensed.

After a prolonged battle on royalties between online music companies such as [[AOL]], [[Napster]] and the recording companies (but not all of them), represented by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI), and organizations representing the interests of songwriters ([[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society|MCPS]] and [[PRS for Music|PRS]]) a compromise was reached, leading to a subsequent 3-year interim legislation (2007) adopted by the UK [[Copyright Tribunal]] under the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Interim Settlement of Digital Royalty Rates (Music), United Kingdom |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ctribunaldownloadingdecision.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate =2007-12-19}}</ref>  The legislation, referring to a new JOL (Joint Online License), applies only to music purchased within UK.

The applicable royalties are given in the Table below which, interestingly, also includes music downloads and music services through mobile devices. This path-breaking legislation is expected to become the model for EU (which is yet to develop comprehensive legislation), and perhaps even extend to the US.

Note that the new legislation includes the distinction between downloads of musical tracks from iTunes and other stores, which were considered "sales" and the webcasts considered "performances".

In brief, the compromise reached is that songwriters will receive 8% of '''gross revenues''' (definition follows), less [[VAT]], as royalty for each track downloaded bridging the demand of the artists demanding a 12% royalty rate (what was, otherwise, the norm for a CD) and music companies holding out for 6.5%, slightly higher than the 5.7% paid for a 79p track sold by iTunes.<ref>{{cite web | title=Artists bid for CD parity on digital royalties|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/78202/artists-bid-for-cd-parity-on-digital-royalties.html. |accessdate =2008-02-24}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref>  A minimum of four pence will be paid, in the new legislation, if tracks are discounted.

The terms used in the legislated Table are explained following it.

Not all music providers in the UK were part of the compromise that led to the legislation. For those not participating - principally, AOL, [[Yahoo!]] and RealNetworks - the Tribunal set the royalty rate for pure webcasting at 5.75%.

UK legislation recognizes the term '''[[Online and offline|online]]''' as referring to downloading digital files from the internet and mobile network operators.  '''Offline''' is the term used for the delivery of music through physical media such as a CD or a DVD.

A '''stream''' is a file of continuous music listened to through a consumer’s receiving device with no playable copy of the music remaining.

'''Permanent Downloads''' are transfers (sale) of music from a website to a computer or mobile telephone for permanent retention and use whenever the purchaser wishes, analogous to the purchase of a CD.

A '''Limited Download''' is similar to a permanent download but differs from it in that the consumer’s use of the copy is in some way restricted by associated technology; for instance, becomes unusable when the subscription ends (say, through an encoding, such as [[Digital rights management|DRM]], of the downloaded music).

'''On-demand streaming''' is music streamed to the listener on the computer or mobile to enable her to listen to the music once, twice or a number of times during the period of subscription to the service.

'''Pure Webcasting''' is where the user receives a stream of pre-programmed music chosen "by the music service provider". It is non-interactive to the extent that even pausing or skipping of tracks is not possible.

'''Premium and Interactive Webcasting''' are personalized subscription services intermediate between pure webcasting and downloading.

'''Special webcasting''' is a service where the user can choose a stream of music, the majority of which comprises works from one source – an artist, group or particular concert.

'''Simulcasting''', although not in the Table above, is the simultaneous re-transmission by a licensed transmission of the program of a [[radio]] or [[TV station]] over the internet of an otherwise traditional broadcast. The person receiving the simulcast normally makes no permanent copy of it. It is defined in the legislation as an offline service.

'''’Gross Revenue’''', which is comprehensively defined in the legislation, summarized here, means, all revenue received (or receivable) by the licensee from Users, all revenue received through advertisements associated with the music service, sponsorship fees, commissions from third parties and revenue arising from barter or contra deals. No deductions are permitted except for refunds of unused music due to technical faults.

The advertising revenue which is shared between the artist and music provider is defined as:
* when the advertising is in-stream;
* when the music offered forms the only content of a page featuring advertising (excluding the advertisement itself); and
* when the music offered forms more than 75% of a page featuring advertising (excluding the advertisement itself).

===Synchronization royalties===
According to Joel Mabus, The term [[synchronization]] "comes from the early days of the [[talkies]] when music was first synchronized with film".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joelmabus.com/royalties.htm |title=Royalties |publisher=Joelmabus.com |accessdate=2013-05-04}}</ref> The terminology originated in US industry but has now spread worldwide.

In the UK and elsewhere, with the exception of the US, there is apparently no legal prohibition to the combination of audio and visual images and no explicit statutory right for the collection of synch royalties. In the US, however, the Copyright Act defines the audiovisual format as that of combining images with music for use in machines but there is no explicit rate set such as the "compulsory royalty rate" for copying music but there are instances of courts implying the synchronization right,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clintons.co.uk/?news_id=38 |title=US Court Recognises Existence of a "Sync Right" |publisher=Clintons |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref>  fuller version at<ref>[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/6128717C16DB42D8882573C400597DC7/$file/0655102.pdf?openelement]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref> but even so, it is an amorphous colloquial commercial term of acceptance.

Synchronization royalties ("sync licenses") are paid for the use of copyrighted music in (largely) audiovisual productions, such as in DVDs, movies, and advertisements. Music used in news tracks are also synch licenses. Synchronization can extend to live media performances, such as plays and live theatre. They become extremely important for new media - the usage of music in the form of [[mp3]], [[wav]], [[flac]] files and for usage in [[webcasts]], embedded media in microchips (e.g. [[karaoke]]), etc. but the legal conventions are yet to be drawn.

Synchronization royalties are due to the composer/song-writer or his/her publisher. They are strictly contractual in nature and vary greatly in amount depending on the subjective importance of the music, the mode of production and the media used. The royalty payable is that of mutual acceptance but is conditioned by industry practice.

It is useful to note in this connection the concept of the "needle drop" (now laser drop) in that the synch royalty becomes payable every time the needle drops 'on the record player' in a public performance. All openings and closings, every cut to advertisements, every cut back from ads, all re-runs shown by every TV company, in every country in the world generates a "synchro", although a single payment may be renegotiable in advance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Current UK Limited Synchronisation Licence example |url=http://i.current.com/pdf/music_sync_uk.pdf |publisher=i.current.com |accessdate=29 November 2010}}</ref>

There is a category of [[royalty free music]] in the field of synchronization. This refers to the use of music in a "library" for which a one-time royalty has been negotiated. It is an alternative to needle-drop negotiation.

In terms of numbers, royalties can range from, say. $500–2000 for a "festival-use license" to $250,000 or more for a movie film score. For low-budget films, which are deemed less than $2 million, the royalties range from 3%–6%<ref>{{cite news|last=VanReece |first=Nancy |url=http://www.musesmuse.com/pubart.html |title=Songwriting Articles: Publishing |publisher=North American Folk Alliance Newsletter |agency=The Muse's Muse |date=September 1998 |accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> or could be per song per usage.

===Audio Home Recording Act of 1992===
In the US, the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] became effective law in October 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/usc_sec_17_00001001----000-.html |title=United States Code: Title 17,1001. Definitions |publisher=Legal Information Institute: Cornell University Law School |accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> The law enabled the release of recordable digital formats such as Sony and Philips' Digital Audio Tape without fear of contributory infringement lawsuits.

==Art royalties==

===Resale royalty or ''droit de suite''===
Art Resale Royalty is a right to a royalty payment upon resales of art works, that applies in some jurisdictions. Whilst there are currently approximately 60 countries that have some sort of Resale Royalty on their statute books, evidence of resale schemes that can be said to be actually  operating schemes is restricted to Europe, Australia and the American state of California.  For example in May 2011 the European commissions ec.europa webpage on Resale royalty stated that, under the heading  'Indicative list of third countries (Article 7.2)'  :
'A letter was sent to Member States on 1 March 2006 requesting that they provide a list of third countries which meet these requirements and that they also provide evidence of application. '''To date the Commission has not been supplied with evidence for any third country which demonstrates that they qualify for inclusion on this list'''.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/resale-right/resale-right_en.htm |title=» Internal Market &raquo Copyright &raquo Resale Right |publisher=European Commission: The EU Single Market |accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> [The emphasis is from the European commission web page.]

Apart from placing a levy on the resale of some art-like objects, there are few common facets to the various national schemes. Most schemes prescribe a minimum amount that the artwork must receive before the artist can invoke resale rights ( usually the hammer price or price). Some countries prescribe and others such as Australia, do not prescribe, the maximum royalty that can be received. Most do prescribe the calculation basis of the royalty. Some country's make the usage of the royalty compulsory. Some country's prescribe a sole monopoly collection service agency, while others like the UK and France, allow multiple agencies. Some schemes involve varying degrees of retrospective application and other schemes such as Australia's are not retrospective at all.
In some cases, for example Germany, an openly tax-like use is made of the "royalties"; Half of the money collected is redistributed to fund public programs.

The New Zealand and Canadian governments have not proceeded with any sort of artist resale scheme. The Australian scheme does not apply to the ''first'' resale of artworks purchased ''prior to the schemes enactment''( June 2010) and individual usage of the right (by Australian artists) is not compulsory. In Australia artists have a case by case right (under clause 22/23 of the Act) to refuse consent to the usage of the right by the appointed collection society and/or make their own collection arrangements. Details of the Australian scheme can be gotten from<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.resaleroyalty.org.au/ |title=About the artists resale royalty scheme |publisher=resaleroyalty.org.au |accessdate=29 November 2010}}</ref> the website of the sole appointed Australian agency; The "Copyright Agency Limited".

The UK scheme is in the context of common-law countries an oddity; No other common-law country has mandated an individual economic right where actual usage of the right is compulsory  for the individual right holder. Whether the common law conception of an individual economic right as an "individual right of control of usage" is compatible with the Code Civil origins of ''droit de suite'' is open to question.

The UK is the largest art resale market where a form of ARR is operating, details of how the royalty is calculated as a portion of sale price in the UK can be accessed here [http://www.dacs.org.uk/ DACS] 
In the UK, the scheme was, in early 2012, extended to all artists still in copyright. In most European jurisdictions the right has the same duration as the term of copyright. In California law, heirs receive royalty for 20 years.

The royalty applies to any work of graphic or plastic art such as a ceramic, collage, drawing, engraving, glassware, lithograph, painting, photograph, picture, print, sculpture, tapestry. However, a copy of a work is not to be regarded as a work unless the copy is one of a limited number made by the artist or under the artist's authority. In the UK the resale of a work bought directly from the artist and then resold within 3 years for a value of €10,000 or less is not affected by the royalty.

The situation as to how ARR applies in situations where an art work is physically made by a person or persons who are not the 'name artist' who first exhibits and sells the work is not clear. In particular whilst ARR is inalienable it seems conceivable that in cases where the copyright on an artwork is transferred/sold, prior to the first sale of an artwork, the inalienable ARR right is also effectively sold transferred.

Whether resale royalties are of net economic benefit to artists is a highly contested area. Many economic studies have seriously questioned the assumptions underlying the argument that resale royalties have net benefits to artists. Many modelings have suggested that resale royalties could be actually harmful to living artists' economic positions.<ref>name="Kirstein, R./Schmidtchen, D. (2001); Do Artists Benefit from Resale Royalties? An Economic Analysis of a New EU Directive. In: Deffains, B./Kirat, T. (eds.): Law and Economics in Civil Law Countries; The Economics of Legal Relationships Vol. 6, Elsevier Science, Amsterdam et al., 231-248."</ref>
Australia's chief advocate for the adoption of artist resale royalties the collection society, Viscopy, commissioned in 2004 a report from Access Economics to model the likely impact of their scheme. In the resulting report, Access Economics warned that the claim of net benefit to artists was: "based upon extremely unrealistic assumptions, in particular the assumption that seller and buyer behaviour would be completely unaffected by the introduction of RRR [ARR]" and that, "Access Economics considers that the results of this analysis are both unhelpful and potentially misleading."<ref>[http://www.arts.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/.../Viscopy_Access_Economics.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>

===Artwork royalties===
An artwork is usually a copyrighted article which be mass-produced for sale, such as [[greeting cards]]. They are both seasonal and on occasion. In the UK it is estimated that one billion pounds are spent on greeting cards every year, with the average person sending 55 cards per year. The royalty range is 2–5% with an ‘upfront royalty’.

Other artwork royalties are as under:<ref>[http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/article-30093.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref>
:* [[Greeting card]]s and [[gift wrap]]: 2% to 5%
:* [[Household item]]s such as cups, sheets, towels: 3% to 8%
:* [[Fabric]]s, [[apparel]] (T-shirts, caps, decals): 2% to 10%
:* [[Poster]]s and [[Photographic print|prints]]: 10% or more
:* [[Toy]]s and [[doll]]s: 3% to 8%

==Software royalties==
There is simply too much [[computer software]] to consider the royalties applicable to each. The following is a guide to royalty rates:{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

:: *Computer Software: 10.5% (average), 6.8% (median)
:: *Internet: 11.7% (average), 7.5% (median)

For the development of customer-specific software one will have to consider:

:: * Total software development cost
:: * Break-even cost (if the software can be sold to many agencies)
:: * Ownership of code (if the client's, he bears the development cost)
:: * Life of the software (usually short or requiring maintenance)
:: * Risk in development (high, commanding A high price)

== Other royalty arrangements ==
The term "royalty" also covers areas outside of IP and technology licensing, such as oil, gas, and mineral royalties paid to the owner of a property by a resources development company in exchange for the right to exploit the resource. In a business project the promoter, financier, LHS enabled the transaction but are no longer actively interested may have a royalty right to a portion of the income, or profits, of the business. This sort of royalty is often expressed as a contract right to receive money based on a royalty formula, rather than an actual ownership interest in the business. In some businesses this sort of royalty is sometimes called an ''override''.

===Alliances and partnerships===
Royalties may exist in technological alliances and partnerships. The latter is more than mere access to secret technical or a trade right to accomplish an objective. It is, in the last decade of the past century, and the first of this one of the major means of technology transfer. Its importance for the licensor and the licensee lies in its access to markets and raw materials, and labor, when the international trend is towards [[globalization]].

There are three main groups when it comes to technological alliances. They are Joint-ventures (sometimes abbreviated JV), the Franchises and Strategic Alliances (SA).<ref>Manual on Technology Transfer Negotiation (A reference for policy-makers and practitioners on Technology Transfer),1996 United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Vienna, 1990, ISBN 92-1-106302-7</ref><ref>Patterns of Internationalization for Developing Country Enterprises, United Nations Industrial Organization, Vienna, Austria 2008, ISBN 978-92-1-106302-7{{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (7) does not correspond to calculated figure.}}</ref>

Joint-ventures are usually between companies long in contact with a purpose. JVs are very formal forms of association, and depending on the country where they are situated, subject to a rigid code of rules, in which the public may or may not have an opportunity to participate in capital; partly depending on the size of capital required, and partly on Governmental regulations. They usually revolve around ''products'' and normally involve an inventive step.

Franchises revolve around ''services'' and they are closely connected with trademarks, an example of which is McDonald's. Although franchises have no convention like trademarks or copyrights they can be mistaken as a trademark-copyright in agreements. The franchisor has close control over the franchisee, which, in legal terms cannot be tie-ins such as frachisee located in an areas owned by the franchisor.

Strategic Alliances can involve a project (such as bridge building). a product or a service. As the name implies, is more a matter of 'marriage of convenience' when two parties want to associate to take up a particular (but modest) short-term task but generally are uncomfortable with the other. But the strategic alliance could be a test of compatibility for the forming of a joint venture company and a precedent step.

Note that all of these ventures s could be in a third county. JVs and franchises are rarely found formed within a county. They largely involve third countries.

On occasion, a JV or SA may be wholly oriented to research and development, typically involving multiple organizations working on an agreed form of engagement. The Airbus is an example of such.

====Technical assistance and service in technology transfer====
Firms in developing countries often are asked by the supplier of know-how or patent licensing to consider technical service (TS) and technical assistance (TA) as elements of the technology transfer process and to pay "royalty" on them. TS and TA are associated with the IP (intellectual property) transferred – and, sometimes, dependent on its acquisition – but they are, by no means, IP.<ref>Manual on Technology Transfer Negotiation (A reference for policy-makers and practitioners on Technology Transfer),1996 United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Vienna, 1990, ISBN 92-1-106302-7, pp 260-261</ref> TA and TS may also be the sole part of the transfer or the tranferor of the IP, their concurrent supplier. They are seldom met with in the developed countries, which sometimes view even know-how as similar to TS.

TS comprises services which are the specialized knowledge of firms or acquired by them for operating a special process. It is often a "bundle" of services which can by itself meet an objective or help in meeting it. It is delivered over time, at end of which the acquirer becomes proficient to be independent of the service. In this process, no consideration is given on whether the transfer of the proprietary element has been concluded or not.

On the other hand, technical assistance is a package of assistance given on a short timetable. It can range variously from procurement of equipment for a project, inspection services on behalf of the buyer, the training of buyer's personnel and the supply technical or managerial staff. Again, TA is independent of IP services.

The payment for these services is a fee, not a royalty. The TS fee is dependent on how many of the specialized staff of its supplier are required and over what period of time. Sometimes, the "learning" capacity to whom the TS is supplied is involved. In any case, the cost per service-hour should be calculated and evaluated. Note that in selecting a TS supplier (often the IP supplier), experience and dependency are critical.

In the case of TA there is usually a plurality of firms and choice is feasible.

==Approaches to royalty rate==

===Intellectual property===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2008}}
The rate of royalty applied in a given case is determined by various factors, the most notable of which are:

:* Market drivers and demand structure
:* Territorial extent of rights
:* Exclusivity of rights
:* Level of innovation and stage of development (see [[The Technology Life Cycle]])
:* Sustainability of the technology
:* Degree and competitive availability of other technologies
:* Inherent risk
:* Strategic need
:* The portfolio of rights negotiated
:* Fundability
:* Deal-reward structure (negotiation strength)

To correctly gauge royalty rates, the following criteria must be taken into consideration:

:* The transaction is at "arms-length"
:* There is a willing buyer and a willing seller
:* The transaction is not under compulsion

===Rate determination and illustrative royalties===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2008}}
There are three general approaches to assess the applicable royalty rate in the licensing of intellectual property. They are

# The Cost Approach
# The Comparable Market Approach
# The Income Approach

For a fair evaluation of the royalty rate, the relationship of the parties to the contract should:

:– be at "arms-length" (related parties such as the subsidiary and the parent company need to transact as though they were independent parties)
:– be viewed as acting free and without compulsion

====Cost approach====
The Cost Approach considers the several elements of cost that may have been entered to create the intellectual property and to seek a royalty rate that will recapture the expense of its development and obtain a return that is commensurate with its expected life. Costs considered could include R&D expenditures, pilot-plant and test-marketing costs, technology upgrading expenses, [[patent application]] expenditure and the like.

The method has limited utility since the technology is not priced competitively on "what the market can bear" principles or in the context of the price of similar technologies. More importantly, by lacking optimization (through additional expense), it may earn benefits below its potential.

However, the method may be appropriate when a technology is licensed out during its R&D phase as happens with [[venture capital]] investments or it is licensed out during one of the stages of [[clinical trial]]s of a pharmaceutical.

In the former case, the venture capitalist obtains an equity position in the company (developing the technology) in exchange for financing a part of the development cost (recovering it, and obtaining an appropriate margin, when the company gets acquired or it goes public through the [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] route).

Recovery of costs, with opportunity of gain, is also feasible when development can be followed stage-wise as shown below for a pharmaceutical undergoing clinical trials (the licensee pays higher royalties for the product as it moves through the normal stages of its development):

          Success State of development Royalty rates,%               Nature
          ----------------------------        ---------------         ----------------------
            Pre-clinical success 0-5 in-vitro
            Phase I   (safety)                   5-10 100 healthy people
            Phase II  (efficacy)                 8-15 300 subjects
            Phase III (effectiveness)           10-20 several thousand patients
            Launched product 20+                 regulatory body approval

A similar approach is used when [[custom software]] is licensed (an in-license, i.e. an incoming license). The product is accepted on a royalty schedule depending on the software meeting set stage-wise specifications with acceptable error levels in performance tests.

==== Comparable market approach ====
Here the cost and the risk of development are disregarded. The royalty rate is determined from comparing competing or similar technologies in an industry, modified by considerations of useful "remaining life" of the technology in that industry and contracting elements such as exclusivity provisions, front-end royalties, field of use restrictions, geographic limitations and the "technology bundle" (the mix of patents, know-how, trade-mark rights, etc.) accompanying it.

Although widely used, the prime difficulty with this method is obtaining access to data on comparable technologies and the terms of the agreements that incorporate them. Fortunately, there are several recognized{{by whom|date=October 2014}} organizations (see "Royalty Rate Websites" listed at the end of this article) who have comprehensive{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} information on both royalty rates and the principal terms of the agreements of which they are a part.

The comparability between transactions requires a comparison of the significant economic conditions that may affect the contracting parties:
* Similarity of geographies
* Relevant date
* Same industry
* Market size and its economic development;
* Contracting or expanding markets
* Market activity: whether wholesale, retail, other
* Relative market shares of contracting entities
* Location-specific costs of production and distribution
* Competitive environment in each geography
* Fair alternatives to contracting parties

==== Income approach ====
The Income approach focuses on the licensor estimating the profits generated by the licensee and obtaining an appropriate share of the generated profit. It is unrelated to costs of technology development or the costs of competing technologies.

The approach requires the licensee (or licensor): (a) to generate a cash-flow projection of incomes and expenses over the life-span of the license under an agreed scenario of incomes and costs (b) determining the [[Net Present Value]], NPV of the profit stream, based on a ''selected'' [[discounting|discount factor]], and c) negotiating the division of such profit between the licensor and the licensee.

The NPV of a future income is always lower than its current value because an income in the future is attended by risk. In other words, an income in the future needs to be discounted, in some manner, to obtain its present equivalent. The factor by which a future income is reduced is known as the  'discount rate'. Thus, $1.00 received a year from now is worth $0.9091 at a 10% [[discounted cash flow|discount rate]], and its discounted value will be still lower two years down the line.

The actual discount factor used depends on the risk assumed by the principal gainer in the transaction. For instance, a mature technology worked in different geographies, will carry a lower risk of non-performance (thus, a lower discount rate) than a technology being applied for the first time. A similar situation arises when there is the option of working the technology in one of two different regions; the risk elements in each region would be different.

The method is treated in greater detail, using illustrative data, in [[Royalty rate assessment|Royalty Assessment]].

The licensor's share of the income is usually set by the "25% rule of thumb", which is said to be even used by tax authorities in the US and Europe for arms-length transactions. The share is on the operating profit of the licensee firm. Even where such division is held contentious, the rule can still be the starting point of negotiations.

Following are three aspects that are important for the profit:

:(a) the profit that accrues to the licensee may not arise solely through the engine of the technology. There are returns from the mix of assets it employs such as fixed and working capital and the returns from intangible assets such as distribution systems, trained workforce, etc. Allowances need to be made for them.

:(b) profits are also generated by thrusts in the general economy, gains from infrastructure, and the basket of licensed rights – patents, trademark, know-how. A lower royalty rate may apply in an advanced country where large market volumes can be commanded, or where protection to the technology is more secure than in an emerging economy (or perhaps, for other reasons, the inverse).

:(c) the royalty rate is only one aspect of the negotiation. Contractual provisions such as an exclusive license, rights to sub-license, warranties on the performance of technology etc may enhance the advantages to the licensee, which is not compensated by the 25% metric.

The basic advantage of this approach, which is perhaps the most widely applied, is that the royalty rate can be negotiated without comparative data on how other agreements have been transacted. In fact, it is almost ideal for a case where precedent does not exist.

It is, perhaps, relevant to note that the [[IRS]] also uses these three methods, in modified form, to assess the attributable income, or division of income, from a royalty-based transaction between a US company and its foreign subsidiary (since [[Law of the United States|US law]] requires that a foreign subsidiary pay an appropriate royalty to the [[Holding company|parent company]]).<ref>{{cite web|title= Treasury Evaluations | url=http://www.intltaxlaw.com/shared/transfer/regs.htm|  accessdate =2007-09-27}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref>

=== Other compensation modes ===
Royalties are only one among many ways of compensating owners for use of an asset. Others include:
:*buying the asset outright, possibly with a [[leaseback]] arrangement
:*offering the licensor an [[Ownership equity|equity]] position in the licensee company
:*staged [[milestone]] payments (as in [[drug development]] and commissioned software arrangements)
:*[[lump sum]] payment made to the licensor in one or more installments
:*[[cross-licensing]] agreements with or without cash payments, and
:*entering into a [[strategic alliance]] or Joint Venture.

In discussing the licensing of Intellectual Property, the terms ''[[Intellectual property valuation|valuation]]'' and ''evaluation'' need to be understood in their rigorous terms.
Evaluation is the process of assessing a license in terms of the specific metrics of a particular negotiation, which may include its circumstances, the geographical spread of licensed rights, product range, market width, licensee competitiveness, growth prospects, etc.

On the other hand, valuation is the [[fair market value]] (FMV) of the ''asset'' – trademark, patent or know-how – at which it can be sold between a willing buyer and willing seller in the context of best awareness of circumstances. The FMV of the IP, where assessable, may itself be a metric for evaluation.

If an emerging company is listed on the [[stock market]], the [[Market capitalization|market value]] of its intellectual property can be estimated from the data of the [[balance sheet]] using the equivalence:

Market Capitalization = Net [[Working capital|Working Capital]] + Net [[Fixed asset|Fixed Assets]] + Routine [[Intangible asset|Intangible Assets]] + IP

where the IP is the residual after deducting the other components from the market valuation of the stock. One of the most significant intangibles may be the work-force.

The method may be quite useful for valuing trademarks of a listed company if it is mainly or the only IP in play (franchising companies).

'''Festus Claudius "Claude" McKay''' (September 15, 1889<ref>See James, Winston (2003), "Becoming the People's Poet: Claude McKay's Jamaican Years, 1889-1912," in ''Small Axe: A Caribbean Journal of Criticism'', March 2003, No. 13, pp. 17-45; note 8. There has been much confusion over whether McKay was born in 1889 or 1890, but his birth certificate has been discovered showing that he was, in fact, born in 1889.</ref> – May 22, 1948) was a [[Jamaican]]-[[United States|American]] writer and poet, who was a seminal figure in the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. He wrote four novels: ''Home to Harlem'' (1928), a best-seller that won the [[William E. Harmon Foundation award for distinguished achievement among Negroes|Harmon Gold Award]] for Literature, ''Banjo'' (1929), ''Banana Bottom'' (1933), and in 1941 a manuscript called ''Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem'' that has not yet been published.<ref name=NYTimes>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/books/harlem-renaissance-novel-by-claude-mckay-is-discovered.html Felicia R. Lee, "New Novel of Harlem Renaissance Is Found,"] ''The New York Times'', September 14, 2012.</ref> McKay also authored collections of poetry, a collection of short stories, ''Gingertown'' (1932), two autobiographical books, ''A Long Way from Home'' (1937) and ''My Green Hills of Jamaica'' (published posthumously), and a non-fiction, socio-historical treatise entitled ''Harlem: Negro Metropolis'' (1940). His 1922 poetry collection, ''Harlem Shadows'', was among the first books published during the Harlem Renaissance. His ''Selected Poems'' was published posthumously, in 1953.

McKay was attracted to [[communism]] in his early life, but he always asserted that he never became an official member of the [[Communist Party USA]]. However, some scholars dispute the claim that he was not a communist at that time, noting his close ties to active members, his attendance at communist-led events, and his months-long stay in the Soviet Union in 1922&ndash;23, which he wrote about very favorably.<ref>Tyrone Tillery, Claude McKay: A Black Poet's Struggle for Identity. University of Massachusetts Press, 1992, pp. 64-65, 68-70.</ref> He gradually became disillusioned with communism, however, and by the mid-1930s, he had begun to write negatively about it.<ref>Wayne F. Cooper, Claude McKay: Rebel Sojourner in the Harlem Renaissance, Louisiana State University Press, 1987, pp. 294-295.</ref>

==Early life==
Claude McKay was born in Nairne Castle near [[James Hill, Jamaica|James Hill]],<ref>Many sources claim this birthplace; however, Winston James (2003) says McKay was born in the village of Nairne Castle.</ref> [[Clarendon, Jamaica]]. He was the youngest child of Thomas Francis McKay and Hannah Ann Elizabeth Edwards, well-to-do farmers who had enough property to qualify to vote. Thomas McKay's father was of [[The Ashanti|Ashanti]] descent, and Claude recounted that his father would share stories of Ashanti customs with him. Claude's mother was of [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] ancestry.<ref>Long (1985), p. 353.</ref>

At four years old, McKay started basic school at the church that he attended. At the age of seven, he was sent to live with his oldest brother, [[Uriah Theodore]], a teacher, to be given the best education available. While living with this brother, McKay became an avid reader of classical and British literature, as well as philosophy, science and theology. He started writing poetry at the age of 10.

In 1906, McKay became apprenticed to a carriage and cabinet maker known as Old Brenga, staying in his apprenticeship for about two years. During that time, in 1907, McKay met a man named Walter Jekyll, who became a mentor and an inspiration for him and encouraged him to concentrate on his writing. Jekyll convinced McKay to write in his native dialect and even later set some of McKay's verses to music. Jekyll helped McKay publish his first book of poems, ''Songs of Jamaica'', in 1912. These were the first poems published in [[Jamaican Patois]] (dialect of mainly [[English language|English]] words and [[Languages of Africa|African]] structure). McKay's next volume, ''Constab Ballads'' (1912), was based on his experiences of joining the constabulary for a brief period in 1911.<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted by Em |url=http://claudemckay.blogspot.co.uk/2007/04/biography-mckays-jamaica-years-still.html |title="Biography, McKay's Jamaica Years, Still Further Continued", The Dialect Poetry of Claude McKay |publisher=Claudemckay.blogspot.co.uk |date=2004-02-26 |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref><ref>[http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/mckay/life.htm Freda Scott Giles, "Claude McKay's Life"], Modern American Poetry.</ref>

==Career in the United States==
McKay left for the U.S. in 1912 to attend [[Booker T. Washington]]'s [[Tuskegee Institute]].  McKay was shocked by the intense [[racism]] he encountered when he arrived in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where many public facilities were [[racial segregation|segregated]], which inspired him to write more poetry. At Tuskegee, he disliked the "semi-military, machine-like existence there" and quickly left to study at [[Kansas State University]]. At Kansas State, he read [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]' ''[[Souls of Black Folk]]'', which had a major impact on him and stirred his political involvement. But despite superior academic performance, in 1914 McKay decided he did not want to be an [[agronomist]] and moved to [[New York]], where he married his childhood sweetheart Eulalie Lewars.

{{Left communism sidebar}}
McKay published two poems in 1917 in ''[[The Seven Arts]]'' under the pseudonym Eli Edwards while working as a waiter on the railways. In 1919, he met [[Crystal Eastman|Crystal]] and [[Max Eastman]], who produced ''[[The Liberator(socialist)|The Liberator]]'' (where McKay would serve as co-executive editor until 1922).<ref>''The Chicago Defender'' (National edition) (1921-1967); April 2, 1921; ProQuest Historical Newspapers: ''Chicago Defender'' (1910-1975), p. 1.</ref> It was here, as the co-editor of ''The Liberator'', that he published one of his most famous poems, "If We Must Die", during the "[[Red Summer]]", a period of intense racial violence against black people in Anglo-American societies. The poem was reportedly later quoted by [[Winston Churchill]] during [[World War II]].<ref>[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/myths/myths/1559-churchill-quoted-radical-poet-claude-mckay According to David Freeman ("Churchill quoted radical poet Claude McKay"; originally published in ''Finest Hour'' 125, Winter 2004-025), while Churchill may have been familiar with McKay's words there is no documented evidence of him citing the poem in any speech.] The Churchill Centre and Museum at the Churchill War Rooms, London.</ref> <!--*unclear what this refers to*This was among a page of his poetry that signaled the commencement of his life as a professional writer.-->

McKay became involved with a group of black [[Far left|radicals]] who were unhappy both with [[Marcus Garvey]]'s [[black nationalism|nationalism]] and the [[middle-class]] reformist [[NAACP]]. These included other Caribbean writers such as [[Cyril Briggs]], [[Richard B. Moore]] and [[Wilfrid Domingo]]. They fought for black self-determination within the context of [[socialism|socialist]] revolution. Together they founded the semi-secret revolutionary organization, the [[African Blood Brotherhood]]. [[Hubert Harrison]] had asked McKay to write for Garvey's ''[[Negro World]]'', but only a few copies of the paper have survived from this period, none of which contain any articles by McKay. McKay soon left for [[London]], [[England]].

==In London==
McKay arrived in [[London]] in autumn 1919. He used to frequent a soldier's club in [[Drury Lane]] and the [[International Socialist Club]] in [[Shoreditch]]. A militant atheist, he also joined the [[Rationalist Press Association]]. It was during this period that McKay's commitment to socialism deepened and he read [[Marx]] assiduously. At the International Socialist Club, McKay met [[Shapurji Saklatvala]], [[A. J. Cook (trade unionist)|A. J. Cook]], [[Guy Aldred]], [[Jack Tanner (trade unionist)|Jack Tanner]], [[Arthur McManus]], [[Willie Gallacher|William Gallacher]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and [[George Lansbury]]. He was soon invited to write for ''[[Workers' Dreadnought]]''.

In 1920, the ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'', a socialist paper published by George Lansbury, included a [[Racism|racist]] article written by [[E. D. Morel]]. Entitled "Black Scourge in Europe: Sexual Horror Let Loose by France on the Rhine", it insinuated gross hypersexuality on [[black people]] in general, but Lansbury refused to print McKay's response. This response then appeared in ''Workers' Dreadnought''. This started his regular involvement with ''Workers' Dreadnought'' and the [[Workers' Socialist Federation]], a [[Council Communist]] group active in the [[East End of London|East End]] and which had a majority of women involved in it at all levels of the organization. He became a paid journalist for the paper; some people claim he was the first black journalist in Britain. He attended the Communist Unity Conference that established the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. At this time he also had some of his poetry published in the ''[[Cambridge Magazine]]'', edited by [[C. K. Ogden]].

When Sylvia Pankhurst was arrested under the [[Defence of the Realm Act]] for publishing articles "calculated and likely to cause [[sedition]] amongst His Majesty's forces, in the Navy, and among the civilian population," McKay had his rooms searched. He is likely to have been the author of "The Yellow Peril and the Dockers" attributed to "Leon Lopez", which was one of the articles cited by the government in its case against ''Workers' Dreadnought''.

==In Russia==

From November 1922 to June 1923, he visited the Soviet Union and attended the fourth congress of the Communist International in [[Moscow]]. There, he met many leading [[Bolshevik]]s including [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and [[Karl Radek]]. Claude McKay details his experience in Russia in the essay "Soviet Russia and the Negro" published in the December 1923 issue of [[The Crisis]] Magazine.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKay|first=Claude|title=Soviet Russia and the Negro|journal=The Crisis|date=December 1923|page=61}}</ref> [[File:Claude McKay Kremlin Crisis Dec 1923.png|thumb|alt=Claude McKay at the Kremlin Crisis Dec 1923]] McKay wrote the manuscripts for a book of essays called ''Negroes in America'' and three stories published as ''Lynching in America'', both of which appeared first in Russian and were re-translated into English; McKay's original English manuscripts have been lost.<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Duke University Press | isbn =978-0-8223-2976-3 | last = Baldwin | first = Kate A. | title = Beyond the Color Line and the Iron Curtain: Reading Encounters between Black and Red, 1922-1963 | location = Durham, N.C. | year = 2002 | pages = 28–32 }}</ref> When Russia was under the rule of communists led by Lenin he was invited to Russia while being reconstruction of the country, out of the experience of going from one end of the country to the other he wrote one of his most famous poems: "If We Must Die."

==''Home to Harlem'' and other works==
In 1928, McKay published his most famous novel, ''Home to Harlem'', which won the Harmon Gold Award for Literature. The novel, which depicted street life in Harlem, would have a major impact on black intellectuals in the [[Caribbean]], [[West Africa]], and [[Europe]].<ref name="findarticles.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_3_34/ai_67413397 |title=Haiti and Black Transnationalism: Remapping the Migrant Geography of Home to Harlem - Critical Essay &#124; African American Review &#124; Find Articles at BNET.com |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>

McKay's novel gained a substantial readership, especially with people who wanted to know more about the intense, and sometimes shocking, details of [[Harlem]] nightlife. His novel was an attempt to capture the energetic and intense spirit of the "uprooted black [[Vagabond (person)|vagabonds]]." ''Home to Harlem'' was a work in which McKay looked among the common people for a distinctive black identity.

Despite this, the book drew fire from one of McKay's heroes, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. To Du Bois, the novel's frank depictions of sexuality and the nightlife in Harlem only appealed to the "prurient demand[s]" of white readers and publishers looking for portrayals of black "licentiousness." As Du Bois said, "''Home to Harlem'' ... for the most part nauseates me, and after the dirtier parts of its filth I feel distinctly like taking a bath."<ref name="findarticles.com"/> Modern critics now dismiss this criticism from Du Bois, who was more concerned with using art as [[propaganda]] in the struggle for [[African-American]] political liberation than in the value of art to showcase the truth about the lives of black people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/hopkins_guide_to_literary_theory/free/african-american_theory_and_criticism-_1.html |title=The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism |publisher=Press.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>

McKay's other novels were ''Banjo'' (1929), and ''Banana Bottom'' (1933). ''Banjo'' was noted in part for its portrayal of how the [[French people|French]] treated people from its sub-Saharan African colonies, as the novel centers on black seamen in [[Marseilles]]. [[Aimé Césaire]] stated that in ''Banjo'', blacks were described truthfully and without "inhibition or [[prejudice]]". ''Banana Bottom'' was McKay's third novel. The book is said to follow a principal theme of a black individual in search of establishing a cultural identity in a white society. The book discusses underlying racial and cultural tensions.

McKay also authored a collection of short stories, ''Gingertown'' (1932), two [[autobiographical]] books, ''A Long Way from Home'' (1937) and ''My Green Hills of Jamaica'' (published posthumously in 1979), and a non-fiction, socio-historical treatise entitled ''Harlem: Negro Metropolis'' (1940). His collection ''Selected Poems'' (1953) was published posthumously and included a Foreword by [[John Dewey]].

McKay became an American citizen in 1940.

Becoming disillusioned with communism, McKay embraced the social teachings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], to which he converted in 1944.<ref>James, Winston (2001). ''A Fierce Hatred of Injustice: Claude McKay's Jamaica and His Poetry of Rebellion'' (London:  Verso), p. 46.</ref> He died from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in Chicago at the age of 59.

==Legacy==
In 1977, the government of Jamaica named Claude McKay the national poet and posthumously awarded him the [[Order of Jamaica]] for his contribution to literature.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jWwWmQQAy38C&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=%22order+of+jamaica%22+claude+mckay&source=bl&ots=1PYgg1QJH_&sig=oSztHLp9xezs5kgwsWbjXQElwZE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m_S1UZ2DE5Pu0gXI2YCIDw&ved=0CFMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22order%20of%20jamaica%22%20claude%20mckay&f=false |title="Claude McKay", in Julie Buckner Armstrong, Amy Schmidt (eds), '&#39;The Civil Rights Reader: American Literature from Jim Crow to Reconciliation'&#39;, University of georgia Press, 2009, p. 62 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jnht.com/site_claude_mckays_birthplace.php |title=Jamaica National Heritage Trust |publisher=Jnht.com |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>

==Unknown manuscript==
A previously unknown manuscript of a 1941 novel by McKay was authenticated in 2012. The manuscript, ''Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem'', was discovered by Jean-Christophe Cloutier in the [[Samuel Roth]] Papers, a previously untouched university archive at [[Columbia University]], in 2009. The novel centers on the ideas and events (such as [[Benito Mussolini]]’s [[invasion of Ethiopia]]) that animated Harlem on the cusp of World War II. Working in collaboration, Professor Cloutier and Professor Brent Hayes Edwards successfully authenticated the manuscript, and have received permission from the McKay estate to publish the novel, a satire set in 1936, with an introduction about how it was found and its provenance verified.<ref name=NYTimes />

The genus '''''Phelsuma''''' consists of several [[lizard]]s in the [[gecko]] family, commonly referred to as '''day geckos'''.

==Description==
[[File:P-flavigularis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yellow-throated day gecko]], ''Phelsuma flavigularis''|150px]]
In contrast to most other [[gecko]] species, day geckos are active mainly during the day. Other diurnal geckos include species of the genera ''[[Lygodactylus]]'' and ''[[Gonatodes]]''. As with all other geckos, day geckos lack eyelids, having, instead, rounded pupils and a clear, fixed plate covering their eyes which they clean with their tongues.  Many species have bright green, red, and blue colors which make them popular [[terrarium]] or [[vivarium]] pets. These brilliant colors play a role in intraspecies recognition and also serve as camouflage. 

The length of the different ''Phelsuma'' species varies between about {{convert|6.5|and|30|cm|in}}, but the extinct [[Rodrigues giant day gecko]] was even larger. Day geckos have toe pads consisting of tiny [[lamella (zoology)|lamella]]e which allow them to walk on plain vertical and inverted surfaces like bamboo or glass. The inner toe on each foot is [[vestigial]]. Males have well-developed [[Femoral triangle|femoral]] pores on the undersurface of their rear limbs. These pores are less developed or absent in females. Females often have well-developed [[endolymphatic]] chalk sacs on the sides of their necks. These sacs store calcium, which is needed for egg production. Those eggs can often be seen through the ventral surface of the female's body shortly before they are laid. The hatchlings reach sexual maturity between six and 12 months old. Smaller species may live up to 10 years, whereas the larger species have been reported to live more than 20 years in captivity.

==Distribution and habitat==
Day geckos inhabit the islands of the south-west part of the [[Indian Ocean]]. The exceptions are ''[[Phelsuma andamanense]]'', which is endemic to the [[Andaman Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]], and ''[[Phelsuma dubia]]'', which is also found on the East Coast of mainland Africa, although it possibly was introduced there. Most ''Phelsumas'' species are found in [[Mauritius]] and [[Madagascar]]. Some species are found on neighbouring island groups, including the [[Mascarenes]], [[Seychelles]], and [[Comoros]]. Due to human introduction, they are also often found on some of the [[Hawaiian Islands]], including the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] and [[Kauai]], and the state of [[Florida]], where they were introduced as a form of pest control. The different ''Phelsuma'' species can be found from sea level up to 2,300 meters. Most day geckos are arboreal. They inhabit, amongst others, [[coconut]] palms and [[banana]] trees, but can also be found near human settlements, in gardens, on fences, houses, and huts. An exception, ''[[Phelsuma barbouri]]'', is a terrestrial species.

==Diet==
[[File:Gold dust day gecko.JPG|250px|thumb|Gold dust day gecko]]
Day geckos feed on various [[insect]]s and other [[invertebrate]]s in the wild. They also eat nectar, pollen, and occasionally soft, ripe and sweet fruits such as bananas.

In captivity, such a diet is simulated.  Insects which may be used include: (wingless) [[Drosophilidae|fruit flies]], various [[flies]], [[wax moth]]s, [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s, small [[super worm]]s, small [[butter worm]]s and [[mealworm]]s. Fruit, which is required a few times a week, may be small pieces of [[papaya]], [[banana]], fruit based baby food, or commercial gecko nectars.

In 2008 a [[BBC]] film crew took footage of a day gecko successfully begging a [[planthopper]] for honeydew.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7247472.stm|title=Gecko 'begs' insect for honeydew | work=BBC News | date=16 February 2008}}</ref>

== Classification ==
The genus ''Phelsuma'' was first described by the British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] in 1825 and named after the Dutch physician [[Murk van Phelsum]]. The genus consists of about 70 known [[species]] and [[subspecies]].

Two ''Phelsuma'' species (''[[Phelsuma gigas]]'' and ''[[Phelsuma edwardnewtoni]]'') are now considered to be extinct, probably due to the destruction of their environments by human settlers and their domestic animals. Many day gecko species are endangered today because an increasing percentage of their natural habitat, especially tropical forest, is being destroyed by human activity.

{{MahayanaBuddhism}}
'''Zhiyi''' ({{zh|c=??|p=zhì y?|w= Chih-I}}; {{lang-ja|Chigi}}) (538–597 CE) is traditionally listed as the fourth patriarch, but is generally considered the founder of the [[Tiantai]] tradition of [[Buddhism]] in China. His standard title was [[?rama?a]] Zhiyi (Ch. ????), linking him to the broad tradition of Indian asceticism. Zhiyi is famous for being the first in the history of [[Chinese Buddhism]] to elaborate a complete, critical and systematic classification of the Buddhist teachings. He is also regarded as the first major figure to make a significant break from the Indian tradition, to form an indigenous Chinese system.

==Biography==
Born with the [[Chinese surname|surname]] Chen (?) in [[Huarong District]], Jing Prefecture (????), Zhiyi left home to become a monk at eighteen, after the loss of his parents and his hometown Jiangling that fell to the Western Wei army when Zhiyi was seventeen. At 23, he received his most important influences from his first teacher, [[Nanyue Huisi]] (??) (515–577 CE), a [[meditation]] master who would later be listed as Zhiyi's predecessor in the Tiantai lineage. After a period of study with Huisi, he spent some time working in the southern capital of [[Jinling]] (??). Then in 575 he went to Tiantai mountain for intensive study and practice with a group of disciples. Here he worked on adapting the Indian meditation principles of [[samatha|?amatha]] and [[vipassana|vipa?yan?]] (translated as "zhi" and "guan") into a complex system of self-cultivation practice that also incorporated devotional rituals and confession/repentance rites. Then in 585 he returned to Jinling, where he completed his monumental commentarial works on the [[Lotus Sutra]], the Fahua wenzhu (587 CE), and the Fahua xuanyi (593 CE).

[[David W. Chappell|Chappell]] holds that Zhiyi: "...provided a religious framework which seemed suited to adapt to other cultures, to evolve new practices, and to universalize Buddhism."<ref>Chappell, David W. (1987). 'Is Tendai Buddhism Relevant to the Modern World?' in ''Japanese Journal of Religious Studies'' 14/2-3, 247-266. Source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20131024104831/http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MAG/mag30243.pdf PDF]; accessed: Saturday 16 August 2008. p.247</ref>

Zhiyi and [[Bodhidharma]] were contemporaneous,<ref name="nanzan-u.ac.jp">Swanson, Paul L. (2002). ''Ch'an and Chih-kuan: T'ien-t’ai Chih-i's View of <nowiki>“</nowiki>Zen<nowiki>”</nowiki> and the Practice of the Lotus Sutra''.

==Important works==
Rujun Wu identifies the {{Nihongo|''Great Concentration and Insight''|????|Mohe Zhiguan}} of Zhiyi as the seminal text of the Tiantai school.<ref>Rujun Wu (1993). ''T'ien-T'ai Buddhism and early M?dhyamika''. National Foreign Language Center Technical Reports. Buddhist studies program, University of Hawaii Press, p.&nbsp;1.

Among Zhiyi's many important works are the {{Nihongo|''Great Concentration and Insight''|????|Mohe Zhiguan}}, ''Liumiao Famen'', {{Nihongo|''Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra''|????|Fahua Wenzhu}}, and {{Nihongo|''Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra''|????|Fahua Xuanyi}}. Of the works attributed to him (although many may have been written by his disciples), about thirty are extant.

==Four Samadhis==
Zhiyi developed a curriculum of practice which was distilled into the 'Four Samadhis' (Chinese: ????;<ref>Swanson, Paul L. (2002).

</ref> Parsing the title, 'zhi' refers to "ch’an meditation and the concentrated and quiescent state attained thereby" (p.&nbsp;4) and 'guan' refers to "contemplation and the wisdom attained thereby" (p.&nbsp;4).<ref name="Swanson, Paul L. 2002 p.4">Swanson, Paul L. (2002). ''Ch'an and Chih-kuan: T'ien-t’ai Chih-i's View of <nowiki>“</nowiki>Zen<nowiki>”</nowiki> and the Practice of the Lotus Sutra''.

Swanson states that Zhiyi in the ''Mohe Zhiguan'':
<blockquote>
...is critical of an unbalanced emphasis on “meditation alone,” portraying it as a possible “extreme” view and practice, and offering instead the binome zhi-guan ?? (calming/cessation and
insight/contemplation, ?amatha-vipa?yan?) as a more comprehensive term for Buddhist practice.<ref>Swanson, Paul L. (2002). ''Ch'an and Chih-kuan: T'ien-t’ai Chih-i's View of <nowiki>“</nowiki>Zen<nowiki>”</nowiki> and the Practice of the Lotus Sutra''.

</blockquote>

The "Samadhi of One Practice" ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]. ''Ekavy?ha Sam?dhi''; Ch. ????) which is also known as the "samadhi of oneness" or the "calmness in which one realizes that all dharmas are the same" (''Wing-tsit Chan''), is one of the ''Four Samadhi'' that  both refine, mark the passage to, and qualify the state of perfect enlightenment expounded in the ''Mohe Zhiguan''.<ref name="Dumoulin 2005 p.311"/> The term "Samadhi of Oneness" was subsequently used by [[Daoxin]].<ref>Sheng-Yen, Master (????)(1988). Tso-Ch'an. Source: [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BJ001/02_10.htm]; (accessed: 6 August 2008) p.364</ref>

The Four Samadhis:
*'Samadhi of Constant Sitting' (Chinese: ????) or 'One Round Samadhi' (Chinese: ????);
*'[[Pratyutpanna Sutra|Pratyutpanna-samadhi]]' (Chinese: ????) or 'Prolonged Samadhi' or 'Samadhi of Constant Walking' (Chinese: ????);
*'Samadhi of Half Walking and Half Sitting' (Chinese: ??????)
*'Samadhi at Free Will' (Chinese: ?????) or 'Samadhi of Non-walking and Non-sitting' (Chinese: ??????)

==Five Periods of the Buddha's Teaching==
T'ien-T'ai taught that the [[Buddha]] taught over five periods (J. ''Go-ji''). The five periods of the Buddha's teaching [according to T'ien-t'ai], were:

1) '''The Flower Garland period''' – taught immediately after the Buddha attained Enlightenment, lasting 3 weeks.<ref name="ReferenceA">Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, Soka Gakkai, "Five Periods"</ref><ref name="nichirenscoffeehouse.net">Ryuei Shonin, Rissho Ankoku Ron Glossary, "Five Periods" http://nichirenscoffeehouse.net/Ryuei/RAR35.html</ref>

2) '''The Agama Period''' – taught at Deer Park, and lasting 12 years.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="nichirenscoffeehouse.net"/>

3) '''The Correct and Equal Period''' – lasting 8 years.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="nichirenscoffeehouse.net"/>

4) '''The Wisdom Period''' – lasting 22 years.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="nichirenscoffeehouse.net"/>

5) '''The Lotus and Nirvana Period''' – lasting 8 years.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="nichirenscoffeehouse.net"/>

==Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life==
T'ien-t'ai taught the principle of Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought Moment (????) (J. ''Ichinen Sanzen'') in his 'Great Concentration and Insight', based on the [[Lotus Sutra]]. The number 'Three Thousand' is derived from the Ten Worlds, multiplied by ten [because of the Mutual Possession of the Ten Worlds], which gives 100, multiplied by ten [the [[Ten suchnesses|Ten Factors]] listed in Ch. 2 of the [[Lotus Sutra]]] which gives 1,000. 1,000 multiplied by 3 [the Three Realms of Existence: Self, Other, and Environment] which gives 3,000.<ref name="ReferenceB">Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, Soka Gakkai, "Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life"</ref>

Volume 5 of Great Concentration and Insight states: ''"Life at each moment is endowed with the Ten Worlds. At the same time, each of the Ten Worlds is endowed with all Ten Worlds, so that an entity of life actually possesses one hundred worlds. Each of these worlds in turn possesses thirty realms, which means that in the one hundred worlds there are three thousand realms. The three thousand realms of existence are all possessed by life in a single moment. If there is no life, that is the end of the matter. But if there is the slightest bit of life, it contains all the three thousand realms.... This is what we mean when we speak of the 'region of the unfathomable.'"''<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

<!-- Commented out: [[Image:John Walker Programmer.jpg|frame|John Walker]] -->'''John Walker''' (born ca. 1950) is a [[programmer|computer programmer]], author and co-founder of the [[computer-aided design]] software company [[Autodesk]].

==Early projects==
In 1974/1975, Walker wrote the [[Timeline of computer viruses and worms|ANIMAL]] software, which self-replicated on [[UNIVAC 1100]] machines: this is considered to be{{who|date=August 2014}} one of the first computer viruses.<ref>Walker, John. [http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/univac/animalsrc.html ANIMAL Source Code]. fourmilab.ch</ref>{{fv|date=August 2014}}{{dubious|date=August 2014}}

Walker also founded the hardware integration manufacturing company [[Marinchip]]. Among other things, Marinchip pioneered the translation of numerous computer language compilers to [[Intel]] platforms.{{cn|date=August 2014}}

== Autodesk ==
In 1982, Walker and 12 other programmers pooled $59,000 to start Autodesk, and began working on several computer applications. The first to be completed was [[AutoCAD]],<ref name="MM">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=E3MdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-mIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3877,8593585&dq=john+walker+autodesk&hl=en |title=Micro-miracle: Autodesk has 'image' of success |author=John R. McCarty|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press |date=May 30, 1986}}</ref> a software application for computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting. AutoCAD which had begun life as InteractCAD, written by programmer Michael Riddle in a proprietary language; Walker and Riddle rewrote the program, and had a profit-sharing agreement for any product derived from InteractCAD. Walker subsequently paid Riddle US$10 million for all the rights.

By mid-1986, the company had grown to 255 employees with annual sales of over $40 million.<ref name="MM"/> That year, Walker resigned as chairman and president of the company, continuing to work as a programmer. <ref name="Leaves"/> In 1989, Walker's book, ''The Autodesk File'', was published.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=New Straits Times |date=November 2, 1989 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bqpUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BZADAAAAIBAJ&pg=3454,490477&dq=john+walker+autodesk+file+book&hl=en|title=Telling the Story Behind Autodesk}}</ref> It describes his experiences at Autodesk, based around internal documents (particularly email) of the company.<ref> {{cite web |title=''The Autodesk File: Bits of History, Words of Experience''|author=John Walker |publisher=Fourmilab Switzerland|accessdate=June 2, 2013}}</ref>

Walker moved to Switzerland in 1991. By 1994, when he resigned from the company, it was the sixth-largest personal computer software company in the world, primarily from the sales of AutoCAD. Walker owned about $45 million of stock in Autodesk at the time.<ref name="Leaves">{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/28/business/company-news-autodesk-founder-saddles-up-and-leaves.html |title=Autodesk Founder Saddles Up and Leaves - New York Times |author=John Markoff |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 28, 1994 }}</ref>

==Fourmilab==
Walker engages in personal projects, including a [[hardware random number generator]] called [[HotBits]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/| title=HotBits: Genuine random numbers, generated by radioactive decay| author=Walker, John|publisher=fourmilab.ch |accessdate=2006-03-30}}</ref> and his Earth and Moon viewer.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/earthview/| title=Earth and Moon Viewer|author=Walker, John|publisher=fourmilab.ch | accessdate=2006-03-30}}</ref>  He publishes on his personal domain, fourmilab.ch.

== In popular culture ==
Walker's interest in artificial life prompted him to hire [[Rudy Rucker]], a mathematician and science fiction author, for work on [[cellular automata]] software.  Rudy later drew from his experience at Autodesk in Silicon Valley for his novel ''[[The Hacker and the Ants]]'', in which one of the characters is loosely based on John Walker.{{cn|date=August 2014}}

'''''Warhammer Fantasy''''' is a [[fantasy]] setting, created by [[Games Workshop]], which is used by many of the company's games. Some of the best-known games set in this world are: the [[table top wargame]] ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battle]]'', the ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay]]'' (WFRP) pen-and-paper [[role-playing game]], and the [[MMORPG]] ''[[Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning]]''.<ref>[http://www.warhammeronline.com/gamedescription/index.php ]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref>

Warhammer is notable for its "dark and gritty" background world, which features a culture similar in appearance to [[Early Modern]] [[Germany]] crossed with [[Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]]. [[Chaos (Warhammer)|"Chaos"]] is central to the setting, as the forces of Chaos are unceasingly attempting to tear the mortal world asunder. The world itself is populated with a variety of races such as [[human]]s, [[High Elves (Warhammer)|high elves]], [[Dark Elves (Warhammer)|dark elves]], [[Wood Elves (Warhammer)|wood elves]], [[Dwarf (Warhammer)|dwarfs]], [[Undead (Warhammer)|undead]], [[Orc (Warhammer)|orcs]], [[Lizardmen (Warhammer)|lizardmen]], [[Ogre Kingdoms|ogres]], and other creatures familiar to many fantasy/role-playing settings.

The first edition of ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battle]]'' (WFB) was released by Games Workshop in early 1983.  Prior to this release, the company dealt primarily with the importing of American [[role-playing game]]s, as well as support and review of gaming products, either through their [[White Dwarf magazine]] periodical or as separate commercially available products. The game was a mix of a simple rule system with a background that was drawn from standard fantasy themes. The dedication was, in part, "to [[Michael Moorcock]]… whose fault it all is". The game thrived, and subsequent supplements added the particular background to the game. Each "Army List" included a partial history and some related aspects such as notable figures or short illustrative stories. With the publication of ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay]]'' in 1987, the setting had moved from background of the game to a full-fledged fantasy setting.

Besides ''Warhammer Fantasy Battle'', now in its eight edition, and WFRP, there have been novels set in the same background. Material published in ''White Dwarf'' (some of it subsequently republished in the game itself), the ''Citadel Journal'', and a number of other games using the same setting have all added to the background.

== Background ==

Warhammer is among the oldest of commercial fantasy worlds, which draws inspiration from [[Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], but the 1st edition also cited [[Robert E Howard]] (''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'') and [[Michael Moorcock]] as having a major influence on fantasy table-top games. What is recognizable as the Warhammer World began with the first edition of the game, but it evolved as its own setting with the release of ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay]]'' in 1986 and the 3rd edition of [[Warhammer Fantasy Battle]] in 1987.

Warhammer has developed a very recognizable stylistic image set. Skulls feature prominently, as well as gothic architecture, absurdly large weapons and shoulder-armor, and bizarre imagery reminiscent of director [[Terry Gilliam]]'s work, as well as a strong dose of [[black comedy]].  From its inspiration from [[Michael Moorcock]]'s novels, the Warhammer World is centred on the classic [[Man vs. Himself]] literary theme.  The [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos Gods]] are the flaws of humankind personified; the inner literal daemons of living things come back through a magic medium to torment and kill.  The ultimate victory of these forces is often hinted at, highlighting a strong assumption that sentient beings are fundamentally flawed and will eventually bring about their own destruction via the forces of Chaos.  This is especially tragic in light of the outside, non-Chaotic forces that threaten civilized beings, including rampaging Orcs, political strife, and general warfare.

The forces of Chaos were introduced into the Warhammer World by the "Old Ones": star-travelling gods responsible for the creation of most of the setting's sentient races. These Old Ones were brought low by the daemonic forces inadvertently unleashed by the collapse of their Warp Gates (one at either pole), leaving their creations to fend for themselves.  This backstory also provides an easy explanation for the variety of familiar fantasy races, and provides a logical framework for them to fit in.  Ogres and Halflings, for example, are closely related.  Both are resistant to the mutating effects of Chaos energies (fuelled by hearty appetites and efficient metabolisms), but have opposite physical templates.

The Warhammer world borrows considerably from historical events and other fantasy fiction settings. The Old World is recognisably Europe approximating to the Renaissance period - the Empire being set over what is modern Germany.  Many events are lifted and modified directly from real-world history, including the [[Black Death|Black Plague]] and the [[Moors|Moorish]] invasion of Spain, and others from original fantasy sources.  Like [[Middle-earth]], Warhammer's Elves are declining in population, and a [[Nagash (Warhammer)|Great Necromancer]] is reborn after the defeats in his Southern stronghold.

Of the races that inhabit the world, [[Rick Priestley]] identified their origins as being based on British themes, the dwarfs are like blunt-spoken [[Yorkshire]] men, Elves having a touch of [[Southern England]] and [[received pronunciation]] about them, and the Orcs speaking with a [[Cockney|working class London accent]].

=== Races and nations ===
{{main|Races and nations of Warhammer Fantasy}}
The fictional Warhammer races and events are described, below, using in-universe tone.

There are numerous nations and races in the Warhammer World. Mankind, the most prominent, often proves to be the most susceptible to the corrupting influence of Chaos. Most of the featured human nations are based in the Old World (analogous to real world [[Europe]]).
The Elves were the first truly civilised race to walk the world. Brought into creation by the Old Ones, the Elves showed a natural talent for magic and superlative skill at arms. The once glorious civilisation of the Elves was torn asunder many thousands of years ago by a bitter civil war, resulting in the sundering of the race into three distinct kindreds: the evil, twisted [[Dark Elves (Warhammer)|Dark Elves]], the proud, noble and magical [[High Elves (Warhammer)|High Elves]] who continue the ancient traditions from before the sundering, and a third group as the rustic, sylvan and mysterious [[Wood elves (Warhammer)|Wood Elves]]. The High Elves inhabit the magical island of Ulthuan (analogous to Atlantis), while the Dark Elves inhabit the continent of Naggaroth (correspondent to Canada and the north parts of North America in the real world), a desolate icy wilderness.

[[Dwarf (Warhammer)|Dwarfs]] are an ancient, grim, and determined race integral in the founding of the Empire. Dwarfs are the greatest craftsmen in the Warhammer World, a skill largely matched by the [[Chaos Dwarfs]] who split from their brothers after being corrupted by Chaos.

In the jungles of [[Lustria]] are the [[Lizardmen (Warhammer)|Lizardmen]] who were created by the Old Ones to aid in their great works. The Slann now lead the Lizardmen blindly, via ancient prophesies containing almost-incomprehensible instructions from their fallen gods. The culture and aesthetic of the Lizardmen are heavily inspired by those of the [[Aztec]] and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] cultures, and the New World continent (Lustria) which they inhabit corresponds to Central and South America in the real world.

[[Orc (Warhammer)|Orcs]] and [[Goblin (Warhammer)|Goblins]], and their kin (also known as Greenskins), are relatively primitive and disorganized, but their instinctive belligerence threatens the various nations. Their violent nature can be noted to commonly cause all-out wars among their own kind. They are found predominantly in the forests and mountains of the Old World, in the jungles to the south and stretched across the steppes to the East, but their kin can be found all over the world, inhabiting almost all continents and adapting to their environments. Thus there are many sub-species of Orcs and Goblins such as Black Orcs and Night Goblins.

Many races have fallen to, or been engendered by Chaos. The barbaric Warriors of Chaos (formerly called "[[Hordes of Chaos]]") invade the civilized nations from the far northern Chaos Wastes. [[Beastmen (Warhammer)|Beastmen]], the half-man half-beast products of Chaos are found in the dark forests of the Old World. Also a product of Chaos are the shrewd and evil ratmen, the [[Skaven]], whose vast, subterranean and [[labyrinth]]ine "Under-empire" riddles the earth.

Besides these, there are the [[undead (Warhammer)|Undead]], who are a result of the black sorceries devised by the first necromancer, [[Nagash (Warhammer)|Nagash]] in the long distant past. His legacy has left the [[Tomb Kings]] in the hot desert lands of Nehekhara to the south of the Old World, the [[Vampire Counts]] in the Old World itself and Nagash in his own city of undead.

== Fiction ==
{{main|Warhammer novels}}
Outside of games, there have also been numerous novels and short stories by various authors set in the ''Warhammer'' world, the most famous of which are the ''[[Gotrek and Felix]]'' novels by [[William King (author)|William King]]. The ''Gotrek and Felix'' series was taken over by Nathan Long, starting with ''Orcslayer'' in 2006.

Early in his career, [[Kim Newman]] wrote several Warhammer novels under the name 'Jack Yeovil'. Some elements from these books (in particular his heroine [[Genevieve Dieudonné]]) later reappeared in the award-winning [[Anno Dracula series]].
Early novels were published as "GW Books" by Boxtree Ltd, but more recently novels have been under Games Workshop's publishing arm, the [[Black Library]].

''[[Warhammer Monthly]]'' was a [[comic book]], published by [[Black Library]], which ran for over 5 years. As well as the fantasy settings, it also included strips set in the other areas of the Warhammer Universe.

Generally running concurrently with Warhammer Monthly was ''[[Inferno!]]'' — also published by Black Library — a magazine which compiled short stories and occasional unconnected illustrations set in the various fictional backgrounds of Games Workshop.

Recently Games Workshop licensed out the rights for comic books. [[Boom! Studios]] are currently working on a series of Warhammer and [[Warhammer 40,000]] (40k) comics, written by [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Ian Edginton]]. The first was the Warhammer 40k strip ''[[Damnation Crusade]]'', but this was followed by one in the fantasy universe: ''[[Forge of War]]''. When this was finished, they again started with a new series located in the Warhammer Fantasy universe. Their newest project is called "Warhammer - Condemned by Fire". This series features a witch-hunter fighting the Chaos minions in the remote regions of the Empire.

{{United States music}}
[[Massachusetts]] is a U.S. state in [[New England]]. The '''music of Massachusetts''' has developed actively since it was first colonized by Britain. The city of [[Boston]] is an especially large part of the state's present music scene, which includes several genres of [[rock music|rock]], as well as [[classical music|classical]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[hip hop music]].

==Concert music==
[[Image:NewEnglandConservatoryofMusic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[New England Conservatory of Music]] in Boston]]
Perhaps the most influential early composer of the United States was [[Lowell Mason]]. A native of Boston, Mason campaigned against the use of [[shape-note]] notation, and for the education in standard notation. He worked with local institutions to release collections of hymns and maintain his stature. Opposed to the shape-note tradition, Mason pushed American music towards a European model.

The [[Bay Psalme Book]] (''The Whole Booke of Psalmes Faithfully Translated into English Metre'') was published in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in 1640; it was the first book of any kind printed in the English colonies of North America. It became the standard used by New England churches for many years, though it contained no music itself, merely providing psalms and pointing readers to other prominent publications. The Bay Psalm Book was faithful to its source, but did not produce beautiful singing. In 1651, then, a third edition was created, and became known as the New England Psalm Book; this became the standard for many years. By this point, the evolution from the Ainsworth Psalter to the New England Psalm Book had steadily dwindled the number of tunes in use.

Massachusetts was later home to a number of the most prominent members of the [[First New England School]] of itinerant singing masters, including [[Daniel Read]] (later of [[New Haven, Connecticut]]) and [[Supply Belcher]] (later of [[Farmington, Maine]]).
Massachusetts is home to several formal ensembles: [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], [[Boston Pops Orchestra]], [[Boston Lyric Opera]], and [[Tanglewood Festival Chorus]]. Formal institutions for the perpetuation of formal music exist in the state as well: [[Boston Conservatory]], [[Longy School of Music]], [[New England Conservatory]], and [[Berklee College of Music]].

Choral music has been a major part of concert life with two of the oldest choral organizations in the United States based in Massachusetts: [[Stoughton Musical Society]], founded in 1786, and [[Handel and Haydn Society]], founded in 1815.

==Sea shanties==
As Massachusetts has long maintained a great maritime tradition from the early colonial fishermen to its importance in the [[whaling]] industry in the nineteenth century, songs of the sea have been prominent in the state's musical heritage. Traditional English [[sea shanties]] were brought to New England and preserved by colonial American seamen. A New England version of the sea shanty [[Spanish Ladies]] changes 'England' to 'New England' or, in some versions, '[[Boston]]' or '[[New Bedford]]', and 'British sailors' to 'Yankee Whalermen'.

==Folk music==
Folklorists who have collected traditional music of Massachusetts include Eloise Hubbard Linscott, whose field recordings from 1938 and 1941 are in the Library of Congress American Folklife Center.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.loc.gov/folklife/guides/listofcollectionsL-Q.html |title=List of Collections in the Archive of Folk Culture |accessdate=2008-01-18 |author=Library of Congress |authorlink=Library of Congress |date=2007-09-12}}</ref>

A number of musicians with ties to the [[American folk music revival]] have Massachusetts connections. While a teenager living in [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]], [[Joan Baez]] gave her first concert at the legendary [[Club 47]] in Cambridge. [[James Taylor]] was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], but later moved to North Carolina before once again relocating to [[Martha's Vineyard]]. He now lives in the town of Lennox. [[Paul Clayton (folksinger)|Paul Clayton]] from New Bedford, best known for his song "Gotta Travel On," was a minor figure in the folk revival. Both [[Bill Staines]], who grew up in Lexington, and [[Bonnie Raitt]], who attended college in Cambridge, were influenced by the folk revival through the concerts at [[Club 47]].

The diverse contemporary Massachusetts folk music scene includes musicians such as [[David Coffin]], who specializes in early music and sea music; [[Lui Collins]], a folk singer/songwriter; [[Vance Gilbert]], a folk singer with a background in jazz; and Aoife Clancy, formerly of [[Cherish the Ladies]], who sings traditional Irish and contemporary folk songs. It also includes [[Ellis Paul]], a singer-songwriter who came onto the Boston music scene in the late 1980s after arriving at [[Boston College]] on a track scholarship. Since then he has been the recipient of 14 Boston Music Awards.<ref>NPR Music.

According to the New England Folk Network Web site, Massachusetts hosts more than a dozen annual [[folk music]] festivals. Of these, the [[Lowell Folk Festival]] claims to be the biggest free folk festival in the United States, while the [[New England Folk Festival]], which began in 1944, may be the longest-running festival in the state. Festivals may include folk music from a wide diversity of cultures. For example, the 2007 New England Folk Festival included Bulgarian, Japanese, and Swedish music,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neffa.org/grid/perfs/index.html |title=NEFFA 2007 Festival Performer Index |accessdate=2008-01-18 |author=New England Folk Festival Association |authorlink=New England Folk Festival}}</ref> and the 2007 Working Waterfront Festival included Portuguese [[fado]] music and Mexican [[Norteño (music)|norteño]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.workingwaterfrontfestival.org/performers/ |title=Featured Guests |accessdate=2008-01-18}}</ref>

===1970s===
[[The Modern Lovers]], featuring [[Jonathan Richman]], David Robinson (later of [[The Cars]]), and, (for a short time) [[Jerry Harrison]] of [[Talking Heads]], came out of Boston, as did more mainstream acts like [[Aerosmith]], [[The Cars]] and [[Boston (band)|Boston]]. [[The J. Geils Band]] formed at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in Worcester, before adding Peter Wolf and Stephen Jo Bladd from Boston band The Hallucinations to the lineup.

Paul Pena was born in Hyannis and attended [[Clark University]] in Worcester. He played gigs at the Holden experiment with Bonnie Raitt and other Worcester folkies. He went on to play with T. Bone Walker and wrote the 1970s hit Jet Airliner. Also from the North Shore were the Nervous Eaters, who's fourth member was often one of the better guitar players in Boston at that time. They were managed by the Rathskeller Club in Kenmore Sq and released two 45's on the RAT label. They still play gigs within the New England area. To date they have released 3 albums, 5 CD's and many 45's records.

==Alternative rock==
[[Image:Pixies at Bumbershoot.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Pixies]]]]

The earliest [[alternative rock]] bands in Massachusetts hailed from [[Boston]] and included [[Salem 66]], [[Volcano Suns]] and [[Mission of Burma]]. Later bands from eastern Massachusetts included [[Pixies]], [[Honest Bob and the Factory-to-Dealer Incentives]], [[Morphine (band)|Morphine]], [[Chip Goddard]], [[Galaxie 500]], [[Swirlies]] and the [[Pernice Brothers]]. Farther west, in [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]], the dissolution of the legendary [[hardcore punk]] band [[Deep Wound]] spurred the foundation of future legends [[Sebadoh]] and [[Dinosaur Jr.]] from its ashes. Amherst and neighboring [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]] also spawned the [[Scud Mountain Boys]], [[Buffalo Tom]], [[Lo Fine]], and [[Cordelia's Dad]], the latter uniquely fusing [[old-time music|Appalachian folk music]] with hardcore punk rock.

==Hip hop==
{{Cleanup|section|date=May 2011}}
Although not nearly as prolific as the hip hop mecca of [[New York City]], the Boston scene includes the late rap legend [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]] of [[Gang Starr]], A-Trigga, Delishus, legendary rap/hip-hop producer [[Statik Selektah]],Lou Armstrong, [[Ed O.G.]], [[Big Shug]], [[Mr. Lif]], [[Akrobatik]], Masspike Miles, Singerpore Kane, Sam Adams, The Maestro Z.O.O.M., [[Sonny Shotz]], [[The Dean's List]], [[Smoke Bulga]], [[Benzino]], Roc Dukati, Millyz, [[Dre Robinson]], [[Moufy]], Daney Foxxwoodz, [[Slaine (rapper)|Slaine]], MC/producer duo [[7L & Esoteric]], Mark Wahlberg, and up-and-coming Lawrence MCs [[Termanology]], and [[Reks]].

==R&B==
The R&B group [[New Edition]] is from the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston.

==Hardcore==
{{main|Boston hardcore}}

As the [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] underground hit Boston, a few [[New wave music|new wave]] bands like Pastische, [[Lou Miami]] and the Kosmetix, [[Human Sexual Response (band)|Human Sexual Response]], [[DMZ (band)|DMZ]]—who were to Boston what the [[New York Dolls]] were to New York City and who evolved into [[garage rock]] revivalists [[Lyres (band)|Lyres]]; [[The Real Kids]], [[The Neighborhoods]], The Turbines, and The Neats played any form of punk. The founder of the Boston hardcore scene was [[Allan Barile]] from [[Lynn, Massachusetts]]. Barile saw [[Minor Threat]] in Washington, D.C. and brought hardcore home with him, intensifying DC's [[skinhead]] and [[straight edge]] subcultures. Boston also developed an active hardcore [[zine]] culture by 1980, most influentially including ''[[Forced Exposure]]''.

Barile's first band was [[SSD (band)|SSD]] (Society System Decontrol). It formed in 1981 and recorded the following year. SSD organized their own shows, not playing at typical venues, such as punk rock mainstay [[The Rathskeller|The Rat]], because those clubs served alcohol. They rented out [[Knights of Columbus]] halls in areas such as Cambridge and [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], and insisted that the performances be "all ages shows". Violence was common at these concerts and many people felt they made the punk scene violent. Mostly this was felt by older punks on the scene and casual fans. Other bands soon joined. In contrast to Barile's SSD, many of these bands were from suburbs of Boston including best known [[Gang Green]], heralding from [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]], [[DYS (band)|DYS]], [[The FU's]], [[Jerry's Kids (band)|Jerry's Kids]], [[Siege (band)|Siege]], [[The Freeze]] and [[Last Rights (band)|Last Rights]]; Stranglehold, and [[The Proleteriat]] from [[Fall River]]. Barile's Crew was known for being for the first major group of skinheads in the city of Boston. One of the most notorious of these straight edgers was [[Choke (band)|Choke]], who was actually attending [[Emerson College]] at the time. Choke played in a series of legendary bands including [[Negative FX]], [[Slapshot (band)|Slapshot]] and Last Rights. The Boston crew were a tight group of skinheads who were intensely loyal to one another and very territorial.

Unlike most hardcore bands, Boston's scene included [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fans. Barile himself was a fan of [[AC/DC]], while DYS, SSD and Gang Green all eventually made the switch to [[speed metal]]. The death of hardcore in Boston is said to have occurred in 1984, when Jerry's Kids announced at a show that "this is the end of hardcore. We started it and we're ending it here today." However, there are still many bands based out of Massachusetts that play hardcore, such as [[Righteous Jams]] and [[Bane (band)|Bane]].

The Boston hardcore scene of the 1990s was led by several hard hitting fan favorites, [[Sam Black Church (band)]], TREE, [[Wrecking Crew (band)|Wrecking Crew]] and [[Blood for Blood (band)|Blood for Blood]]. Other notable Boston area hardcore bands of the 1990s include Honkeyball, Scissorfight, Tapes Don't Skip, Corrin, Converge, Fall From Grace and Brawlpark.

In recent years many hardcore bands have included [[metalcore]] elements to their music. These bands have been considered the rebirth of hardcore in Boston and the surrounding areas, and bands include [[Black My Heart]], [[On Broken Wings]], Shere Khan (which features several members of the two previously mentioned bands), [[Shipwreck A.D.]], [[Death Before Dishonor (Boston band)|Death Before Dishonor]], [[Forced Coitus]], and [[MOB HIT]] (with ex-Wargasm drummer Barry Spillberg).

===Western Massachusetts hardcore===
Perhaps a bit less violent than the Boston scene, the early [[Western mass hardcore]] scene had several notable bands, including [[Deep Wound]], [[All White Jury]], [[Brain Injured Unit]], [[Cancerous Growth]], [[Pajama Slave Dancers]], [[Gray Matter (band)|Grey Matter]] and [[Outpatients (band)|Outpatients]]. Of these, Deep Wound was the most important, spawning pioneering [[alternative rock]] groups like Dinosaur Jr and later [[Sebadoh]], after the breakup of Deep Wound.

The late 80s to mid 90s saw many hardcore bands with a wide range of sounds. The 80s side included bands like Bloodbath, G Man, Wishful Thinking and Rumble Puppy. Many of these bands also had connections with the NYHC scene. During the early to mid nineties the scene contained acts ranging from heavy bands like Roachgrind, to punk bands like Wish and [[Maude (band)|Maude]], emo bands like [[Spoke (band)|Spoke]] and the abstract performance group Gutters. Most bands of the era released their own demo tapes and put out vinyl on Mark Dargie's Community Chest Records or Vandal Children Records run by Charlie Krich in Willimantic, Connecticut. Along with Mass. and Conn. basements, shows of this era happened at the Greenfield Grange, First Baptist Church of Northampton, Katina's, Pearl Street Nightclub, and even the middle school hangout Club Soda. Many of these bands also appeared at one time or another at the annual Northampton High School battle of the bands.

In the late 1990s several bands in Western Massachusetts (centered around the [[Five Colleges (Massachusetts)|five colleges]] in Northampton/Amherst) helped establish an [[indie rock]] scene. These included such bands as Apollo Sunshine, the Warren Commission, New Jersey Fairplan, Waterpistol, Psara, Delvic, The Right, Pixies and Noah's Dove. Waterpistol and Psara appear on [[Deep Elm Records]]'s ''The Emo Diaries'' compilation. The Warren Commission released several albums on the Boston label Espo Records. This was followed by a second wave of Western Massachusetts music, with [[emo]] and indie rock bands including I Am Disaster, Saveyourself, and the El to Addison. Many of these bands moved to the Boston area, where they have found some success or have broken up and formed new bands.

Western Massachusetts is still home to a bountiful hardcore scene. Bands such as, Fishercat, Fieldmaster, Limbs Bin, Lord Jeff, Buick Hands In, Shoot to Kill, Scurvy, Chuck Brunswick, Give 'Em Hell, Failures, Ampere, Orchid, Worms, Throwing Aces, Bloodwar, and many others are constantly playing in and out of the area.

==Metalcore==
Metalcore in Massachusetts started from the Boston hardcore scene and the influence of bands from the [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]]. The bands combined the two genres and created [[metalcore]], a whole new genre of metal in itself. In the middle of this musical renaissance, were two bands from Massachusetts that would form the way metalcore sounds today. [[Aftershock (band)|Aftershock]] and [[Overcast (band)|Overcast]] are known to some as the godfathers of this genre. Following the breakup of these two bands, two other metalcore acts spawned from a number of their members, namely [[Killswitch Engage]] and [[Shadows Fall]], two of the best-selling bands in metalcore. Other best-selling Massachusetts metalcore bands are [[The Acacia Strain]], [[All That Remains (band)|All That Remains]], [[Unearth]], and [[Within the Ruins]]. Other well-known Boston metalcore bands are [[Diecast (band)|Diecast]], [[The Red Chord]], [[Corrin]], and [[Bury Your Dead]].

==Experimental Noise==
{{Unreferenced section|small=yes|date=October 2013}}
There is a vibrant Experimental Noise scene in Western Massachusetts, including such bands as Fat Worm of Error, Egg Eggs, Zebu, Flaming Dragons of Middle Earth, etc. The label and record store of Northampton, Feeding Tube, provides a venue for many of these bands.

==Gameplay==
''Total Annihilation'' is set in the far future in the midst of a galactic war, with battles taking place on the surface of planets and moons. The efforts of the player are centered around constructing a defensive base and an offensive force, and conquering opponents. The player is also concerned with gathering resources, [[reconnaissance]] and stealth, and evaluation of units and terrain. Battles take place against [[artificial intelligence|AI]] in a story-driven campaign, with the option of playing against other players in a skirmish mode.

Normally, the player begins with the unique Commander unit, a [[mech]] with the ability to create structures to form a base and, by extension, a military force comprising a range of mobile units. The Commander, in addition to being a powerful combat unit, is vital to the player because of its ability to quickly construct units. This makes the loss of a Commander a critical event in any game. Construction is governed by the possession of the game's two unlimited resources, Metal and Energy, and can be undertaken by factories or mobile construction units. Every unit belongs to a level of technology (tech level); the higher the level, the more advanced the unit and the more resources and thus time required to construct it. A feature of the game is the ability to easily "queue" the many commands for a unit or group of units, with types of commands including patrolling a route, constructing a defensive group of structures and attacking enemy units. Once given its commands, the unit will go about them automatically thus minimizing the need for the player's attention to small, repetitive tasks. The victory conditions of a multiplayer game generally involve the elimination of all enemy units, but the aim of single player campaign missions can be more specialized.[[File:Total annihilation screenie 3.1415926.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An in-game screenshot of a ''Core'' base. Near the bottom-right corner the Commander (with the yellow backpack) is visible assisting a factory in construction.]]

===Resources===
Resources in ''Total Annihilation'' are handled in a manner different from other real-time strategy games of the day: they are "streaming", meaning that they are accumulated at a constant rate rather than in small batches; and they are limitless. In addition, all units and structures have a fixed cost, but they build at varying rates depending on the unit constructing them. A Commander, for example, will build a structure three times faster than a construction vehicle. Of course, the faster a unit or structure is built, the faster the cost thereof is deducted from the player's reserves, competing with the rate at which resources are acquired. Thus, the commander is a double-edged sword, being able to build units and structures quickly, but at rates that quickly become unsustainable in the early game without sufficient reserves. If the rate at which resources are used exceeds the rate at which resources are acquired, then the player's reserves will begin to be depleted. If a player's reserves are entirely depleted, the player's production across the board will slow to a rate proportional to the amount by which outflow exceeds income, this is known as "nanostalling". In addition, if the player runs out of energy, power-dependent structures such as radar towers, metal extractors, and laser towers will cease to function. This adds an element of economic complexity unparalleled in most RTS games of the time period. When units and buildings die, they leave behind burnt metal frames, commonly referred to as wrecks, which can be reclaimed by commanders and construction units. When a wreck is reclaimed, the reclaiming player receives the metal in a lump sum. Players need to be careful when attacking, because if they leave behind wrecks, and don't do much damage, they will give the enemy a boost of metal. This is commonly referred to as 'feeding' the enemy.

===Combat===
The player can command a variety of units including infantry bots, vehicles, ships, hovercraft, aircraft, powerful stationary long range weapons, and even a giant mecha known as the Core Krogoth.  Units can vary in size, speed and the ability to give and take damage, generally depending on their tech level.  The strongest units take longer to build as well as cost more resources.  Each unit has strengths and weaknesses, optimal styles of use, and corresponding units against which it is vulnerable or well-suited. Effective play is usually characterized by consideration of these attributes, as well as efficient resource management, strong defenses, and knowledge of the opponent's strategies. The game's [[User interface|interface]] consists of construction and command buttons (depending on the unit selected), unit status information, resource information on the production of Energy and Metal, and a minimap which gives an overview of the game's [[battlespace]]— the visibility of which may be hindered by [[fog of war]], necessitating the use of radar or scout units. There are a few highly advanced units which are invaluable combat-wise, such as nuclear missile launchers which have enormous range and very high damage, as well as long-range artillery that have enough range to attack any point on smaller maps. There are two story-related factions, Arm and Core, which have comparable sets of units (one side a little bit faster, other one a little bit tougher etc.), but are aesthetically different.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tauniverse.com/?page=articles/editorials/arm_v_core| title=Arm Versus Core – which is the better race?|author= Nemir|publisher=tauniverse.com|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}</ref> Generally, the Arm have faster, sleeker units while the Core units are built to take slightly more punishment.  This is shown exceptionally well by the Arm being able to build an extremely fast Kbot known as the Zipper, while the Core can build an armored Kbot known simply as The Can. When playing amongst experienced players, subtle differences between the two factions put Core players at a disadvantage. The most noticeable differences are as follows: The level 1 Arm fighter aircraft is 1.7x more maneuverable than its Core counterpart, the Arm commander walks 1.12x faster than the Core commander, amphibious Arm kbots float above water, making them faster and more useful than their submerging Core counterparts, Arm players can build Farks, fast assistant repair kbots which can be crowded around labs and structures to dramatically reduce build times, and level 1 Arm tanks are equipped with superior weapons. Core has some distinct advantage as well, such as superior naval units, level 1 bombers that drop more bombs, and less conspicuous nuclear facilities. These advantages, however, are overshadowed by the Arm advantages in most situations.

''Total Annihilation'' was one of the first RTS games to feature radar that caused enemy units within its radius to appear on the minimap despite being covered by the fog of war. This added an additional element of electronic warfare to the game: players could construct radar jammers that prevented units in a small radius around them from appearing on radar. Mobile radar jammers could be used to create surprise attacks, necessitating the deployment of scout units on a regular basis to reveal said units visually. In addition, radar jammers could disguise the presence of visually cloaked units, such as the commander or land mines. Radar fields rendered cloaked units detectable; a radar jammer could make said units undetectable until the radar jammer itself was destroyed. ''Total Annihilation'' was also one of the first RTS games to point the way towards battlefields with hundreds and thousands of units. Previous games could field a hundred units or so. However, Total Annihilation initially permitted 200 units per side which was later patched to 500 and then to 5,000 units per side.

===Physics===
The game features a physics engine which governs projectiles, explosions and wreckage. The terrain is strictly [[2-dimensional|2D]] but contains height values which allow it to act as a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] surface. Hills obstruct artillery fire, and, depending on the "line-of-sight" setting, height enhances units' visual and firing ranges. If terrain is steep and jagged, units tilt and turn to meet the face of the ground. Structures can be built on steep terrain to protect them from artillery fire and to create [[choke point]]s. [[Artillery]] shells are affected by gravity, which is actually variable on different planets- particularly on lower-gravity moons. Units that achieve five kills receive "veteran" status which increases health and damage, as well as giving the unit the ability to lead moving targets. This effect grows with every five subsequent kills.

==Story==
The game's start-up credits give a summary of the game's narrative:
<blockquote>
What began as a conflict over the transfer of consciousness from flesh to machines escalated into a war which has decimated a million worlds. The ''Core'' and the ''Arm'' have all but exhausted the resources of a galaxy in their struggle for domination. Both sides now crippled beyond repair, the remnants of their armies continue to battle on ravaged planets, their hatred fueled by over four thousand years of total war. This is a fight to the death. For each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the other.
</blockquote>
[[File:Total-annihilation.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Screenshot of an ''Arm'' campaign mission. The interface is visible along the top and left sides, displaying resource, minimap, construction and movement information.]]
In the far future the galaxy is ruled by a benevolent central body of humans and [[artificial intelligence]]s called the '''Core''' (a contraction of "Consciousness Repository"). The Core's technological and economic triumphs have allowed humanity to colonize most of the [[Milky Way]] and enjoy peace and prosperity. However, the balance is broken by a technological breakthrough which allows the consciousness of a human being to be reliably transferred into a machine, thereby granting theoretically indefinite life in a process called "patterning". Following a mandate imposed on humanity by the Core requiring everyone to undergo patterning as a public health measure, a rebel band is formed out of colonies from the edges of the galaxy (hence named the '''Arm'''), whose members refused to leave their natural bodies to join the Core's machines. A war lasting four thousand years followed, with the Arm mass-producing [[cloning|clones]] as pilots for its vehicles and the Core duplicating consciousness-embedded microchips to pilot its own machines.

The game's two campaigns focus on their respective sides' military leaders, the Commanders. The story of either the Core or the Arm starts with an effort to defend the protagonist's homeworld and initiate a turning point in the overall war. The player then fights a series of battles on a number of planets and moons, as transported to through Galactic Gates, a fictional form of [[faster-than-light]] travel. As the player progresses, more units become available for construction, either through the course of background story or upon completion of a mission centered around the unit in question. Mission objectives include protecting a vital structure or area, eliminating all enemy units, or capturing a pivotal enemy unit. The worlds upon which the player wages warfare force the player to adapt to different strategies; for example, deployment on a world whose surface is entirely composed of [[archipelago]]s necessitates the construction of an effective navy. Some have occasional weather conditions, such as meteor storms. Both campaigns include 25 missions, the final mission ending the war with a final strike on the enemy's homeworld — either the Arm's bucolic Empyrrean or the Core's artificial [[Jupiter Brain]] world of Core Prime.

==Expansions==

=== Downloadable content===
Starting in 1997 [[Cavedog]] began offering additional free [[downloadable content]] for ''Total Annihilation'', adding new units, maps, and scenarios over time.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20010330073657/http://www.cavedog.com/totala/dwnlds_frame.html TA downloadable units] on cavedog.com (archived in the [[Internet Archive]] on March 30, 2001)</ref>

===''The Core Contingency''===
Cavedog released ''[[Total Annihilation: The Core Contingency|The Core Contingency]]'' a year after the release of ''Total Annihilation''. It features 25 new missions as well as 75 new units. It continues the story after the ending of the Arm campaign. The expansion also comes with the ''Total Annihilation'' editor, which allows users to create maps and missions.

===''Battle Tactics''===
A month after ''The Core Contigency'', ''[[Total Annihilation: Battle Tactics|Battle Tactics]]'' was released, which includes four new units, 100 additional missions as well an experimental approach to ''Total Annihilation'' gameplay, with less emphasis on base construction.

==Soundtrack==
The game has an original orchestral soundtrack composed by [[Jeremy Soule]] and performed by the 96-piece Northwest Sinfonia orchestra. The music changes according to events: during a battle, louder and more frantic music plays. During post-war damage repair or idle construction, a more ambient and mysterious track is played. The soundtrack is in CD-audio format and can be listened to with ordinary CD players. An ordinary music CD can be inserted once the game is under way and can replace the original game music with its own tracks. It is even possible to program such custom CD tracks to the various battlefield situations (conflict, construction, defeat, etc.) like the default set.

==Reception==
The game was highly praised by critics and players, and won [[List of awards received by Total Annihilation|numerous awards]], including [[GameSpot]]'s Game of the Year Award for 1997.<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/totalannihilation Total Annihilation Reviews] at metacritic.com</ref> ''Total Annihilation'' is still played actively today, over 15 years after its release.<ref name="GamespyTop10RTS200402">[http://archive.gamespy.com/top10/february04/rts/index11.shtml Top Ten Real-Time Strategy Games of All Time] at gamespy.com (2004)</ref><ref name="GamespotHhistoryOfRTS1989to1998">[http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/real_time/p5_01.html History of Real-time Strategy Games: 1989–1998 – the Second Generation] at gamespot.com (2000)</ref><ref name="RTSCTA">[http://www.rakrent.com/rtsc/rtsc_totala.htm RTSC ''Total Annihilation'' Page] at rakrent.com (2006)</ref> It won [[Gamespy]]'s Top Ten Real-Time Strategy Games of All Time <ref>[http://archive.gamespy.com/top10/february04/rts/index11.shtml Top Ten Real-Time Strategy Games of All Time] at gamespy.com</ref> in 2004, leaving ''[[StarCraft]]'' in second place.

'''Cavedog Entertainment''', or '''Cavedog''', was a [[video game developer]] based in [[Bothell, Washington]]. Cavedog gained the attention of gamers and the gaming press alike with the 1997 release of ''[[Total Annihilation]]'' (''TA''), winning many accolades such as multiple ''Game of the Year'' honors<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/awards97/game.html| title=Game of the Year| work=Best & Worst Awards 1997| publisher=GameSpot| date=1998-01-31| accessdate=2010-06-22}}</ref> or being one of ''The Greatest Games of All Time''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-43.html| title=Armed to the Core: Total Annihilation| first=Greg| last=Kasavin| work=The Greatest Games of All Time| publisher=GameSpot| date=2004-03-26| accessdate=2010-06-22}}</ref>

==History==
Cavedog Entertainment was a label created in 1996 by [[Humongous Entertainment]], a developer of children's computer games founded by [[Ron Gilbert]] and [[Shelley Day]], to pursue the creation of [[mainstream]] games.<ref name=TAStory>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070807085133/http://www.gamespot.com/features/totalstory/|archivedate=2007-08-07|year=2007|accessdate=2011-01-08|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/totalstory/|publisher=gamespot.com|first=Geoffrey|last=Keighley|title=The Total Annihilation: The Story So Far}}</ref> Humongous Entertainment was originally independent, but was purchased in 1996 by [[GT Interactive]],<ref name=founding>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970530194653/www.cavedog.com/press/release1.html |title=GT INTERACTIVE LAUNCHES CAVEDOG ENTERTAINMENT, A NEW INTERNAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT STUDIO |archivedate=1997-05-30 |date=1997-02-05 |accessdate=2011-01-07 |url=http://www.cavedog.com/press/release1.html |publisher=gtinteractive.com}}</ref> a video game publisher later acquired by [[Infogrames]] in 1999 (later renamed to Atari).

The game's creator, [[Chris Taylor (game designer)|Chris Taylor]], left the company shortly before the release of the ''[[Total Annihilation: Core Contingency]]'' [[expansion pack]] to found his own development house, [[Gas Powered Games]]. Despite this loss, Cavedog released one more expansion pack, ''[[Total Annihilation: Battle Tactics]]'', as well as many freely downloadable enhancements and [[patch (computing)|patch]]es, and built strong community support with their own online service Boneyards (now shut down) that matched opponents and provided a continuing game campaign.

In 1999, Cavedog released the eagerly anticipated ''[[Total Annihilation: Kingdoms]]''. ''TA:Kingdoms'' largely reused the ''TA'' [[game engine]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} replacing the [[science fiction theme]] with one of [[fantasy]]. ''TA:Kingdoms'' did not resonate as well with critics or fans of the original title. One expansion pack was released,  ''The Iron Plague''.

The closure of Cavedog came as the game industry began to experience a downturn in sales, to which parent company GT Interactive was no exception. Besides the ''TA'' [[Media franchise|franchise]], Cavedog had three ambitious<ref>{{cite web

The unfinished projects were ''[[Amen: The Awakening]]'', a [[first-person shooter]]; ''Elysium'', a fantasy [[adventure game|adventure]] title, and ''Good & Evil'', an adventure title from Ron Gilbert. With GT Interactive spiraling into [[debt]] and no ship dates in sight, all three were discontinued by the Fall of 1999. 
GT Interactive was purchased by Infogrames and the Cavedog label was discarded by Humongous Entertainment in 2000, which renewed its focus on children's games. Cavedog declared bankruptcy in 2000. Humongous Entertainment was shut down in 2005 by Infogrames (now called Atari).
Cavedog's developers have played significant roles at [[Gas Powered Games]] and [[Beep Industries]].

'''Trinity Anglican School''' is a private [[Anglican]] School located in [[Tropical North Queensland]], [[Australia]].


TAS White Rock caters for students from Kindergarten through to Year 12 and TAS Kewarra Beach serves students from Prep to Year 7.

The motto of the school is ''Docentes Omnia Servare'', which is Latin for "teaching them to observe all things". 

In 2008 the school celebrated its 25th birthday on Trinity Day. Trinity Day occurs on the 25th of May, and is the anniversary of the date when the school opened in 1983.

TAS, along with other private school's in Cairns was criticised in 2008 for receiving laptop's from the federal government over that of more needy school's. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2008/06/14/4587_local-news.html}}</ref>

'''Logitech International S.A.''' is a [[Swiss]] global provider of personal computer and tablets accessories with EMEA headquarters in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]] and Americas headquarters in [[Newark, CA]]. The company develops and markets products like peripheral devices for [[Personal computer|PCs]], including [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]], [[Mouse (computing)|mice]], [[trackballs]], [[microphones]], [[game controller]]s and [[webcams]]. Logitech also makes home and [[computer speaker]]s, headphones, [[wireless]] audio devices, as well as audio devices for [[MP3 players]] and [[mobile phones]]. More recently, the company has begun making keyboards and covers for tablets.

In addition to its Swiss and Americas headquarters, the company has offices throughout [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the rest of the Americas. Logitech's sales and marketing activities are organized into three geographic regions: [[Americas]], [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]], and [[Asia Pacific]].



== History ==
Logitech International S.A. was co-founded in [[Apples, Vaud]], [[Switzerland]], in 1981 by two [[Stanford]] PhD alumni, [[Daniel Borel]] and [[Pierluigi Zappacosta]], Jean-luc Mazzone and [[Giacomo Marini]], formerly a manager at [[Olivetti]].

The mass-marketed [[Mouse (computing)|computer mouse]] was the product that made Logitech well-known. The range of products offered improvements over a product originally developed at LAMI ([[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]]) by professor  [[Jean-Daniel Nicoud]] and engineer [[André Guignard]], who was involved in the design changes of the computer mouse originally invented by [[Douglas Engelbart]].

For a time during its formative years, Logitech's [[Silicon Valley]] offices occupied space at [[165 University Avenue]], [[Palo Alto]], [[California]], home to a number of noted technology startups.

From there, Logitech expanded its product line (see below) to encompass many mass market computer peripherals and beyond (such as the "Harmony" range of programmable universal remote controls).

In 2007, Logitech licensed [[Hillcrest Labs]]' Freespace motion control technology to produce the MX Air Mouse, which allows a user to use natural gestures to control a PC.<ref name="Vilches">''Techspot'' July 13, 2007.

== Production ==
The first Logitech mice were made in [[Le Lieu]], in the Swiss [[Canton of Vaud]] by Dubois Depraz SA.

Production facilities were then established in the [[United States|US]], [[Taiwan]], [[Ireland]] and moved subsequently to [[Suzhou]], China.  {{As of|2005}}, the manufacturing operations in China produce approximately half of Logitech's products.  The remaining production is outsourced to [[contract manufacturer]]s and original design manufacturers in [[Asia]].

'''33''' ('''thirty-three''') is the [[natural number]] following [[thirty-two|32]] and preceding [[thirty-four|34]].

==In mathematics==

33 is the smallest sum of two positive numbers, each of which raised to the fifth power: 1^5 + 2^5 = 33.
 
33 is the largest positive integer that cannot be expressed as a sum of different [[triangular numbers]]. It is also the smallest odd [[repdigit]] that is not a prime number.

33 is the eighth distinct [[semiprime]] comprising the prime factors (3 • 11). Its [[aliquot sum]] is 15; itself a discrete [[semiprime]] (3 • 5) in the following Aliquot sequence 33,15,9,4,3,1,0. (Note 33 is the 8th [[composite number]] to descend into the prime number 3, the others outside of this sequence  being 30,26,16,12) Since 33 is a [[semiprime]] with both its prime factors being [[Gaussian prime]]s, 33 is a [[Blum integer]].

The sum of the first four positive [[factorial]]s is 33. Adding up the sums of divisors of 1 through 6 yields 33. 33 is the smallest integer such that it and the next two integers all have the same number of divisors.

It is also the first member of the first cluster of three semiprimes (33,34,35); the next such cluster is 85,86,87.

Since the greatest prime factor of 33<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 1090 is 109, which is obviously more than 33 twice, 33 is a [[Størmer number]].

The '''music of [[New York City]]''' is a diverse and important field in the world of music. It has long been a thriving home for popular genres such as [[jazz]], [[Rock music|rock]] and the [[blues]], as well as [[classical music|classical]] and [[art music|art]] music. It is the birthplace of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Latin freestyle]], [[bebop]], [[disco]], [[punk rock]], and [[New wave music|new wave]]. It's also the birthplace of [[Salsa music]], born from a fusion of Cuban, Puerto Rican and Dominican influences that came together in New York's Latino neighborhoods in the 1960s. The city's culture, a [[melting pot]] of nations from around the world, has produced vital [[folk music]] scenes such as [[Celtic music in the United States|Irish-American music]] and Jewish [[klezmer]]. Beginning with the rise of popular sheet music in the early 20th century, New York's [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theater]] and [[Tin Pan Alley]]'s [[songwriting|songcraft]], New York has been a major part of the American [[music industry]].<ref name="Unterberger">Richie Unterberger, ''The Rough Guide to Music USA'', pgs. 1-65</ref>

The [[Apollo Theater]] has long been a place for African American performers to begin their careers; it has such an iconic status that Congress has declared it a [[National historic landmark]].

===Club influence===
The New York [[club]] scene is an important part of the city's music scene, birthplace to many styles of music from [[disco]] to [[punk rock]]; some of these clubs, such as [[Studio 54]], [[Max's Kansas City]], [[Mercer Arts Center]], [[ABC No Rio]], and [[CBGB's]], reached an iconic statuses in the United States and the world. New York is home to several major jazz clubs, including [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]], [[Sweet Rhythm]] (formerly Sweet Basil), [[Village Vanguard]] and [[Blue Note Jazz Club|The Blue Note]], the latter being one of the premier spots for jazz lovers. There was a time&mdash;now long gone&mdash;when [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]] in Manhattan, with its numerous clubs, was one of jazz's epicenters. Future generations of music venues would retain the prolific elements of this culture.

== Festivals, holidays and parades ==

New York City has a long history of using music in various festivals and parades, though the vibrant local music scene has meant that festivals aren't as big a draw as in many cities, since residents are near major sources of live music all the time. The diverse groups of immigrants living in New York have each brought with them their own holiday traditions. As a result, major festivals of music in New York include the [[Chinese New Year]] celebrations, [[Pulaski Day Parade, New York City|Pulaski Day Parade]] and the [[St. Patrick's Day Parade]] run by the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]]; New York is home to the largest St. Patrick's Day Parade in the world, a tradition that has continued since 1762 due to the large Irish population in New York. Irish folk music and folk-rock are the major styles at the two-day [[Guinness Fleadh]] festival. The [[College Music Journal Network]]'s annual [[Music Marathon]] has been held since 1980, providing a major showcase for new music. [[Central Park SummerStage]], a series of free concerts presented by [[City Parks Foundation]] and hosting performers of many kinds, is also a major part of New York's summer music scene, which also includes the July [[Intel New York Music Festival]]. There are numerous New York jazz festivals, including the [[Texaco New York Jazz Festival]], [[Panasonic Village Jazz Festival]], the [[JVC Jazz Festival]], and the free Charlie Parker Jazz Festival.<ref name="Unterberger" /> [[City Parks Foundation]] also presents CityParks Concerts each summer, a series of thirty free concerts in ten parks across all five boroughs of the city.

Additionally, New York hosts the yearly [[ElectricZoo]] festival, second only to Miami's [[Winter Music Conference]] as a mecca for house and electronic music fans in the United States. It also holds the annual [[Dance Parade]] which brings together all types of dance-oriented music from across the world (both traditional and contemporary) in a combined parade down [[Fifth Avenue]].
The NYC Musical Saw Festival has been a summer staple since 2001, bringing [[musical saw]] players from around the world to perform diverse types of music on this unique instrument. The festival, organized by [[Natalia Paruz]], holds the [[Guinness World Records]] for the 'Largest Musical Saw ensemble'.

==Music history==

The first music performed in the area that is now New York City was that [[Native American music|of the Lenape Native Americans]] who lived there. However, little is known of these peoples' musical lives. The earliest documented music comes after the foundation of the city (then called ''New Amsterdam'') by Dutch explorers, who controlled the area until the British conquest in 1664. The music of New York City's colonial era was primarily British in character, gradually evolving as the United States became independent and developed a distinct culture; the influence of [[African-American music]] became very important as the city's African American population increased throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.

By the 1830s, New York City was gradually becoming the most important cultural center in the United States, and was a home for many varieties of folk, popular and classical music. Late in the 19th century, many influential conservatories and venues were founded, including the world-famous [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]] and [[Carnegie Hall]]. New York's status as a center for musical development continued into the 20th century, leading to the foundation of many companies associated with the American music industry in the city. These companies included sheet music publishers, based around an area called [[Tin Pan Alley]], and later [[record label]]s and other organizations and institutions. The rise of the [[Broadway theatre]]s began in the early part of the century; the songs from Broadways [[musical theatre|musicals]] became some of the earliest American popular music, and eventually came to be treated as [[pop standard]]s.

===Early history===
As the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam, New York City was populated by Dutch settlers who left little musical trace behind, excepting some songs such as "[[Dutch Prayer of Thanksgiving]]", "[[Rosa (song)|Rosa]]" and "[[The Little Dustman]]". Under English rule, [[sea shanty|sea shanties]], open-air singing gardens, sometimes with [[fireworks]], [[ballad]]s and other Anglo-Irish traditions became widespread. New York's colonial ballads were often topical, concerning the events of the day and the local gossip. Beginning in 1732, ballads were placed together with a story tying them together, forming a performance genre called the [[ballad opera]], the best-known of which is ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', first performed in 1752. The same period, the early to mid-18th century, also saw the first concerts held in New York City, and the arrival of [[William Tuckey]], who helped establish church music in the city.<ref name=Burke>Burk, Cassie, Virginia Meierhoffer and Claude Anderson Phillips, ''America's Musical Heritage''</ref>

[[File:William Hogarth 016.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Painting based on ''The Beggar's Opera'', Scene V, William Hogarth, c. 1728]]

New York's rise as the intellectual and artistic center of the United States occurred in the 1830s. This period, which coincided with an upsurge in American [[nationalism]], saw major growth in choral music, with musical societies being formed in most major cities, like New York; these choral societies remained a fixture of American music throughout the 19th century. Military bands were also common throughout the country, as was singing family troupes such as the [[Hutchinson Family]]. Later still, [[minstrel show]]s, comic and musical acts performed by whites in [[blackface]], spread across the country. In New York, Italian operas were very popular throughout much of the century.<ref name="Ferris"/>

Near the end of the 19th century, modern [[music school|conservatories]] opened in many cities, and New York became the home of the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]] in 1882 and [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1891, the latter's opening being marked by an appearance by the famed Russian composer [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]. In 1892, [[Antonín Dvo?ák]] became Director of the [[National Conservatory of Music of America|National Conservatory of Music]]. Dvo?ák, a [[Bohemia]]n composer, was fascinated with Native and African American folk music, and he was enthusiastic about encouraging a nationalist American field of music that utilized those fields. Dvo?ák only stayed on for three years before returning to Bohemia, though he influenced later composers such as his pupil, the African American composer [[Harry Thacker Burleigh]].<ref name="Ferris"/>

[[George Frederick Bristow|George Bristow]] was an important composer of the latter 19th century. He was a violinist with the [[New York Philharmonic]], later conducting an orchestra called the [[Harmonic Society]]. He attempted to popularize an indigenous American sound in his music, using nationalist elements such as a [[Native American music|Native American melody]] in his ''[[Symphony No. 4 (Bristow)|Symphony No. 4]]''. [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]] also worked at the New York Philharmonic before forming the [[New York Symphony Orchestra]]. He hired many of the best performers of the day in an attempt to lure in audiences, and he promoted a more casual atmosphere to encourage attendance and enthusiasm.<ref name="Struble">Struble, ''The History of American Classical Music''</ref>

===Classical and art music history===

New York's position as a center for [[European classical music]] can be traced back to the early 19th century. The [[New York Philharmonic]], formed in 1842, did much to help establish the city's reputation. In that same era was organized the short-lived rival to the Philharmonic, the American Academy of Music, founded by [[Charles Jerome Hopkins]] (born 1836 in Burlington, Vermont), [[William Henry Fry|William Fry]], [[George Frederick Bristow|George Bristow]], and Charles Steele in 1856. Two of the first major New York composers were William Fry and [[George Frederick Bristow|George Bristow]], both of whom were involved in a well-known 1854 controversy over the Philharmonic's programming choices. The controversy consisted of a series of letters published in the ''[[Musical World and Times]]'' following a poor review of Fry's ''Santa Claus Symphony''. Fry's first letter, responding angrily to the review, claimed that the Philharmonic had played no pieces by American composers, to which Bristow responded that the Philharmonic had played one piece, an overture he had composed. [[Henry Christian Timm]], one of the founders of the Philharmonic, responded by noting a number of recently composed works.<ref name="Struble"/>

Both Fry and Bristow, despite their support for American compositions, were very European in style. Fry's most notable composition was the opera ''[[Leonora (opera)|Leonora]]'', which received mixed reviews upon its opening and was criticized for its debt to [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s [[bel canto]] style. Bristow was also very European in his style, and was a violinist and conductor with the Philharmonic until the 1854 controversy, though he later rejoined. His most important work was the opera ''[[Rip Van Winkle (opera)|Rip Van Winkle]]'', and was very popular at the time; most influentially, ''Rip Van Winkle'' used an American folktale rather than European imitations.<ref name="Struble"/>

The New York native [[Edward MacDowell]] was a major late 19th-century composer, though he spent most of his productive time in Boston. His first concerto was premiered in New York in 1888, and he returned the following year to premier another concerto. MacDowell eventually began using elements of American folk music in his compositions, especially the ''[[Woodland Sketches]]''. The [[Bohemia]]n composer [[Antonín Dvo?ák]] came to New York in 1892 to head the [[National Conservatory of Music of America|National Conservatory]]. A fervent nationalist, Dvo?ák used the folk music of his native land in his music, and encouraged American composers to do the same. One of the Conservatory's students, the African American [[Harry Burleigh]], introduced him to the songs of the [[minstrel show]]s and [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]]s, and Dvo?ák was deeply moved, enough to write a well-known essay in an 1895 issue of ''[[Harper's]]'' declaring that American composers should use the diverse folk elements of their country in their compositions.<ref name="Struble"/>

In the early 20th century, the New York classical music scene included [[Charles Griffes]], originally from [[Elmira, New York]], who began publishing his most innovative material in 1914. His collaboration with other area performers and composers on ''[[The Kairn of Koridwen]]'' was an early attempt to use musical themes adopted from non-Western cultures, specifically, [[music of Japan|Japanese]] and [[music of Java|Javanese music]]. He was to continue in this vein with the score for [[Rupert Brooke]]'s "Wai Kiki", the ballet ''[[Sho-Jo, or &mdash; the Spirit of Wine, A Symbol of Happiness]]'' and his orchestral composition ''[[The Pleasure-Dome of Kubla Khan]]''. Besides Griffes, New York composers included [[Marion Bauer]], [[Leo Ornstein]] and [[Rubin Goldmark]],<ref name="Struble"/> all three of which were either Jewish immigrants or the children of Jewish immigrants.

The best-known New York composer, indeed, the best-known American classical composer of any kind, was [[George Gershwin]]. Gershwin was a songwriter with [[Tin Pan Alley]] and the [[Broadway theatre]]s, and his works were strongly influenced by [[jazz]], or rather the precursors to jazz that were extant during his time. It is not clear that he was a classical musician, though neither is it clear that he worked in jazz, popular music or any other field &mdash; he primarily synthesized and utilized elements of many styles, including the music of New York's [[Yiddish theatre]], [[vaudeville]], [[ragtime]], [[operetta]], jazz, Tin Pan Alley and Broadway songs, the music of the [[Gullah]] people and the impressionist and post-Romantic music of European composers. Some of his most famous compositions were the ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' and ''[[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]'', both of which utilized jazz idioms. Gershwin's work made American classical music more focused, and attracted an unheard of amount of international attention.<ref>Struble, pg. 122 ''. After Gershwin, American classical music became focused as it had never been focused before. And the world began to sit up and listen.''</ref>

Following Gershwin, the first major composer was [[Aaron Copland]] from Brooklyn, who used elements of American folk music, though it remained European in technique and form. His works included the [[Symphony for Organ and Orchestra]] (which was well-received, earning him comparisons to [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]), the jazz-affected ''[[Music for the Theatre]]'', the music for the ballet ''[[Appalachian Spring]]'' and the ''[[Copland Piano Variations|Piano Variations]]''. Later, he turned to the ballet and then [[serial music]].<ref name="Struble"/>

The early to mid 20th century New York classical music scene also produced composers such as [[Roger Sessions]], an academically oriented composer known for operas such as ''[[Motezuma]]''. The similarly academic [[William Schuman]] became known for such works as the ''[[New England Triptych]]'' and his [[Symphony No. 3 (Schuman)|Third Symphony]]; Schuman also became president of [[Juilliard]], changing the school by forming the [[Juilliard String Quartet]] and merging the Institute of Musical Art with the Juilliard Graduate School, as well as hiring teachers such as [[William Bergsma]], [[Peter Mennin]] and [[Hugo Weisgall]], who went on to teach future luminaries such as [[Steve Reich]] and [[Philip Glass]].<ref name="Struble"/>

In the middle of the 20th century, the most influential New York composers included the Massachusetts native and conductor and composer [[Leonard Bernstein]], known for his works ''[[Prelude, Fugue, and Riffs]]'', ''[[Serenade after Plato's "Symposium"|Serenade for Solo Violin, Strings, Harp and Percussion]]'', ''[[Chichester Psalms]]'' and the musicals ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]'' and ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]''. Another major composer was [[Elliott Carter]], whom John Warthen Struble claimed would likely be remembered as "the most significant of the mid-20th century... composers [because he] reconceived and restructured the fundamental language of Western art music in evolving his powerful personal style... his music has earned immense respect from colleagues of virtually every esthetic stripe, as well as three generations of performing musicians and audiences". Carter's compositions include ''[[Eight Etudes and a Fantasy for Wind Quintet]]'' and a [[Sonata for cello and piano (Carter)|Sonata for 'cello and piano]]. In addition to Carter and Bernstein, in the mid-20th century, New York produced the film composer [[Bernard Herrmann]], [[Gunther Schuller]] and serialist [[Leon Kirchner]].<ref name="Struble"/>

Many of the later 20th-century composers in various modernist and minimalist styles came from outside of New York City, such as [[John Cage]] from Los Angeles, though many studied, performed or conducted in New York, the center for American music.  [[John Corigliano]], however, is a New York native who has worked exclusively in tonal idioms for most of his career.  [[Steve Reich]] innovated a technique known as [[phasing]], in which two musical activities are begun simultaneously and repeated, gradually drifting out of sync with each other in a natural evolution; Reich was also very interested in non-Western music, incorporating [[music of African|African rhythmic]] techniques in his compositions ''[[Drumming (piece)|Drumming]]''.<ref name="Struble"/> [[Rhys Chatham]] as well as [[Glenn Branca]] blended the minimal music with modern rock esthetics and began writing microtonal pieces for large orchestras of guitarists but also wrote other classical pieces with non amplified instruments. [[Kyle Gann]] is a musicologist as well as a composer of post modern pieces.

Most recently, New York has become home to a Manhattan-based scene sometimes called [[Contemporary classical music|New Music]]. These composers and performers are strongly influenced by the minimalist works of [[Philip Glass]], a Baltimore native based out of New York, [[Meredith Monk]] and others. One of the most famous persons from this scene is easily [[John Zorn]], often cited as a jazz musician though he works in many fields and idioms. Others include [[Arto Lindsay]], [[Marc Ribot]], [[John Lurie]], [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]] and [[Bill Laswell]].<ref name="Unterberger" />

==Popular music==

New York is the center of the American music industry, and by extension, is one of the major centers for popular music worldwide. The city attained an iconic musical status in the early 20th century. Later, New York retained its position as the major center for the American music industry, despite the rise of other cities such as [[Detroit]], [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and [[San Francisco]].

The African American genre of [[jazz]] was closely associated with New York by the middle of the 20th century, when a number of avant-garde performers helped created styles such as [[hard bop]] and [[free jazz]]. Later still, New York was the major American home for the [[punk rock]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] movements, and was the scene for the invention of both [[hip hop music]] and Latino [[salsa music]]. Musicians from New York have also dominated the Jewish-American [[klezmer]] scene, the [[Greenwich Village]] [[old-time music]] revival, and the straight 1960s [[pop music]] exemplified by the [[Brill Building]] sound.

===Tin Pan Alley===
{{Main|Tin Pan Alley}}
[[Tin Pan Alley]] was a center for music publishing around the turn of the 20th century. Numerous professional songwriters lived in the area, churning out songs ready for mainstream America during a time that music, like other aspects of American culture, was becoming a national rather than a regional affair.<ref name="Clarke">{{cite book|author=Clarke, Donald|title=The Rise and Fall of Popular Music|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1995|isbn=0-312-11573-3}}</ref> Tin Pan Alley was originally in an area called [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], and it had become the major center for music publishing by the mid-1890s.<ref name="Ewen">{{cite book |author=Ewen, David|title=Panorama of American Popular Music|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1957}}</ref> The songwriters of this era wrote formulaic songs, many of them sentimental ballads.<ref>Ewen, pg. 94 (T)hese publishers devised formulas by which songs could be produced with speed and dispatch... Songs were now to be produced from a serviceable matrix, and issued in large quantities: stereotypes for foreign songs, Negro songs, humorous ditties, and, most important of all, sentimental ballads.''</ref> Some of the most notable publishers included [[Willis Woodward]], the Witmark house of publishing, [[Charles K. Harris]], and [[Edward B. Marks]] and [[Joseph W. Stern]]. Stern and Marks began writing together as amateurs in 1894, with "[[The Little Lost Child]]"; the song became a hit selling more than two million copies of its sheet music after its successful promotion as an [[illustrated song]] and after it attracted the attention of popular stage performer [[Della Fox]]. However, [[Paul Dresser]] was, in the words of David Ewen, the "richest contributor of sentimental ballads to Union Square". He was an original composer, less maudlin, less cloyingly sentimental and less cliché-ridden than his contemporaries.<ref>Ewen, pg. 98 ''Less disposed toward clichés than so many of his rivals, elss inclined to stretch an emotion to the point of maudlin and cloying sentimentality, Dresser was a composers whose finest ballads have a winning charm and a lingering fragrance.''</ref>

In addition to the popular, mainstream ballads and other clean-cut songs, some Tin Pan Alley publishers focused on rough songs such as "Drill Ye Tarriers" in 1888, believed to have been written by an unskilled laborer turned stage performer named [[Thomas F. Casey]]. [[Coon song]]s were another important part of Tin Pan Alley, derived from the watered-down songs of the minstrel show with the "verve and electricity" brought by the "assimilation of the ragtime rhythm". The first popular coon song was "New Coon in Town", introduced in 1883, and was followed by a wave of ''coon shouters'' such as [[Ernest Hogan]] and [[May Irwin]].<ref>Ewen, pg. 101 and Clarke, pg. 62 Ewen attributes "New Coon in Town" to [[Paul Allen (songwriter)|Paul Allen]], though Clarke attributes it to [[J. S. Putnam]], though both agree on the year, 1883</ref>

===Musical theatre===

The early 20th century also saw the growth of [[Broadway theatre]], a group of theatres specializing in [[musical (theater)|musical]]s. Broadway became on the preeminent locations for musical theater in the world, and produced a body of songs that led Donald Clarke to call the era (ca. 1914 to 1950), the ''golden age of songwriting''. The need to adapt enjoyable songs to the constraints of a theater and a plot enabled and encouraged a growth in songwriting and the rise of composers such as [[George Gershwin]], [[Cole Porter]], [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Jerome Kern]]. Most of these songwriters were [[Judaism|Jewish]], descended from Jews who immigrated from [[Russia]].<ref name="Clarke">Clarke, ''The Rise and Fall of Popular Music''</ref>

Professional Yiddish theater in New York began in 1882 with a troupe founded by [[Boris Thomashefsky]]. The plays in the late 19th century were realistic, while in the beginning of the 20th century, they became more political and artistic in orientation. Some performers were well-respected enough to move back and forth between the Yiddish theatre and Broadway, including [[Bertha Kalich]] and [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]]. Some of the major composers included [[Abraham Goldfaden]], [[Joseph Rumshinsky]] and [[Sholom Secunda]],<ref name="Struble"/> while playwrights included [[David Pinski]], [[Solomon Libin]], [[Jacob Gordin]] and [[Leon Kobrin]].

===Blues and jazz===

The [[New York blues]] was a type of [[blues]] music, characterized by significant jazz influences and a more modernized, urban feel than the country blues. It arose in New York City in the early part of the 20th century, and quickly spread to other urban areas and, often, more affluent listeners than country blues, which is distinctively rural in nature. Prominent musicians from this field include [[Lionel Hampton]] and [[Big Joe Turner|Joe Turner]].

In New York City, [[jazz]] was fused with [[stride (music)|stride]] (an advanced form of [[ragtime]]) and became highly evolved. [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s jazz orchestra, first appearing in 1923, included [[Coleman Hawkins]] and later, [[New Orleans]] musician [[Louis Armstrong]], became wildly popular and helped invent [[swing music]]. Though Henderson was among the first major New York jazz musicians, he was not as able to adapt to the rapidly changing style as some of his contemporaries, such as [[Duke Ellington]]. When Ellington moved to New York City, he inaugurated a legion of jazz musicians that did the same and moved the center of jazz's development from Chicago to New York.

The style that developed from New York's big jazz bands became known as [[swing music]]; it was a very danceable and catchy style, played originally by large black orchestras. Later, white bands led by people such as [[Jimmy Dorsey]] and [[Benny Goodman]] began to dominate. These large orchestras produced a number of instrumentalists that had a profound effect on the later evolution of jazz, including [[Coleman Hawkin]]'s tenor saxophone innovations, electric guitarist [[Charlie Christian]] and improvisational [[Lester Young]]. Star vocalists also emerged, mainly women such as the bluesy [[Billie Holiday]] and the [[scat singing|scat singer]] [[Ella Fitzgerald]].<ref name="Unterberger" />

New York's jazz scene was the home of [[bebop]], which evolved over many years and reached its full identity in the mid-1940s. Charlie Christian, [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Thelonious Monk]] were among the major innovators of the style. Bebop "polarized listers, critics and musicians alike" because it differed from swing in many important ways, including a lack of typical [[riff]]s and danceable beats, the use of [[melodic progression]] and the chords as the basis for all soloing and improvising.

In the 1950s, jazz began to diversify into a number of new genres, spread out into many cities. The West Coast became a home for [[cool jazz]], though the style's major innovator was New York-based [[Miles Davis]]. New York was also a major center for [[hard bop]], and was home to [[Sonny Rollins]] and [[Art Blakey]]. Late in the 1950s, the Los Angeles-based [[Ornette Coleman]] moved to New York, bringing with him the nascent style of [[free jazz]]. He was later joined by a number of others, most famously including [[John Coltrane]]; Coltrane and his contemporaries, such as [[Albert Ayler]] and [[Sun Ra]].<ref name="Unterberger" />

The last few decades have seen a further diffusion of jazz from New York and other major long-time capitals, to cities and regions across the United States and the world. Many New York jazz performers during this period played fusions of jazz with rock and other styles; among the earliest of these modern musicians was [[Carla Bley]], cofounder of the [[Jazz Composers Orchestra Association]], an independent distribution company for avant-garde and jazz artists. The city has also been home to the well-known modern performer from [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], [[Wynton Marsalis]] and the large [[M-Base Collective]], as well as people such as [[John Zorn]] who use jazz as a prominent part of their experimental music in many different styles.<ref name="Unterberger" />

===Greenwich Village===
{{Main|Greenwich Village}}
Beginning in the 1940s, New York City was the center for a [[roots revival]] of [[American folk music]]. Many New Yorkers, especially young people, became interested in [[blues]], [[Appalachian folk music]] and other roots styles. In [[Greenwich Village]], many of these people gathered; the area became a hotbed of American folk music as well as leftist political activism.

The performers associated with the Greenwich Village scene, many of whom were not originally from New York, had sporadic mainstream success in the 1940s and 1950s; some, such as [[Pete Seeger]] and the [[Almanac Trio]], did well, but most were confined to local coffeehouses and other venues. Performers such as [[Dave Van Ronk]] and [[Joan Baez]] helped expand the scene by appealing to college students, while [[Bob Dylan]] became a mainstream [[folk-rock]] star in the 1960s.

===Disco and house===
[[Disco]] is an up-tempo style of [[dance music]] that originated in the early 1970s, with its center in the United States in New York. As discothèques grew more popular later in the decade, they began moving to larger venues. Many of these were in New York, including [[Paradise Garage]] and [[Studio 54]].

In the early 1980s, [[house music]], a direct descendent of disco, was forged in the underground clubs of Chicago, Detroit, and New York. The common element of most house music is a 4/4 beat generated by a drum machine or other electronic means (such as a sampler), together with a solid (usually also electronically generated) bassline. Upon this foundation are added electronically generated sounds and samples of music such as jazz, blues and synth pop.

===Salsa===

Salsa is a style of [[Latin American music|Latin music]] that incorporates multiple styles and variations. It was developed by mid-1970s groups of [[New York City]]-area Cuban and [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rica]]n immigrants to the [[United States]], and stylistic descendants such as 1980s [[salsa romántica]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and recently [[salsa dura]]. Salsa, along with other Latin American genres, has become extremely popular in New York City. Latin dancing is also very popular.

Salsa, a music predominantly derived from the Cuban [[son montuno]]  was imported back to Latin America were it has become insanely popular over the past 40 years. Salsa aficionados the world over know that the origin of the music is uniquely tied to New York City.

The same phenomenon has recently occurred with yet another type of Latin rhythm, [[bachata (music)|bachata]]. Bachata is dominated by Dominicans, especially Dominicans from New York's [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood.

===Hip hop===
{{further|East Coast hip hop|List of hip hop musicians from New York City}}
New York City is a prominent part of [[hip hop music]]. The genre began there at neighborhood [[block party|block parties]] when [[DJ]]s, such as [[Kool Herc]], began isolating percussion breaks in [[funk]] and [[R&B]] songs, eventually [[rapper|rapping]] while the audience danced. For many years, New York was the only city with a major hip hop scene, and all of the early recordings came from New York. People such as [[Kurtis Blow]] and [[LL Cool J]] brought hip hop to the mainstream for the first time, while so-called [[East Coast rap]] was perfected by artists including [[Eric B. & Rakim]].

Hip Hop's early years saw an ongoing rivalry between the boroughs of New York City, with each seeking credit for its rightful contributions to the culture. The original "beef" pitted [[The Bronx]], led by [[Boogie Down Productions]], against [[Marley Marl]]'s [[Juice Crew]] (Queens).

By the early 1990s, however, [[West Coast rap]], from [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], was gaining national fame. In 1992, [[Dr. Dre]]'s ''[[The Chronic]]'' became a national hit and made the West Coast the most popular center of hip hop. However, in 1993 with release of [[Black Moon (group)|Black Moon]]'s [[Enta Da Stage]] and later on Wu-Tang Clan's [[36 Chambers]] in the same year, East Coast hip hop made a major comeback. The release of [[Nas]]'s [[Illmatic]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]'s [[Ready to Die]] in 1994 made New York city the most popular center of Hip Hop once again in just a time frame of two years. The west coast never again enjoyed such levels of success as they did in 1992 and 1993. However the east coast delivered one classic album after another for the rest of the decade. Most prominent of the releases include Mobb Deep's [[The Infamous]] and [[Hell on Earth (Mobb Deep album)|Hell On Earth]], Jay-Z's [[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]] and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]]'s [[It's Dark and Hell Is Hot]]. Ma$e's [[Harlem World]] cemented him as the most popular MC in New York in the late 1990s however he left the industry to pursue other callings. The East coast still remains a prominent center of hip hop in the current scene but their mainstream appeal has been somewhat taken over by the [[Southern hip hop|rappers from the Southern states]] of the USA.

Each borough or area of [[New York City]] has its fair share of associated Hip Hop acts, both commercially successful and underground. [[KRS-One]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Big Pun]], and [[Slick Rick]] all grew up in The Bronx, although the latter is an implant from London, England. [[Wu-Tang Clan]] put [[Staten Island]] on the Hip Hop map, renaming the borough "Shaolin." LL Cool J, [[Run–D.M.C.]], [[Eric B. & Rakim]], [[Black Sheep (group)|Black Sheep]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], Akinyele, [[Ja Rule]], [[Pharoahe Monch]], [[Nicki Minaj]] (an implant from [[Trinidad & Tobago]]) and [[50 Cent]] all represent Queens. Additionally, the [[Queensbridge, Queens|Queensbridge]] Projects in the borough of [[Queens]] have been an epicenter of Hip Hop, producing the Juice Crew (Marley Marl, [[MC Shan]], [[Roxanne Shante]]), [[Mobb Deep]], [[Capone-N-Noreaga]] and [[Nas]]. In order of appearance, Brooklyn has produced [[Whodini]], [[Newcleus]], [[Audio Two]], [[Full Force]], [[Gang Starr]], [[Jeru the Damaja]], [[Masta Ace]], [[Boot Camp Clik]], [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], [[Talib Kweli]], [[Afu-Ra]], [[M.O.P.]], [[Shyne]], and [[Siah and Yeshua DapoED]]. The [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] neighborhood has been a hotbed successful Hip Hop artists, including [[Junior M.A.F.I.A.]] ([[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Lil' Kim]], [[Lil' Cease]], [[Mase]],etc.), [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Killah Priest]] and [[Mos Def]]. Lastly, the island of Manhattan, particularly Harlem, is home to artists such as Kurtis Blow, [[Doug E. Fresh]] (an implant form [[Barbados]]), [[Biz Markie]], [[2 Black 2 Strong MMG]], [[Big L]], [[Immortal Technique]], [[Vast Aire]],  [[Cam'ron]], [[Mase]], [[Black Rob]], [[Mims (rapper)|MIMS]], [[Street P]], [[Dipset]], [[Eyston]], & [[A$AP Rocky]].

===Rock===

====Proto punk, New Wave & No Wave====

New York City had the earliest documented [[punk rock]] scene in the United States. Drawing on local influences such as [[The Velvet Underground]], [[Richard Hell]] and the [[New York Dolls]], punk music developed at clubs such as [[CBGB]] and [[Max's Kansas City]]. [[Patti Smith]], [[Talking Heads]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]], [[The Fleshtones]], and other artsy [[New wave music|new wave]] artists were popular in the mid to late 1970s, as bands like the [[Ramones]] were establishing an American punk rock sound. [[CBGB]] and [[Max's Kansas City]] opened their doors and became influential venues. [[No Wave]] was a short lived movement in New York and raised [[James Chance]], [[DNA (American band)|DNA]], [[Rhys Chatham]], [[Glenn Branca]], [[Lydia Lunch]], [[Rat At Rat R]], [[Swans (band)|Swans]], [[Live Skull]], [[Band of Susans]], [[Ut (band)|Ut]] and later [[Sonic Youth]].

====Hardcore punk & Ska====
In the early 1980s, [[hardcore punk]] was developing primarily in [[Southern California]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]. The [[New York hardcore]] scene was founded by 1981, and bands such as [[Reagan Youth]] and [[Kraut (band)|Kraut]] led the initial charge. By 1985, the New York hardcore scene had become inhabited by [[straight edge]]rs and [[skinhead]]s, including bands such as [[Agnostic Front]], [[Cro-Mags]], [[Heart Attack (band)|Heart Attack]], [[Youth of Today]], [[Warzone (band)|Warzone]] and [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]]. With the collapse of the CBGB hardcore matinees, due to constant violence, a more activist [[DIY]] scene began to develop around [[ABC No Rio]] and the [[squatting|squats]] of the [[Lower East Side]]. New York has been at the center of the United States [[third wave ska]] scene. The founders of third wave ska, which drew on British [[2 Tone|Two-Tone]] ska, were New York bands such as [[the Toasters]] and [[Urban Blight (band)|Urban Blight]]. In the early 1980s, Toasters singer/guitarist and songwriter [[Robert 'Bucket' Hingley]] established [[Moon Ska Records]]; the label operated until the late 1990s, giving many ska bands from New York and elsewhere international exposure. Some of the other ska bands to come from the New York scene were [[Skinnerbox]], [[The Slackers]], [[Agent 99 (band)|Agent 99]] and [[Mephiskapheles]]. Other major hardcore punk bands from New York are [[Sick of It All]], [[H2O (American band)|H2O]] and [[Madball]].Theres also ska-jazz bands as New York Ska Jazz Ensemble.

=====Heavy Metal=====
New York City has also contributed to the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] genre.  During the 1980s and 1990s, it was a major center of the [[Thrash metal#East Coast (New York/New Jersey)|East Coast thrash metal]] scene, which produced the bands [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] and [[Nuclear Assault]]. [[Funk metal]] groups such as [[Living Colour]] and [[24-7 Spyz]], and [[alternative metal]] groups such as [[Prong (band)|Prong]] and [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]], also emerged from the growing New York metal scene. Two other major metal bands from New York are [[Type O Negative]] and [[Life of Agony]], both from Brooklyn.

In the 1990s and later, New York City and its environs developed a small but influential [[death metal]] scene. [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]], one of the best known bands to emerge from this scene, earned a good deal of notoriety for their brutal, complex, and uncompromising style.  Another long-lived New York death metal group is [[Immolation (band)|Immolation]], whose innovative use of dissonance helped to establish them as underground favorites.  Other bands associated with New York death metal are [[Mortician (band)|Mortician]] and [[Incantation (band)|Incantation]] (the latter being originally from [[Pennsylvania]]).

=====Indie rock=====
New York City has long been one of the leading centers of the [[indie rock]] movement. During the mid-to-late 1990s, bands such as [[Bowery Electric]], [[Blonde Redhead]], [[The Van Pelt]], [[The Lapse]], [[Enon]] and [[Les Savy Fav]] were part of the New York [[indie music scenes|indie rock scene]].

New York City also was one of the primary centers of the [[Garage Rock Revival]] of the early 2000s, most notably with bands such as [[The Strokes]] and the [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]] as well as less popular bands such as [[The Bravery]], [[The Mooney Suzuki]], [[The Walkmen]], [[The Hold Steady]], [[The Virgins]] and [[The Rapture (band)|The Rapture]]. [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]] drew influences from garage rock, post-punk and indie rock for their critically acclaimed 2002 debut album ''[[Turn on the Bright Lights]]'', and they have seen some mainstream success. A highly experimental indie rock scene that emerged during the 2000s has seen such bands as [[Liars (band)|Liars]], [[Black Dice]], [[Le Tigre]], [[Parts & Labor]] and [[These Are Powers]] take influences from a variety of sources, including [[dance-punk]], [[synth punk]], [[electroclash]], [[noise rock]], [[psychedelic rock]] and [[no wave]]. [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]], from the New York City suburb of [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]], has gained critical acclaim by emerging from their post-hardcore roots to becoming one of the more unique indie rock bands with their third album, ''[[The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me]]'' (2006).

In more recent years, indie rock, indie pop and [[indie electronic]] artists such as [[LCD Soundsystem]], [[Antony and the Johnsons]], [[Clap Your Hands Say Yeah]], [[Vampire Weekend]], [[The Drums]], [[Yeasayer]], [[French Kicks]], [[Vivian Girls]], [[High Places]], [[Twin Sister]], [[The Pains of Being Pure at Heart]], [[Animal Collective]], [[Battles (band)|Battles]], [[The Antlers (band)|The Antlers]], [[Dirty Projectors]], [[Grizzly Bear (band)|Grizzly Bear]], [[Gang Gang Dance]], [[TV on the Radio]], [[Matt & Kim]]. [[The National (band)|The National]] and [[MGMT]] have further solidified New York City's stance as one of the leaders of the indie rock scene.

'''45''' ('''forty-five''')  is the [[natural number]] following [[44 (number)|44]] and followed by [[46 (number)|46]].

== In mathematics ==
'''Forty-five''' is a [[triangular number]], and in particular the sum of all the decimal digits (0 + 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;5&nbsp;+&nbsp;6&nbsp;+&nbsp;7&nbsp;+&nbsp;8&nbsp;+&nbsp;9&nbsp;=&nbsp;45). It is the smallest triangle number (after 1) which can be written as the sum of two squares. It is also a [[hexagonal number|hexagonal]] and 16-[[polygonal number|gonal number]], 

45 is the sixth [[positive integer]] with a [[prime factorization]] of the form  ''p''<sup>2</sup>''q'', with ''p'' and ''q'' being [[Prime number|prime]].

33 is the [[aliquot sum]] of 45 and the [[aliquot sequence]] of 45 is&nbsp;(45,&nbsp;33,&nbsp;15,&nbsp;9,&nbsp;4,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0).

Since the greatest prime factor of 45<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;2026 is&nbsp;1013, which is clearly more than 45 twice, 45 is a [[Størmer number]].

In base 10, it is a [[Kaprekar number]], and a [[Harshad number]].

==History==
Although [[Fort Street High School]] was established in 1849, Sydney Boys High School is the first state high school in New South Wales created under [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]] [[Henry Parkes]]' public education system in the early 1880s, following the ''Public Instruction Act 1880 (NSW)''.<ref>Waugh, Joseph W. (2008.) ''Sydney Boys' High School: the foundation years 1883–1891'', Sydney High School Old Boys' Union, Darlinghurst, Australia.</ref> Whereas Fort Street Model Street, as it was founded as, had a primary education division, neither Sydney Boys nor [[Sydney Girls High School]] have had primary education divisions and are thus the first state high schools founded for the express purpose of secondary education.<ref name="APH">{{cite web|url=http://www.auspostalhistory.com/articles/2113.shtml|title=Sydney Boys and Girls High Schools|publisher=AusPostalHistory.com}}</ref> These schools are, however, the equal-second-oldest schools in New South Wales to offer secondary education until matriculation to university, which was then, more often than not, the [[University of Sydney]].<ref name="APH"/>

Alternatively known as '''The Sydney High School''', due to its being the first state high school, '''Sydney High School''' was established as two single-sex schools sharing a single building, with boys and girls on separate floors.<ref name="APH"/> The first day of instruction, for 46 boys, was October 1, 1883 and was at a building located in [[Castlereagh Street, Sydney|Castlereagh Street]] in the [[Sydney central business district]], which was designed by [[Francis Greenway]] and constructed by convicts.<ref name="APH"/> From 1883 to 1892, Sydney Boys occupied the lower floor and entered from the Castlereagh Street side of the building, whereas Sydney Girls occupied the upper floor and entered from the Elizabeth Street side.<ref name="APH"/> In 1924, this building would be demolished and both schools would, in 1921, have relocated to Moore Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/63385174@N06/6064057012/|title=Sydney Girls' High School, Castlereagh Street Side, March 1922|publisher=State Library of New South Wales}}</ref> Presently, this site is home to the [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]] store of [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]].

==Grounds, buildings, and facilities==
[[File:Sbhsmoorepark.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sydney Boys High School, as seen from Moore Park West.]]
The current [[Moore Park, New South Wales|Moore Park]] site hosts the Great Hall, other school buildings, tennis courts, a gymnasium, the Junior Quadrangle, and the Flat, a common low-lying area of land between Sydney Boys and Sydney Girls High Schools. The school buildings include approximately 60 classrooms, two change rooms, the Junior Library (for Years 7–9), and the Senior Library (for Years 10–12).<ref name="Map">[http://www.sydneyboyshigh.com/school/map School Map - Sydney Boys High School]</ref> Most disciplines are individual departments and have their own common rooms;<ref name="Map"/> however, others are not that clearly divided or some teachers take classes in more than one discipline. For example, some English teachers in the English department also teach Drama; some History teachers in the History department also teach Studies of Religion.

Nearby to the school are a number of sports facilities, such as the tennis courts opposite to the Sydney Boys and Girls High Schools,<ref name="Map"/> located on Cleveland Street, and the facilities at [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park]].

Also nearby, but not associated with Sydney Boys and Girls High Schools, are [[Fox Studios Australia]], the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], and the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].

Sydney Boys High School also owns and controls properties and other interests at [[Abbotsford, New South Wales|Abbotsford]] (a rowing facility) and [[Malabar Headland]] (the [[ANZAC Rifle Range]]). In addition to this, the school owns a number of vehicles, which it utilises to travel to sporting events, such as the annual [[The Armidale School]] versus the High School rugby union game at [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]] and the [[Head of the River (New South Wales)|Head of the River]] at the Penrith Lakes, [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/big-wet-turns-heads-up-for-traditional-gps-rowing-festival-20120307-1uknj.html|title=Big wet turns heads up for traditional GPS rowing festival|first=Kim|last=Arlington|date=8 March 2012|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref>

Sydney Boys High School is the sole state-operated member school of the [[Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales]]<ref name="BT">{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/rugby-union/union-news/worst-xv-sydney-boys-drop-the-ball-after-100-years-of-rugby-20091124-jbtb.html|title=Worst XV: Sydney Boys drops the ball after 100 years of rugby|first=Jonathan|last=Dart|work=Brisbane Times|date=25 February 2009|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref> since 1906. It therefore competes against other GPS schools in many of the aforementioned sports; most notable among the traditional English public school sports of cricket, rowing, and rugby union. Accordingly, and unusually for a state school, the school possess rowing facilities at the [http://www.shsfoundation.org.au/outterside-centre.php Outterside Centre] at [[Abbotsford, New South Wales|Abbotsford]], which includes a dormitory, boat sheds, and three pontoons; playing fields at [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park]], with the [http://www.shsfoundation.org.au/fairland-pavilion.php Fairland Pavilion] and the McKay Oval, a fenced cricket ground; and, facilities at the [[ANZAC Rifle Range]], which are managed by the [[Sydney High School Rifle Club]].

In recent years, Sydney Boys High has had disappointing results in sporting competitions, particularly in rugby union, due in part to a shift to association football ("soccer") and mismatches in size and abilities between it and its competitors.<ref name="BT"/> In the 2007 season of GPS rugby union, Sydney Boys High lost 7 of 7 games it had played to date before withdrawing from the remaining 6 games. Of this, GPS rugby convener Mark Ticehurst said, "Mr Ticehurst said: "It was the safety issue that saw Sydney High withdrawing. It's an opportunity to develop their rugby, and although they will still be in a very tough competition, the pressure is off them to perform at the First XV level".<ref name="BT"/>

In contrast to Sydney Boys' performance in team sports, both historically and in recent years, numerous students have represented the school at the Eastern Suburbs Zone and Sydney Eastern Regional levels.

==School traditions==

===House system===
Each student at Sydney Boys High School is placed into one of six [[House system|houses]], and each year is evenly divided into these houses. These houses, named after early Old Boys who have significantly contributed to and served the school, are:

Sydney Boys High School has frequently been embroiled in controversy for racial issues, its selection criteria and its proposal to modify it, and allegations of [[nepotism]] or other [[favouritism]]. Sydney Boys High School, like other schools, has seen several (then) minorities matriculate to it and graduate from it, including non-[[British people|British]], non-[[Irish people|Irish]] European minorities, such as [[Italian Australian]]s, [[Maltese Australian]]s, and [[Greek Australian]]s; in 2002, however, the school was at the centre of a media furore over comments by Old Boys made in regard to its ethnic — namely [[East Asia]]n and [[South Asia]]n; erroneously merely East Asian — composition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/04/19/1019020708130.html|title=Put to the test|date=20 April 2002|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media}}</ref>

In 2013, the school was again featured in the media for its proposal to modify its selection criteria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/selective-students-against-local-intake-20130602-2njog.html|title=Selective students against local intake|first=Josephine|last=Tovey|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref> This proposal, supported by Principal Kim A. Jaggar, President of the School Council Julie Connolly, and President of the School Parents and Citizens Association Ian Sweeting, involved reserving 30 places of the annual Year 7 intake of 180 places for local boys who live within 5&nbsp;km of the school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/class-action-for-local-boys-20130524-2k6rr.html|title=Class action for local boys|first=Josephine|last=Tovey|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref> Connolly stated that "any racial undertones to earlier campaigns were a thing of the past" and that "the benefit for the school this time is about tying it to its local community". The proposal would, in theory, reduce the load on overcrowded local high schools, of which there are an inadequate amount,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/city-east/sydney-boys-high-could-host-inner-city-students-to-alleviate-overcrowding-issues-short-term/story-fngr8h22-1226628363511|title=Sydney Boys High School could host inner-city students to alleviate overcrowding issues short-term|first=James|last=Gorman|date=24 April 2013|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref> and would be a short-term resolution to the problem.<ref name="Rethink">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/year-7-rethink-for-sydney-boys-20130523-2k42j.html|title=Year 7 rethink for Sydney Boys|first=Josephine|last=Tovey|date=24 May 2013|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref> Sydney MP [[Alex Greenwich]] added, "it will not take away the need for a proper, comprehensive high school in the inner city".<ref name="Rethink"/> As of the 2012 edition of the New South Wales Department of Education and Communities statistics, more than 80% of the students enrolled at Sydney Boys High School have a language background other than English;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/english-second-language-of-selective-students-at-sydney-schools/story-fndo317g-1226509692683|title=English second language of selective students at Sydney schools|first=Briana|last=Domjen|date=4 November 2012|work=Herald Sun|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref> however, this is not to suggest that these students and their parents or guardians are all recent immigrants or not proficient in English or, broadly, that the school is not necessarily lacking in diversity.

In recent years, allegations of there being an anti-meritocratic selection process have been levelled against the school, as an increasing number of "sport[s] imports" have been admitted in latter years, to bolster the school's ability to more competitively participate in sports against other members of the AAGPS as well as to dilute the school's academic-only image.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2008/09/05/in-memory-of-rugby-at-sydney-boys-high-school/|title=In memory of rugby at Sydney Boys High School|first=Spiro|last=Zavos|date=5 September 2008|publisher=The Roar|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref> Furthermore, in part due to the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|English public school]] nature of the school and the AAGPS, of which the school is a member, further claims of nepotism, cronyism, and other favouritism have been levelled against the school. Brothers, sons, and grandsons of former students have been allowed entry, though they may not have met the rigorous selection criteria, and are open to win certain awards or prizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/04/05/1017206267898.html|title=Good old boys push to keep Sydney High in the family|first=Gerard|last=Noonan|date=6 April 2002|work=Sydney Morning herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref>

Another significant long-standing issue on which the school has commented include [[Tutor#Academic coaching|private coaching or tuition]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/08/25/1030053009900.html|title=Reversal of fortunes for Sydney Boys' High as King's is lost for wordsmiths|first=Paul|last=Sheehan|date=26 August 2002|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref> which has allegedly created a culture that has been regarded as undesirable. In 2002, it was proposed that, of the 180 Year 7 places, 30 places — the so-called "ethos enhancement group" — would be allocated each year on the basis of the Selective Schools Entrance Test (with no extended writing requirement), a detailed ''[[curriculum vitae]]'', two school reports, and their achievements in civic, sporting, community, and leadership involvement, similar to the manner by which students are admitted to grammar and private schools, such as [[Sydney Grammar School]].

One eminent alumnus of the school, [[James Spigelman]], [[Chief Justice of New South Wales|Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|New South Wales]], himself an Australian of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish descent]] and a practising [[Jews|Jew]], said, in an address at the school dated 16 February 1999, that:
<blockquote>
... Our careers are particular manifestations of the ability of this school, by reason of its tradition of selection on the grounds of academic excellence, to make available opportunities to persons from backgrounds which may otherwise restrict such opportunities. The ability to obtain an education which is pitched at a level appropriate to the capacities of particular students, is the basis for the equality of opportunity, to which I have referred.

From time to time you will find comments made which characterise the acceptance of excellence in education as in some way “elitist”. I refute that. My personal experience and that of many other persons who have come from family backgrounds that do not offer any particular privilege, is that excellence in education is the way we have broken through the existing elites.

In my opinion, those who would undermine the achievement of, or the recognition of, academic excellence in our schools are the true elitists. For they place barriers in the path of those who can overwhelm an entrenched elite. ...<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwPrint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_160299|title=Address by the Honourable JJ Spigelman, Chief Justice of New South Wales|date=16 February 1999|publisher=Supreme Court of New South Wales|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref>

'''The Journeyman Project''' is a [[time travel]] [[adventure game|adventure computer game]] developed by [[Presto Studios]].

==Gameplay==
The game features a first-person perspective. The protagonist sees a display, a rectangle shaped visor (acting as a monocle for Agent 5). This user interface helps to reduce the movie size and maintain relatively high frame rates. Controls work as four interface buttons located below the screen. They move Agent 5 forward and backward, and rotate Agent 5 left and right.

The Journeyman Project was billed as interactive movie [[adventure game]], where the player is presented with several clues and puzzles that must be solved in order to move on or finish the level. Items that the player finds can be helpful or harmful as he attempts to explore his surroundings. The most important of these items are the seven bio-chips, which enhance the player-character's abilities in various ways. The game's user interface stores the bio-chips in a special "bio-chip panel", which serves as a "quick-menu" for activating and deactivating the various chips.

== Story ==
[[Image:Pegasus Time Tunnel.jpg|thumb|left|What an Agent sees when he activates the time machine]]
The game takes place in the distant future, after the Earth has been united to a peaceful global community. A scientist has discovered the technology of time travel but because of its dangerous nature, the prototype machine, 'Pegasus', has been placed under government supervision and further attempts at traveling through time or developing time travel technology are forbidden by law.{{r|reveaux199307}}

The game begins as humanity welcomes the first alien delegation to visit the planet, and prepares to answer positively to an invitation to join the interplanetary "Symbiotry of Peaceful Beings". During the induction ceremony, the government-operated Temporal Security Annex, which was established to oversee the lock-down of the Pegasus machine, detects three temporal disturbances that have altered the timeline; the Annex mobilizes Agent 5 to correct the disruptions, which have altered the timeline so that Earth's meeting with the Symbiotry representatives is one of mutual distrust and aggression rather than cooperation.

[[Image:Morimoto Mars Colony Shuttle Gantry.jpg|thumb|right|The Morimoto Mars Colony]]
Upon arriving at the Annex, Agent 5 discovers that the anachronisms are related to Earth's first contact with the Symbiotry; ten years prior, the aliens had extended their offer, and planned to return in one decade to receive Earth's answer. An unknown party has altered the timeline to prevent contact with the Symbiotry, either through preventing them from reaching Earth or changing humanity's reaction to the aliens' arrival.

The disruptions occurred during three key events in Earth's recent past:

*The conference of 2112 which led to peace and prosperity through the unification of Earth over opposing voices. The robot ''Poseidon'' sends a nuclear missile to detonate above Ghorbistan so that fear prevents the countries from proceeding with the acceptance of the treaty.
*The first acknowledged contact with an alien ship in 2185 above Mars. The robot ''Ares'' is sent to sabotage the Morimoto Mars Colony so that humanity connects the aliens with the colony's destruction, and grow skeptical of their intentions.
*The Pro-alien rally of 2310 where the speech of Dr. Enrique Castillo persuaded the opposing scientists to accept joining the Symbiotry. Robot ''Mercury'' was sent to assassinate Castillo so that the opposition prevailed.

After exploring all three time periods, and collecting evidence from each, Agent 5 discovers that the person responsible for the disruptions is Dr. Elliot Sinclair, the inventor of the Pegasus time machine. He fears that the aliens are a malevolent force rather than a peaceful race, and is doing everything in his power to make Earth an unsuitable candidate for joining the aliens.

In all three scenarios, the player has two ways to neutralize the robots—one "peaceful" and one "aggressive"—which will affect the player's overall score. The player also gains bio-chips from each robot when he completes each scenario successfully.

[[Image:Elliot Sinclair.jpg|thumb|left|Elliot Sinclair, giving instructions and confessing his intentions to his last Prototype, Poseidon, as seen on an Optical Memory Bio-Chip]]
After correcting the anachronisms created by Dr. Sinclair, Agent 5 learns that the doctor decided to take matters into his own hands and assassinate the alien delegate sent to receive Earth's answer. Agent 5 finds Dr. Sinclair hiding on top of an apartment building and holding a rifle, ready to fire on the delegate as soon as he arrives. After a brief scuffle, Agent 5 arrests Dr. Sinclair, allowing history to take its proper course.

== Development ==
[[Image:Mars Maze JM1.png|thumb|250px|right|The Morimoto Caverns as seen in ''The Journeyman Project'']]
''The Journeyman Project'' was released in [[1992 in video gaming|1992]] after 2 years of development. The game impressed the gaming press with its use of high quality rendered environments, stylistic artwork and [[digital audio]].

Due to performance difficulties, the game was re-released in 1994 as ''Journeyman Project Turbo!'', with an updated executable that drastically decreased loading times and improved animation quality.

Two sequels (''[[The Journeyman Project 2: Buried in Time|Buried in Time]]'' and ''[[The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time|Legacy of Time]]'') were released in subsequent years, and a fourth game was in the design stage before Presto Studios closed in November 2002; it was eventually shelved in favor of work on ''[[Myst III: Exile]]''.

A redesign of the game, with the subtitle of ''[[The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime|Pegasus Prime]]'', was released for the [[Power Macintosh]]; it featured updated graphics, enhanced and updated sounds and puzzles, and improved video technology. Plans to release it on multiple platforms were cancelled. In April 2014 the game was released on PC for the first time on Good Old Games.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' called ''The Journeyman Project'' "visuall stunning" and its world "believably fantastic". The magazine stated that the game was "as tough as they come" and recommended built-in hints, but concluded that "It is all the more rewarding after puzzling past each conundrum".<ref name="reveaux199307">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=108 | title=Journey Back to the Future in Presto Studios' The Journeyman Project | work=Computer Gaming World | date=1993-07 | accessdate=12 July 2014 | author=Reveaux, Tony | pages=76}}</ref> In 1993, ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon196">{{cite journal

== Releases and bug fixes ==
The game suffered from performance problems and slow animations due to its early reliance on [[Macromedia Director]]. These problems were mostly overcome with the version 2.0 release and retitled as ''The Journeyman Project Turbo!'' under the publisher [[Sanctuary Woods]] in 1994.

* ''The Journeyman Project'' v1.0 (1992) – original self-published release for Macintosh
* ''The Journeyman Project'' v1.1 (1992) – bug fixes
* ''The Journeyman Project'' v1.2 (1993) – performance upgrade, fastest Mac version until ''TJP Turbo''
* ''The Journeyman Project'' MPC v1.0 (1993) – first release for Windows 3.1
* ''The Journeyman Project Turbo'' (1994) – unified release for Mac and PC with major speed improvements
* ''[[The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime]]'' (1997) – a complete remake of the original

{{About|the former education board in NSW|the current education board|Board of Studies, Teaching and Educational Standards}}

The '''Board of Studies''' was the state government education board in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] from 1990 to 2013. It provided educational leadership by developing the [[curriculum]] from [[Kindergarten]] to [[Year 12]] and awarding the secondary school credentials [[Record of School Achievement]] and [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]].

The Board of Studies amalgamated with the NSW Institute of Teachers on 1 January 2014 to form the [[Board of Studies, Teaching and Educational Standards]] NSW (BOSTES).

==Patterns of study==

The majority of students undertake HSC-related courses over the final two years of high school, though it is possible to undertake different study patterns over different time periods or through different teaching organisations. 

There are a great number of possible courses students can study, totalling over 100 (including languages), in a wide range of subject areas. However, most schools offer students a smaller selection from which they must choose. The only compulsory subject area is English, with one of English Advanced, English Standard, English as a Second Language or English Life Skills required for the award of the HSC. (English Extension 1 and English Extension 2 are also available for English Advanced students). Individual schools may require their students to undertake certain courses, as is the case with Studies of Religion in many religious schools or Agriculture in agricultural schools. However, these are internal school requirements separate from HSC requirements. There are also three distance education [[HSC distinction courses|distinction courses]] run through regional universities available to students who have finished 2 units ahead of their cohort.

Most courses offered comprise a preliminary (Year 11) component and an HSC (Year 12) component. As a general rule the preliminary component must be completed prior to the HSC component. Furthermore, each subject is designated as either one or two "units". Each unit involves approximately two hours of formal tuition per week, and contributes a maximum mark of 50. The majority of courses are two unit courses, and thus students receive marks out of 100 in these courses. 10 units is the minimum number of units required, however students can attempt more should they choose. If they do, their final ATAR mark is calculated using their best 2 units of English and 8 best other units. Extension courses, each with a value of one unit, may be included in the study program, meaning that a certain subject area may have up to four units, e.g. English (Advanced) (two units) plus English Extension 1 and English Extension 2 (each worth one unit).

To be eligible for the award of the HSC a student must have satisfied the requirements in at least twelve preliminary level units, and at least ten HSC level units, with the additional requirements that:
* at least two must be English units;
* at least six units must be Board of Studies-developed courses;
* at least three courses are of two unit or greater value.
* at least four subjects have been completed.
* no more than six units of science are studied.

Further restrictions may apply in certain subject areas.

Note that these requirements are for the award of the HSC. Further requirements regarding study patterns apply if the student wishes to apply for a separate [[Australian Tertiary Admission Rank]] (ATAR) based on their HSC performance.

==Available courses==

There are two main types of courses available in the HSC: Board Developed Courses and Board Endorsed Courses. Board Developed Courses have a syllabus and final exam set by the Board of Studies, and generally may be included in the calculation of the ATAR. Board Endorsed Courses are developed by the school, and may vary from school to school in regards to content and assessment.

==Assessment==
A student's final mark in each subject is determined by a combination of in-school assessments conducted throughout the HSC component of a course, and externally administered final exam(s) typically held in October or November of that year. In addition to comprising half of a student's final assessment result in a subject, external exam results are also used to statistically moderate in-school assessment results between different schools.

These exams are administered by [[Board of Studies, Teaching and Educational Standards|BOSTES]], which is responsible for the overall oversight of the HSC.

==Award==

Upon successful completion of a satisfactory pattern of study students are awarded the Higher School Certificate by way of a [[testamur]].

Whenever a student has completed a course they also receive feedback regarding their results in that course, which typically includes exam results, school assessment results and the performance band in which their performance lies.

Students who achieve excellent results of over 90 in 10 units of study in the HSC are awarded the Premier's Award by the [[government of New South Wales|New South Wales government]]. The most outstanding of these students may also be awarded the [[Australian Student Prize]] by the [[government of Australia|Commonwealth government]]. The [[Thomas Gerald Room|T G Room award]] of the Mathematical Association of New South Wales is given to the student with the best score in the highest-level HSC mathematics examination.<ref>[http://www.mansw.nsw.edu.au/studentservices/tgroom-award.htm The T G Room Award], Mathematical Association of New South Wales, retrieved 2010-06-01.</ref>

HSC results may also be used to calculate the [[Australian Tertiary Admission Rank]] (ATAR). Similar ranking processes used previously were called the UAI ([[Universities Admission Index]]) and the TER (Tertiary Entrance Rank). The ATAR is a separate ranking calculated by another body, the [[Universities Admissions Centre]] (UAC), and is used for determining university entrance. Since 1998 the university entrance rank has been issued separately from the HSC results in order to distinguish the two.

'''Zhao Gao''' ({{zh|t=??}}; died 207 BC) was a close advisor to emperors during the [[Qin Dynasty]] of [[China]]. Considered as one of the most corrupt, villainous, violent and powerful eunuchs in Chinese history, Gao played an instrumental role in the downfall of the Qin Dynasty.

== Early life ==
{{Further|Eunuch#China}}
Zhao Gao was distantly related to the ruling house of the [[state of Zhao]]. According to the [[Shiji]], Zhao Gao's parents committed crimes and were punished. Zhao Gao's brothers were castrated; it is unclear whether Zhao Gao himself was a eunuch or not.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Loewe|first=Michael|title=On the Terms bao zi, yin gong, yin guan, huan, and shou: Was Zhao Gao a Eunuch?|journal=T'oung Pao|year=2005|volume=91|series=Second|issue=4/5|pages=301–319|jstor=4529012|doi=10.1163/156853205774910124}}</ref> {{Dubious|date=November 2009}} However [[Qin Shi Huang]] valued Zhao Gao since he was an expert in law and punishment.{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}  This was very useful to Qin Shi Huang since he himself was always looking for ways to control the people by laws and punishments.  Zhao Gao enjoyed a steady rise in position.

When Zhao was a minor official, he committed a crime punishable by death. Meng Yi was the official in charge of sentencing and he sentenced Zhao to death and removed him from the officials list as instructed by Qin Shi Huang.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Zhao was later pardoned by Qin Shi Huang and returned to his official status.

== Coup following Qin Shi Huang's death ==
At the end of the reign of the First Emperor, [[Qin Shi Huang]], Zhao was involved in the death of Marshal [[Meng Tian]] and his younger brother [[Meng Yi]]. Meng Tian, a reputable general and a supporter of the Emperor's oldest son [[Fusu]], was stationed at the northern border, commanding more than 200,000 troops for the inconclusive campaign against the [[Huns]]. Following the sudden death of Qin Shi Huang at the [[Shaqiu]] prefecture, Zhao and the Imperial Secretariat [[Li Si]] persuaded the emperor's youngest son [[Qin Er Shi|Huhai]] to falsify the emperor's will. The fake decree forced Fusu to commit suicide and stripped Meng Tian of his command. Harboring hatred for the entire Meng family due to his prior sentencing by Meng Yi, Zhao destroyed the Meng brothers by convincing Huhai to issue a decree that forced Meng Tian to commit [[suicide]] and have Meng Yi killed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

[[Qin Er Shi]], who viewed Zhao Gao as his teacher, became the next Qin emperor.

Two years later, Zhao Gao also killed Li Si, ironically executing him via "[[The Five Pains]]" method, Li's own invention. The method consisted of having the victim's nose cut off, cutting off a hand and a foot, then the victim was castrated and finally cut in half in line with the waist. He also executed Li Si's family down to the third generation.

In 207 BC, rebellions rose one after another across China. Zhao was afraid that the Second Emperor might make him responsible for the uprisings. To preempt this, Zhao forced the emperor to commit suicide and installed his nephew, Fusu's son [[Ziying]], as the new emperor. (Note: Some scholars pointed out that Fusu's son might be too young to plot the demise of Zhao Gao and [[Ziying]] might be a brother of the First Emperor instead.)

Ziying, however, knew that Zhao intended to kill him afterwards to appease the rebels, so he feigned illness on the day of the coronation, which forced Zhao to arrive at his residence to persuade him to attend. The moment Zhao arrived, Ziying, along with his two sons, immediately killed Zhao. Zhao's entire clan was annihilated afterwards on Ziying's orders.

Ziying soon surrendered to [[Liu Bang]], and the Qin Dynasty collapsed, three years after the death of Qin Shi Huang, and less than twenty years after it was founded.

==Calling a deer a horse==
One [[Chinese idiom]] that is derived from an incident involving Zhao is "calling a deer a horse" ({{zh|t=????|s=????|p=zh? lù wéi m?}}), meaning "deliberate misrepresentation for ulterior purposes". The ''[[Shiji]]'' records that Zhao, in an attempt to control the government, devised a loyalty test for court officials using a deer and horse:

<blockquote>Zhao Gao was contemplating treason but was afraid the other officials would not heed his commands, so he decided to test them first. He brought a deer and presented it to the Second Emperor but called it a horse. The Second Emperor laughed and said, "Is the chancellor perhaps mistaken, calling a deer a horse?" Then the emperor questioned those around him. Some remained silent, while some, hoping to ingratiate themselves with Zhao Gao, said it was a horse, and others said it was a deer. Zhao Gao secretly arranged for all those who said it was a deer to be brought before the law and had them executed instantly. Thereafter the officials were all terrified of Zhao Gao. Zhao Gao gained military power as a result of that. (tr. Watson 1993:70) </blockquote>

There is a conspiracy theory that Zhao Gao was a descendant of the royal family of the Kingdom of Zhao, which was destroyed by Qin, and Zhao Gao was seeking revenge on Qin. With Zhao Gao in charge of the Qin government, it was natural that the Qin Empire collapsed in such a short time. In fact, Zhao Gao killed all the sons and daughters of Qin Shi Huang, including the Second Emperor, Huhai. In revenge, [[Ziying]] killed Zhao Gao and all of his family members. Thus Zhao Gao or his brothers have no known descendants.

Li Kaiyuan (???), a historian from China, believes Zhao Gao was not a eunuch at all. He bases this in part on the fact eunuchs were not allowed to serve as prime minister, which Zhao did.

[[File:5022007 graz.jpg|thumb|right|Desiro train in [[Graz]], Austria]]
The '''Siemens Desiro''' is a family of [[Diesel multiple unit|diesel]] or [[Electric multiple unit|electric]] [[multiple unit]] passenger trains developed by [[Siemens Mobility]], a division of the German [[Siemens|Siemens AG]] conglomerate.<ref name=siemenspage>{{cite web | url=http://www.mobility.siemens.com/mobility/global/en/urban-mobility/rail-solutions/commuter-and-regional-trains/desiro/Pages/desiro.aspx | title=Desiro| publisher=Siemens}}</ref> The main variants are the Desiro Classic, Desiro ML, Desiro UK and the future Desiro City and Desiro RUS. The trains are mostly used for commuter and regional services,<ref name=siemenspage /> and their rapid acceleration makes them suitable for services with short intervals between stations. The design is flexible, and has become common in many European countries.

==Desiro Classic==

=== Austria ===
[[Austrian Federal Railways]] (ÖBB) is currently using about 60 diesel-powered Desiro trains designated as '''ÖBB 5022'''. These are based on the Class 642 used by Deutsche Bahn, but have some additional safety equipment.

=== Bulgaria ===
[[File:Desiro on the Sofia-Lakatnik line, 14 February 2012.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Bulgarian State Railways]]-operated Desiro train on the [[Sofia]]-[[Lakatnik]] line near [[Thompson, Bulgaria|Thompson]].]]
In 2005 and 2006, the [[Bulgarian State Railways]] began operating Desiro trains as part of a 67 million Euro deal with Siemens AG for a total of 25 [[Diesel multiple unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/bulgarian-modernisation-programme-aims-to-win-back-lost-traffic.html | title=Bulgarian modernisation programme aims to win back lost traffic| date=1 March 2005 | publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}</ref> As of 22 March 2006, 16 trains had been delivered, with many of them operating on the [[Sofia]]-[[Kyustendil]]-[[Sofia]] line. Another 117 million Euro deal for 25 EMUs has also been signed with Siemens AG. The EMUs were fitted out in [[Varna]], where BDZ and Siemens AG are intending to establish a joint venture company. The EMUs are designated classes 30 and 31 and are servicing traffic in the Sofia and [[Plovdiv]] areas.

=== Czech Republic ===
Private railway company [[RegioJet]] used to temporarily operate 2 Desiro trains leased from [[Alpha Trains]] (Germany).

=== Denmark ===
In Denmark [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]] has rented 12 Desiro trains since 2002. The trains are primarily used between [[Odense]] and [[Svendborg]] and between [[Odense]] and [[Fredericia]].
On 2 July 2009 DSB signed a contract of eight trains from Siemens for [[Grenaabanen]], which entered service on 12 December 2010, with an option for 92 more.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/dsb-agrees-desiro-dmu-framework-contract.html | title=DSB agrees Desiro DMU framework contract| date=3 July 2009 | publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}</ref> The trains extend to [[Odder]] from December 2012, starting the light rail network in Aarhus city.<ref>{{cite web|last=Østergaard|first=Nicolai|title=Trods spritnye tog: Århus-pendlere får længere rejsetid|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/134772-trods-spritnye-tog-aarhus-pendlere-faar-laengere-rejsetid|publisher=[[Ingeniøren]]|accessdate=7 December 2012|date=7 December 2012}}</ref>

[[Nordjyske Jernbaner]] used Desiro trains since 2004 on all its operations. Today the company owns eight Desiro trains.

=== Germany ===
[[File:TriebwagenderErzgebirgsbahninAnnaberg-BuchholzUntererBahnhof.jpg|thumb|right|Two Class 642s in Germany]] Germany's [[Deutsche Bahn]] introduced two-car Desiro DMUs for local services in 2000. With a top speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}}, these '''Class 642''' units are mainly used on branch lines and regional lines. Besides the 234 units purchased by DB until 2007, various private German rail companies are also using Desiro DMUs.

The Class 642 is equipped with two MAN diesel engines with an output of {{convert|275|or|315|kW|abbr=on}} each and hydro-mechanical transmission with [[retarder (railroad)|retarder]]s. It typically contains 100 seats. When linked together with [[Scharfenberg coupler]]s, up to three trainsets can be operated together. The Desiros are quite popular with most passengers, thanks to their good acceleration. Because they have often replaced push/pull trains, their shorter journey times, such as on the [[Müglitz Valley Railway]], have encouraged greater passenger numbers.

Originally DB intended to operate together modern DMUs purchased from different manufacturers, but due to software incompatibilities this proved to be impossible. Therefore the Class 642 can only be mechanically coupled with other DMUs like the [[Talent (train)|Class 643]].

=== Greece ===
[[File:OSE Baureihe 460.jpg|thumb|OSE Desiro EMU]]
In [[Greece]] eight diesel DMU-2 Desiro trains (OSE class 660) were temporarily in service with the [[Hellenic Railways Organisation]] (OSE) during 2004–2006, and again in 2007 on the [[Athens]]–[[Chalkida]] line and on the Athens suburban railway lines ([[Proastiakos]]). Afterwards they were returned to their owner (Hellenic Shipyards S.A.) in December 2007. In the late 2008 Hellenic Shipyards/MAN-FERROSTAAL leased the 8 units to Hungary with a contract for 20 years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/world-rolling-stock-market-february-2009.html | title=World rolling stock market February 2009| date=14 February 2009 | publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}</ref>

OSE owns and TRAINOSE operates twenty (20) electric Desiro EMU-5 (OSE class 460) equipped for the [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25-kV]] [[Overhead line|overhead catenary]] system. They operate on the [[Kiato]]–[[Athens International Airport]] suburban line and as a stopping service on the mainline between [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Larissa]], which is also advertised as a suburban service. OSE is in litigation with the Joint Venture of Siemens & Hellenic Shipyards for the supply of those 20 Desiro.

=== Hungary ===
At present 31 diesel Desiros are in service with [[MÁV]] (including the 8 units from Greece), mainly as suburban trains on the regional line between Budapest-[[Esztergom]] and Budapest - Lajosmizse and as an InterCity between Budapest and Baja. On weekends the units also used as peak inter-city trains from Budapest to [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]] and [[Sátoraljaújhely]] and as fast trains from Budapest to Tapolca. During the summer months (when fewer units are used on the Budapest suburban routes) Desiros appear on some local train diagram on the north shore of the Lake Balaton.

=== Romania ===
[[File:Sageata.jpg|thumb|right|Train in Romania (''S?geata Albastr?'') at [[Balote?ti]] Station]]
[[C?ile Ferate Române]] (CFR), Romania's national railway operator, is one of the largest users of the Siemens Desiro trainsets (as the light train variant). CFR, which is currently undergoing modernisation, has bought 120 diesel Desiro trainsets and uses them for all types of train, including its "Inter Regio", and "Regio" inter-city services, but mainly on its "Inter Regio" trains. There was some criticism of the use of Desiros for CFR's long-distance services because they were considered to be uncomfortable. CFR has recently refitted them, and is now using Desiros mainly on its medium- and short-distance routes. For example, it is planning to use them as part of a proposed commuter link in Bucharest and [[Ilfov|Ilfov county]]. For more information on routes, see [[C?ile Ferate Române]].

Twelve married pairs were delivered in August 2006 to the operator [[North County Transit District]] (NCTD). Service began on 9 March 2008, serving fifteen stations.

Mountain Rail, one of two competing coalitions bidding on a large portion of [[FasTracks]] in [[Denver]], appear to pitching a Siemens Desiro ML derived vehicle that is [[Federal Railroad Administration|FRA]] compliant. Both [[Electric multiple unit|EMU]] and [[Diesel multiple unit|DMU]] units would be used for the Northwest Corridor, North Metro Corridor and Gold Line.

==== EMUs ====
The first electric ''Desiro UK'' units were ordered by [[South West Trains]] for both short and long distance service out of [[Waterloo station]] to [[Alton, Hampshire|Alton]], [[Basingstoke]] and the [[Hampshire]]/[[Dorset]] coast. They became two different classes, both of which use the 750V [[Direct current|DC]] third-rail power supply. One hundred and ten [[British Rail Class 450|Class 450]] four-car units for commuter services which entered service in 2003. Forty five [[British Rail Class 444|Class 444]] five-car units for long-distance inter-city services entered service in 2004. An additional order for a further seventeen Class 450 units was placed with the trains being in service by late 2006/early 2007.

Former [[East Anglia]] train operator [[First Great Eastern]] acquired 21 [[British Rail Class 360|Class 360]] four-car units  which operated from 25 kV overhead electrical supply for services from [[London Liverpool Street]] to [[Clacton-on-Sea]]/[[Walton-on-the-Naze]], [[Harwich]] and [[Ipswich]]. The vehicles entered service in 2003.

For the stopping service between [[London Paddington]] and [[Heathrow Airport]] called  [[Heathrow Connect]] five [[British Rail Class 360|Class 360]] five-car units were acquired and entered service in June 2005.

As part of the modernisation of the [[West Coast Main Line]] the former [[Strategic Rail Authority]] ordered thirty [[British Rail Class 350|Class 350]] dual voltage sets for use on stopping services.{{When|date=July 2011}} They are operated by [[London Midland]]. These units were originally ordered as Class 450 third-rail units for South West Trains, but following a review by the Strategic Rail Authority they were diverted to the West Coast main line.  The dual-voltage capability has only been used in service on temporary loan to [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]] on [[Milton Keynes Central railway station|Milton Keynes Central]] - [[East Croydon railway station|East Croydon]] services whilst covering for a shortfall of Southern [[British Rail class 377|class 377]] [[Electrostar]] units. The units have been praised for their air conditioning, accessibility and performance, but criticised for their comfort (newer units have 3+2 seating). Thirty [[British Rail Class 350|Class 350/1]] four-car units entered service in 2005, and in 2008/9 a further thirty seven [[British Rail Class 350|Class 350/2]] four-car units entered service.

On 11 July 2008, [[First ScotRail]] ordered a number of [[British Rail Class 380|Class 380 EMUs]] for delivery in 2010. The order was for 22 three-car and 16 four-car units.<ref>[http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/node/3343 New Electric Trains for Scotland's Growing Railways], [[Transport Scotland]] press release 11 July 2008</ref> First enter service began 8 December 2010. Inverclyde Line, Ayrshire Coast Line of the Class 318, Class 334 "Juniper" was introduced to replace the fleet, and the North Berwick line Class 322 trains have been replaced.

==== DMUs ====
To fulfil their franchise commitment, [[First TransPennine Express]] ordered the first diesel variant of the ''Desiro UK'' for use on its inter-city services across the north of [[England]] and over the border in southern [[Scotland]]. 51 three-car units classed as [[British Rail Class 185|Class 185]] entered service in 2006.

=== Desiro City ===
Desiro City is a planned high-capacity commuter EMU for the UK market building on the Desiro UK and Desiro Main Line, with a reduction in weight and energy use and '[[Drive by wire|fly-by-wire]]' controls.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/siemens-offers-desiro-city-to-the-uk-market.html | title=Siemens offers Desiro City to the UK market| date=17 July 2009| publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}</ref>

A £1.6 billion order for 115 eight and twelve car units (1150 vehicles) for the [[Thameslink rolling stock programme]] was awarded in 2011 (finalised 2013). The vehicles were given the designation [[British Rail Class 700|Class 700]] ''(qv)''

In 2014 [[South West Trains]] ordered 30 five car units at a cost of £210 million.<ref>{{citation| url = http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/siemens-wins-south-west-trains-suburban-emu-order.html| title = Siemens wins South West Trains suburban EMU order|date = 3 September 2014| work =  www.railwaygazette.com}}</ref>

[[File:Reel-to-reel recorder tc-630.jpg|thumb|right|A reel-to-reel tape recorder (Sony TC-630), typical of those which were once common audiophile objects. Note the distinctive Scotch tape spool at left.]]

'''Reel-to-reel/open-reel [audio] tape recording''' is the form of [[Magnetic tape#Audio recording|magnetic tape audio recording]] in which the recording medium is held on a [[reel]], rather than being securely contained within a [[compact audio cassette|cassette]].

In use, the ''supply reel'' or ''feed reel'' containing the tape is mounted on a spindle; the end of the tape is manually pulled out of the reel, threaded through mechanical guides and a [[tape head]] assembly, and attached by friction to the hub of a second, initially empty ''takeup reel''.

==History==
[[File:Ton S.b, tape unit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Magnetophon]] from a German radio station in World War II.]]
The reel-to-reel format was used in the earliest [[Sound recording#Magnetic recording|tape recorders]], including the pioneering German-British Blattnerphone machines of the late 1920s which used [[Tape_recorder#Early_steel_tape_recorders|steel tape]],<ref>[http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/blattner.htm "Blattnerphone"], Orbem.co.uk, retrieved 02 February 2014</ref> and the German [[Magnetophon]] machines of the 1930s. Originally, this format had no name, since all forms of magnetic [[tape recorder]]s used it. The name arose only with the need to distinguish it from the several kinds of tape [[8-track tape|cartridges]] or [[Audio cassette|cassette]]s such as the [[Fidelipac|endless loop cartridge]] developed for radio station commercials and spot announcements in 1954, the [[RCA tape cartridge|full size cassette]], developed by RCA in 1958 for home use, as well as the [[Audio cassette|compact cassette]] developed by [[Philips]] in 1962, originally for dictation.

Reel-to-reel tape was also used in early [[tape drive]]s for data storage on [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computers, [[video tape recorder]] (VTR) machines, and high quality [[analog audio]] recorders, which have been in use from the early 1940s, up until the present. [[Studer]], [[Stellavox]] and [[Denon]] still produced reel to reel tape recorders in the 1990s, but currently only Nagra,<ref name="nagraaudio">{{cite web|url=http://www.nagraaudio.com/pro/pages/products_nagra_4-2.php |title=Nagra 4.2 frame |publisher=[[Nagra]] |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref> Otari,<ref name="otari">{{cite web|url=http://www.otari.com/product/recorder/mx5050/index.html |title=Otari, Inc.: Product Information: MX-5050BIII 2ch Analog Audio Tape Recorder |publisher=Otari.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref> and Mechlabor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stm.hu/fomenu/angol/egesz1_angol.htm |title=STM Studiotechnic |publisher=Stm.hu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref> continue to manufacture analog reel-to-reel recorders.

The earliest machines produced distortion during the recording process which German engineers significantly reduced during the Nazi era by applying a high-frequency [[AC_bias|bias]] current to the recording head along with the desired signal. American audio engineer [[Jack Mullin]] was a member of the [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]] during [[World War II]]. His unit was assigned to investigate German radio and electronics activities, and in the course of his duties, he acquired two Magnetophon recorders and 50 reels of [[I.G. Farben]] recording tape from a German radio station at [[Bad Nauheim]] (near [[Frankfurt]]). He had these shipped home. Over the next two years, he worked to develop the machines for commercial use, hoping to interest the Hollywood film studios in using magnetic tape for movie soundtrack recording.
[[File:Unitra ZK-147.jpg|thumb|right|[[Unitra]] ZK-147, a vintage [[Poland|Polish]]-made reel-to-reel tape recorder]]

Mullin gave a demonstration of his recorders at [[MGM Studios]] in [[Hollywood]] in 1947, which led to a meeting with [[Bing Crosby]], who immediately saw the potential of Mullin's recorders to pre-record his radio shows. Crosby invested $50,000 in a local electronics company, [[Ampex]], to enable Mullin to develop a commercial production model of the tape recorder. Using Mullin's tape recorders and with Mullin as his chief engineer, Crosby became the first American performer to master commercial recordings on tape and the first to regularly pre-record his radio programs on the medium. Ampex and Mullin subsequently developed commercial stereo and [[Multitrack recording|multitrack audio recorders]], based on the system invented by Ross Snyder of Ampex Corp. Les Paul had been given one of the first Ampex Model 200 tape decks by Crosby in 1948 and went on to use Ampex eight track "Sel Sync" machines for multitracking. Ampex went on to develop the first practical [[videotape recorder]]s in the early 1950s to pre-record Crosby's TV shows.
[[File:magtape1.jpg|thumb|left|7-inch reel of {{convert|1/4|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} recording tape, typical of non-professional use in the 1950s–70s. Studios generally used 10½ inch reels on [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] backings.]]

Inexpensive reel-to-reel tape recorders were widely used for voice recording in the home and in schools before the [[Philips]] [[compact cassette]], introduced in 1963, gradually took over. Cassettes eventually displaced reel-to-reel recorders for consumer use. However, the narrow tracks and slow recording speeds used in cassettes compromised [[high fidelity|fidelity]].  Columbia House carried pre-recorded reel-to-reel tapes from 1960 to 1984.

Following the example set by Bing Crosby, high-speed reel-to-reel tape recorders rapidly became the main recording format used by [[audiophile]]s and professional recording studios until the late 1980s when [[digital audio]] recording techniques began to allow the use of other types of media (such as [[Digital Audio Tape]] (DAT) cassettes and [[hard disk]]s).

Even today, some artists of all genres prefer analog tape's "musical", "natural" and especially "warm" sound. Due to [[harmonic]] distortion, bass can thicken up, creating a fuller-sounding mix. In addition, high end can be slightly [[Audio level compression|compressed]], which is more natural to the human ear. It is common for artists to record to digital and re-record the tracks to analog reels for this effect of "natural" sound. In addition to all of these attributes of tape, tape saturation is a unique form of distortion that many [[rock music|rock]], [[blues]] and [[funk]] artists find very pleasing.

==Description==
The earliest reel-to-reel systems used metal wire as a medium (see [[wire recording]]), which is robust, but suffered from a number of problems&nbsp;– poor fidelity, required a strong current to imprint the signal onto the wire, editing inconvenience (needing physical cuts to effect an edit), and potential kinking or even tangling of the recording wire. The invention of [[cellulose acetate]] plastic tape coated with [[iron oxide]] solved these problems, opening up the use of tape recorders in studios.

The great advantage of tape for studios was twofold&nbsp;– it allowed a performance to be recorded without the 30-minute time limitation of a phonograph disc, and it permitted a recorded performance to be edited. For the first time, audio could be manipulated as a physical entity. Tape editing is performed simply by cutting the tape at the required point, and rejoining it to another section of tape using [[adhesive tape]], or sometimes [[adhesive|glue]]. This is called a '''''splice'''''. The splicing tape has to be very thin to avoid impeding the tape's motion, and the adhesive is carefully formulated to avoid leaving a sticky residue on the tape or deck. Usually, the cut is made at an angle across the tape so that any "click" or other noise introduced by the cut is spread across a few milliseconds of the recording. The use of reels to supply and collect the tape also made it very easy for editors to manually move the tape back and forth across the heads to find the exact point they wished to edit. Tape to be spliced was clamped in a special ''splicing block'' attached to the deck near the heads to hold the tape accurately while the edit was made. A skilled editor could make these edits very rapidly and accurately. A side effect of cutting the tape at an angle is that on [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] tapes the edit occurs on one channel a split-second before the other. Long, angled splices can also be used to create a perceptible dissolve from one sound to the next; periodic segments can induce rhythmic or pulsing effects.<ref>Thom Holmes, Electronic and experimental music, 2nd ed., p. 79</ref>

[[File:Reel-to-ReelTapeBigHub.agr.jpg|thumb|Professional-style tape reel designed to fit large NARTB hub.]]

The performance of tape recording is greatly affected by the width of the tracks used to record a signal, and the speed of the tape. The wider and faster the better, but of course this uses more tape. These factors lead directly to improved [[frequency response]], [[signal-to-noise ratio]], and high-frequency [[distortion]] figures. Tape can accommodate multiple parallel tracks, allowing not just stereo recordings, but multi-track recordings too. This gives the producer of the final edit much greater flexibility, allowing a performance to be remixed long after the performance was originally recorded. This innovation was a great driving force behind the explosion of [[popular music]] in the late 1950s and 1960s. The first multi-tracking recorders had four tracks, then eight, then sixteen, twenty-four, and so on. It was also discovered that new effects were possible using multi-tracking recorders, such as [[phaser (effect)|phasing]] and [[flanging]], delays and echo, so these innovations appeared on pop recordings shortly after multi-tracking recorders were introduced.

[[File:Sonora-r2r.jpg|thumb|left|A typical home reel-to-reel tape recorder, this one made by Sonora. It could play stereo quarter-track tapes, but record only in one quarter-track mono. Home equipment with missing features were fairly common in the 1950s and 1960s.]]

For home use, simpler reel-to-reel recorders were available, and a number of track formats and tape speeds were standardised to permit interoperability and prerecorded music.

Reel-to-reel [[tape editing]] also gained cult-status when many used this technique on hit-singles in the 1980s.

==Pre-recorded reel tapes==
[[File:UniversumUNAM47.JPG|thumb|Astrovox Polaris III reel-to-reel 1960 at [[Universum (UNAM)|Universum]] in Ciudad Universitaria in Mexico City]]
The first prerecorded reel-to-reel tapes were introduced in the USA in 1949; the catalog contained fewer than ten titles with no popular artists. In 1952, EMI started selling pre-recorded tapes in Great Britain. The tapes were twin-sided and mono (2 tracks) and were duplicated in real time on modified EMI BTR2 recorders. [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] joined the reel-to-reel business in 1954. In 1955, EMI released 2-track "stereosonic" tapes, although the catalog took longer to be published. Since these EMI tapes were much more expensive than a vinyl LP record, sales were poor; still, EMI released over 300 "stereosonic" titles. Then they introduced their Twin Packs, which contained the equivalent of two LP albums but playing at 3.75ips. {{fact|date=May 2014}}

The heyday of prerecorded reel tapes was the mid-1960s, but after the introduction of less complicated [[cassette tapes]] and [[8-track tape]]s, the number of albums released on prerecorded reel tape dropped dramatically despite their superior sound quality. By the latter 1960s, their retail prices were considerably higher than competing formats, and musical genres were limited—classical, soundtracks, original cast albums, major pop stars—to those most likely to appeal to well-heeled [[audiophile]]s willing to contend with the cumbersome threading of open-reel tape. The introduction of the [[Dolby noise-reduction system]] narrowed the performance gap between cassettes and open-reel, and by 1973 the prerecorded open-reel offerings had almost completely disappeared, even from record stores and audio equipment shops. [[Columbia House]] advertisements in 1978 showed that only 1/3 of new titles were available on reel-to-reel; they continued to offer a select number of new releases in the format until 1984.{{fact|date=May 2014}}

Sales were very low and specialized during the 1980s. Audiophile reel tapes were made under license by Barclay-Crocker between 1977 and 1986. Licensors included [[Philips Records|Philips]], [[Deutsche Grammophon]], [[Argo Records|Argo]], [[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]], [[Musical Heritage Society]] and [[L'Oiseau Lyre]], so there was a large selection of high quality performances with great artists. Barclay-Crocker tapes were all Dolby encoded and some titles were also available in the [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]] format. The majority of the catalog contained classical recordings, with a few jazz and movie soundtrack albums. Barclay-Crocker tapes were duplicated on modified Ampex 440 machines at four times the playing speed, unlike popular reel tapes which were duplicated at 16 times the playback speed. All of the known pre-recorded reel-to-reels on the market are all documented at the Reel To Reel Index Website which focuses on the last reels made during the 1980s and includes photographs of all of them. David Winter also released the complete list of 1950's EMI and Barclay-Crocker tapes.{{fact|date=May 2014}}

==Tape speeds==
In general, the faster the speed the better the reproduction quality. In addition, higher tape speeds spread the signal longitudinally over more tape area, reducing the effects of dropouts that can be audible from the medium. Slower tape speeds conserve tape and are useful in applications where sound quality is not critical.

* 15/16ths of an inch per second (in/s) or {{convert|15/16|in/s|cm/s|2|abbr=on|disp=output only}}: used for very long-duration recordings (e.g. recording a [[radio station]]'s entire output in case of complaints, aka "logging").

* 1? in/s {{convert|1.875|in/s|cm/s|2|abbr=on|disp=output only}}: usually the slowest domestic speed, best for long duration speech recordings.

* 3¾ in/s {{convert|3.75|in/s|cm/s|2|abbr=on|disp=output only}}: common domestic speed, used on most single-speed domestic machines, reasonable quality for speech and off-air radio recordings.

* 7½ in/s {{convert|7.5|in/s|cm/s|2|abbr=on|disp=output only}}: highest domestic speed, also slowest professional; used by most radio stations for "dubs", copies of commercial announcements; Through the early to mid '90s many stations could not handle 15 IPS.

Speed units of [[inches per second]] or in/s are also abbreviated IPS. 3¾ in/s and 7½ in/s are the speeds that were used for (the vast majority of) consumer market releases of commercial recordings on reel-to-reel tape. 3¾ in/s is also the speed used in 8-track cartridges. 1? in/s is also the speed used in [[Compact cassette]]s.

In some early prototype linear [[video tape recording]] systems developed in the early 1950s from companies such as [[Bing Crosby Enterprises]], [[Radio Corporation of America|RCA]], and the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]'s [[Vision Electronic Recording Apparatus|VERA]], the tape speed was extremely high, over 200 in/s, to adequately capture the large amount of image information. The need for a high linear tape speed was made unnecessary with the introduction of the now-obsolete professional [[Quadruplex videotape|Quadruplex]] system from 1956, which segmented the fields of a television image by recording (and reproducing) several tracks at a high-speed across the width of the tape per field of video by way of a spinning headwheel with 4 separate video heads mounted on its edge (a technique called ''[[transverse scan]]ning''), allowing for the linear tape speed to be much slower. Transverse scanning was superseded by the later technology of [[helical scan]]ning, which could record one whole field of video per helically-recorded track, recorded at an angle across the width of the tape.

===Quality aspects===
Even though a recording on tape may have been made at studio quality, tape speed was the limiting factor, much like [[bit rate]] is today. Decreasing the speed of analog audio tape causes a uniform decrease in the linearity of the response, increased background noise (hiss), more noticeable [[Dropout (electronics)|dropouts]] where there are flaws in the magnetic tape, and shifting of the (Gaussian) background noise spectrum toward lower frequencies (where it sounds more "granular",) ''regardless'' of the audio content. An MP3 of a noisy rock band at a low bit rate will have many more artifacts than a simple flute solo at the same bit rate, whereas either on low-speed tape will have the same uniform background noise profile and high frequency saturation (weakened high end response) but no dynamic distortion patterns.

A recording on magnetic audio tape is [[linear]]; unlike today's digital audio, not only was jumping from spot to spot to edit time consuming, editing was destructive—unless the recording was duplicated before edit, normally taking the same amount of time to copy, in order to preserve 75-90 percent of the quality of the original. Editing was done either with a razor blade—by physically cutting and splicing the tape, in a manner similar to motion picture film editing—or electronically by dubbing segments onto an edit tape. The former method preserved the full quality of the recording but not the intact original; the latter incurred the same quality loss involved in dubbing a complete copy of the source tape, but preserved the original.

Tape speed is not the only factor affecting the quality of the recording. Other factors affecting quality include track width, tape formulation, and backing material and thickness. The design and quality of the recorder are also important factors, in many ways that are not applicable to digital recording systems. The machine's speed stability ([[wow (recording)|wow-and-flutter]]), head gap size, head quality, and general head design and technology, and the machine's alignment (mostly a maintenance issue, but also a matter of design—how well and precisely it can be aligned) electro-mechanically affect the quality of the recording. The regulation of tape tension affects contact between the tape and the heads and has a very significant impact on the recording and reproduction of high frequencies. The track width of the machine, which is a question of format rather than individual machine design, is one of two major machine factors controlling signal-to-noise ratio (assuming the electronics have high enough S/N not to be a factor), the other being tape speed. S/N ratio varies directly with track width, due to the Gaussian nature of tape noise; doubling the track width doubles the S/N ratio (hence, with good electronics and comparable heads, 8-track cartridges should have half the signal-to-noise of quarter-track 1/4" tape at the same speed, 3-3/4 IPS.) Tape formulation affects the retention of the magnetic signal, especially high frequencies, the frequency linearity of the tape, the S/N ratio, print-through, optimum AC bias level (which must be set by a technician aligning the machine to match the tape type used, or more crudely set with a switch to approximate the optimum setting.) Tape formulation varies between different tape types ([[ferric oxide]] [Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>], [[chromium dioxide]] [CrO<sub>2</sub>], etc.) and also in the precise composition of a specific brand and batch of tape. (Studios therefore generally align their machines for one brand and model number of tape and use only that brand and model.) Backing material type and thickness affect the [[tensile strength]] and elasticity of the tape, which affect wow-and-flutter and tape stretch; stretched tape will have a pitch error, possibly fluctuating. Backing thickness also affects print-through, the phenomenon of adjacent layers of tape wound on a reel picking up weak copies of the magnetic signal from each other. Print-through on analog tape causes unintended pre- and post-echoes on playback, and is generally not fully reversible once it has occurred.

===Noise reduction===
Electronic [[Audio noise reduction#In audio|noise reduction]] techniques were also developed to increase the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and [[dynamic range]] of analog sound recordings. Dolby noise reduction includes a suite of standards (designated A, B, C, S and SR) for both professional and consumer recording. The Dolby systems use frequency dependent compression/expansion ([[companding]]) during the recording/playback, respectively. [[Dbx (noise reduction)|DBX]] is another noise reduction system that uses a more aggressive companding technique to improve both dynamic range and noise level. However, DBX recordings do not sound acceptable when played on non-DBX equipment.

In the late 70s there was also the German Telefunken-made HighCom NR system, a broadband compander, which was technically very advanced and reached a signal-to-noise ratio in the range of a CD (approximately 100 dB). That was a gain in dynamics of roughly 25 dB that outperformed the well-known Dolby B by far. HighCom was included in more sophisticated cassette recorders, mostly alongside with the various Dolby systems. Even though this applied to the consumer market, there was no tape hiss at all that an ear could realize. Another advantage was that recorded tapes could be exchanged amongst HighCom recorders without any loss of quality in sound. The "pumping effect" mostly reported from critical sound material (e.g. drums or any percussive instrument) with advanced dbx NR which was also a serious competitor did not show in properly calibrated HighCom recordings. HighCom was utilized in professional recording studios and (German) radio stations in its professional versions HighCom II and HighCom III. It was licensed by Nakamichi around 1980 but did not penetrate the market, possibly due to the less aggressive marketing strategies typical for German companies at that time compared to the widely known Dolby systems.

Dolby B eventually became the most popular system for Compact Cassette noise reduction. Today [[Dolby SR]] is in widespread use for professional analog tape recording.

==Multi-track recorders==
As studio audio production progressed and became more and more advanced, it became desirable to record the individual instruments and human voices separately and mix them down to one, two, or more speaker channels later, rather than in real time in the studio before recording. In addition to allowing recording engineers and producers to experiment with different mixing arrangements, effects, etc. on the same performance and to produce multiple versions of a recording (without having multiple duplicates of all the studio control room equipment used for mixing), multi-tracking enables the use of non-real-time effects or effects that cannot be produced in the same studio where the musicians perform. Reel-to-reel recorders with eight, sixteen, twenty four, and even thirty two tracks were eventually built, with as many heads recording synchronized parallel linear tracks. Some of these machines were larger than a laundry washing machine and used tape as wide as 2&nbsp;inches. A single new reel of 1" or wider tape, could easily cost $100 to $200. Still, in professional studios, most tapes were recorded only once, and all recording was on new tape, to ensure the maximum quality, as studio time and the time of skilled musicians was much higher than the cost of tape, making it not worth the risk of a recording being lost or degraded due to using media that had been previously recorded upon.

==Digital reel-to-reel==
As professional audio evolved from analog magnetic tape to digital media, engineers adapted magnetic tape technology to digital recording, producing digital reel-to-reel magnetic tape machines. Before large hard disks became economical enough to make hard disk recorders viable, studio digital recording meant recording on digital tape. [[Mitsubishi]]'s [[ProDigi]] and [[Sony]]'s [[Digital Audio Stationary Head]] (DASH) were the primary digital reel-to-reel formats in use in recording studios from the early 1980s through the mid-1990s. [[Nagra]] introduced digital reel-to-reel tape recorders for use in film sound recording. Digital reel-to-reel tape eliminated all the traditional quality limitations of analog tape, including background noise (hiss), high frequency [[roll-off]], wow and flutter, pitch error, nonlinearity, print-through, and degeneration with copying, but the tape media was even more expensive than professional analog open reel tape, and the linear nature of tape still placed restrictions on access, and winding time to find a particular spot was still a significant drawback. Also, while the quality of digital tape did not progressively degrade with use of the tape, the physical sliding of the tape over the heads and guides meant that the tape still did wear, and eventually that wear would lead to digital errors and permanent loss of quality if the tape was not copied before reaching that point. Still, digital reel-to-reel tape represented a significant advance in audio recording technology, and most who could afford to record using digital tape generally did.

==As a musical instrument==
Early reel-to-reel users realized that segments of tape could be spliced together and otherwise manipulated by adjusting playback speed or direction of a given recording. In the same way as modern keyboards allow [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and playback at different speeds, a reel-to-reel could accomplish similar feats in the hands of a talented user. Consider:
* The [[mellotron]] is an electro-mechanical, polyphonic tape replay keyboard that used a bank of parallel linear magnetic audio tape strips.  Playback heads underneath each key enable the playing of pre-recorded sounds. Each of the tape strips has a playing time of approximately eight seconds, after which the tape comes to a dead stop and rewinds to the start position.
* The title track of [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s album ''[[Are You Experienced (album)|Are You Experienced]]'', on which the guitar solo and much of the drum track was recorded, then played backwards on a reel-to-reel.
* [[The Beatles]] recorded many songs using reel to reel tape as a part of the creative process. Examples include "[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite]]" and "[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]" which used a technique where stock recordings were cut up and then randomly reassembled and overdubbed on to the songs (recordings of [[Calliope (music)|calliope organs]] on "Mr. Kite", and recordings of [[marching bands]] on "Yellow Submarine").<ref>Emrick, Geoff. ''Here, There and Everywhere'', p.168</ref> On "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]" multiple tape machines were used all interconnected patching tape loops that had been prepared by the band. The loops were played in a variety of ways such as backwards, sped up and slowed down. To record the song, the machines, which were located in separate studio rooms, were all manned by individual technicians and played at once to record on the fly.<ref>Emrick, p.113.</ref> "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]" combined two different taped versions of the song. The versions were independently altered in speed to end up together miraculously both on pitch and tempo.<ref>Emrick, p.139.</ref> "[[I Am the Walrus]]" used a radio tuner patched into the sound console to layer random live broadcast over an existing taped track.<ref>Emrick, p.215.</ref> "[[Revolution 9]]" also had many effects produced using a reel-to-reel and tape editing techniques.
* The [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], notably [[Delia Derbyshire]] who "performed" (a more accurate term would be "realised") the [[Doctor Who theme|original theme tune]] to the BBC series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', by recording various sounds including [[oscillators]] and then manually cutting together each individual note on a group of reel-to-reels.
* [[Aaron Dilloway]], founding member of [[Wolf Eyes]], often utilizes a reel to reel tape machine in his solo performances.
* [[Yamantaka Eye]] of the band [[Boredoms]] uses a reel-to-reel tape as an instrument in live performances and in post-production (a good example would be in the track "Super You" from the album ''[[Super æ]]'').
* [[The Gasman]] who produced much of his early work on Planet Mu Records splicing old reel-to-reel classical music into loops.
* [[Mission of Burma]], whose fourth member [[Martin Swope]] "played" a reel-to-reel tape recorder live, either playing previously recorded samples at certain times or recording part of the band's performance and playing it back either in reverse or at different speeds. When the band re-formed in 2002, audio engineer [[Bob Weston]] took over Swope's role at the tape deck.
* [[Musique concrète]] in general.
* [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[cash register]] introduction to their track "[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]" was made using a loop of "splices" which was looped around a mic stand and through a tape player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD5NVBIIqVw&t=0m51s |title=Pink Floyd : Money in Studio VERY RARE!! |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-08-03 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}</ref>
* [[Steve Tibbetts]] is a recording artist who includes tape editing as a significant portion of the creative process.
* [[Frank Zappa|Frank Zappa's]] ''[[Lumpy Gravy]]'' and ''[[We're Only In It For the Money]]'', both of which featured edits too numerous to mention, in addition to multiple instances of speed alteration and intricately layered samples upon samples.
* The improviser [[Jerome Noetinger]] uses a ReVox A77 reel-to-reel to create and manipulate tape loops in live performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lionelpalun.com/supercolor/indexE.php |title=Supercolor Palunar |publisher=Lionelpalun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}</ref>

In addition, multiple reel-to-reel machines used in tandem can also be used to create echo and delay effects. The [[Frippertronics]] configuration used by [[Brian Eno]] and [[Robert Fripp]] on numerous of their 1970s and '80s recordings illustrates these possibilities.<ref>In particular, the back cover of Eno's 1975 album ''[[Discreet Music]]'' provides an technical diagram of the dual reel-to-reel setup and other components used in recording the selections on that album.</ref>

'''Oceanic dolphins''' are members of the [[cetacea]]n [[family (biology)|family]] '''Delphinidae'''. These [[marine mammals]] are related to [[whale]]s and [[porpoise]]s. They are found worldwide, mostly in the shallower seas of the continental shelves. As the name implies, these [[dolphin]]s tend to be found in the open seas, unlike the [[river dolphin]]s, although a few species such as the [[Irrawaddy dolphin]] are coastal or riverine.

Six of the larger species in the Delphinidae, the [[killer whale]], [[Pilot Whale|pilot]] ([[long-finned pilot whale|long-finned]] and [[short-finned pilot whale|short-finned]]), [[Melon-headed Whale|melon-headed]], [[Pygmy Killer Whale|pygmy killer]] and [[False Killer Whale|false killer]] whales, are commonly called whales, rather than dolphins; they are also sometimes collectively known as "blackfish".

==Characteristics==
[[File:Dolphind.jpg|thumb|left|[[Atlantic spotted dolphin]]]]
The Delphinidae are the most diverse of the cetacean families, with numerous variations between species. They range in size from {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}} ([[Haviside's dolphin]]), to {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on}} and 10 tonnes ([[killer whale]]). Most species weigh between {{convert|50|and|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. They typically have curved dorsal fins, clear 'beaks' at the front of their heads, and forehead [[melon_(whale)|melon]]s, although exceptions to all of these rules are found. They have a wide range of colors and patterns.<ref name=EoM>{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Evans, Peter G.H.|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 180–185|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}</ref>

Most delphinids primarily eat fish, along with a smaller number of squid and small crustaceans, but some species specialise in eating squid, or, in the case of the killer whale, also eat marine mammals and birds. All, however, are purely [[carnivore|carnivorous]]. They typically have between 100 and 200 teeth, although a few species have considerably fewer. 

Delphinids travel in large pods, which may number a thousand individuals in some species. Each pod forages over a range of a few dozen to a few hundred square miles. Some pods have a loose social structure, with individuals frequently joining or leaving, but others seem to be more permanent, perhaps dominated by a male and a [[harem]] of females.<ref name=EoM/> Individuals communicate by sound, producing low-frequency whistles, and also produce high-frequency broadband clicks of 80-220 [[hertz|kHz]], which are primarily used for [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]]. [[Gestation]] lasts from 10 to 12 months, and results in the birth of a single calf.

<tt>'''ln'''</tt> is a standard [[Unix command]] used to create links ('''l'''i'''n'''k) to files.

== Link files ==
Links allow more than one file name to refer to the same file, elsewhere.

There are two types of links, both of which are created by <tt>ln</tt>:
#[[symbolic link]]s, which refer to a symbolic path indicating the abstract location of another file; and
#[[hard link]]s, which refer to the specific location of physical data.

These links behave differently when the source of the link (what is being linked to) is moved or removed. Symbolic links are not updated (they merely contain a string which is the pathname of its target); hard links always refer to the source, even if moved or removed.

==Specification ==
The [[Single Unix Specification]] (SUS) specifies the behaviour that a link or links (either symbolic or hard) will be created where specified that will link to the target file (or directory) specified. 

More precisely, <tt>ln</tt> can be invoked in one of two ways: two arguments—first an argument specifying the source file then the target, or multiple (greater than two) arguments, specifying firstly a number of source files, then a directory in which all the links are to be created. In the latter invocation, the names of the links will be that of the source file. This invocation will be assumed if the last argument is a directory. If invoked in the latter form, <tt>ln</tt>'s behaviour is not specified (it is implementation-defined).

<tt>ln</tt> is specified to use behaviour identical to that of the standard <tt>unlink()</tt> and <tt>link()</tt> functions.
The original file can still be accessed through the hardlink: 
<source lang="bash">
$ cat hardlink.file
This is a file
</source>

Multiple hard links can be made to the same file. Each hard link increments a [[reference count]]; a file is not deleted until its reference count reaches zero.

'''Televiziunea Român?''' ({{IPA-ro|televizi?une?a ro?m?n?}}<ref>http://dexonline.ro/search.php?lexemId=57040</ref>), more commonly referred to as '''TVR''' {{IPA-ro|teve?re|}}, is the short name for '''Societatea Român? de Televiziune''' (Romanian Television Corporation); acronym: '''SRTV'''. '''SRTV''' is the Romanian public television. It operates six channels: [[TVR1]], [[TVR2]], [[TVR3]], [[TVR Cultural]], [[TVR Info]], [[TVRi]] and [[TVR HD]], along with six regional studios in [[TVR Bucure?ti|Bucharest]], [[TVR Cluj|Cluj-Napoca]], [[TVR Ia?i|Ia?i]], [[TVR Timi?oara|Timi?oara]], [[TVR Craiova|Craiova]] and  [[TVR Târgu Mure?|Târgu Mure?]]. Of the regional studios of TVR ("''studiouri teritoriale''") only TVR Cluj broadcasts independently (terrestrial and via cable) all over [[Transylvania]]. The other broadcast usually at the same time on TVR2 and sometimes on TVR1.

[[TVR1]] has a total national coverage of 99.8% and [[TVR2]] has 91% coverage &mdash; all of the other channels and networks cover only densely populated areas. Even though it does not have the largest audience, ([[Pro TV]] and [[Antena 1 (Romania)|Antena 1]], two private networks, consistently get higher ratings in the urban market segment), it offers a wider variety of services, including webcasts and international viewing.

==History==

===The beginnings===
TVR was established in 1956, in [[Bucharest]] and had its first broadcast on 31 December from a little building (a deserted cinema studio) on Molière Street no. 2.

===During the Ceau?escu era===
TVR moved in 1969 to a new building, the specially built television center on the Doroban?ilor Avenue.

A second channel, [[TVR2]], was created in 1968 (at that time it was simply called "Programul 2", the second channel and the old TVR became the first channel, "Programul 1"). TVR2 was suspended from 1985, due to the "energy saving programme" initiated by [[Nicolae Ceau?escu]] and TVR1 became TVR again, becoming the sole television station in Romania until the fall of communism in 1989.

In 1983, TVR introduced color television. Although the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries adopted the Soviet-backed [[SECAM]] system, TVR chose to implement the [[PAL]] system.
[[File:Epoca Nicolae Ceausescu TV Show.jpg|thumb|right|Propaganda TV program from 1986, entitled ''Nicolae Ceau?escu Era''.]]
Due to the same "energy saving programme" between 1985 and 1989, the TVR schedule was severely limited to only about two hours per day, between 20:00 and 22:00, most of which were dedicated to the [[Nicolae Ceau?escu's cult of personality|cult of personalities of Nicolae Ceau?escu]] and his wife [[Elena Ceau?escu|Elena]]; with an exception on Saturdays, from 13:00 to 15:00 and 19:00 to 22:30 and Sundays (the same program as Saturdays, but with children's programs between 11:30 and 12:30). The two hours of programming were half propaganda and half general entertainment:

*'''19:53''' The Socialist Republic of Romania National Anthem ("[[Trei culori]]")
*'''19:57''' The ''[[Frontul Democra?iei ?i Unit??ii Socialiste]]'' ("Democracy and Socialist Unity Front", FDUS) Anthem ("[[Himni i Flamurit|E scris pe tricolor Unire]]")
*'''19:59:30''' Opening (clock)
*'''20:00''' News ("[[Telejurnal]]")
*'''20:20''' Special programs dedicated to Ceau?escu (documentary or musical shows)
*'''21:00''' An episode of theatre play, opera or a socialist movie
*'''21:50''' News ("[[Telejurnal]]")
*'''21:58''' Closing ("Hora Unirii")

Later, the programs increased to three hours per day during the workweek (from 19:00 to 22:00).
[[Image:TVR Main Building Bukarest Romania.JPG|thumb|right|Main building of the TVR in [[Bucharest]] at night (Nov 2006).]]

===After December 1989===
During the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Revolution of December 1989]], TVR was an important focal point of the events. Rebels occupied the TVR building, in the afternoon of December 22 and announced that the Ceau?escus had fled. TVR changed its name to "Televiziunea Român? Liber?" (TVRL), "Free Romanian Television".  On 17 February 1990, TVR2 resumed broadcasting and TVRL became TVR1.

But TVR would remain a propaganda instrument in the hands of the newly created [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN), made up mostly of former second-rank Communists. FSN used TVRL, by far the most widely penetrating information source at that time in Romania, to discredit protesters who were demanding a Communist-free government, denigrating them as "fascists". This culminated with the June 1990 riots in central [[Bucharest]], crushed by the miners called in by president [[Ion Iliescu]]. After the riots ended, Iliescu was shown on TV congratulating the miners for "restoring law and order". A little while later, following protests from civil society, TVRL abandoned the "L", the designation "Free" and reverted to its previous name of TVR.

After 1990, lacking any strategy, TVR fell into a deep crisis of identity. TVR changed its identity several times without any particular reason. The crisis intensified after 1996.<br>

On 1 January 1993, TVR, as a part of Radioteleviziunea Româna (RTVR), was admitted as a full active member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]].

In 1995, [[TVRi]] was launched on 1 December, [[Great Union Day]], the national holiday. In 1998, TVR International was renamed "TV Romania International", with a completely different identity.

In 2001, TVR2 changed its identity, logo and presentation for the fourth time. The same year, after three "rebrandings", TVR1 became "TV Romania 1". The new "Romania 1" changed its identity, including the channel logo, three times in only two years.

In 2002, [[TVR Cultural]] was launched.

In 2003, the management started a controversial rebranding (a new identity was created by the British agency, English & Pockett). On 11 June 2004, all channels were renamed "TVR" and received the same identity.

In October 2007, during its prime-time newscast, TVR aired a video showing [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Romania)|Agriculture Minister]] [[Decebal Traian Reme?]] allegedly taking a bribe. In the aftermath, [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[C?lin Popescu-T?riceanu]] criticised TVR for carrying out the minister's "public execution", and a heated debate that showed TVR's weakness in defending its independence ensued. The station's own director called the airing incorrect and illegal because it violated the presumption of innocence, while media organisations and the broadcast regulator defended the legitimacy of the airing, which they said served the public interest. Politicians issued intense attacks against TVR, which reorganised its news department into two divisions. One of its most critical journalists, Rodica Culcer, was placed in charge of supervising both divisions, which actually reduced her decision-making; reassignment has been a typical way through which Romanian governments reduce the power of non-loyal individuals, as more overt measures may have attracted charges of censorship. Other independent journalists were moved to afternoon or night newscasts.<ref>Pippa Norris, ''Public Sentinel: News Media & Governance Reform'', p.269-70. World Bank Publications, 2010. ISBN 0-8213-8200-4.</ref>

In August 2008, TVR acquired the broadcasting rights for the [[UEFA Champions League]] in Romania, for the following three seasons (between the 2009–10 and the 2011–12 season).<ref>http://sport.hotnews.ro/stiri-fotbal-2701681-tvr-transmite-champions-league-pro-ramane-fara-fotbal.htm</ref> From the 2012–13 season, it has the second option for the broadcasting rights.<ref>http://www.realitatea.net/tvr-a-cumparat-meciurile-din-uefa-champions-league-pentru-perioada-2012-2015_1062395.html</ref>

On 1 June 2008, [[TVR HD]] started broadcasting in HD. The [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] and the 2008 Summer Olympics were transmitted in HD.

On 10 October 2008, [[TVR 3]] was launched. This is a channel dedicated to local programming, airing shows and news produced in the various regions of Romania.

On 31 December 2008, [[TVR Info]], a "must-carry" channel for all cable operators, was launched. The channel broadcasts traffic information, live feed from cameras in various cities of Romania and also news.

==Structure==
'''TVR''' has six national TV channels: [[TVR1]], [[TVR2]], [[TVR3]], [[TVR News]], [[TVRi]], and [[TVR HD]]. [[TVRi]] is designed for the [[Romanians]] living outside [[Romania]], the "i" coming from International ("Interna?ional" in the [[Romanian language]]). Due to the financial crisis in which [[TVR]] is immersed, [[TVR Cultural]] and [[TVR Info]] closed in the summer of 2012, however the latter was replaced by [[TVR News]] three months later.

It also has six regional TV channels or "studios" ("studiouri teritoriale"): [[TVR Bucure?ti]], [[TVR Cluj]], [[TVR Craiova]], [[TVR Ia?i]], [[TVR Târgu Mure?]] and [[TVR Timi?oara]].

==Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2006==
Romania hosted on 2 December 2006, the international [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]]. The Romanian broadcaster has been chosen by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU), for being the organizer of the 4th edition of the contest. For the first time, Romania has been the host of such an event and a show produced by TVR broadcast live all over Europe, in the member states of the EBU.

==Funding and accusations==
TVR is funded by direct government subsidies, by a [[television licence]] tax mandatory for all holders of TV sets and also from advertising. This has been deemed unfair competition by the commercial TV stations, which must rely exclusively on revenue from advertisement and cable operators. Proposals have been made to outlaw advertising on public TV channels.

TVR's board is appointed by the government and the parliament. In its post-Communist history, TVR has been almost constantly suspected of submitting to government control and censorship.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

'''Mineral''' is an [[emo]] band originally from [[Houston]], Texas. Soon following their formation they relocated to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. All four members of Mineral were signed to [[Interscope Records]] on individual contracts. After disbanding in 1997, its members worked on numerous other musical projects including [[The Gloria Record]], [[Pop Unknown]], and [[Zookeeper (band)|Zookeeper]].

Mineral's music is characterized by its iterated soft/loud structure, overlaid with melodic vocals and ethereal guitar-based instrumental [[Bridge (music)|bridges]]. Mineral's subtle balance between angst-ridden kinetics and wistful underpinnings, in conjunction with their intelligent lyrics, have heavily influenced many bands of the late 1990's and 2000's.<ref>{{cite web|last=Raymer|first=Miles|title=On Mineral and midwestern emo's second wave|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2013/08/09/on-mineral-and-midwestern-emos-second-wave|publisher=Chicago Reader|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref>

In 2010, a compilation CD of all the band's songs (except for "Sadder Star", from the First Crush comp) was released in Japan, entitled "The Complete Collection".

Mineral announced a reunion tour on April 24, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mineral Reuniting for First Shows in 17 Years|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/54919-mineral-reuniting-for-first-shows-in-17-years/|publisher=Pitchfork}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=StartSerenading...

'''Old Frisian''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] spoken between the 8th and 16th centuries in the area between the [[Rhine]] and [[Weser]] on the European [[North Sea]] coast. The Frisian settlers on the coast of South Jutland (today's Northern Friesland) also spoke Old Frisian but no medieval texts of this area are known. The language of the earlier inhabitants of the region between the [[Zuiderzee]] and Ems River (the [[Frisii|Frisians]] famously mentioned by [[Tacitus]]) is attested in only a few personal names and place-names. Old Frisian evolved into [[Middle Frisian]], spoken from the 16th to the 19th century.

In the early Middle Ages, [[Frisia]] stretched from the area around [[Bruges]], in what is now [[Belgium]], to the [[Weser]] River, in northern [[Germany]]. At the time, the Frisian language was spoken along the entire southern [[North Sea]] coast. This region is referred to as Greater Frisia or Frisia Magna, and many of the areas within it still treasure their Frisian heritage. However by 1300, their territory had been pushed back to the Zuiderzee (now the [[IJsselmeer]]), and the Frisian language survives along the coast only as a substrate.

The people from what are today northern Germany and Denmark who settled in [[England]] from about 400 onwards came from the same regions and spoke more or less the same language as the people who lived in Frisia (as medieval Friesland is usually called to distinguish it from the present-day regions with that name). Hence, a close relationship exists between Old Frisian and [[Old English language|Old English]].

==Phonology==
{{see also|Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law}}

===Early sound developments===
<!-- [[File:Manuscript Thet Oera Linda Bok, pagina 48.jpg|thumb|Page 48 of the manuscript of the [[Oera Linda Book]]. Purports to show how alphabet letters (and runes?) were derived from a basic six-spoked wheel shape...]] -->
[[File:Pagina's codex roorda.jpg|thumb|The {{Ill|fy|Kodeks Roarda}} is a medieval document with [[Latin]] and Old Frisian law texts.]]

Generally, Old Frisian phonologically resembles Old English. In particular, it shares the palatalisation of [[velar consonant]]s also found in Old English. For example, whereas the closely related Old Saxon and Old Dutch retain the velar in ''dag'', Old Frisian has ''dei'' and Old English has ''dæ?'' {{IPA|[dæj]}}. When followed by front vowels the Germanic {{IPA|/k/}} changed to a {{IPA|/t?/}} sound. The Old Frisian for ''church'' was ''tzirke'' or ''tzerke'', in Old English it was ''?iri?e'' {{IPA|[?t?irit?e]}}, while Old Saxon and Old Dutch have the unpalatalised ''kirika''. Another feature shared between the two is Anglo-Frisian brightening, which fronted ''a'' to ''e'' under some circumstances. In unstressed syllables, ''o'' merges into ''a'', and ''i'' into ''e'' as in Old English.

The old Germanic diphthongs *''ai'' and *''au'' become ''?''/''?'' and ''?'', respectively, in Old Frisian, as in ''?n''/''?n'' ("one") from Proto-Germanic *''ainaz'', and ''br?d'' from *''braudaN''. In comparison, these diphthongs become ''?'' and ''?a'' (''?n'' and ''br?ad'') in Old English, and ''?'' and ''?'' (''?n'' and ''br?d'') in Old Saxon. The diphthong *''eu'' generally becomes ''ia'', and Germanic *''iu'' is retained. These diphthongs initially began with a syllabic (stressed) ''i'', but the stress later shifts to the second component, giving to ''i?'' and ''i?''. For example, ''thi?d'' ("people") and ''li?de'' from Proto-Germanic *''þeud?'' and *''liud?z''.

Between vowels, ''h'' generally disappears (''sian'' from *''sehwanaN''), as in Old English and Old Dutch. Word-initial ''h-'' on the other hand is retained. Old Frisian retains ''th'' in all positions for longer than Old Dutch and Old Saxon do, showing the gradual spread of the shift from ''th'' to ''d'' from south to north, beginning in southern Germany in the 9th century as part of the [[High German consonant shift]], but not reaching Frisian until the 13th or 14th century.

==Grammar==
Old Frisian (c. 1150&ndash;c. 1550) retained [[Declension|grammatical cases]]. Some of the texts that are preserved from this period are from the 12th or 13th centuries, but most are from the 14th and 15th centuries. Generally, all these texts are restricted to legal writings. Although the earliest written examples of Frisian—stray words in a Latin context—are from approximately the 9th century, there are a few examples of [[runic]] inscriptions from the region which are older and in a very early form of the Frisian language. These runic writings however usually consist of no more than inscriptions of a single or few words.

==Corpus==
There are some early Frisian names preserved in Latin texts, and some [[runic]] ([[Futhorc]]) inscriptions, but the oldest surviving texts in Old Frisian date from the 13th century, in particular official and legal documents. They show a considerable degree of linguistic uniformity.

'''Antena 1''' ({{IPA-ro|an?tena ?unu}}) is a [[Romania]]n [[television network]], and one of the top three networks in the country with a [[market share]] of about 10%. It covers most of the country and it is owned by [[Dan Voiculescu]], who is the founder president of the [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Conservative Party]].

Antena 1 is currently the second most popular TV channel, after [[ProTV]]. Its main show is [the Observer] or ''Observator'' (main news broadcast at 19:00), and various others [[soap opera]] shows, [[association football|football]] matches and entertainment programs.

Antena 1 promotes itself under the slogan ''Together we are Antena 1'', after dropping the long-running ''Always Close'' slogan which helped relaunch it in 1998. In May 2005, Antena 1 has acquired a specialty brother, the channel [[Antena 3 (Romania)|Antena 3]], a 24/7 news channel fashioned in the spirit of [[CNN]]. In February 2006, [[Antena 4 - Euforia lifestyle TV]] was launched, a channel targeting women viewers. In July 2006, [[Antena 5 - Antena Interna?ional|Antena Interna?ional]], a 24-hour TV channel for Romanians over the borders was launched; it is now broadcasting only in [[USA]] and [[Canada]], but will soon extend its coverage area. In April 2007, [[Antena 2 (Romania)|Antena 2]] has been launched.

The channel is owned by the [[Intact (group of companies)|Intact Media Group]] group. 

The building that houses Antena 1 and Antena 3's headquarters was seized by the state on Friday, the 8th of August 2014, as a result of the judgement sentencing (among others) Dan Voiculescu, the founder of Intact Media Group. The building may be sold in order for the state to recuperate the prejudice brought to it as a result of the fraudulent privatization of the Institute for Alimentary Research in 2003.<ref>http://anticoruptie.hotnews.ro/ancheta-7475495-dosarul-dan-voiculescu.htm</ref>

'''The Dillinger Escape Plan''' is an American [[mathcore]] band from [[Morris Plains, New Jersey]] and currently signed to [[Sumerian Records]]. The group originated in 1997 after the disbanding of Arcane, a [[hardcore punk]] trio consisting of [[Ben Weinman]], [[Dimitri Minakakis]], and [[Chris Pennie]].<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Dillinger-Escape-Plan-Biography/EDEAB9F3FFF02E6348256CEA000DD6C2 Apostolopoulos, Tom.

Retrieved on 2008-03-22</ref>  The band's current line-up consists of guitarists [[Ben Weinman]] and James Love, bassist [[Liam Wilson]], vocalist [[Greg Puciato]], and drummer Billy Rymer. Their band name is derived from bank robber [[John Dillinger]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/13239/The-Dillinger-Escape-Plan |title=The Dillinger Escape Plan |publisher=Fasterlouder.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}</ref>

==History==

===Early years (1997–1998)===
The Dillinger Escape Plan was founded in 1997 and emerged from a [[hardcore punk]] trio named Arcane.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Previous to Arcane, [[Adam Doll]], Craig McKeown, John Fulton, and [[Chris Pennie]] played together in the bands Samsara and Malfactor from 1992–1997. Managed by longtime friend Tom Apostolopoulos and guitarist Ben Weinman, Arcane recorded a self-titled demo under the name The Dillinger Escape Plan, in reference to the early 1930s bank robber [[John Dillinger]], famous for his multiple escapes from jail. Now or Never Records offered to release the demo.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The six-track EP was released in 1997 by Now or Never Records, and set them off on a small club tour around northeast America.  Shortly before their first tour under the new name, guitarist Derek Brantley left the group and was replaced by John Fulton.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

During this time period, The Dillinger Escape Plan gained notoriety in the hardcore punk scene for the intensity of their performances. Their performances were increasingly wild, and often violent. These elaborate performances, as well as the creative, technical approach of their music led a record executive of Relapse Records to offer the band a multi-record contract. The band agreed to the contract, and recorded their second [[extended play|EP]] with Relapse entitled ''[[Under the Running Board]]''. Shortly after its release, Fulton left the band over creative differences.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

===''Calculating Infinity'' (1999–2001)===
The three-song EP release served to bolster anticipation for their 1999 full-length release, ''[[Calculating Infinity]]''. Before the recording of ''Calculating Infinity'', bassist Adam Doll was involved in a car accident that left him paralyzed from the chest down.<ref name="interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/6841/tempidx/5/menuid/3 |title=Donnelly, Justin. Blistering.com Feature – Interview with The Dillinger Escape Plan |publisher=Blistering.com |date=November 22, 2007 |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref> The accident was a minor [[fender bender]], but because Doll had leaned over to pick up a CD beneath the stereo, the accident caused a small fracture in his spine, inducing paralysis. Guitarist Weinman played both guitar and bass on the album, though liner notes credited Doll as providing a great deal of help.

Shortly before touring began for the new album, former Jesuit guitarist Brian Benoit auditioned for the band, taking the place of the departed John Fulton; Jeff Wood, former [[M.O.D.]] bassist, took the place of the injured Adam Doll. ''Calculating Infinity'' was met with great acclaim from both underground and mainstream press, even drawing the attention of [[Faith No More]] vocalist [[Mike Patton]], who asked Dillinger Escape Plan to tour with his band [[Mr. Bungle]]. Over time, their notoriously intense shows grew more so, incorporating samples, a [[Stage lighting|light show]], [[fireworks]], [[fire breathing]], and other antics.

After several months of touring, including appearances on the [[Warped Tour]] and March Metal Meltdown, the band and Wood parted ways, with Wood moving on to his own project, Shat. [[Liam Wilson]], took his place. In 2000, Now or Never Records re-released the band's [[The Dillinger Escape Plan (album)|self-titled album]] with added bonus tracks. Later that same year, the band parted ways with Minakakis.  Minakakis credited his departure from the band to the rigorous touring schedule. The band remains in contact with him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/features/interviews/dillinger_escape_plan2.aspx |title=Dillinger Escape Plan interview // Interviews // Features // Lambgoat |publisher=Lambgoat.com |date= |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref>

===''Irony Is a Dead Scene'' EP (2002–2003)===
Without a vocalist, The Dillinger Escape Plan began a nationwide search for a replacement via their website, releasing an instrumental version of "43 % Burnt" from ''Calculating Infinity'' and inviting prospective vocalists to record and submit their own vocal tracks.

While the search was underway, vocal duties were handled by a number of the band's friends, including Sean Ingram of [[Coalesce (band)|Coalesce]] and [[Mike Patton]], who agreed to help the band produce an [[extended play|EP]].  The plan to record with Patton was in place before a replacement vocalist had been found. By the time Mike Patton had recorded vocals and the EP was released, the band had been touring with Minakakis's replacement, Greg Puciato, for nearly a year.

The group released their first EP via [[Epitaph Records]], titled ''[[Irony Is a Dead Scene]]''.<ref>[http://www.musicemissions.com/artists/albums/index.php?album_id=1899 "The Dillinger Escape Plan – Irony is a Dead Scene", ''Review'']. Retrieved on 2008-03-22</ref> It features Weinman, Pennie, Benoit, Wilson, and Mike Patton on vocals, with ex-bassist [[Adam Doll]] assisting with keyboards and sample effects. It marked Doll's last appearance with the band, until he returned to contribute briefly towards ''[[Option Paralysis]]''. The EP contains three original songs and a cover of [[electronic music]] artist [[Aphex Twin]]'s "[[Come to Daddy]]". [[Buddyhead Records]] released the EP in a limited vinyl version.

===''Miss Machine'' (2004–2005)===
[[File:The Dillinger Escape Plans Greg Puciato.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Greg Puciato]] and [[Liam Wilson]] in 2005.]]
In late 2001, Dillinger Escape Plan met [[Greg Puciato]], one of many would-be vocalists who had submitted a recording to the band. Puciato included both a faithful version of "43 % Burnt" (in the style of ''Calculating Infinity'') and the same song with his own personal spin. The band offered him the job after two practice sessions. He accepted, first appearing at the 2001 CMJ Music Festival in New York City. Soon after, Puciato and the band recorded two songs for a [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] tribute compilation. In 2003, the band appeared on the soundtrack for ''[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]'' with the song "Baby's First Coffin", their first original song with [[Greg Puciato]] on vocals. They also recorded a cover of "My Michelle" for the [[Guns N' Roses]] tribute album ''Bring You to Your Knees'', released on March 23, 2004.

In 2002 The Dillinger Escape Plan made national United Kingdom headlines when, at the prestigious [[Reading Festival]], Puciato defecated in full view onstage, put it into a bag, and threw it into the crowd before smearing the rest onto himself, proclaiming "This is a bag of shit, I just wanted to show you this so you'll recognize it later on throughout the day", in reference to the quality of music he felt was appearing that day of the festival. The band's set was one of the highest reviewed of the entire festival that year, and was later included in a list of the top one hundred Reading or Leeds performances of the decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strictlyrandl.com/features/the-top-100-reading-bands-of-the-2000s-no-96-dillinger-escape-plan/ |title=The Top 100 Reading Bands Of The 2000s No.96: Dillinger Escape Plan &#124; Reading and Leeds Festival |publisher=Strictlyrandl.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}</ref>

On July 20, 2004, [[Relapse Records]] released the band's first full-length album with Puciato, entitled ''[[Miss Machine]]''. ''Miss Machine'' sold 12,000 copies its first week, becoming their largest selling release. The album polarized The Dillinger Escape Plan audience; some fans were critical of the band's increasing artistic and musical departures from their earlier efforts, while others preferred them.

Following the controversial release, The Dillinger Escape Plan began a two-year touring cycle, headlining tours of their own or occasionally providing support for acts such as [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[System of a Down]], and [[Megadeth]]. These tours were replete with injuries; in late 2004, guitarist Benoit suffered nerve damage ([[brachial plexus]] [[neuritis]]) in his left hand, and other than a short return to the stage in 2005, he has not played with the band since.<ref>[http://www.decoymusic.com/vb/showthread.php?t=24255 "Brian Benoit Retires from Dillinger Escape Plan." ''News''.] Retrieved 2008-03-22.</ref> Former [[Fenix*TX]] guitarist [[Fenix Tx#Lechuza and breakup|James Love]] ended up playing most shows in the late 2004–2006 period. In 2005, the band was forced to drop out of [[Dave Mustaine]]'s "[[Gigantour]]" slightly early due to a [[rotator cuff]] injury and fractured vertebrae Weinman had sustained performing in Anaheim, CA at the famous Chain Reaction.

===''Plagiarism'' (2006)===
In June 2006 the band released an iTunes exclusive EP of cover songs entitled ''[[Plagiarism (EP)|Plagiarism]]''. The title is a reference to the fact that four of the EP's six tracks are covers faithful to the original songs.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} They also released their first DVD, a short accompanying piece to Miss Machine (entitled ''Miss Machine: The DVD''). Guitarist James Love played in the band during the recording of their ''Plagiarism'' EP. Dillinger toured supporting [[AFI (band)|AFI]] and [[Coheed and Cambria]] in the summer of 2006.

Four shows before the end of the Coheed tour, Weinman flew home for undisclosed personal reasons. In an interview, Greg Puciato announced that actual reasons for Weinman flying home was because of the growing tension between him and Chris Pennie. The night of August 4, the group played their first show as a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gWO4dA8vLU four-piece] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]] at the Murat Theatre Egyptian Room. It was previously announced during an interview on the Jekyll and Hyde show in November 2007, during the Coheed tour, Weinman had briefly quit the band in order to recover from compounding medical and financial problems.<ref>[http://pod.icast.co.il/396c64c3-43e6-4487-b8dd-fe0615cd49e5.icast.mp3 "Dillinger Escape Plan on the Jekyll and Hyde Show 106FM Jerusalem"] Retrieved on Nov. 17 2009</ref>

During the time Weinman was apart from the band, [[Chris Pennie]] received an offer from [[Coheed and Cambria]] to be the band's permanent drummer when their former drummer left the band.  Coheed had been impressed with Pennie after seeing him live, and Pennie accepted the offer. Pennie left the band right before the recording of ''[[Ire Works]]''.<ref>[http://www.punkbands.com/news/11919/ "Drummer Leaves DEP – Joins Coheed and Cambria?", ''News'']. Retrieved on 2008-03-22</ref>

===''Ire Works'' (2007–2009)===
[[File:Dillinger Escape Plan Eindhoven.png|thumb|right|The Dillinger Escape Plan performing live in 2005.]]
The Dillinger Escape Plan completed their follow-up album to Miss Machine in 2007, entitled ''[[Ire Works]]'', produced by [[Steve Evetts]] at his studio ''Omen Room'' in Los Angeles. Drums were recorded at Sonikwire Studios in Irvine, California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shop.relapse.com/content/news.aspx?NewsItemID=524 |title=THE DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN: BEGIN WORK ON NEW ALBUM – News from Relapse Records / Release Entertainment |date= |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref> On June 15, the band announced the title of the album as well as confirming the departure of Chris Pennie (who became the drummer of [[Coheed and Cambria]]<ref>[http://www.coheedandcambria.com/index2 ]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>). [[Gil Sharone]] of [[Stolen Babies]] handled drum duties for the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alarmpress.com/650/music-news/the-dillinger-escape-plan-give-glimpses-of-ire-works/ |title=The Dillinger Escape Plan Show Flashes of Ire Works : ALARM Magazine – Music & Art Beyond Comparison |publisher=Alarmpress.com |date=July 6, 2007 |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref>  ''Ire Works'' was released on November 13, 2007.
The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 142 with 7,000 copies scanned, but was later corrected when it was revealed that Relapse somehow forgot to scan the pre-release album sales, which made the first week total actually around 11,000.

Missing from the new line up was guitarist Brian Benoit, who had left the band because of injury. Although assured his place in the band is secure should he ever be able to perform again,<ref>[http://shop.relapse.com/artist/artist.aspx?ArtistID=10030 Dillinger Escape Plan, The – Official Relapse Records Band Page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Jeff Tuttle]] (formerly of Heads Will Roll and Capture the Flag) has taken his place on stage.

''Ire Works'' has been a critical and commercial success, with the album being on many critics' top ten lists, making it the band's most critically successful album.  Allmusic said that "DEP should be careful, or they'll end up the [[Radiohead]] of metalcore." On February 6, 2008, the band had two songs from ''Ire Works'' broadcast on two [[television program]]s in the United States. The song "Milk Lizard" was featured on the ''[[CSI: NY]]'' episode "Playing With Matches",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/csi-ny/playing-with-matches/episode/1150663/summary.html |title=Playing with Matches |work=TV.com |accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref> and the band performed live the song "Black Bubblegum" on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Dillinger Escape Plan on NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=90226 |newspaper=Blabbermouth.net |date=February 7, 2008 |accessdate=April 29, 2010}}</ref> In January 2009 Gil Sharone left the band. Billy Rymer was then confirmed to be the band's new drummer.

The Dillinger Escape Plan played in Australia, where they joined [[Nine Inch Nails]] onstage during the Soundwave 2009 festival, helping them perform the songs "[[Wish (Nine Inch Nails song)|Wish]]" and "[[Mr. Self Destruct]]" as part of the last encore song of Nine Inch Nails' live show at the event.

===''Option Paralysis'' and ''One of Us is the Killer'' (2009–present)===
On May 27, 2009, it was reported by Benjamin Weinman that the band started their own label, Party Smasher Inc., which is a collaboration with French record label [[Season of Mist]]. After having fulfilled their contract with Relapse, The Dillinger Escape Plan released their fourth studio album in March 2010 through Party Smasher Inc and recorded by Steve Evetts.<ref name="seasonofmist">{{cite web | url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=120839| title = THE DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN Signs With SEASON OF MIST| work = [[Blabbermouth]]| date=May 27, 2009}}</ref> ''[[Option Paralysis]]'' was confirmed as the title of the new album in a press release by Season of Mist. Puciato has noted that ''Option Paralysis'' was the toughest album the group and himself have ever written. In an interview in [[The Aquarian]], Weinman stated that "it was the most organic and less forced than previous works."<ref>[http://www.theaquarian.com/2010/03/03/interview-with-ben-weinman-of-dillinger-escape-plan-more-than-they-were-destined-for/ Slevin, Patrick] March 2010</ref>

The Dillinger Escape Plan started the ''Option Paralysis'' touring cycle with a short North American tour with [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]] in December 2009, followed by a headlining run in Feb/March 2010 with [[Darkest Hour (band)|Darkest Hour]], [[Animals as Leaders]], and [[Iwrestledabearonce]].

The group also played its first shows in Malaysia and Bangkok, as well as their first South American performance, headlining the second stage on the first night of the prestigious [[Rock al Parque]] festival in Bogota, Colombia. On August 17, 2012, the band announced via their Facebook page that Jeff Tuttle had left the band to pursue other projects in music and film.<ref name="loudwire">{{cite web | url = http://loudwire.com/guitarist-jeff-tuttle-leaves-dillinger-escape-plan/| title = Guitarist Jeff Tuttle Leaves Dillinger Escape Plan| work = [[Loudwire]]| date = August 17, 2012}}</ref>

On November 21 the band uploaded a video indicating the new album would be released in Spring 2013, and also used the video to announce they signed with [[Sumerian Records]] to release the forthcoming album.<ref>?http://www.theprp.com/2012/11/21/news/the-dillinger-escape-plan-sign-with-sumerian-records/</ref>

On November 24, the band played at the California Metalfest show alongside bands such as [[Killswitch Engage]] and [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]]. While playing this show, a mystery guitar player was noticed filling in for former rhythm guitarist Jeff Tuttle, who had left the band in August. A couple of weeks later, during a phone interview (on the Metal Injection Livecast) while in the studio recording their new album, Weinman announced that this mystery guitar player was James Love, who had played with the band briefly while they toured in support for their album Miss Machine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/the-dillinger-escape-plan-might-have-a-new-guitarist |title=THE DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN Might Have A New Guitarist - Metal Injection &#124; Latest News |publisher=Metal Injection |date=2012-12-04 |accessdate=2013-10-16}}</ref>

On February 18, 2013, the band announced the title of their new album, ''[[One of Us Is the Killer]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Axl |url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2013/02/18/one-member-of-the-dillinger-escape-plan-is-a-killer/ |title=One Member of The Dillinger Escape Plan is a Killer |publisher=MetalSucks |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}</ref> which was released on May 14 of the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/the-dillinger-escape-plan-album-preview-one-of-us-is-the-killer/ |title=The Dillinger Escape Plan Unleash Album Preview for ‘One of Us Is the Killer’ |publisher=Loudwire.com |date=2013-04-01 |accessdate=2013-10-16}}</ref> On March 12, they released the first single from the album. "Prancer" is now available for purchase on iTunes Store, Amazon MP3, and other internet sources. Also, a 6-minute album teaser has been uploaded to YouTube. April 23, The Dillinger Escape Plan released the first music video from ''One of Us Is the Killer''. The video for track number two, "When I Lost My Bet" was directed by [[Mitch Massie]] and was posted on the band's Facebook page and [[Sumerian Records]]'s YouTube account.

On July 14, 2014, it was announced that the band would be playing for two weeks as the opening slot on the Nine Inch Nails and [[Soundgarden]] North American tour. This decision was made following the disbandment of [[Death Grips]], who were originally chosen as the opening act.<ref>{{cite web| title = New and old friends joining us this summer| work = [[Facebook]]| date = July 14, 2014| url = https://www.facebook.com/ninofficial/photos/a.10150097171211221.314441.19787971220/10152557021976221/?type=1| accessdate = July 14, 2014}}</ref>

'''Édith Cresson''' ({{IPA-fr|edit k??s??}}; born '''Édith Campion'''; 27 January 1934) is a [[Politics of France|French politician]]. She was the first and so far only woman to have held the office of [[Prime Minister of France]].

== French Prime Minister ==
Cresson was appointed to the prime ministerial post by President [[François Mitterrand]] on 15 May 1991. She soon became strongly unpopular among the electorate and had to leave office after less than one year, following the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialists]]' poor showing in 1992's regional elections. She has so far spent the shortest time in office for any French Prime Minister of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]].
Her strong criticism of Japanese trade practices, going so far as to compare the Japanese to "yellow ants trying to take over the world", has led some to consider her also to be a racist.<ref>News Week Japanese Edition, 30 May 1991</ref><ref>The Mainichi Daily News, 21 June 1991</ref><ref name="articles.latimes.com">Rone Tempest, [[Los Angeles Times]], 23. Juli 1991: [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-07-23/news/wr-223_1_puppet-show Edith Cresson's Answer to TV Spoof: Hush Puppet! France's brutally frank premier says her caricature on one of the nation's most popular shows is sexist, unfair] (englisch)</ref>
She also said, talking about the sexual proclivities of Anglo-Saxon males, " Homosexuality seems strange to me. It's different and marginal. It exists more in the Anglo-Saxon tradition than the Latin one."<ref name="articles.latimes.com"/>

In social policy, Cresson's government enacted the Urban Framework Act of 1991,<ref>http://www.eugris.info/Policy.asp?Ca=1&Co=21&Cy=3&Gy=128&Title=Mega-sites&e=201&en=&s=None</ref> which sought to ensure a “right to the city” for all citizens. The
Act required “local bodies to provide living and dwelling conditions which will foster social cohesion and enable conditions of segregation to be avoided.”<ref>http://www.oecd.org/gov/publicsectorinnovationande-government/2537279.pdf</ref> The Cresson Government also placed considerable emphasis during its time in office on facilitating the international competitiveness of firms with under 500 employees.<ref>https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:S3-AN7BXIlMJ:spe.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/spe/article/download/11467/8355+michel+rocard+continuing+education+voucher&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESjoPlqlNEJeAhVYWRAVI-R4XRBH-xXj54nqWYGW-q4PN98e1fRs5CU9VlZdSz-UJPLNrq54Jd7W9OeKg4AKPsEHC8F_gM2qkjcyOst4EmJ28euCvYwF_061ttxaUvfKZ5WiHzIh&sig=AHIEtbRdm2F203rHDAtukY9VfYw7Saejqg</ref> A law was passed in July 1991 which included several measures aimed at improving access of people with disabilities to housing, work places, and public buildings.<ref>http://www.ideanet.org/content.cfm?id=5B5D75</ref>

Cresson is a member of the [[Council of Women World Leaders]], an International network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.

==European Commissioner==
While a [[European Commissioner]], Cresson was the main target in the fraud allegations that led to the [[Santer Commission#Resignation|resignation of the Santer Commission]] in 1999. Subsequent to a fraud inquiry the European Commission said that Cresson in her capacity as the Research Commissioner "failed to act in response to known, serious and continuing irregularities over several years". Cresson was found guilty of not reporting failures in a youth training programme from which vast sums went missing.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/255053.stm Europe Cresson: The 'careless' commissioner], ''[[BBC News]]'', 16 March 1999</ref>

===Appointing a friend===
When Cresson took up her functions, she intended to appoint dental surgeon Philippe Berthelot, one of her close acquaintances, as a "personal advisor". Because Berthelot was 66 years old, he could not be appointed as a member of a Commissioner’s Cabinet. When Cresson took up office, her Cabinet was already fully staffed with personal advisors. Berthelot was instead engaged as a "visiting scientist" in September 1995.<ref name=Europa>[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=CJE/06/56&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en The Court declares that Mrs Edith Cresson acted in breach of her obligations as a European commissioner], 11 July 2006</ref>

Berthelot worked only as a personal advisor to Cresson. His contract expired on 1 March 1997, and he was offered another visiting scientist’s contract for a period of one year. EU rules specify a maximum duration of 24 months for visiting scientists, but Berthelot spent two and a half years in the position.<ref name=Europa />

On 31 December 1997, Berthelot requested the termination of his contract on medical grounds, and his application was accepted. A complaint was made by a Member of Parliament, and a criminal investigation concerning Berthelot was opened in Belgium in 1999. In June 2004, the Chambre du conseil of the Tribunal de première instance de Bruxelles (Court of First Instance, Brussels) decided that no further action should be taken in the case.<ref name=Europa />

=== ''European Commission vs. Édith Cresson'' ===
On 11 July 2006, in a judgment by the [[European Court of Justice]] on Case C-432/04 (''Commission of the European Communities'' versus ''Édith Cresson''), the Court declared that Édith Cresson acted in breach of her obligations as a European Commissioner. While the breach of the obligations arising from the office of Member of the Commission calls, in principle, for the imposition of a penalty, the Court held that, having regard to the circumstances of the case, the finding of breach constituted, of itself, an appropriate penalty and, accordingly, decided not to impose on Cresson a penalty in the form of a deprivation of her right to a pension or other benefits.

Cresson claimed that where the conduct complained of in criminal and disciplinary proceedings was the same, the findings of the criminal court were binding on the disciplinary authorities. However, the Court held that it was not bound by the legal characterisation of facts made in the context of the criminal proceedings and that it was for the Court, exercising its discretion to the full, to investigate whether the conduct complained of in proceedings brought under Article 213(2) EC constituted a breach of the obligations arising from the office of Commissioner. Accordingly, the decision of the ''Chambre du conseil of the Tribunal de première instance de Bruxelles'' that there was no evidence of criminal conduct on Cresson’s part could not bind the Court.

In [[physiology]], '''water of the body''' is the [[water]] content of an [[animal body]], contained in the tissues, the blood, the bones, or elsewhere. Body water makes up a significant fraction of the [[human body]], both by weight and by volume.

==In animals== <!--Anchor for redirect of [Animal body water] article; caution. -->
The usual way of adding water to a body is by [[drinking]].  In addition, water enters the body with foods, especially those rich in water, such as plants, [[raw meat]], and fish.  The amount of this water that is retained in animals is affected by several factors.  For instance, animal body water amounts vary with the age of the animal. The older the [[vertebrate]] animal, the higher its relative bone mass and the lower its body water content.  Water in the animal body performs a number of functions: as a solvent for transportation of nutrients; as a medium for [[excretion]]; a means for heat control; as a lubricant for joints; and for shock absorption.<ref name=aniprod>[http://books.google.com/books?id=0UPDQQOgr5YC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=%22animal+body+water%22&source=bl&ots=lgiH5WdhyJ&sig=g3oAL6_TNDK2vyWL20J2r9SIAa4&hl=en&ei=81veTuPLIKqmiQLWpbjsCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22animal%20body%20water%22&f=false]</ref>

Most of animal body water is contained in various [[body fluid]]s.  These include [[Intracellular fluid]]; [[Extracellular fluid]]; [[Blood plasma|Plasma]]; [[Interstitial fluid]]; and [[Transcellular fluid]].<ref name="John T. Hansen, Bruce M. Koeppen, 2002">{{cite book |author=John T. Hansen, Bruce M. Koeppen, |title=Netter's Atlas of Human Physiology |publisher=Icon Learning Systems |location=Teterboro, N.J |year=2002 |isbn=1-929007-01-9}}</ref>  Water is also contained inside organs, in [[gastrointestinal fluid|gastrointestinal]], [[cerebrospinal fluid|cerebrospinal]], [[peritoneal fluid|peritoneal]], and [[ocular fluid|ocular]] fluids.  [[Adipose tissue]] contains about 10% of water, while [[muscle tissue]] contains about 75%.<ref name=aniprod/><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=FcA6zIq0d48C&pg=PT365&dq=%22animal+body+water%22&hl=en&ei=uPTeTseqGqjfiAK6nfG3Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22animal%20body%20water%22&f=false]</ref>

==In humans==
By weight, the average human adult male is approximately 65% water.<ref name=Jackson1979>{{cite book | title=Anatomy & Physiology for Nurses |last=Jackson| first=Sheila| year=1985| edition=9th| series=Nurses' Aids Series| publisher=Bailliere Tindall| location=London| isbn=0-7020-0737-4}}</ref><ref name=textbookofmedicalphysiology5thed>{{cite book |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology | last=Guyton |first=Arthur C. |year=1976| edition=5th| publisher=W.B.

Saunders| location=Philadelphia| page= 274| isbn=0-7216-3994-1}}</ref> However, there can be considerable variation in body water percentage based on a number of factors like age, health, weight, and gender. In a large study of adults of all ages and both sexes, the adult human body averaged ~65% water. However, this varied substantially by age, sex, and adiposity (amount of fat in [[body composition]]). The figure for water fraction by weight in this sample was found to be 48 ±6% for females and 58 ±8% water for males.<ref>See table 1. [http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/33/1/27.full.pdf here]</ref>

The body water constitutes as much as 75% of the body weight of a newborn infant, whereas some obese people are as little as 45% water by weight.<ref name=textbookofmedicalphysiology5thed>{{cite book |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |last=Guyton |first=Arthur C. |year=1976|edition=5th|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|page= 424|isbn=0-7216-4393-0}}</ref><ref name=textbookofmedicalphysiology8thedp274>{{cite book | title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |last=Guyton |first=Arthur C.| year=1991| edition=8th|publisher=W.B. Saunders| location=Philadelphia| page= 274| isbn=0-7216-3994-1}}</ref> These figures are statistical averages, and so like all [[biostatistics]], the estimation of body water will vary with factors such as type of population, age of people sampled, number of people sampled, and methodology. So there is not, and cannot be, a figure that is exactly the same for all people, for this or any other physiological measure.

==Compartmentalization==
In diseased states, where body water is affected, the compartment or compartments that have changed can give clues to the nature of the problem. Body water is regulated by [[hormone]]s, including [[anti-diuretic hormone]] (ADH), [[aldosterone]] and [[atrial natriuretic peptide]].

In ''Netter's Atlas of Human Physiology'', body water is broken down into the following ''compartments:''<ref name="John T. Hansen, Bruce M. Koeppen, 2002"/>
* [[Intracellular fluid]] (2/3 of body water). Per Guyton, in a body containing 40 litres of fluid, about 25 litres is intracellular,<ref name=textbookofmedicalphysiology8thedp275>Guyton, Arthur C. (1991) p. 275</ref> which amounts to 62.5% (5/8), close enough to the 2/3 rule of thumb. Jackson's texts states 70% of body fluid is intracellular.<ref name=Jackson1979 />
* [[Extracellular fluid]] (1/3 of body water). Per Guyton's illustration, for a 40 litre body, about 15 litres is extracellular,<ref name=textbookofmedicalphysiology8thedp275 /> which amounts to 37.5% Again, this is close to the 1/3 rule of thumb cited here.
** [[Blood plasma|Plasma]] (1/5 of extracellular fluid). Per Guyton's illustration, of the 15 litres of extracellular fluid, plasma volume averages 3 litres.<ref name=textbookofmedicalphysiology8thedp275 /> This amounts to 20%, the same as per ''Netter's Atlas''.
** [[Interstitial fluid]] (4/5 of extracellular fluid)
** [[Transcellular fluid]] (a.k.a. "third space," normally ignored in calculations)
*** Contained inside organs, such as the [[gastrointestinal]], [[cerebrospinal fluid|cerebrospinal]], peritoneal, and [[Human eye|ocular]] fluids.

==Measurement==

===Dilution and equilibration===
Total body water can be determined using [[Flowing afterglow mass spectrometry]] measurement of [[deuterium]] abundance in breath samples from individuals.  A known dose of deuterated water ([[Heavy water]], D<sub>2</sub>O) is ingested and allowed to equilibrate within the body water. The FA-MS instrument then measures the deuterium-to-hydrogen (D:H) ratio in the exhaled breath water vapour.  The total body water is then accurately measured from the increase in breath deuterium content in relation to the volume of D<sub>2</sub>O ingested.

Different substances can be used to measure different fluid compartments:<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch02/7ch02p13}}</ref>
* total body water: [[tritiated water]] or [[heavy water]].
* [[extracellular fluid]]: [[inulin]]
* [[blood plasma]]: [[Evans blue]]

[[Intracellular fluid]] may then be estimated by subtracting extracellular fluid from total body water.

===Bioelectrical impedance analysis===
Another method of determining total body water percentage (TBW%) is via [[Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis]] (BIA). In the traditional BIA method, a person lies on a cot and spot electrodes are placed on the hands and bare feet. Electrolyte gel is applied first, and then a weak current of frequency 50&nbsp;kHz is introduced. This AC waveform allows the creation of a current inside the body via the very capacitive skin without causing a DC flow or burns, and limited in the ~20mA range current for safety.<ref name="US Patent 4719922">[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4719922/description.html US Patent 4719922, Stimulator Apparatus]</ref>

BIA has emerged as a promising technique because of its simplicity, low cost, high reproducibility and noninvasiveness. BIA prediction equations can be either generalized or population-specific, allowing this method to be potentially very accurate. Selecting the appropriate equation is important to determining the quality of the results.

For clinical purposes, scientists are developing a multi-frequency BIA method that may further improve the method's ability to predict a person's hydration level. New segmental BIA equipment that uses more electrodes may lead to more precise measurements of specific parts of the body.

==Fluid loss==
{{Main|Volume contraction|Dehydration}}
[[Volume contraction]] is a decrease in [[body fluid]] volume, with or without a concomitant loss of [[osmolyte]]s. The loss of the body water component of body fluid is specifically termed [[dehydration]].<ref>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2933 MedicineNet > Definition of Dehydration] Retrieved on July 2, 2009</ref>

Na<sup>+</sup> loss approximately correlates with fluid loss from [[extracellular fluid]] (ECF), since Na<sup>+</sup> has a much higher concentration in ECF than [[intracellular fluid]] (ICF). In contrast, K<sup>+</sup> has a much higher concentration in ICF than ECF, and therefore its loss rather correlates with fluid loss from ICF, since K<sup>+</sup> loss from ECF causes the K<sup>+</sup> in ICF to diffuse out of the cells, dragging water with it by [[osmosis]].

'''Cryptopsy''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[technical death metal]] band from [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], formed in 1988. The band has sold over 300,000 records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flomounier.com/en_bio.html |title=Extreme Metal Drumming |publisher=Flo Mounier |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}</ref>
{{TOC limit}}

==History==
===Necrosis (1988–1992)===
Cryptopsy was formed in 1988 by [[drummer]] Mike Atkin, [[guitarist]] Steve Thibault and [[vocalist]] Dan Greening (who would later take the name "Lord Worm" because he would dig up and ingest worms on stage) under the name "Necrosis". John Todds later joined on [[Bass guitar|bass]]. The band released several demos, including ''Mastication and Heterodontism'' (1989), ''Realms Of Pathogenia'' (1991) and ''Necrosis'' (1992). The band made their first live appearance in 1992, and changed their name to "Cryptopsy" the same year. 

Atkin, whose musical direction was heading in a more [[thrash metal|thrash]]/[[speed metal]] vein, left the band and was replaced by Flo Mounier (introduced to the band by Todds), whose "high speed and hard hitting drumming" style would mark the beginning of the Cryptopsy sound. Todds left Necrosis shortly thereafter and retired from music to focus on his family. Guitarist Dave Galea also joined the band.

===''Blasphemy Made Flesh'' (1993–1995)===
Cryptopsy recruited Kevin Weagle to play bass, and in 1993 released their debut demo, ''[[Ungentle Exhumation]]''. This demo caught the attention of local label [[Gore Records]]. Gore Records would proceed to re-release the demo and would, for a brief period, manage the band as well. Cryptopsy's first demo release earned them some attention in the Canadian death metal [[underground music|underground]], as well as from the [[Germany|German]] label [[Invasion Records]].

By 1994, bassist Kevin Weagle had been replaced by Martin Fergusson, and Dave Galea left and was replaced by lead guitarist Jon Levasseur. This line-up recorded their debut album, ''[[Blasphemy Made Flesh]]'', which at first was independently released in 1994 and later licensed to Invasion Records. The album gained them a wide following in the Canadian underground.

Despite recent recognition, difficulties ensued with their label Invasion Records. Invasion was collapsing because of financial problems and as a result Cryptopsy was now without a label to support their tour and album activities. Despite setback, the album would later come in the possession of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] label [[Displeased Records]]. After successful touring in support of ''Blasphemy Made Flesh'', guitarist Steve Thibault left the band but remained manager for a few months. Bassist Martin Fergusson was replaced by [[Eric Langlois]]. The addition of Langlois incorporated [[funk|funk-style]] bass slaps into the Cryptopsy sound.

===''None So Vile'' (1996–1997)===
In 1996, the line-up of Lord Worm, Flo Mounier, Jon Levasseur, and Eric Langlois released the album ''[[None So Vile]]'' on the [[Sweden|Swedish]] label [[Wrong Again Records]]. This album took the extreme and technical elements further and is now considered a benchmark of [[technical death metal]]. By this time, Levasseur was a very prominent songwriter in the band. His guitar leads consisted of very fast yet complex shreds, which were usually played in short bursts. Although Levasseur handled all the guitar parts on the album, the band would add Miguel Roy as a second touring guitarist.

After the tour in support of ''None So Vile'', Lord Worm departed the band, focusing his career as an [[English studies|English]] teacher. The band had reached some musical differences as well, as the rest of the band wanted to evolve and expand more, and Lord Worm expressed a dislike for the experimental path that Cryptopsy's music was then taking{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}.

In early 1997, new vocalist Mike DiSalvo joined the band. He was from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and had the personal approval by Lord Worm to be the new vocalist. Mike DiSalvo also had a different vocal style from Lord Worm: a less extreme and more [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] sounding voice. In July 1997, Cryptopsy’s appearance at the Milwaukee Metalfest XI gained the attention of many American metalheads as well as the label [[Century Media]].

===''Whisper Supremacy'' (1998–1999)===
Cryptopsy's next album, ''[[Whisper Supremacy]]'', was released on Century Media in 1998, and featured Miguel Roy on second guitar. It took Cryptopsy's style further, incorporating some [[jazz]] and [[jazz-fusion|fusion]] elements. Some fans criticised Mike DiSalvo's vocal style, citing that it was too similar to that of hardcore vocalists and preferred the more extreme death metal style of Lord Worm, whereas others welcomed the more intelligible lyrics and vocal presence of DiSalvo{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. The tour in support of ''[[Whisper Supremacy]]'' also took the band on their first tour through the [[United States]], increasing their fan-base significantly.

===''…And Then You'll Beg'' (2000–2001)===
Cryptopsy released their fourth studio effort, ''[[…And Then You'll Beg]]'', in 2000. The album featured a new guitarist, [[Alex Auburn]], who replaced Miguel Roy. ''And Then You'll Beg'' was viewed as being less extreme than Cryptopsy's previous albums. The album also incorporated even more progressive elements and was still considered to be very technical and experimental. After the first portion of the supporting tour, Mike DiSalvo departed from the band to pursue a family life with his girlfriend in Montreal and with a daughter on the way{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}.

In 2001, [[Montreal|Montreal–area]] Cryptopsy fan Martin LaCroix took over the position as Cryptopsy's singer for the [[Europe]] and [[Japan]] tours. His style was viewed by many fans as being in between the styles of Lord Worm and Mike DiSalvo, making him a convenient choice to front the band.

===''None So Live'' (2002–2004)===
In June 2001, Cryptopsy played their first concert in their hometown of Montreal in four years and attracted an audience of more than 2,000. The concert was recorded and released as a live album, ''[[None So Live]]'', in May 2003. This release was LaCroix's only contribution to Cryptopsy's discography. The band soon realised that the French-speaking LaCroix was not fluent enough in English, which prevented him from writing lyrics on par with his predecessors.

Later in 2003, it was announced that Lord Worm, Cryptopsy's original vocalist, had rejoined the band. Throughout summer 2004, Cryptopsy played shows in the [[Montreal]] area, and continued a full [[Canada]] tour in September, with former guitarist Miguel Roy filling in for the unavailable Jon Levasseur. Beginning on October 9, Martyr and former [[Gorguts]] guitarist [[Dan Mongrain]] took over second guitar duties for the live dates. The setlist for this tour began the entire ''None So Vile'' album played straight through, and then followed by songs from ''Blasphemy Made Flesh'' and ''Whisper Supremacy''. The Canada 2004 tour ended at Cryptopsy's performance on November 6 at the [[Trois-Rivières, Quebec|Trois-Rivieres]] ''Metalfest IV'', which was filmed for a live [[DVD]]. The DVD [[Live at Trois-Rivieres Metalfest IV]] was released in 2005.

===''Once Was Not'' (2005–2006)===
On January 31, 2005, Jon Levasseur announced that he had lost interest in extreme music and amicably departed Cryptopsy. Dan Mongrain remained on guitar duties for the ''Back to the Worms'' tour through the United States from February to May. After the tour's completion Mongrain also departed in order to continue his work with [[Martyr (band)|Martyr]]. It was then announced that Cryptopsy's next album, ''[[Once Was Not]]'', would be released on October 18, 2005. The album features original vocalist Lord Worm, Flo Mounier, Eric Langlois, and Alex Auburn handling all guitar duties except the intro track "Luminum". On September 28 it was announced that the new touring guitarist would be Christian Donaldson of [[Mythosis]]. The band toured North America with [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]], [[Despised Icon]], and [[Aborted]]. Advanced copies of the new album were available at the shows. After a break, and the release of Flo Mounier's instructional drumming DVD ''[[Extreme Metal Drumming 101]]'', the band toured Europe with [[Grave (band)|Grave]], [[Aborted]], [[Dew-Scented]], and others, followed by tours in America and Australia.  Following their second tour of Europe, UK, and Scandinavia; guitarist Christian Donalson was hired as a permanent member of the band.

===''The Unspoken King'' (2007–2011)===
The new album was originally to be called ''The Book of Suffering'', and was to be a [[double album]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR3jh1OHVHk |title=Cryptopsy video interview HARDTIMES.CA |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}</ref> but on April 23, 2007, Cryptopsy announced that Lord Worm had been fired from the band and that they were looking for a new vocalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=71066 |title=CRYPTOPSY Parts Ways With Singer LORD WORM, Seeks Replacement |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}</ref> After the announcement, Lord Worm stated that he left the group earlier than planned for health reasons, which contradicted the band's statement that he was kicked out.

On December 4, 2007, Cryptopsy revealed the addition of vocalist Matt McGachy and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboardist]] Maggie Durand to the band.

==Royal Navy==
Arthur Wakefield was born in Essex near London, a son of [[Edward Wakefield (1774-1854)]] and Susanna Crash (1767–1816); his other brothers were [[William Hayward Wakefield]] and [[Felix Wakefield]].<ref name=DNB00>{{cite DNB|wstitle = Wakefield, Edward (1774-1854)|first =Cæsar Litton |last =Falkiner|authorlink = Cæsar Litton Falkiner|volume = 59|quote=''sources:'' [Allibone's Dict. of Engl. Lit.; Edinburgh Review, xx. 346; Russell's Memoirs of Thomas Moore, iv. 129; Webb's Compendium of Irish Biography; Place MSS. Brit. Mus.; Edward Gibbon Wakefield, by Dr. R. Garnett, 1898.]}}</ref>

He joined the [[Royal Navy]] at age eleven. He saw action in the [[Dutch East Indies]], and was part of the force that captured and burnt [[Washington, D.C.]] during the War of 1812. He took part in the [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|bombardment of Algiers]]. In the post-Napoleonic period he was stationed off [[South America]], involved in diplomatic duties during the various wars of independence. He then spent several years off the coast of West Africa as part of the flotilla engaged in the suppression of the [[slave trade]]. He also saw duty in the North Atlantic, the [[West Indies]] and the [[Mediterranean]]. He was eventually given command of his own ship, the steam frigate ''Rhadamanthus''. However, in 1837 he was passed over for promotion, so, recognizing that his career was going nowhere, he resigned from the Navy in 1841.

==New Zealand Company==
Immediately after Arthur Wakefield left the Navy in 1841, his brother, [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]] recruited him to join the [[New Zealand Company]], tasking him to select settlers for a new settlement to be named [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], escort the party to [[New Zealand]], and supervise the growth of the new town. Arthur Wakefield sailed from London on the ''[[Whitby (1837 Barque)|Whitby]]'' in April 1841 and reached Wellington in September 1841.<ref>

The first immigrant ships arrived in Nelson in February, 1842. 

The settlement of Nelson got off to a good start. In the first two years, 18 ships transported  [[Nelson, New Zealand#New Zealand Company|more than 3,000 colonists]]. Captain Wakefield actively worked to promote the orderly development of the colony. Although he seems{{or|date=May 2013}} to have been rather paternal in his attitude to the settlers, he also seems to have been respected and admired.

However, the new colony encountered serious difficulties in subsequent months. The biggest problem was the lack of arable land. The New Zealand Company, and particularly Wakefield's brother, had made extravagant promises to the settlers about the availability of land. Each settler family had been offered 1 acre (4,000 m²) of urban land, 50 acres (200,000 m²) of suburban land, and 150 acres (600,000 m²) of rural land. However, the company had nothing like that amount of land available and the existing owners – the native [[M?ori people|M?ori]] – proved very reluctant to sell their land and not inclined to trust the New Zealand Company's promises. 

Furthermore, the newly established British government of [[William Hobson]] in [[Auckland]] was not at all sympathetic to their problems.  One of the basic tenets of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] (1840), between the British Crown and various M?ori chiefs, was the understanding that the Crown would protect the M?ori from attempts to defraud them of their land.

On the other hand, some members of the New Zealand Company and many of the settlers saw the M?ori as ignorant savages who had no right to stand in the way of honest British colonists. This was a period when the growing British Empire was very aware of what it saw as its [[manifest destiny]],{{fact|date=May 2013}} to rule the native peoples of the world. The British colonists believed they were owed the land, and resented the fact that their survival was dependent on the goodwill of the M?ori, who held all the power. 

In summary, Arthur Wakefield found he had far more settlers than he had land for and they were not happy. For once, Edward Gibbon Wakefield urged caution, but he was in [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]] and his brother Arthur was the man on the spot.

==Death==
{{Main|Wairau Affray}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}

The Chief [[Magistrate]] in Nelson, Henry Thompson, was a very hot-tempered, arrogant man who was not prepared to accept that the Nelson settlement did not own and control the Wairau Plains. Te Rauparaha and [[Te Rangihaeata]] visited Nelson and made it very clear that they would not allow the settlers to occupy the Wairau Plain. Despite that, Wakefield and Thompson sent out surveyors. The M?ori very firmly, but without violence, escorted them off their land and burnt down their hut.    

Thompson immediately issued a warrant for the arrest of the two chiefs on a charge of arson. He and Wakefield then recruited a group of special constables and led them off to carry out the arrest. The result was the [[Wairau Affray]], in which Arthur Wakefield and 21 other of the party were killed by the M?ori.

It is difficult to apportion the blame for this disaster. Henry Thompson appears to have been the driving force behind the attempt to arrest Te Rauparaha and he already had a reputation for headstrong, irrational impulses. But Wakefield was supposed to be in command of the settlement. His brother had told him that the claim to land was invalid. It seems that he yielded to the pressures and expectations of the people around him and particularly to Thompson. It is still unknown as to what initiated the incident at Wairau yet Wakefield, Thompson and seven other settlers surrendered during the clash and were summarily executed on the orders of an enraged Chief. It is claimed that his head was laid on a loaf of bread as a final insult, echoing his arrogant quote that he could buy the Maori with "sugar and bread".

The subsequent government inquiry found the whole expedition had been illegal and exonerated the M?ori. This did not sit well with the colonists, who immediately began a political campaign against [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor]] [[Robert FitzRoy]] that contributed to his early dismissal.

The new settlement is now a thriving city, while a few kilometres away is the community of [[Wakefield, New Zealand|Wakefield]].

==Client base==

|title=Kissinger Means Business

The secrecy of their corporate client list has caused problems where Kissinger or a member of his staff were called to public service. In 1989, [[George H.W. Bush]] nominated [[Lawrence Eagleburger]] as his [[United States Deputy Secretary of State|Deputy Secretary of State]]. Congress required that Eagleburger disclose the names of 16 clients, some of which were his through his Kissinger Associates affiliation.<ref>{{cite news

Congressional Democrats insisted that Kissinger disclose the names of clients.  Kissinger and President Bush claimed that such disclosures were not necessary, but Kissinger ultimately stepped down, citing conflicts of interest.

Thesiger is best known for his travel books ''[[Arabian Sands]]'' (1959), on his foot and camel crossing of the [[Empty Quarter]] of Arabia, and ''The Marsh Arabs'' (1964), on his time living in the marshes of Iraq with the [[Marsh Arabs]]. He donated his collection of 23,000 travel photographs to the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]], [[Oxford]].

==Early life==

Thesiger was born in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], the son of diplomat [[Wilfred Gilbert Thesiger]], British consul-general and minister to Addis Ababa from 1909 to 1919. Thesiger's grandfather was [[Frederic Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]].  [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Viscount Chelmsford]], future [[Viceroy of India]] was an uncle, and the actor [[Ernest Thesiger]] was a cousin.

Thesiger was educated at [[Eton College]], Berkshire, followed by  [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] at the University of Oxford, where he took a [[British undergraduate degree classification|Third]] in History. Between 1930 and 1933, Thesiger represented Oxford at boxing and later (in 1933) became captain of the Oxford boxing team. He was awarded a boxing [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]] for each of the four years that he was at Oxford.  Whilst at Oxford, Thesiger was also elected Treasurer of the [[Oxford University Exploration Club]] (1931-32).

==Career==

[[File:Thesiger 1934.jpg|thumb|Thesiger in the Horn of Africa in 1934]]

In 1930, Thesiger returned to Africa, having received a personal invitation from [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] to attend his coronation.  He returned again in 1933 as the leader of an expedition, funded in part by the [[Royal Geographical Society]], to explore the course of the [[Awash River]].  During this expedition, he became the first European to enter the [[Aussa Sultanate]] and visit [[Lake Abbe]].

Between 1935 and 1940, Thesiger served with the [[Sudan Political Service]] stationed in [[Darfur]] and the [[Upper Nile (state)|Upper Nile]].

===Second World War===

At the outbreak of war, Thesiger joined the [[Sudan Defence Force]], helping to organise the Abyssinian resistance to the occupying Italians. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]]<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=35396 |date=26 December 1941 |startpage=7333 |supp=y |accessdate=23 June 2008}}</ref> for capturing [[Mekane Selam|Agibar]] and its garrison of 2,500 Italian soldiers. 

He later served with the [[Special Operations Executive]] in [[Syria]] and the [[Special Air Service]] during the [[North African Campaign]], attaining the rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]]. From 1943 to 1945 he acted as political adviser to the Abyssinian Crown Prince.

===Travels===

After the Second World War, Thesiger travelled across Arabia, lived for some years in the marshes of [[Iraq]], and then travelled in [[Iran]], [[Kurdistan]], [[French West Africa]] and  [[Pakistan]]. He lived for many years in northern [[Kenya]].<ref name=lof>{{cite book | author=Thesiger, Wilfred | title=The Life of My Choice | date=1987 | publisher=Collins | isbn=9780002161947}}</ref>

He is best remembered for his Arabian expeditions. In 1945, an [[entomology|entomologist]], O.B. Lean, acting on behalf of the Middle East Anti Locust Unit (MEALU), hired Thesiger to search for locust breeding grounds in southern Arabia. This led to two crossings of the great Arabian desert, the [[Rub al Khali]] or Empty Quarter, and travels in inner Oman. He rode camels in the company of [[bedouin]] guides through remote areas that were potentially dangerous on account of tribal tensions and the opposition of local rulers to the presence of foreigners.<ref name=Morton>{{Citation | author=Morton, Michael Q. | title=Thesiger and the Oilmen | journal=Journal of the Petroleum History Institute | date=December 2013 | volume=14 | page=125-39 | url=https://www.academia.edu/7205667/Thesiger_and_the_Oilmen_2013_}}</ref>

Thesiger’s first crossing began in October 1946 when, with his bedouin companions, he left Salalah in the Dhofar province of Oman and travelled to the Mughshin Oasis. From there, he entered the sands but there was dissent among his party, some of whom were unwilling to travel any farther. Thesiger continued with four members, two from the Rashid and two from the Bait Kathir tribes. He reached the Liwa Oasis in Abu Dhabi in mid December, visited Abu Dhabi town then crossed into Oman, heading back towards Salalah via Dhofar and ending his journey at Salalah on 23 February 1947.<ref name=Thesiger>{{Citation

}}</ref>

His second crossing began in December 1947, at Manwakh well in Yemen. The king of Saudi Arab did not agree to Thesiger entering his territory, and imprisoned Thesiger and his party when they arrived at Sulayil. Soon released, they travelled to the Liwa Oasis and then to Abu Dhabi town, arriving on 14 March 1948. In April, Thesiger visited the Buraimi Oasis, for which the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC) held an oil concession, which it operated through an associate company, [[Petroleum Development Oman]]. Dick Bird, the company's representative, was concerned by Thesiger's attitude towards oil exploration. Thesiger disapproved of the company’s activities, believing that the discovery of oil would destroy the bedouin way of life. However, the need to finance his expeditions led the explorer to accept funding from the oil company in exchange for providing information garnered from his travels.<ref name=Morton/><ref name=Thesiger/>

After all his travels were over, Thesiger returned to England in the 1990s and was knighted in 1995.<ref name=lof/>

He is also known for two travel books: ''[[Arabian Sands]]'' (1959), which recounts his travels in the Empty Quarter of Arabia between 1945 and 1950 and describes the vanishing way of life of the [[Bedouin]]s; and ''The Marsh Arabs'' (1964), which is an account of the [[Madan (people)|Madan]], the indigenous people of the marshlands of southern Iraq. The latter journey is also covered by his travelling companion, [[Gavin Maxwell]], in ''A Reed Shaken by the Wind – a Journey through the Unexplored Marshlands of Iraq'' ([[Longman]], 1959).

Thesiger took many photographs during his travels and donated his vast collection of 23,000 negatives to the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]], [[Oxford]]. His books were analysed, from a collector's point of view, in ''Book and Magazine Collector'' magazine, No.65, August 1989, and again in 2008, Issue No.295.

==In popular culture==

In the [[Ring of Bright Water (film)|film version]] of [[Gavin Maxwell]]'s ''[[Ring of Bright Water]]'', [[Bill Travers]] uses a copy of Thesiger's ''The Marsh Arabs'' to covertly spy on his soon-to-be close companion, Mijbil the otter.

In 2008, Majid Abdulrazak (a film director from the [[United Arab Emirates]]) produced a film version of ''Arabian Sands'' which was self-funded and employed actors from the UAE and [[Oman]] in most of the major roles.

A documentary about Sir Wilfred was made by producer [[Les Guthman]] in 1999, "A Life of My Choice."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snagfilms.com/films/title/a_life_of_my_choice|title=A Life of My Choice"}}</ref>

The [[order (biology)|order]] '''Afrosoricida''' (a Latin-Greek compound name which means "looking like African shrews") contains the [[golden mole]]s of southern [[Africa]] and the [[tenrec]]s of [[Madagascar]] and Africa, two families of small [[mammal]]s that have traditionally been considered to be a part of the order [[Insectivora]].

Some biologists use '''Tenrecomorpha''' as the name for the tenrec-golden mole [[clade]], but Gary Bronner and Paulina Jenkins argue that Afrosoricida is more appropriate, despite their misgivings about the similarity between the name "Afrosoricida" and the unrelated shrew subgenus ''[[Afrosorex]]''.<ref name=msw3>{{MSW3 Bronner|pages=71-81}}</ref>

Traditionally, these two families were grouped with the [[hedgehog]]s, [[shrew]]s and [[Mole (animal)|mole]]s in the [[Lipotyphla]]. However, there have always been minority opinions suggesting that Tenrecomorpha, or at least the golden moles, are not true lipotyphlans. These opinions are now supported by many genetic studies indicating an association between Tenrecomorpha and various other African mammals in the superorder [[Afrotheria]]; however there is no strong morphological evidence to link the Afrosoricida together with other Afrotherians. The Afrosoricida are sometimes considered part of the [[Afroinsectiphilia]], a clade within Afrotheria.

As a rule, tenrecs tend to be small animals varying from 4&nbsp;cm to 39&nbsp;cm in length. There is no pronounced body type since they have evolved to take over the insect-eating niche in Madagascar. However, based on the niche occupied, they look like shrews, hedgehogs or otters. Their coat can vary from smooth to spiny and the coloration of the fur is generally dirt brown. Most species are also nocturnal and have poor eyesight. However, their whiskers are rather sensitive and they can detect very minute vibrations in the ground to locate their prey.

'''''Lupinus polyphyllus''''' ('''Large-leaved Lupine''', '''Big-leaved Lupine''', or, primarily in cultivation, '''Garden Lupin''') is a species of [[lupin]]e (lupin) native to western [[North America]] from southern [[Alaska]] and [[British Columbia]] east to [[Alberta]] and western [[Wyoming]], and south to [[Utah]] and [[California]]. It commonly grows along streams and creeks, preferring moist habitats. 

It is a [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[herbaceous]] plant with stout stems growing to {{convert|1.5|m|ftin}} tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] are palmately compound with (5-) 9-17 leaflets {{convert|3|-|15|cm|in}} long. The [[flower]]s are produced on a tall spike, each flower {{convert|1|-|1.5|cm|in}} long, most commonly blue to purple in wild plants. The polyphyllus variety in particular make up a great number of the hybrids which are generally grown as garden lupins, they can vary dramatically in colours. The majority of lupins do not thrive in rich heavy soils, and often only live for a matter of years if grown in such places, crown contact with manure or rich organic matter encourages rotting. 

There are five [[variety (biology)|varieties]]:
*''Lupinus polyphyllus'' var. ''burkei'' – Interior northwestern United States
*''Lupinus polyphyllus'' var. ''humicola'' – Interior western North America
*''Lupinus polyphyllus'' var. ''pallidipes'' – Western Oregon and Washington (Willamette Valley)
*''Lupinus polyphyllus'' var. ''polyphyllus'' – Coastal western North America
*''Lupinus polyphyllus'' var. ''prunophilus'' – Interior western North America

==Russell Hybrids==

The herbaceous lupin, ''Lupinus polyphyllus'', arrived in Britain from North America in the 1820s, brought over by David Douglas. Almost a century later, George Russell[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/howtogrow/3298276/Falling-in-love-again.html][http://www.stillingtonvillage.org/history/Chapter5.htm], a 54-year-old [[horticulturist]] from York, [[UK]], started to breed his famous Russell hybrids (''Lupinus X russellii hort''). ''Lupinus polphyllus'' originally were of basic colours and had large gaps in the flowering spike. Without the use of modern day plant breeding techniques, Russell took to ruthlessly pulling out any plants which he deemed to be unacceptable in growth or display. He spent two decades single-mindedly trying to breed the perfect lupin, crossing ''L. polyphyllus'' with ''L. arboreus'', ''L.sulphureus'' and one or more annual species (maybe ''L. nootkatensis''). 

Over the decades, the plants he selected developed flower spikes that were denser, larger, and more colourful than the original ''Lupinus polyphyllus''. His work may have gone unrecognised if he had not been encouraged by nurseryman James Baker to show the plants to the public. It is understood the pair worked together for several years to perfect the Russell Hybrid, before they were displayed at the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s June show in 1937, where their brightly coloured, tightly packed spires won awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenworld.co.uk/blog/garden-lupins/|title=BBC gardeners world article|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> Russell was later awarded an [[MBE]], and the Royal Horticultural Society awarded him the [[Veitch Memorial Medal]] for a lifetime's achievement in horticulture. Baker later secured Russell's entire stock; in their heyday, Bakers Nurseries Ltd. of Codsall, Wolverhamton attracted 80,000 visitors in June to see {{convert|40|acre|ha}} of lupins in flower.

Russell disliked the blue colours, as they reflected too closely the original plants imported from America almost a 100 years previously. The blue colouring is a recessive [[allele]], and so although Russell might have worked hard to suppress it, lupins left unchecked over several generations will eventually revert to the old blues. Almost all garden lupins today are hybrids of the true Russell hybrids due to their ease of cross pollinating with one another, and with no special interest in lupin cultivating until recent years it has meant the plants have created a large pool of genetic diversity and variation from the original Russells
.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westcountrylupins.co.uk/acatalog/|title=West Country Nurseries article|publisher=West Country Nurseries|accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>

The templates created by Russell are still used by other specialist lupin horticulturalists today e.g. Maurice and Brian Woodfield, nurserymen from [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], who received the RHS [[Veitch Memorial Medal]] for their work on lupins in 2000. The Woodfields created more complex plants with more varied and vivid bi-coloured spikes, the red and yellow, and red and purple flowers are particular highlights of the 'Woodfield' lupin variety.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/4791536/Simply-loopy.html|title=Telegraph Lupin article|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=2009-07-27 | location=London | first=Fred | last=Whitsey | date=2000-06-24}}</ref> In 2009, Sarah Conibear who runs the Westcountry Nurseries, displayed several new varieties including the ‘Beefeater', about which the RHS writer Graham Rice commented "[the beefeater] has what looks to be the best red lupin we've seen so far."  <ref>{{cite web|url=http://mygarden.rhs.org.uk/blogs/graham_rice/archive/2009/05/17/westcountry-nurseries-new-at-chelsea-09.aspx|title=RHS  article|publisher=RHS|accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref>

It is commonly used in [[garden]]s for its attractiveness to bees, ability to improve poor sandy soils with their nitrogen fixing ability and flowers; numerous [[cultivar]]s have been selected for differing flower colour, including red, pink, white, blue, and multicoloured with different colours on different petals. Often hybrids between ''L. polyphyllus'' and ''[[Lupinus arboreus|L. arboreus]]'' are used, and sold under hybrid names such as Rainbow Lupins, Lupin Tutti Fruitti, and Band of Nobles (mixed), Chandelier (yellow), My Castle (red), Noble Maiden (white) The Chatelaine (pink), and The Governor (blue). They are very hardy plants, surviving extreme temperatures withstanding frost to at least {{convert|-25|°C|°F}} and the wild varieties can easily become [[invasive species|invasive]] and hard to dispose of unless kept in check on a regular basis. They need a reasonable level of sun to survive, and do best in light soils, suffering in heavy and clay types, once fully established they are extremely resilient and may be divided. Seeds taken from the mother plant will never be a true replica of the original even if they produce similar colourings.  

Low alkaloidal or sweet [[cultivar]]s of this lupin suitable for [[fodder]] crops have been bred. To avoid restoration of alkaloid synthesis in cross-pollinated species of lupin, a new approach has been developed on the basis of specific crossing. Only compatible forms are involved in hybridization, with their low alkaloid content controlled by one and the same genetic system. These approaches have allowed transforming this bitter weed into a valuable fodder crop. In the conditions of Northwest Russia positive results from the use of the sweet commercial cultivar 'Pervenec' (first sweet variety), which is included in the State Catalogue of selection achievements of Russia. Breeding of sweet lupin is carried out also in Finland. The newer garden hybrids of today are highly poisonous because they are full of toxic alkaloids and should never be eaten.

==Invasive species==
[[File:Russell lupins Canterbury New Zealand.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Russell lupins alongside a road in Canterbury, New Zealand.]]

'''''Lupinus''''', commonly known as '''lupin''' or '''lupine''' (North America), is a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]]s in the [[legume]] [[family (biology)|family]], [[Fabaceae]].

The pearl lupin of the Andean highlands of South America, ''Lupinus mutabilis'', known locally as ''tarwi'' or ''chocho'', was extensively cultivated, but there seems to have been no conscious genetic improvement other than to select for larger and water-permeable seeds. Users soaked the seed in running water to remove most of the bitter alkaloids and then cooked or toasted the seeds to make them edible (Hill, 1977; Aguilera and Truer, 1978), or else boiled and dried them to make ''kirku'' (Uauy ''et al''., 1995). However, Spanish domination led to a change in the eating habits of the indigenous peoples, and only recently has interest in using lupins as a food been renewed (Hill, 1977).<ref name=glad>Gladstone, J.S., Atkins C.A. and Hamblin J (ed) (1998).

The leaf blades are usually [[palmate]]ly divided into five to 28 leaflets, or reduced to a single leaflet in a few species of the southeastern United States. The flowers are produced in dense or open whorls on an erect spike, each flower 1–2&nbsp;cm long. The pea-like flowers have an upper standard, or banner, two lateral wings, and two lower [[petal]]s fused into a keel. The flower shape has inspired common names such as [[bluebonnet (plant)|bluebonnets]] and [[Lupinus perennis|quaker bonnets]]. The fruit is a [[legume|pod]] containing several seeds.

==Uses==

=== Culinary ===
{{Main|Lupin bean}}
The [[legume]] seeds of lupins, commonly called lupin beans, were popular with the Romans, who cultivated the plants throughout the Roman Empire; hence, common names like ''lupini'' in [[Romance languages]].

[[File:Lupinus angustifolius (1).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Lupinus angustifolius]]'']]
[[Lupinus angustifolius|Australian Sweet Lupins]] (''Lupinus angustifolius'') are high in protein, dietary fibre and antioxidants, very low in starch, and, like all legumes, are gluten-free. Lupins can be used to make a variety of foods both sweet and savoury including everyday meals, traditional fermented foods, baked foods and sauces.

The European White Lupin (''Lupinus albus'') beans are commonly sold in a salty solution in jars (like [[olive]]s and [[pickled cucumber|pickle]]s) and can be eaten with or without the skin. ''Lupini'' dishes are most commonly found in Europe, especially in Portugal, Egypt, Greece, and Italy, and also in Brazil. In Portugal, Spain, and  [[Spanish Harlem]], they are popularly consumed with [[beer]]. In Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Israel and Palestine, salty and chilled lupini beans are called ''termos'' and are served as part of an [[Apéritif and digestif|apéritif]] or a snack. The [[Lupinus mutabilis|Andean lupin]] or ''tarwi'' (''L. mutabilis'') was a widespread food in the [[Incan Empire]]. Other species, such as ''[[Lupinus albus|L. albus]]'' (white lupin), ''[[Lupinus angustifolius|L. angustifolius]]'' (narrow-leafed lupin),<ref>Murcia, J. and I. Hoyos. (1998).

Lupins were also used by many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] peoples such as the [[Yavapai people|Yavapai]] in North America. Lupins are known as ''altramuz'' in [[Spain]] and [[Argentina]], from [[Arabic]] ???? ''termes''. The seeds are used for different foods, from [[vegan]] sausages to lupin-tofu or baking-enhancing lupin flour.

=== Agriculture ===
Whilst originally cultivated as a green manure or forage, lupins are increasingly grown for their seeds, which can be used as an alternative to [[soybean]]s. Sweet (low alkaloid) lupins are highly regarded as a stock feed, particularly for ruminants but also for pigs and poultry and more recently as an ingredient in aqua-feeds. The market for lupin seeds for human food is currently small, but researchers believe it has great potential. Lupin seeds are considered "superior" to soybeans in certain applications and there is increasing evidence for their potential health benefits. They contain similar [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]] to soybean but less fat. As a food source, they are [[Gluten-free diet|gluten-free]] and high in [[dietary fiber]], [[amino acid]]s, and [[List of antioxidants in food|antioxidants]], and they are considered to be [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]]. About 85% of the world's lupin seeds are grown in [[Western Australia]].<ref name=ross>Ross, K. [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/business/energy-environment/soy-substitute-edges-its-way-into-european-meals.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 Soy substitute edges its way into European meals.] ''[[New York Times]]'' November 16, 2011.</ref>

Three [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] species of lupin, blue (narrow-leafed) lupin, white lupin, and [[Lupinus luteus|yellow lupin]], are widely cultivated for livestock and poultry feed.

Like other legumes, they can [[Nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] from the atmosphere into [[ammonia]] via a [[rhizobia|rhizobium]]–[[root nodule]] symbiosis, fertilizing the soil for other plants. This adaption allows lupins to be tolerant of infertile soils and capable of pioneering change in barren and poor-quality soils. The genus ''Lupinus'' is [[nodulate]]d by ''[[Bradyrhizobium]]'' soil bacteria.<ref name=kurl/>

=== Horticulture ===
Lupins are popular [[ornamental plant]]s in gardens. Numerous [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] and [[cultivar]]s are available. Some species, such as [[garden lupin]] (''L. polyphyllus'') and hybrids like the [[rainbow lupin]] (''L.'' ×''regalis'') are common garden flowers. Lupins can be good [[companion plant]]s in gardens, increasing the soil nitrogen for vegetables and other plants.

==Ecology==
[[File:Canadian Tiger Swallowtail on Wild Lupine.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Papilio canadensis|Canadian tiger swallowtail]] on wild lupine, [[Gatineau]], [[Quebec]]]]
Certain species, such as the [[yellow bush lupin]] (''L. arboreus''), are considered [[invasive species|invasive]] [[weed]]s when they appear outside their native ranges. In New Zealand, ''L. polyphyllus'' has escaped into the wild and grows in large numbers along main roads and streams on the [[South Island]]. A similar spread of the species has occurred in Finland after the non-native species was first deliberately planted in the [[landscaping]] along the main roads. Lupins have been planted in some parts of Australia with a considerably cooler climate, particularly in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]].

Lupins are important [[larva]]l food plants for many [[lepidoptera]]ns, the butterflies and moths. These include:

==Toxicity and allergenicity==
{{Main|Lupin poisoning}}
Lupins contain some amounts of certain [[secondary metabolism|secondary compounds]], including [[isoflavone]]s and [[alkaloid]]s such as [[lupinine]] and [[sparteine]] which is removed through processing. Early detection means that lupins that contain these elements are not selected for food grade products.

==History==
Consumed throughout the Mediterranean region and the Andean mountains, lupins were eaten by the early Egyptian and pre-Incan people and were known to Roman agriculturalists to contribute to the fertility of soils.

In the late eighteenth century lupins were introduced into northern Europe as a means of improving soil quality and by the 1860s the ‘Garden Yellow Lupin’ was seen across the sandy soils of the Baltic coastal plain.

Watson (1873) originally divided the genus ''Lupinus'' into three sections, ''Platycarpos'', ''Lupinus'', and ''Lupinellus'', based on habitat and the number of [[ovules]]. Most of the species found in the Americas were assigned to ''Lupinus''. ''Platycarpos'' consisted of some annuals with two ovules and two seeds (e.g., ''L. densiflorus'', ''L. micricarpus''), while ''Lupinellus'' had only one species (''L. uncialis'').

While Watson's work was predominantly based on study of North American species, the later research of Ascherson and Graebner (1907) was more global. They described two subgenera, ''Eulupinus'' and ''Platycarpos'', using similar criteria. Most species fell into the subgenus ''Eulupinus'', while ''Platycarpos'' included the annual species from the Eastern Hemisphere in Watson's classification.

A current schema retains this distinction, but uses the nomenclature for the subgenera of ''Platycarpos'' and ''Lupinus''. In this schema, subgenus [[Platycarpos]] (S.Wats.) Kurl. contains perennial and annual species from the Western Hemisphere, with a minimum two or more ovules or seedbuds. Subgenus ''Lupinus'' consists of 12 species from Africa and the Mediterranean, with a minimum of 4 ovules or seedbuds.<ref name=kurl>Kurlovich, B. S. and A. K. Stankevich. (eds.) [http://personal.inet.fi/tiede/lupin/Classific.htm Classification of Lupins.] In: ''Lupins: Geography, Classification, Genetic Resources and Breeding''. St. Petersburg: Intan. 2002. pg 42-43. Accessed 2 August 2013.</ref>

The first steps were taken in the early twentieth century to truly transform the lupin into a contemporary, domesticated cropping plant. Pioneered by German scientists, their goal was to cultivate a ‘sweet’ variety of lupin that didn’t have the bitter taste (due to a mixture of alkaloids in the seed) making it more suitable for both human consumption and animal feed.

The successful development of lupin varieties with the necessary “sweet gene,” paved the way for the greater adoption of lupins across Europe and later Australia.

And further work carried out by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food during the 1950s and 60s now see more sweet lupin crops produced in Western Australia than anywhere else in the world.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus ''Lupinus'' L. and, in particular, its North-American species, were divided by [[Sereno Watson]] (1873) into three parts: ''Lupinus'', ''Platycarpos'', and ''Lupinnelus''. Differences in habit and in the number of ovules were accepted as the basis for this classification. A majority of perennial and annual species from the American continent described by Watson were referred to ''Lupinus''. To the ''Platycarpos'' section were attributed some annual species with two ovules in the ovary and two seeds in the pod (''L. densiflorus'', ''L. microcarpus'', etc.). Section ''Lupinnelus'' consisted of one species (''L. uncialis''), with axillary and solitary flowers, scarcely reflexed banner, and also with two ovules in the ovary. Presently, the existence of such species seems doubtful.{{vague|date=April 2014}}

This principle of classification was extended by Ascherson and Graebner (1907) to cover all lupins from the eastern and western hemispheres. ''Lupinus'' L. was for the first time subdivided into two subgenera: A. ''Eulupinus'' and B. ''Platycarpos'' (Ascherson and Graebner, 1907). Quantity of ovules (seedbuds) in the ovary and seeds in the pod was also accepted as the criterion for this division. Most of the described species from the eastern and western hemispheres were referred to subgen. A. ''Eulupinus''.  Subgen. B. ''Platycarpos'' included several annual species from the eastern hemisphere with two seedbuds and seeds in the bean (the same species, as the one specified by S. Watson).

The taxonomy of ''Lupinus'' has always been confusing. It is not clear how many distinct species there are or how they might be organized within the genus. The plants are variable and the taxa are not always distinct from one another. Some American taxa have been described as [[species complex|complexes]] rather than separate species.<ref name=naga>Naganowska, B., et al. (2005).

The ovary contains two and more ovules or seedbuds. The seed are predominantly small-sized, with an underdeveloped embryo and small amount of endosperm. Cotyledons are small-sized, with long caulicles. The first pair of true leaves is alternate. The stem is predominantly naked with waxen coating. Dominating is the monopodial type of branching. Leaflets are smooth, with waxen coating or slight pubescence, predominantly narrow. Pods are flat or orbicular, with two or more seeds. Represented by frutcuilose, fruticose and herbaceous perennial forms, or less often annual ones. Plants are cross-pollinated. Chromosome number 2''n'' = 36, 48, or 96.<ref name="Kurd" /> This subgenus is distributed throughout North, Central and South America, predominantly in the mining systems of the Andes and Cordillera. Some species are cultivated (''L. mutabilis'', ''L. polyphyllus''). This subgenus includes several hundred species, requiring further analysis of their authenticity.

It comprises the following species:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ildis.org/LegumeWeb?version~10.01&genus~Lupinus&species~ | title = ILDIS LegumeWeb entry for ''Lupinus'' | author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | date = Last edited on 1 November 2005 (rebuilt on 24 April 2013) | website = International Legume Database & Information Service | publisher = Cardiff School of Computer Science & Informatics | accessdate = 11 April 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/splist.pl?7036 | title = GRIN species records of ''Lupinus'' | author = [[USDA]], [[Agricultural Research Service|ARS]], National Genetic Resources Program | date = | website = [[Germplasm Resources Information Network]]—(GRIN) [Online Database] | publisher = [[Henry A.

'''''Rosa dumalis''''' ('''Glaucous Dog Rose''') is a species of [[rose]] native to [[Europe]] and southwest [[Asia]]. Not all authorities accept it as distinct, with the ''Flora Europaea'' treating it as a [[synonymy|synonym]] of ''[[Rosa canina]]''.

It is a [[shrub]] that grows {{convert|1|–|2|m|ab br=on}} high. It has long, bent thorns. It bears dark or light pink [[flower]]s in June and July. The [[rose hip|hips]] are oval and quite soft. It may be confused with ''R. canina'', but when flowering they are easy to tell apart since ''R. canina'' has white or light pink flowers.

'''''Rosa rugosa''''' ('''rugosa rose''', '''Japanese rose''', or '''Ramanas rose''') is a species of [[rose]] native to eastern [[Asia]], in northeastern [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and southeastern [[Siberia]], where it grows on the [[coast]], often on [[sand]] [[dune]]s.<ref name=FOC>{{cite web|url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=200011310|title=''Flora of China''|publisher=eFlora|accessdate=15 October 2011}}</ref> It should not be confused with ''[[Rosa multiflora]]'', which is also known as "Japanese rose".

==Description==
[[File:Rosa_rugosa_buds.jpg|thumb|left|''Rosa rugosa'' buds on [[Grape Island, Massachusetts]]]]
''Rosa rugosa'' is a suckering [[shrub]] which develops new plants from the roots and forms dense thickets 1–1.50&nbsp;m tall with stems densely covered in numerous short, straight [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|prickles]] 3–10&nbsp;mm long. The [[leaf|leaves]] are 8–15&nbsp;cm long, [[leaf shape|pinnate]] with 5–9 leaflets, most often 7, each leaflet 3–4&nbsp;cm long, with a distinctly corrugated (rugose, hence the species' name) surface. The [[flower]]s are pleasantly scented, dark pink to white (on ''R. rugosa'' f. ''alba'' <small>(Ware) Rehder</small>), 6–9&nbsp;cm across, with somewhat wrinkled petals; flowering occurs in spring.<ref name=FOC/>

[[File:Rosa rugosa 2010.jpg|thumb|left|''Rosa rugosa'' in bloom.]]
[[Image:Rosa rugosa hip Neelix.jpg|thumb|right|''Rugosa'' rose hips resemble tomatoes]]
The [[rose hip|hips]] are large, 2–3&nbsp;cm diameter, and often shorter than their diameter, not elongated; in late summer and early autumn the plants often bear fruit and flowers at the same time. The leaves typically turn bright yellow before falling in autumn.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Cultivation and uses==
''Rosa rugosa'' is widely used as an [[ornamental plant]]. It has been introduced to numerous areas of [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. It has many common names, several of which refer to the fruit's resemblance to a [[tomato]], including '''beach tomato''' or '''sea tomato'''; others include '''saltspray rose''', '''beach rose''', '''potato rose''' and '''Turkestan rose'''.<ref name=CABI>{{cite web|title=''Rosa rugosa''|url=http://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/47835|publisher=[[CAB International]] |work=Invasive Species Compendium|accessdate=17 September 2014|ref=harv}}</ref>  Its fruit are sometimes mistaken for those of the [[beach plum]] – despite being entirely different in size, shape, color, texture and taste. 

The sweetly scented flowers are used to make [[Potpourri|pot-pourri]] in Japan and [[China]], where it has been cultivated for about a thousand years.

This species [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridises]] readily with many other roses,<ref name=CABI /> and is valued by rose [[Plant breeding|breeders]] for its considerable resistance to the diseases [[rose rust]] and [[rose black spot]]. It is also extremely tolerant of seaside [[sodium chloride|salt]] spray and [[storm]]s, commonly being the first shrub in from the coast. It is widely used in [[landscape design|landscaping]], being relatively tough and trouble-free. Needing little maintenance, it is suitable for planting in large numbers; its salt-tolerance makes it useful for planting beside roads which need [[deicing#Roads|deicing]] with salt regularly.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Numerous [[cultivar]]s have been selected for garden use, with flower colour varying from white to dark red-purple, and with semi-double to double flowers where some or all of the [[stamen]]s are replaced by extra petals. Popular examples include 'Fru Dagmar Hastrup' (pink, single), 'Pink Grootendorst' (pink, semi-double), 'Blanc Double de Coubert' (white, double) and the more common 'Roseraie de L’Haÿ' (pink, double), which is often used for its very successful rootstock and its ornamental rose hips.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Invasive species==
''Rosa rugosa'' is naturalized in many parts of Europe, and it is considered an [[invasive species]] in some habitats, particularly in seashores of [[North Europe]]. It can out-compete native flora, thereby threatening biological diversity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nobanis.org/files/factsheets/Rosa_rugosa.pdf |title=NOBANIS — Invasive Alien Species Fact Sheet — ''Rosa rugosa'' |author=Weidema, I. |date=2006 |work=Online Database of the European Network on Invasive Alien Species — NOBANIS [http://www.nobanis.org www.nobanis.org] |publisher= |accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref> On [[Sylt]], an island in the north of [[Germany]], it is sufficiently abundant to have become known as the "Sylt rose".<ref name=CABI /> It is also considered a noxious weed in the USA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=RORU |title=''Rosa rugosa'' Thunb. rugosa rose |author=[[USDA]], [[NRCS]] |date=2012 |work=The PLANTS Database |publisher=National Plant Data Team, Greensboro, NC, USA |accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref>

''R. rugosa'' was first introduced into North America in 1845.   The first report of it being naturalized far from the location in which it was planted occurred on [[Nantucket Island]] in 1899.  Ten years later, it was said to be "straying rapidly", and today it is naturalized on the entire coast of [[New England]].

==Vernacular names==
In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], it is called {{nihongo|''hamanasu''|????}}, meaning "shore eggplant" and also ''hamanashi'' ({{Clarify|Japanese here|date=February 2011}}) meaning "shore pear".{{cn|date=May 2014}} The Chinese call it "meiguihua" (???), literally "flowers of red jade".{{cn|date=May 2014}} In [[Korean language|Korean]], the species is called ''haedanghwa'' (???, {{linktext|?|?|?}}), literally "flowers near seashore".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.go.kr/plant/plantGuide/results/view.jsp?name_id=13169&returnUrl=%2Fplant%2FplantGuide%2Fsearch%2Fgeneral.jsp%3Fplant_name%3D%C7%D8%B4%E7%C8%AD%26size%3D10%26init_check%3DY%26start%3D1%26selLang%3DK |title=Haedanghwa (???) |publisher=Korea National Arboretum |language=Korean |accessdate=2008-08-06}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>{{cn|date=May 2014}}

'''Timothy-grass'''<ref>Clause 5.3.2.2.3 BS 7370-5</ref> ('''''Phleum pratense'''''), is an abundant [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[Poaceae|grass]] native to most of [[Europe]] except for the [[Mediterranean region]]. It is also known simply as '''timothy''', or as '''meadow cat's-tail''' or '''common cat's tail'''.<ref>The Observer's book of grasses, sedge and rushes by Francis Rose, page 112, 1976, ISBN 0 7232 1533 2, published by Frederick Warne and Co Ltd</ref> It is one of the ''[[Phleum]]'' genus, consisting of about 15 species of annual and perennial grasses.

It is probably named after Timothy Hanson, a U.S. farmer and agriculturalist said to have introduced it from New England to the southern states in the early 18th century.<ref>''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', 11th ed., p. 1310.</ref><ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v. ''timothy grass''.</ref> Upon his recommendation it became a major source of hay and cattle fodder to [[United Kingdom|British]] [[farmer]]s in the mid-18th century.<ref>Readers Digest Nature Lover's Library Wild Flowers of Britain, page 430, published 1988</ref>

Timothy-grass can be confused with [[Meadow Foxtail]] (''Alopecurus pratensis'') and [[Phleum phleoides|Purple-stem Cat's-tail]] (''Phleum phleoides'').

==Description==
[[File:Timothy stamen and stigma.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Close-up of flower head showing purple stamen (3 per floret) and feathery stigma (2 per floret)]]
[[File:Timothy ligule.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The ligule is short and blunt]]
It grows to 19–59 inches tall, with [[leaf|leaves]] up to 17 inches long and ½ inch broad. The leaves are hairless,rolled rather than folded, and the lower sheaths turn dark brown. 

It has no [[stolon]]s or [[rhizome]]s, and no [[auricle (botany)|auricle]]s.

The [[flower]]head is 2¾–6 inches long and ¼–½ inches broad, with densely packed spikelets. It flowers from June until September. The [[stamen]] are pink.

The [[ligule]] is short and blunt.

It grows well in heavy soil, and is noted for its resistance to cold and drought, and thus ability to grow in dry upland or poor sandy soils. In [[pasture]] it tends to be overwhelmed by more competitive grasses. After cutting it grows slowly.

[[File:Illustration Phleum pratense0.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Showing bulbous base and brown leaf sheaths]]

==Subspecies==
There are two [[subspecies]]:
*''Phleum pratense'' subsp. ''pratense''. Larger, to 59 inches tall. Widespread.
*''Phleum pratense'' subsp. ''bertolonii''. Smaller, to 27½ inches tall. [[Calcareous]] grassland.

===Cultivation and uses===
Timothy-grass was unintentionally introduced to [[North America]] by early settlers, and was first described in 1711 by John Hurd from plants growing in [[New Hampshire]]. Hurd named the grass "hurd grass" but a farmer named Timothy Hanson began to promote cultivation of it as a hay about 1720, and the grass has been known by its present name since then. Timothy has now become naturalized throughout most of the US and Canada.
 
It is commonly grown for [[cattle]] feed and, in particular, as [[hay]] for [[horse]]s. It is relatively high in fibre, especially when cut late. It is considered a harsh, coarse grass little relished by livestock if cut earlier. It is considered part of the standard mix for grass hay and provides quality [[equine nutrition|nutrition for horses]]. '''Timothy hay''' is a staple food for domestic pet [[rabbit]]s, [[guinea pig]]s, [[chinchillas]], and [[degu]]s, often making up the bulk of their diet. Timothy hay is rich in long fibre and its abrasive texture helps to grind down the teeth, keeping both the teeth and jaw in good order.

The [[caterpillar]]s of some [[Lepidoptera]] use it as a foodplant, e.g. the [[Essex Skipper]] (''Thymelicus lineola''), the [[Melanargia galathea|Marbled White]] (Melanargia galathea). It also grows in roadsides and abandoned fields but generally requires nutrient-rich soils.

Its [[pollen]] is a common [[allergen]]; it has recently been used in small amounts as part of a new [[hay fever]] vaccine Grazax, which is designed to recondition the body's immune system so it no longer responds to [[pollen]].

Plants persist through the winter. Dead, straw-colored flowering stems may persist, but only for a short time, and are recognized by the distinctive spike-like [[inflorescence]].

==Confusion with other species==
[[File:Timothy awns.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Close-up of flower head showing hornlike spikelets]]

It is often confused with [[Alopecurus pratensis|Meadow Foxtail]] (''Alopecurus pratensis''). Timothy flowers later, from June until August, whereas Meadow Foxtail flowers from April until June. The [[spikelet]]s of Timothy are twin hornlike projections arranged in cylindrical [[panicle]]s, whereas foxtail has a soft, single [[awn_(botany)|awn]].<ref>[http://www.bsbi.org.uk/identification.html bsbi.org.uk]; description, retrieved 2010-12-1.</ref> 
[[File:Alopecurus pratensis1.JPG|200px|thumbnail|left|Meadow Foxtail (''[[Alopecurus pratensis'']]) spikelet]]
[[Phleum phleoides|Purple-stem Cat's-tail]] (''Phleum phleoides'') prefers lighter soils and grows on [[chalk downland]].

'''''Alopecurus pratensis''''', known as the '''meadow foxtail''' or the '''field meadow foxtail''', is a [[Perennial plant|perennial]] grass belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is native to [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].

This common plant is found on grasslands, especially on neutral [[soil]]s. It is found on moist, fertile soils, but avoids waterlogged, light or dry soils. The species forms dense swards leading to low botanical diversity.

This species is widely cultivated for pasture and hay, and has become [[naturalised]] in many areas outside of its native range, including [[Australia]] and [[North America]].

==Identification==
It flowers from April until June - one of the earliest grasses to do so. Any survey work carried out in mid-summer may miss the grass as a result of this.

It can grow to a height of about {{convert|110|cm}}. The [[Plant stem|stem]] is erect and hard at the shaft,the sheathes being smooth and cylindrical. The [[Leaf|leaves]] are about {{convert|5|mm}} wide and hairless. Meadow foxtail has a cylindrical [[inflorescence]] with [[chaff|glume]]s about {{convert|5|–|10|mm}} wide and [[Raceme|spikelets]] about {{convert|4|–|6|mm}} long. 

The [[ligule]] is {{convert|1|-|2.5|mm}} long, with a slightly tattered top.<ref>[http://www.bsbi.org.uk/identification.html BSBI Description] retrieved 2010-12-1.</ref>

[[File:Alopecurus pratensis ligula.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|ligule has a slightly tattered top]]

==Similarity to other grassland species==
''Alopecurus pratensis'' has two common relatives, [[Alopecurus geniculatus|marsh foxtail]] (''Alopecurus geniculatus'') and [[Alopecurus myosuroides|black grass]] (''A. myosuroides''). It is often confused with [[Phleum pratense|timothy]] (''Phleum pratense'').  Timothy flowers later, from June until August. Its [[spikelet]]s have twin hornlike projections arranged in cylindrical [[panicle]]s, while meadow foxtail has a single soft [[awn (botany)|awn]].

==Ecology==
The [[caterpillar]]s of some [[lepidoptera]]ns use it as a foodplant, e.g. the [[Essex Skipper]] (''Thymelicus lineola''). Additionally, male mosquitoes can often be found on this flower drinking the nectar out of it.

'''Judie Tzuke''' (born '''Judie Myers''', 3 April 1956) is an English singer/songwriter. She is best known for her 1979 hit "Stay With Me Till Dawn", which reached number 16 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Tzuke's family relocated from Poland to England in the 1920s, and changed their surname from Tzuke to Myers. Her mother, Jean Silverside, was a television actress, and her father, Sefton Myers, was a successful property developer who also managed artists and singers&mdash;most notably [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]] during the writing of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. When Tzuke embarked on her singing career, she decided to reclaim the family's Polish name as her stage name. 

Educated in the visual arts, performing arts, and music, Tzuke performed in [[folk club]]s from the age of 15. Her meeting with [[Mike Paxman]] in 1975 was a turning point and they began to collaborate. Under the name Tzuke & Paxo, they eventually secured a recording contract and the duo released a single, "These are the Laws", produced by [[Tony Visconti]].

{{EngvarB|date=March 2014}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2014}}
===Early success===
Tzuke's career as a solo artist began in 1977, when she signed to [[Elton John]]'s label [[The Rocket Record Company]]. Her first single was on Rocket, "For You", released in 1978. Her first major success, "Stay with Me till Dawn", was released in 1979. The track, which was co-written with Mike Paxman, became a Top 20 hit in the UK in the summer of 1979 and a Top 10 hit in Australia and was featured on Tzuke's 1979 debut album, ''[[Welcome to the Cruise]]'', which was also a Top 20 hit. In 2002, "Stay With Me Till Dawn" was chosen by the British public in a poll of the 50 Best British Songs 1952–2002 (ranking at number 39).<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/06_june/01/top50.shtml BBC Press Office – Best of British Top 50]</ref> The song was also sampled by [[Mylo]] in the song "Need You Tonite", which is taken from his 2004 album ''[[Destroy Rock & Roll]]''.

Tzuke's second album, ''[[Sportscar (album)|Sportscar]]'' (1980), charted higher than her debut album (reaching no.7 in the UK) and contained one single "Living on the Coast" which failed to chart. Both albums were certified Gold by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] in 1981. Tzuke became Elton John's support act for his North American tour, and went on to release one more album on Rocket, ''[[I Am the Phoenix]]'' (1981), which also made the UK Top 20.

===1982-1995===
In 1982, Tzuke signed to [[Chrysalis Records]] and released her fourth album, ''[[Shoot the Moon (Judie Tzuke album)|Shoot The Moon]]''. Although the album reached the UK Top 20, it was Tzuke's last album to do so. Three singles were taken from the album (including a 7" picture disc release for "I'm Not A Loser"), but none were chart hits. Tzuke completed a 57 date tour of the UK, culminating as the headline act at that year's [[Glastonbury Festival]]. The performance was recorded for a TV special by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. Several performances from the tour were recorded and released at the end of 1982 as a double album, ''[[Road Noise|Road Noise: The Official Bootleg]]''.

In 1983, Rocket issued a compilation album, ''The Best of Judie Tzuke'', and released the track "Black Furs" as a single (the original version of which was on Tzuke's 1981 album ''I Am The Phoenix''). September 1983 saw the release of Tzuke's fifth studio album, ''[[Ritmo]]'' (Italian for "rhythm"). The album was somewhat of a departure from her previous work, with a much more electronic feel. The single "Jeannie No" preceded the album and had radio airplay, but did not chart. An edit and extended remix of the track were issued on 7" and 12" single formats (Tzuke's first). The subsequent single "How Do I Feel?" did not fare any better, and the album itself peaked at no.26 in the UK. Neither the album or singles were released internationally.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} During autumn 1983, Tzuke toured a series of larger (but fewer) venues.

After two albums, Tzuke left Chrysalis Records, believing that the company was no longer interested in promoting her records. Wanting to take greater control of her work, she signed with the small independent Legacy Records for the release of her next album. A new single, "You", was released in October 1984. A cover of a lesser-known [[Marvin Gaye]] track, Tzuke's version turned a rather sedate piece into a grinding electro production. It peaked at no.92 in the UK, and several different versions of the track were released on 7" and 12" formats. In March 1985, "I'll Be The One" was issued as a new single from Tzuke's forthcoming sixth album, ''[[The Cat Is Out]]'', which was mainly recorded at her home studio and released in June 1985. The single peaked at no.97, while the album peaked at no.35 on the UK Album Chart. A third single, "Love Like Fire", was released shortly afterwards, again with several versions on 7" and 12" formats, though this failed to chart. September 1985 saw a fourth single from the album, "This Side of Heaven", which coincided with Tzuke's national concert tour, though this too failed to chart. The show at [[Fairfield Halls]] in Croydon was recorded for a television special which, several years later, was issued as a CD/DVD release. 

Following the muted reception of ''The Cat Is Out'', Tzuke signed with another major label, [[Polydor Records]], in 1987. She began working on her seventh album, though took some time off in June 1987 when she gave birth to her daughter, Bailey. However, the release of the album was delayed further after Polydor first requested that Tzuke work with a producer of their choice rather than with her usual team. The collaboration with Polydor's preferred producer was strained, not least of all due to Tzuke being pregnant at the time. Eventually, Polydor agreed to allow Tzuke to re-record the entire album with her own team of husband Paul Muggleton and Mike Paxman. The album, ''[[Turning Stones]]'',  was released in April 1989, peaking at no.57 in the UK Album Chart. It was preceded by the single "We'll Go Dreaming", which had peaked at no.96 several weeks earlier. Further problems arose between Tzuke and Polydor which led to the last minute cancellation of her 1989 tour, enraging fans who had turned up to venues. Tzuke later apologised to fans, and when she appeared as a guest on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]]'s Friday evening record review show ''Round Table'', she claimed that the cancellation of the tour was out of her control but she had been prevented from saying anything publicly on the matter by the record company.

1990 saw Tzuke switch to another record company, [[Columbia Records]] (CBS), her fifth label in less than ten years. In August, she released a new single, a cover version of the [[Beach Boys]] classic "[[God Only Knows]]". Despite the single being issued in various formats (7", 7" poster wrap, limited edition numbered 10", 12", cassette-single and CD-single) and a video being made, the song failed to gain chart success. A limited promo 12" was issued of a remix made by DJ [[Judge Jules]]. The song also featured in an ITV documentary series about recording techniques, where Tzuke and her producers Mike Paxman and Paul Muggleton showed how the song had been constructed using samples of her voice which were transposed into a synthesizer range. 

Tzuke's eighth album, ''[[Left Hand Talking]]'', was released by Columbia in May 1991. Promotion for the album had begun in March when a 3-track promo had been issued widely to independent record stores, and Tzuke made two live performances at London's [[Shaw Theatre]] in April. These performances were the first time neither Muggleton, Paxman or Bob Noble were part of her live band. "Outlaws" was released as a single by Columbia in June 1991, but neither the album nor single made an impact upon the charts despite Radio 1 DJ [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] making "Outlaws" his record of the week on his Saturday afternoon show. Much like her contract with Polydor, Tzuke's tenure with Columbia ended after only one album.

Tzuke signed with another small independent label for the release of her ninth album, ''[[Wonderland (Judie Tzuke album)|Wonderland]]'', which was released in September 1992 by Essential Records (a subsidiary of the now-defunct [[Castle Communications]]). Two singles from the album, "Wonderland" and "Fly", were performed on the BBC1 lunchtime programme ''[[Pebble Mill At One]]'' in November 1992, after Tzuke had performed a concert tour of smaller venues in October and November. Neither the album nor singles charted, despite featuring the talents of [[Brian May]] from [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Nigel Kennedy]] on violin. Tzuke stated in a later interview (used in the inner booklet of the 2002 reissue of the album) that ''Wonderland'' was the album she felt most proud of as a songwriter. 

August 1995 saw the release of two albums. The BBC issued its recording of Tzuke's "Radio 1 in Concert" performance from 1981, and Polygram issued a compilation album entitled ''Stay With Me Till Dawn'' which drew on Tzuke's first three albums released on Rocket Records with tracks from the ''Turning Stones'' album on Polydor Records. The album included four single remixes which had not previously been available on CD.

===1996-present===
Tzuke released her tenth studio album, ''[[Under the Angels]]'', in October 1996 on her own label Big Moon Records. The album was previewed by two dates at London's Jazz Cafe in August 1996 and in Dublin in October that year. Three tours to promote the album, playing at over 30 venues, took place in January/February, June and November 1997. Recordings from the tour culminated in another live album, ''[[Over the Moon (Judie Tzuke album)|Over the Moon]]'' (1997). 

In 1998, Tzuke released her eleventh studio album, ''[[Secret Agent (Judie Tzuke album)|Secret Agent]]'', again on her own label, Big Moon. [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]] of [[BBC Radio 2]] included one of the album's tracks, "Tonight", on his compilation CD ''Bob Harris Presents... (Vol.1)''. In 2000, Tzuke gained the rights to her first three albums recorded for Rocket Records and reissued them on CD via Big Moon. She named her tour later that year the "Phoenix Tour", a reference to her last Rocket Records album, ''I Am the Phoenix''. Following this came a new live album, ''[[Six Days Before the Flood]]'' (2000), and a new studio album ''[[Queen Secret Keeper]]'' (2001). Another live album, ''[[Drive Live]]'', was released in 2002. 

Tzuke then released an album of [[cover version|covers]], ''[[The Beauty of Hindsight]]'', in September 2003. A self-promoted tour in September ended with two nights at London's Bush Hall. Two dates in March 2004 were played at London's Cabot Hall in [[Canary Wharf]] as part of the Docklands Music Festival and the following night at Dartford's Mick Jagger Centre, previewing two new tracks—"Addiction" (never released but later part of the [[B.E.D.]]'s ''Ver. 1.0'' and ''Ver. 1.5'' albums with Tzuke on backing vocals) and "Before I Found My Heart".

In 2004, musician [[Mylo]] sampled "Stay With Me Till Dawn" for the single "Need You Tonite" from his debut album ''[[Destroy Rock & Roll]]''. 

Autumn 2004 saw Tzuke release her thirteenth album, ''[[The End of the Beginning (Judie Tzuke album)|The End of the Beginning]]'', which saw her returning to a much heavier rock style on many of the tracks and the use of strings for the first time since 1981. Most of the album was played as part of her tour in October of that year. 2002 [[The X Factor (UK)|X Factor]] runner-up [[Gareth Gates]] joined Tzuke on stage to sing backing vocals on the track "Bully". The pair were first introduced by [[Lucie Silvas]] who had previously been one of Tzuke's backing singers and had also written material for Gates. Silvas and Tzuke also co-wrote most of the songs for Silvas' platinum-selling 2004 album ''[[Breathe In (Lucie Silvas album)|Breathe In]]'', and co-wrote four tracks for Silvas' 2006 album ''[[The Same Side]]''. Tzuke also provided backing vocals.

In January 2006, one of Tzuke's co-writes, "Strange Love", hit the UK top twenty for the group [[Phixx]]. Later in 2006, Tzuke provided vocals for the song "Falling Down" for the group [[Hybrid (producers)|Hybrid]] on their album ''[[I Choose Noise]]''. In 2007, two other Tzuke co-writes featured on the eponymous album by the Canadian brothers [[RyanDan]]. "Like The Sun" and "High" were both released as singles, and the album reached number 7 in the UK album charts.

In 2007, Tzuke released her fifteenth album, ''[[Songs 1 (Judie Tzuke album)|Songs 1]]''. It was accompanied by her biggest tour in almost a decade, with her daughter [[Bailey Tzuke]] on backing vocals, and collaborations with other musicians, such as [[Gareth Gates]] on piano (Gates also co-wrote the album's track "Dark Days" with Tzuke). March 2007 saw the download single release of "Cup of Tea Song" from the album.

Tzuke also collaborated with David P Goodes and co-wrote the song "What's It All For" for [[Laura Michelle Kelly]]. 

June 2008 saw the release of Tzuke's sixteenth studio album, ''[[Songs 2 (Judie Tzuke album)|Songs 2]]''. The same year, Tzuke co-wrote four tracks with the band [[Morcheeba]], and featured as a vocalist on two tracks from their ''[[Dive Deep]]'' album, including the lead single "Enjoy The Ride". In October 2008, Tzuke reached no.37 in the USA [[Adult Contemporary chart]] when she provided vocals for the American Jazz combo Project Grand Slam on their self-titled album. The track, "Captain Of The Heart", was not officially released as a single, but charted through airplay. Hot on the heels of this there was an official USA release (via CD Baby only) and international download release of the single "Christmas And I'm Home", which Tzuke had written with Gareth Gates in 2004 (Gates had already released his own version of the song). Tzuke recorded versions of the song with Haim Cotton, the pianist with Project Grand Slam. Proceeds from sales went to the New York Ronald McDonald's charity.

On 18 July 2009, Tzuke took part in a Teenage Cancer benefit concert at [[Kilworth House]], Leicestershire alongside [[Lucie Silvas]]. She performed three tracks solo ("Love Me No More", "Stay With Me Till Dawn" and "If (When You Go)") accompanied by a string quartet. She returned to the stage for an encore performance alongside Silvas, singing their co-written "Place To Hide" as a duet.

In 2010, Tzuke released a thirty year celebratory double-album titled ''Moon On a Mirrorball'', via a new deal with Wrasse Records. The collection featured over thirty songs from her back catalogue, some re-recorded songs and some new songs, one of which, "If (When You Go)", was performed on [[Michael Ball (singer)|Michael Ball]]'s Radio 2 show in August 2009. The track was released as a single in April 2010, and the song "Love You No More" was made available as a 1-track promo single. Wrasse also re-released all of Tzuke's Big Moon back catalogue as downloads, and reissued her debut album ''Welcome To The Cruise'' on CD. Wrasse also have plans to re-issue Tzuke's 1989 album ''Turning Stones'', which was deleted by Polydor soon after its release and has become something of a rarity since then.

A planned tour for June 2010 to promote ''Moon On A Mirrorball'' was delayed, but went ahead in October, encompassing 13 towns and cities. A live album, ''[[October Road (Judie Tzuke album)|October Road]]'', was recorded from the tour and was released in March 2011 via Tzuke's official website.

In July 2011, BGO Records remastered and re-issued Tzuke's 1983 album ''Ritmo''.

The track "Solid Shoulders" by The Goodes featuring Judie Tzuke was released as a download single on 25 July 2011.

[[Image:P._m._madagascariensis_juvenile.jpg|left|thumb|160px|A juvenile]]

This [[lizard]] is one of the largest living [[day gecko]]s. It can reach a total length of about 22&nbsp;cm (8.7 in). The body color is light green or bluish green. The skin between the scales often has a light color. A rust-coloured stripe extends from the nostril to behind the eye. On the back there are brownish or red-brick coloured dots which may form a thin line along the mid back. These geckos do not have eyelids, and they have flattened toe pads.

== Distribution ==
This species inhabits the whole east coast of Madagascar. It can also be found on the islets Nosy Bohara, Ste. Marie and throughout the Hawaiian Islands. Also, the gecko was deliberately introduced to a restaurant in the Florida Keys, US, by reptile experts. This was due to the garden surrounding the restaurant and the great possibilities it provided for reproduction. The experts come back every year and remove all excess geckos to sell in pet shops.

== Habitat ==
''P. m. magascariensis'' is often found on trees along the edges of forests. They also inhabit local huts and banana trees. The east coast of Madagascar because it has a humid and warm climate.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on many arthropods (insects and arachnids) as well as some fruit matter(mashed). They also like to lick hard, tart fruit, pollen and nectar found on Coonatorious Palm trees.

== Behavior ==
Like most ''Phelsuma'' spec., the males can be quite quarrelsome and do not accept other males in their neighbourhood. In captivity, where the females cannot escape, the males can also sometimes seriously wound a female. In this case the male and female must be separated.

== Reproduction ==
The mating season is between November and the first weeks of April. During this period, the females lay up to 6 pairs of eggs. At a temperature of 28°C, the young will hatch after approximately 55 days. The juveniles measure 55&ndash;60&nbsp;mm.

== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
These animals should be housed alone, because they are highly territorial. Male and female pairs can get along but it is common that males harass females too much. They need a large, well planted terrarium. 
The temperature should be between 25 and 28°C. On warm spot temperature should be 35-40°C. The humidity at night should be maintained between 75 and 90%, on daytime between 60 and 80% In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth larvae, fruit flies, mealworms and houseflies. Fresh tropical fruits, honey and fruity baby foods are good to maintain their inner moisture.

'''Petroglyphs''' (also called '''rock engravings''') are [[pictogram]] and [[logogram]] [[image]]s created by removing part of a [[Rock (geology)|rock]] surface by incising, picking, carving, and [[Abrasion (geology)|abrading]].  Outside North America, scholars often use terms such as "carving", "engraving", or other descriptions of the technique to refer to such images.  Petroglyphs are found world-wide, and are often associated with [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] peoples. The word comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''petro-'', theme of the word "petra" meaning "stone", and ''glyphein'' meaning "to carve", and was originally coined in [[French language|French]] as ''pétroglyphe''.

The term ''petroglyph'' should not be confused with [[petrograph]], which is an image drawn or painted on a rock face. Both types of image belong to the wider and more general category of [[rock art]] or [[parietal art]]. [[Petroforms]], or patterns and shapes made by many large rocks and boulders over the ground, are also quite different. [[Inukshuk]]s are also unique, and found only in the Arctic (except for reproductions and imitations built in more southerly latitudes).

== History ==
[[File:Haljesta.jpg|thumb|right|Composite image of petroglyphs from [[Scandinavia]] (Häljesta, Västmanland in Sweden). Nordic Bronze Age. The glyphs have been painted to make them more visible.]]
[[File:MtnSheepPetroglyph.jpg|thumb|right|A petroglyph of a caravan of [[bighorn sheep]] near [[Moab, Utah]], [[USA]]; a common theme in glyphs from the [[desert]] southwest]]

Some petroglyphs are dated to approximately the Neolithic and late [[Upper Paleolithic]] boundary, about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, if not earlier ([[Kamyana Mohyla]]). Sites in Australia have petroglyphs that are estimated to be as much as 27,000 years old, and in other places could be as old as 40,000 years. Around 7,000 to 9,000 years ago, other precursors of [[writing system]]s, such as [[pictograph]]s and [[ideogram]]s, began to appear. Petroglyphs were still common though, and some cultures continued using them much longer, even until contact with [[Western culture]] was made in the 20th century. Petroglyphs have been found in all parts of the globe except [[Antarctica]] with highest concentrations in parts of [[Africa]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Siberia]], southwestern [[North America]] and [[Australia]].

== Interpretation ==
There are many theories to explain their purpose, depending on their location, age, and the type of image.  Some petroglyphs are thought to be astronomical markers, maps, and other forms of symbolic communication, including a form of "pre-[[writing]]". Petroglyph maps may show trails, symbols communicating time and distances traveled, as well as the local terrain in the form of rivers, landforms and other geographic features. A petroglyph that represents a landform or the surrounding terrain is known as a geocontourglyph. They might also have been a by-product of other rituals:  sites in India, for example, have been identified as musical instruments or "[[rock gong]]s".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3520384.stm Ancient Indians made 'rock music']. BBC News (2004-03-19). Retrieved on 2013-02-12.</ref>

Some petroglyph images probably have deep cultural and religious significance for the societies that created them; in many cases this significance remains for their descendants. Many petroglyphs are thought to represent some kind of not-yet-fully understood symbolic or ritual language. Later glyphs from the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] in Scandinavia seem to refer to some form of territorial boundary between [[tribe]]s, in addition to possible religious meanings. It also appears that local or regional dialects from similar or neighboring peoples exist. The [[Siberian inscriptions]] almost look like some early form of [[Runic alphabet|runes]], although there is not thought to be any relationship between them. They are not yet well understood.

Some researchers have noticed the resemblance of different styles of petroglyphs across different continents; while it is expected that all people would be inspired by their surroundings, it is harder to explain the common styles. This could be mere coincidence, an indication that certain groups of people [[Human migration|migrated]] widely from some initial common area, or indication of a common origin. In 1853 [[George Tate (topographer)|George Tate]] read a paper to the Berwick Naturalists' Club, at which a [[John Collingwood Bruce]] agreed that the carvings had "... a common origin, and indicate a symbolic meaning, representing some popular thought."<ref>J. Collingwood Bruce (1868; cited in Beckensall, S., ''Northumberland's Prehistoric Rock Carvings: A Mystery Explained''. Pendulum Publications, Rothbury, Northumberland. 1983:19)</ref> In his cataloguing of Scottish rock art, Ronald Morris summarised 104 different theories on their interpretation.<ref>Morris, Ronald (1979) ''The Prehistoric Rock Art of Galloway and The Isle of Man'', Blandford Press, ISBN 978-0-7137-0974-2.</ref>

Other, more controversial, explanations are grounded in [[Jungian psychology]] and the views of [[Mircea Eliade]]. According to these theories it is possible that the similarity of petroglyphs (and other [[atavism|atavistic]] or [[archetype|archetypal]] [[symbol]]s) from different cultures and continents is a result of the [[genetics|genetically]] inherited structure of the human brain.

Other theories suggest that petroglyphs were made by [[shaman]]s in an [[altered state of consciousness]],<ref>[see Lewis-Williams, D.  2002.  A Cosmos in Stone: Interpreting Religion and Society through Rock Art. Altamira Press, Walnut Creek, Ca.]</ref> perhaps induced by the use of natural [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants#Hallucinogenic plants, fungi, and animals|hallucinogens]]. Many of the [[Geometry|geometric]] [[pattern]]s (known as [[form constant]]s) which recur in petroglyphs and [[cave paintings]] have been shown by David Lewis-Williams to be "hard-wired" into the human brain; they frequently occur in visual disturbances and hallucinations brought on by drugs, [[migraine]] and other stimuli.

Recent analysis of surveyed and GPS logged petroglyphs around the world has identified commonalities indicating pre-historic (7,000–3,000 B.C.) intense auroras observable across the continents.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/TPS.2003.820956|title=Characteristics for the occurrence of a high-current, Z-pinch aurora as recorded in antiquity|year=2003|last1=Peratt|first1=A.L.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science|volume=31|issue=6|page=1192 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/TPS.2007.902630|title=Characteristics for the Occurrence of a High-Current Z-Pinch Aurora as Recorded in Antiquity Part II: Directionality and Source|year=2007|last1=Peratt|first1=Anthony L.|last2=McGovern|first2=John|last3=Qoyawayma|first3=Alfred H.|last4=Van Der Sluijs|first4=Marinus Anthony|last5=Peratt|first5=Mathias G.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science|volume=35|issue=4|page=778 }}</ref> Specific common associated archetypes include: squatting man, caterpillars, ladders, eye mask, kokopelli, spoked wheels, and others.

Present-day links between shamanism and rock-art amongst the San people of the [[Kalahari]] desert have been studied by the Rock Art Research Institute (RARI) of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]].<ref>[http://rockart.wits.ac.za/ Rockart.wits.ac.za]. Rockart.wits.ac.za. Retrieved on 2013-02-12.</ref> Though the San people's artworks are predominantly paintings, the beliefs behind them can perhaps be used as a basis for understanding other types of rock art, including petroglyphs. To quote from the RARI website:
:''Using knowledge of San beliefs, researchers have shown that the art played a fundamental part in the religious lives of its San painters. The art captured things from the San’s world behind the rock-face: the other world inhabited by spirit creatures, to which dancers could travel in animal form, and where people of ecstasy could draw power and bring it back for healing, rain-making and capturing the game.''

There is also a second rock approximately 1&nbsp;km from the main rock near the Nabatean tombs of Nawamis with carvings of various animals including Camels, Gazelles and others.  The original archaeologists who investigated these in the 1800s have also left their names carved on this rock.
* Giraffe petroglyphs found in the region of [[Gebel el-Silsila]]. The rock faces have been used for extensive quarrying of materials for temple building especially during the period specified as the [[New Kingdom]] . The Giraffe depictions are located near a [[stela]] of the king [[Amenhotep IV]]. The images are not dated, but they are probably dated from the Predynastic periods.

This term often (mistakenly) coincides with the [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]. When installing software, one may be instructed to take one or more steps related to installing extensions (or these steps may automatically be done for the user).

"Add-on" is often considered the general term comprising snap-ins, [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s, extensions, and [[theme (computing)|theme]]s.<ref name="amo-def">[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:7 Mozilla Firefox plugins] - Description of the difference between Mozilla Firefox plugins and extensions under the general term ''add-on''.</ref>

The format of extensions can vary from one program to another, with for example:

* [[XPI]] format for Mozilla family (the browsers [[Firefox]] and [[SeaMonkey]], the [[email client]] [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]], but [[Nvu]] and [[Songbird]])
* [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] format for [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] Browser
* [[JAR (file format)|JAR]] format for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] (part of the XPI include JAR files)

==Extensions vs. plug-ins==
Extensions differ slightly from [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s. Plug-ins usually have a narrow set of capabilities. For example, the original impetus behind the development of [[Mozilla Firefox]] was the pursuit of a small baseline application, leaving exotic or personalized functionality to be implemented by extensions to avoid [[feature creep]]. This is in contrast to the "[[wikt:everything but the kitchen sink|kitchen sink]]" approach in its predecessors, the [[Mozilla Application Suite]] and [[Netscape (browser)#Mozilla Application Suite-based releases|Netscape 6 and 7]]. Therefore, after integration, extensions can be seen as part of the browser itself, tailored from a set of optional modules. 

Firefox also supports plug-ins using NPAPI. When the browser encounters references to content a plug-in specializes in, the data is handed off to be processed by that plug-in. Since there is generally a clear separation between the browser and the plug-in, the results are discrete objects embedded within a webpage. The same distinction between plug-ins and extensions is in use by other web browsers, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, where a typical extension might be a new [[toolbar]], and a plug-in might embed a video player on the page. Since plug-ins and extensions both increase the utility of the original application, [[Mozilla]] uses the term [[Add-on (Mozilla)|"add-on"]] as an inclusive category of augmentation modules that consists of plug-ins, themes, and search engines.

The '''Squamata''', or the '''scaled reptiles''', are the largest recent [[order (biology)|order]] of [[reptile]]s, comprising all [[lizard]]s and [[snake]]s. With over 9,000 [[species]], it is also the second-largest order of [[vertebrate]]s, after the [[Perciformes|perciform fish]]. Members of the order are distinguished by their skins, which bear horny [[scale (zoology)|scales]] or shields. They also possess movable [[quadrate bone]]s, making it possible to move the upper jaw relative to the [[neurocranium]]. This is particularly visible in snakes, which are able to open their mouths very wide to accommodate comparatively large prey. They are the most variably sized order of reptiles, ranging from the {{convert|16|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} dwarf gecko (''[[Sphaerodactylus ariasae]]'') to the {{convert|6.6|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} green anaconda (''[[Eunectes murinus]]'') and the now-extinct [[mosasaur]]s, which reached lengths of {{convert|14|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

Among the other reptiles, squamates are most closely related to [[tuatara]]s, which superficially resemble lizards.

== Evolution ==
[[File:Slavoia darevskii.jpg|thumb|left|''Slavoia darevskii'', a fossil squamate]]
Squamates are a [[monophyletic]] [[sister group]] to the [[tuatara]]. The squamates and tuatara together are a sister group to crocodiles and birds, the extant [[archosaur]]s. Fossils of the squamate sister group, the Rhynchocephalia, appear in the Early Triassic,<ref name="Jones, M.E. 2013">Jones, M.E., Anderson, C.L., Hipsley, C.A., Müller, J., Evans, S.E., Schoch, R.R., 2013. Integration of molecules and new fossils supports a Triassic origin for Lepidosauria (lizards, snakes, and tuatara). BMC evolutionary biology 13, 208.</ref> meaning that the lineage leading to squamates must have existed as well. Modern squamates probably originated in the Jurassic,<ref name="Jones, M.E. 2013"/> when fossil relatives of geckos and skinks appear, other groups, including iguanians, snakes, and varanoids, first appear in the Cretaceous period. Also appearing in the Cretaceous are the polyglyphanodonts, a lizard group of uncertain affinities, and the mosasaurs, a group of predatory, marine lizards that grew to enormous sizes.<ref name="Gauthier, J. 2012">Gauthier, J., Kearney, M., Maisano, J.A., Rieppel, O., Behlke, A., 2012. Assembling the squamate tree of life: perspectives from the phenotype and the fossil record. Bulletin Yale Peabody Museum 53, 3-308.</ref> At the end of the Cretaceous, squamates suffered a major extinction at the K-T boundary <ref>Longrich, N.R., Bhullar, A.-B.S., Gauthier, J., 2012. Mass extinction of lizards and snakes at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 109, 21396--21401.</ref> which wiped out polyglyphanodonts, mosasaurs, and a number of other groups.

The relationships of squamates have been debated. Although many of the groups originally recognized on the basis of morphology are still accepted, our understanding of their relationships to each other has changed radically as a result of studies of DNA. From morphological data, the iguanians were long thought to be the most ancient branch of the tree <ref name="Gauthier, J. 2012"/> however studies of the DNA suggest that the geckos represent the most ancient branch.<ref>Pyron, R.A., Burbrink, F.T., Wiens, J.J., 2013. A phylogeny and revised classification of Squamata, including 4161 species of lizards and snakes. BMC evolutionary biology 13, 93.</ref> Iguanians are now united with snakes and anguimorphs in a group called the ''[[Toxicofera]]''. DNA also suggests that the various limbless groups- snakes, amphisbaenians, and dibamids- are unrelated, and instead arose independently from lizards.

== Reproduction ==
[[File:Trachylepis maculilabris mating.jpg|thumb|250px|''Trachylepis maculilabris'' [[skinks]] mating]]
The male members of the group Squamata have [[hemipenis|hemipenes]], which are usually held inverted within their bodies, and are everted for reproduction via [[erectile tissue]] like that in the human [[penis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenigsociety.org/anatomy.htm |title=Iguana Anatomy |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Only one is used at a time, and some evidence indicates males alternate use between [[animal sexual behavior|copulation]]s. The hemipenis has a variety of shapes, depending on the species. Often it [[penile spines|bears spines or hooks]], to anchor the male within the female. Some species even have forked hemipenes (each hemipenis has two tips). Due to being everted and inverted, hemipenes do not have a completely enclosed channel for the conduction of [[sperm]], but rather a seminal groove that seals as the erectile tissue expands. This is also the only reptile group in which both [[viviparous]] and [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] species are found, as well as the usual [[oviparous]] reptiles. Some species, such as the [[komodo dragon]], can actually reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] and undergo [[parthenogenesis]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Morales, Alex |publisher=[[Bloomberg Television]] |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601082&sid=apLYpeppu8ag&refer=canada |title=Komodo Dragons, World's Largest Lizards, Have Virgin Births |accessdate=2008-03-28 |format= |work= |date=2006-12-20}}</ref>

== Evolution of venom ==
{{see also|Venom}}
Recent research suggests that the evolutionary origin of venom may exist deep in the squamate phylogeny, with 60% of squamates placed in this hypothetical group called [[Toxicofera]]. Venom has been known in the clades [[Caenophidia]], [[Anguimorpha]], and [[Iguania]], and has been shown to have evolved a single time along these lineages before the three groups diverged, because all lineages share nine common toxins.<ref name= "Fry, B. G., N. Vidal, J. A. Norman, F. J. Vonk, H. Scheib, S. F. R. Ramjan, S. Kuruppu et al.">Fry, B. G., N. Vidal, J. A. Norman, F. J. Vonk, H. Scheib, S. F. R. Ramjan, S. Kuruppu. 2006. Early evolution of the venom system in lizards and snakes. Nature 439:584-588.</ref> The fossil record shows the divergence between anguimorphs, iguanians, and advanced snakes dates back roughly 200 [[Mya (unit)|Mya]] to the [[Late Triassic]]/[[Early Jurassic]].<ref name= "Fry, B. G., N. Vidal, J. A. Norman, F. J. Vonk, H. Scheib, S. F. R. Ramjan, S. Kuruppu et al.">Fry, B. G., N. Vidal, J. A. Norman, F. J. Vonk, H. Scheib, S. F. R. Ramjan, S. Kuruppu et al. 2006. Early evolution of the venom system in lizards and snakes. Nature 439:584-588.</ref> But the only good fossil evidence is from the Jurassic.<ref name="Hutchinson2012" />

Snake venom has been shown to have evolved via a process by which a gene encoding for a normal body protein, typically one involved in key regulatory processes or bioactivity, is duplicated, and the copy is selectively expressed in the venom gland.<ref name="Fry, B. G., N. Vidal, L. van der Weerd, E. Kochva, and C. Renjifo">Fry, B. G., N. Vidal, L. van der Weerd, E. Kochva, and C. Renjifo. 2009. Evolution and diversification of the toxicofera reptile venom system.Journal of Proteomics 72:127-136.</ref> Previous literature hypothesized that venoms were modifications of salivary or pancreatic proteins,<ref name="Kochva 1987">Kochva, E. 1987. The origin of snakes and evolution of the venom apparatus. Toxicon 25:65-106.</ref> but different toxins have been found to have been recruited from numerous different protein bodies and are as diverse as their functions.<ref name="Fry, B.G.">Fry, B.G. 2005. From genome to "Venome": Molecular origin and evolution of the snake venom proteome inferred from phylogenetic analysis of toxin sequences and related body proteins. Genome Research 15:403-420.</ref>

Natural selection has driven the origination and diversification of the toxins to counter the defenses of their prey. Once toxins have been recruited into the venom [[proteome]], they form large, multigene families and evolve via the birth-and-death model of protein evolution,<ref name="Fry, B. G., H. Scheib, L. van der Weerd, B. Young, J. McNaughtan, S. F. R. Ramjan, N. Vidal">Fry, B. G., H. Scheib, L. van der Weerd, B. Young, J. McNaughtan, S. F. R. Ramjan, N. Vidal. 2008. Evolution of an arsenal. Molecular & Cellular Proteomics 7:215-246.</ref> which leads to a diversification of toxins that allows the ambush predators the ability to attack a wide range of prey.<ref name="Calvete, J. J., L. Sanz, Y. Angulo, B. Lomonte, and J. M. Gutierrez.">Calvete, J. J., L. Sanz, Y. Angulo, B. Lomonte, and J. M. Gutierrez. 2009. Venoms, venomics, antivenomics. Febs Letters 583:1736-1743.</ref> The rapid evolution and diversification is thought to be the result of a predator/prey [[evolutionary arms race]], where both are adapting to counter the other.<ref name="Barlow, A., C.

== Humans and squamates ==

=== Bites and fatalities ===
{{see also|Snakebite}}
[[File:Number of snake envenomings.svg|right|300px|thumb|Map showing the global distribution of snakebite morbidity]]
An estimated 125,000 people a year die from venomous snake bites.<ref>{{cite web | title = Snake-bites: appraisal of the global situation | publisher = Who.com| url = http://www.who.int/bloodproducts/publications/en/bulletin_1998_76(5)_515-524.pdf | accessdate =2007-12-30}}</ref> In the US alone, more than 8,000 venomous snake bites are reported each year.<ref>{{cite web | title = First Aid Snake Bites | publisher = University of Maryland Medical Center | url = http://www.umm.edu/non_trauma/snake.htm | accessdate =2007-12-30}}</ref>

Lizard bites, unlike venomous snake bites, are not fatal. The [[komodo dragon]] has been known to kill people due to its size, and recent studies show it may have a passive envenomation system. Recent studies also show that the close relatives of the komodo, the monitor lizards, all have a similar envenomation system, but the toxicity of the bites is relatively low to humans.<ref>{{cite web | title = Komodo dragon kills boy, 8, in Indonesia| publisher = msnbc | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19026658/| accessdate =2007-12-30}}</ref>

=== Conservation ===
Though they survived the most drastic changes{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} in [[Earth]]'s history, many squamate species are endangered now due to habitat loss, hunting and poaching, illegal wildlife trading, alien species being introduced to their habitats (which puts native creatures at risk through competition, disease, and predation), and many other unnecessary reasons. Because of this, some are in fact [[extinct]], with Africa having the [[List of extinct animals of Africa#Reptiles|most extinct species of squamates]]. However, breeding programs and wildlife parks are trying to save many endangered reptiles from extinction. Many zoos, private hobbyists and breeders educate people about the importance of [[snake]]s and [[lizard]]s.

== Classification ==
[[Image:DesertIguana031611.jpg|thumb|Desert iguana from Amboy Crater, Mojave Desert, California]]
Historically, the order Squamata has been divided into three suborders:
* [[Lacertilia]], the lizards
* [[Serpentes]], the snakes
* [[Amphisbaenia]], the worm lizards

Of these, the lizards form a [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group, since "lizards" excludes the subclades of snakes and amphisbaenians. Studies of squamate relationships using molecular biology have found several distinct lineages, though the specific details of their interrelationships vary from one study to the next. One example of a modern classification of the squamates<ref name=wiensetal2012/> found the following relationships:

Named [[Toxicofera]], it combines the groups [[Serpentes]] (snakes), [[Iguania]] (agamids, chameleons, iguanids, etc.), and [[Anguimorpha]] (monitor lizards, Gila monster, glass lizards, etc.).<ref name="Fry2006"/>

== History ==

A [[Block (data storage)|block]], a contiguous number of bytes, is the minimum unit of storage that is read from and written to a disk by a disk driver. The earliest disk drives had fixed block sizes (e.g. the [[IBM 350]] disk storage unit (of the late 1950s) block size was 100 6 bit characters) but starting with the [[IBM 1301|1301]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_1301.html |title=IBM&nbsp;1301 disk storage unit |author= |publisher=[[IBM]] |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}</ref> IBM marketed subsystems that featured variable block sizes: a particular track could have blocks of different sizes. The [[Direct access storage device|disk subsystems]] on the [[IBM System/360]] expanded this concept in the form of [[Count Key Data]] (CKD) and later [[Count Key Data#ECKD|Extended Count Key Data]] (ECKD); however the use of variable block size in HDDs fell out of use in the 1990s; one of the last HDDs to support variable block size was the IBM 3390 Model 9, announced May 1993.<ref>[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3390.html IBM 3390 direct access storage device]</ref>

Modern hard disk drives, such as [[Serial attached SCSI]] (SAS)<ref>"The LBAs on a logical unit shall begin with zero and shall be contiguous up to the last logical block on the logical unit"., Information technology&nbsp;— Serial Attached SCSI - 2 (SAS-2), INCITS 457 Draft 2, May 8, 2009, chapter 4.1 Direct-access block device type model overview.</ref> and [[Serial ATA]] (SATA)<ref>ISO/IEC 791D:1994, AT Attachment Interface for Disk Drives (ATA-1), section 7.1.2</ref> drives, appear at their [[interface (computing)|interface]]s as a contiguous set of fixed-size blocks; for many years 512 bytes long but beginning in 2009 and accelerating through 2011, all major hard disk drive manufacturers began releasing hard disk drive platforms using the [[Advanced Format]] of 4096 byte logical blocks.<ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/show/2888 Western Digital's Advanced Format: The 4K Sector Transition Begins]</ref><ref>[http://www.seagate.com/ww/v/index.jsp?locale=en-US&name=advanced-format-migration-to-4k-tpc&vgnextoid=746f43fce2489210VgnVCM1000001a48090aRCRD Advanced Format&nbsp;– The Migration to 4K Sectors], Seagate Corp.</ref>

[[Floppy disk]]s generally only used fixed block sizes but these sizes were a function of the host's [[Operating System|OS]] and its interaction with its [[Floppy disk controller|controller]] so that a particular type of media (e.g., 5¼-inch DSDD) would have different block sizes depending upon the host OS and controller.

[[Optical disk]]s generally only use fixed block sizes.

== Disk formatting process ==

Formatting a disk for use by an operating system and its applications typically involves three different processes.<ref group=NB>Each process may involve multiple steps, and steps of different processes may be interleaved.</ref>

# Low-level formatting (i.e., closest to the hardware) marks the surfaces of the disks with markers indicating the start of a recording block (typically today called sector markers) and other information like block [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] to be used later, in normal operations, by the [[disk controller]] to read or write data. This is intended to be the permanent foundation of the disk, and is often completed at the factory.
# [[Disk partitioning|Partitioning]] divides a disk into one or more regions, writing data structures to the disk to indicate the beginning and end of the regions. This level of formatting often includes checking for defective tracks or defective sectors.
# High-level formatting creates the [[file system]] format within a disk partition or a [[logical volume]]. This formatting includes the data structures used by the OS to identify the logical drive or partition's contents. This may occur during operating system installation, or when adding a new disk. [[List of file systems|Disk and distributed file system]] may specify an optional boot block, and/or various volume and directory information for the operating system.

=== Low-level formatting of floppy disks ===

The low-level format of floppy disks (and early hard disks) is performed by the disk drive's controller.

Consider a standard [[Floppy disk#The 3½-inch microfloppy diskette|1.44 MB floppy disk]]. Low-level formatting of the floppy disk, normally writes 18 [[Disk sector|sector]]s of 512 [[byte]]s to each of 160 tracks (80 on each side) of the floppy disk, providing 1,474,560 bytes of storage on the disk.

Physical sectors are actually larger than 512 bytes, as in addition to the 512 byte data field they include a sector identifier field, [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] bytes (in some cases [[Error detection and correction|error correction bytes]]) and gaps between the fields. These additional bytes are not normally included in the quoted figure for overall storage capacity of the disk.

Different low-level formats can be used on the same [[Recording medium|media]]; for example, large records can be used to cut down on inter-record gap size.

Several [[freeware]], [[shareware]] and [[free software]] programs (e.g. [[GParted]], [[Fdformat|FDFORMAT]], NFORMAT and [[2M (DOS)|2M]]) allowed considerably more control over formatting, allowing the formatting of high-density 3.5" disks with a capacity up to 2 MB.

Techniques used include:

* head/track sector skew (moving the sector numbering forward at side change and track stepping to reduce mechanical delay),
* [[interleaving (disk storage)|interleaving]] sectors (to boost throughput by organizing the sectors on the track),
* increasing the number of sectors per track (while a normal 1.44 MB format uses 18 sectors per track, it is possible to increase this to a maximum of 21), and
* increasing the number of tracks (most drives could tolerate extension to 82 tracks: though some could handle more, others could jam).

[[Linux]] supports a variety of sector sizes, and [[DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] support a large-record-size [[Distribution Media Format|DMF]]-formatted floppy format. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

=== Low-level formatting (LLF) of hard disks ===
[[File:IBM PC XT 10 meg MFM low level format.jpg|thumb|Low-level format of a 10-megabyte [[IBM Personal Computer XT|IBM PC XT]] hard drive]]

Hard disk drives prior to the 1990s typically had a separate [[disk controller]] that defined how data was encoded on the media. With the media, the drive and/or the controller possibly procured from separate vendors, users were often able to perform low-level formatting. Separate procurement also had the potential of incompatibility between the separate components such that the subsystem would not reliably store data.<ref>This problem became common in PCs where users used RLL controllers with MFM drives; [http://webpages.charter.net/dperr/diskguid.txt "MFM drives should not be used on RLL controllers. ..".]</ref>

User instigated low-level formatting (LLF) of [[hard disk drives]] was common for [[minicomputer]] and [[personal computer]] systems until the 1990s. IBM and other mainframe system vendors typically supplied their hard disk drives (or media in the case of removable media HDDs) with a low-level format. Typically this involved subdividing each track on the disk into one or more blocks which would contain the user data and associated control information. Different computers used different block sizes and IBM notably used [[Count Key Data|variable block sizes]] but the popularity of the IBM PC caused the industry to adopt a standard of 512 user data bytes per block by the middle 1980s.

Depending upon the system, low-level formatting was generally done by an operating system system utility. IBM compatible PCs used the BIOS, which is invoked using the MS-DOS [[DEBUG (DOS Command)|debug]] program, to transfer control to a routine hidden at different addresses in different BIOSes.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/60089 Using DEBUG to Start a Low-Level Format], Microsoft</ref>

==== Transition away from LLF ====

Starting in the late 1980s, driven by the volume of IBM compatible PCs, HDDs became routinely available pre-formatted with a compatible low-level format. At the same time, the industry moved from [[Hard disk drive#Disk interface families used in personal computers|''historical (dumb) bit serial interfaces'']] to [[Hard disk drive#Disk interface families used in personal computers|''modern (intelligent) bit serial interfaces'' and ''Word serial interfaces '']] wherein the low level format was performed at the factory.

Today, an [[end-user]], in most cases, should never perform a low-level formatting of an IDE or ATA hard drive, and in fact it is often not possible to do so on modern hard drives because the formatting is done on a [[servowriter]] before the disk is assembled into a drive in the factory.<ref>The NOSPIN Group, Inc. (n.d.). ''[http://web.archive.org/web/20120716043736/http://freepctech.com/pc/001/007.shtml Low level formatting an IDE hard drive] (archived)''. Retrieved December 24, 2003.</ref><ref>The PC Guide. Site Version: 2.2.0 - Version Date: April 17, 2001 ''[http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/geom/formatUtilities-c.html Low-Level Format, Zero-Fill and Diagnostic Utilities]''. Retrieved May 24, 2007.</ref>

==== Disk reinitialization ====
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2009}}

While it is generally impossible to perform a complete LLF on most ''modern'' hard drives (since the mid-1990s) outside the factory,<ref>Many enterprise class HDDs can be low-level formatted to block sizes other than 512 bytes, e.g., [http://www.seagate.com/docs/pdf/whitepaper/tp595_building_faster_more_flexible_infrastructure.pdf Seagate SAS drives] support sector sizes of 512, 520, 524 or 528 bytes and can reformatted from one size to another</ref> the term "low-level format" is still used for what could be called the ''reinitialization'' of a hard drive to its ''factory configuration'' (and even these terms may be misunderstood).

The present ambiguity in the term ''low-level format'' seems to be due to both inconsistent documentation on web sites and the belief by many users that any process below a high-level (file system) format must be called a ''low-level'' format. Since much of the low level formatting process can today only be performed at the factory, various drive manufacturers describe reinitialization software as LLF utilities on their web sites. Since users generally have no way to determine the difference between a complete LLF and ''reinitialization'' (they simply observe running the software results in a hard disk that must be high-level formatted), both the misinformed user and ''mixed signals'' from various drive manufacturers have perpetuated this error. Note: Whatever possible misuse of such terms may exist (search hard drive manufacturers' web sites for all these terms), many sites do make such ''reinitialization'' utilities available (possibly as bootable floppy diskette or CD image files), to both overwrite every byte ''and'' check for damaged sectors on the hard disk.

Reinitialization should include identifying (and sparing out if possible) any sectors which cannot be written to and read back from the drive, correctly. The term has, however, been used by some to refer to only a portion of that process, in which every sector of the drive is written to; usually by writing a specific value to every addressable location on the disk.

Traditionally, the physical sectors were initialized with a filler value of <code>0xF6</code> as per the INT&nbsp;1Eh's [[Disk Parameter Table]] (DPT)<!-- TBD: IIRC this resembles a bit pattern optimized for MFM controllers --> during format on IBM compatible machines. This value is also used on the [[Atari Portfolio]]. 8-inch [[CP/M]] floppies typically came pre-formatted with a value of <code>0xE5</code>,<ref name="Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS"/> and by way of [[Digital Research]] this value was also used on [[Atari ST]] and some [[Amstrad]] formatted floppies.<ref group="NB" name="NB_Magic_E5"/> Amstrad otherwise used <code>0xF4</code> as a format filler value. Some modern formatters wipe hard disks with a value of <code>0x00</code> instead, sometimes also called ''zero-filling'', whereas a value of <code>0xFF</code> is used on flash disks to reduce [[Program-erase cycle|wear]]. The latter value is typically also the default value used on ROM disks (which cannot be reformatted). (Some advanced formatting tools allow to configure the format filler byte.<ref group="NB" name="NB_Format_Wipe"/>)

One popular method for performing only the zero-fill operation on a hard disk is by writing zero-value bytes to the drive using the Unix [[dd (Unix)|dd]] utility with the [[/dev/zero]] stream as the input file and the drive itself or a specific partition as the output file.<ref>[http://www.myfixlog.com/fix.php?fid=58 How to Securely Erase (Wipe) a Hard Drive for Free with DD]</ref> This command may take many hours to complete, and can erase all files and file systems.

Another method for [[SCSI]] disks may use the sg_format<ref>[http://sg.danny.cz/sg/sg3_utils.html SG.danny.cz]</ref> command to issue a low level [[SCSI Format Unit Command]].

Overwriting the drive with a zero-fill-command is not necessarily a secure method of erasing sensitive data{{Failed verification|date=December 2013}}, or of preparing a drive for use with an encrypted filesystem.<ref>[http://www.globallinuxsecurity.pro/quickly-fill-a-disk-with-random-bits-without-dev-urandom/ Quickly fill a disk with random bits]</ref>

=== Partitioning ===
{{main|Disk partitioning}}

Partitioning is the process of writing information into blocks of a storage device or medium that allows access by an operating system. Some operating systems allow the device (or its medium) to appear as multiple devices; i.e. partitioned into multiple devices.

On [[MS-DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and UNIX-based operating systems (such as [[BSD]], [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]]) this is normally done with a [[partition editor]], such as [[fdisk]], [[GNU Parted]], or [[Disk Utility]]. These operating systems support multiple partitions.

In current IBM mainframe OSs derived from [[OS/360]] and [[DOS/360]], such as [[z/OS]] and [[z/VSE]], this is done by the INIT command of the ICKDSF utility.<ref>[http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/ick4020f.pdf Device Support Facilities User's Guide and Reference]</ref> These OSs support only a single partition per device, called a volume. The ICKDSF functions include creating a volume label and writing a Record 0 on every track.

Floppy disks are not partitioned; however depending upon the OS they may require volume information in order to be accessed by the OS.

[[Partition editor]]s and ICKDSF today do not handle low level functions for HDDs and optical disk drives such as writing timing marks, and they cannot reinitialize a modern disk that has been degaussed or otherwise lost the factory formatting.

=== High-level formatting ===

High-level formatting is the process of setting up an empty file system on a disk partition or [[logical volume]] and, for PCs, installing a [[boot sector]]. This is a fast operation, and is sometimes referred to as ''quick formatting''.

The entire logical drive or partition may optionally be scanned for defects, which may take considerable time.

In the case of floppy disks, both high- and low-level formatting are customarily performed in one pass by the disk formatting software. 8-inch floppies typically came low-level formatted and were filled with a format filler value of <code>0xE5</code>.<ref name="Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS"/><ref group="NB" name="NB_Magic_E5"/> Since the 1990s, most 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch floppies have been shipped pre-formatted from the factory as DOS [[FAT12]] floppies.

In current IBM mainframe operating systems derived from [[OS/360]] or [[DOS/360]], this may be done as part of allocating a file, by a utility specific to the file system or, in some older access methods, on the fly as new data are written.

== Host protected area ==
{{main|Host protected area}}

The host protected area, sometimes referred to as hidden protected area, is an area of a [[hard drive]] that is high level formatted so that the area is not normally visible to its [[operating system]] (OS).

== Reformatting {{anchor|REFORMAT}} ==<!-- incoming links -->
Reformatting is a [[#HIGH|high-level formatting]] performed on a functioning disk drive to free the contents of its medium. Reformatting is unique to each operating system because what actually is done to existing data varies by OS. The most important aspect of the process is that it frees disk space for use by other data. To actually "erase" everything requires overwriting each block of data on the medium; something that is not done by many PC high-level formatting utilities.

Reformatting often carries the implication that the operating system and all other software will be reinstalled after the format is complete. Rather than fixing an installation suffering from malfunction or security compromise, it is sometimes judged easier to simply reformat everything and start from scratch. Various colloquialism exist for this process, such as "wipe and reload", "nuke and pave", "reimage", etc.

== Formatting ==

=== DOS, OS/2 and Windows ===
[[Image:Unformat.gif|thumb|MS-DOS 6.22a FORMAT /U switch failing to overwrite content of partition]]

''format command'': Under [[MS-DOS]], [[PC DOS]], [[OS/2]] and [[Microsoft Windows]], disk formatting can be performed by the <code>[[format (command)|format]]</code> [[command (computing)|command]]. The <code>format</code> program usually asks for confirmation beforehand to prevent accidental removal of data, but some versions of DOS have an undocumented <code>/AUTOTEST</code> option; if used, the usual confirmation is skipped and the format begins right away. The WM/FormatC [[Macro virus (computing)|macro virus]] uses this command to format drive C: as soon as a document is opened.

''Unconditional format'': There is also the <code>/U</code> parameter that performs an ''unconditional'' format which under most circumstances overwrites the entire partition,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.mdgx.com/secrets.htm#FORMAT-U |title = AXCEL216 / MDGx MS-DOS Undocumented + Hidden Secrets |accessdate = 2008-06-07}}</ref> preventing the recovery of data through software. Note however that the <code>/U</code> switch only works reliably with floppy diskettes (see image to the right). Technically because unless <code>/Q</code> is used, floppies are always low level formatted in addition to high-level formatted. Under certain circumstances with hard drive partitions, however, the <code>/U</code> switch merely prevents the creation of <code>[[unformat (command)|unformat]]</code> information in the partition to be formatted while otherwise leaving the partition's contents entirely intact (still on disk but marked deleted). In such cases, the user's data remain ripe for recovery with specialist tools such as [[EnCase]] or [[disk editor]]s. Reliance upon <code>/U</code> for secure overwriting of hard drive partitions is therefore inadvisable, and purpose-built tools such as [[DBAN]] should be considered instead.

''Overwriting'': In Windows Vista and upwards the non-quick format will overwrite as it goes. Not the case in Windows XP and below.<ref>
  {{cite web
    | url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/941961
    | title = MSKB941961: Change in the behavior of the format command in Windows Vista
    | publisher = [[Microsoft Corporation]]
    | quote = The format command behavior has changed in Windows Vista. By default in Windows Vista, the format command writes zeros to the whole disk when a full format is performed. In Windows XP and in earlier versions of the Windows operating system, the format command does not write zeros to the whole disk when a full format is performed.
    | date = 2009-02-23
    | accessdate = 2012-10-24
  }}
</ref>

''OS/2'': Under OS/2, if you use the <code>/L</code> parameter, which specifies a ''long'' format, then format will overwrite the entire partition or logical drive. Doing so enhances the ability of [[CHKDSK]] to recover files.

=== Unix-like operating systems ===

High-level formatting of disks on these systems is traditionally done using the <code>[[mkfs]]</code> command. On Linux (and potentially other systems as well) <code>mkfs</code> is typically a wrapper around filesystem-specific commands which have the name <code>mkfs''.fsname''</code>, where ''fsname'' is the name of the filesystem with which to format the disk.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://linux.die.net/man/8/mkfs |title = mkfs(8) - Linux man page |accessdate = 2010-04-25}}</ref> Some filesystems which are not supported by certain implementations of <code>mkfs</code> have their own manipulation tools; for example [[Ntfsprogs]] provides a format utility for the [[NTFS]] filesystem.

Some Unix and Unix-like operating systems have higher-level formatting tools, usually for the purpose of making disk formatting easier and/or allowing the user to partition the disk with the same tool. Examples include [[GNU Parted]] (and its various GUI frontends such as [[GParted]] and the [[KDE Partition Manager]]) and the [[Disk Utility]] application on [[Mac OS X]].

== Recovery of data from a formatted disk ==
{{original research|section|date=March 2011}}

As in file deletion by the operating system, data on a disk are not fully erased during every<ref>Data are destroyed in PC operating systems when the '''/L''' (long) option is used on format, for a [[Data set (IBM mainframe)#Partitioned datasets|Partitioned Data Set (PDS)]] in [[MVS]] and for newer file systems on IBM mainframes.</ref> high-level format. Instead, the area on the disk containing the data is merely marked as available, and retains the old data until it is overwritten. If the disk is formatted with a different file system than the one which previously existed on the partition, some data may be overwritten that wouldn't be if the same file system had been used. However, under some file systems (e.g., NTFS, but not FAT), the file indexes (such as $MFTs under NTFS, inodes under ext2/3, etc.) may not be written to the same exact locations. And if the partition size is increased, even FAT file systems will overwrite more data at the beginning of that new partition.

From the perspective of preventing the recovery of sensitive data through recovery tools, the data must either be completely overwritten (every sector) with random data before the format, or the format program itself must perform this overwriting, as the [[DOS]] <code>FORMAT</code> command did with floppy diskettes, filling every data sector with the format filler byte value (typically <code>0xF6</code><!-- as per the INT 1Eh disk parameter table. TBD: IIRC this resembles a bit pattern optimized for FM/MFM controllers -->).

However there are applications and tools, especially used in forensic information technology, that can recover data that has been conventionally erased. In order to avoid the recovery of sensitive data, governmental organization or big companies use information destruction methods like the [[Gutmann method]].<ref>[http://www.youbioit.com/en/article/shared-information/5317/deleting-files-permanently Deleting files permanently]</ref> For average users there are also special applications that can perform complete data destruction by overwriting previous information. Although there are applications that perform multiple writes a [[data erasure#Number of overwrites needed|single write]] is generally all that is needed on modern hard disk drives.  The ''ATA Secure Erase'' can be performed by disk utilities to quickly and thoroughly wipe drives.<ref name="Secure Deletion">{{cite web

[[File:PSD in Central Station.jpg|thumb||[[Platform screen doors]] in [[Central (MTR)|Central]] Station on the Tsuen Wan&nbsp;Line]]

The '''Tsuen Wan&nbsp;Line''' is one of the ten lines of the [[rapid transit|metro]] network in [[Hong Kong]]'s [[MTR]]. It is indicated in red on the MTR map.

The Tsuen Wan Line starts at [[Central Station (MTR)|Central]] station on [[Hong Kong Island]] and runs through western [[Kowloon]] to the southwestern [[New Territories]], where it ends at [[Tsuen Wan Station|Tsuen Wan]] station. It currently travels through 16 stations in 30 minutes along its route. Because it travels under [[Victoria Harbour]] from Central and into the busy areas on [[Nathan Road]] ([[Tsim Sha Tsui]], [[Yau Ma Tei]], and [[Mong Kok]]) continuing into densely populated [[Sham Shui Po]], it is a very heavily travelled line.

==History==

===Early construction===
The Tsuen Wan Line was one of the original lines of the [[MTR]] network. The initial plan for this line is somewhat different from what currently exists; especially in the names and the construction characteristics of the [[New Territories]] section. Original plans envisioned a terminus station in a valley further west of the present [[Tsuen Wan Station|Tsuen Wan]] station terminus, named Tsuen Wan West. The station is different from the current [[West Rail Line|West Rail&nbsp;Line]] [[Tsuen Wan West Station|Tsuen Wan West]] station located under reclaimed land. Furthermore, the line was supposed to run underground in Tsuen Wan, rather than the present line which was built on ground level.

The final route design allowed for a truncated line and construction to [[Tsuen Wan]] was approved in 1975 and commenced soon afterwards. While the main section of the line under [[Nathan Road]] in Kowloon started service in 1979, trains did not reach Tsuen Wan until 10 May 1982. All stations in the [[Sham Shui Po District]] ([[Sham Shui Po Station|Sham Shui Po]], [[Cheung Sha Wan Station|Cheung Sha Wan]], [[Lai Chi Kok Station|Lai Chi Kok]] and [[Mei Foo Station|Mei Foo]]) opened a week later than the rest of the line. This was the only express service in the MTR, the journey time between Prince Edward and Lai King was shorter than a local service by two to three minutes.

Eight stations differ in names or location from the initial plan. [[Central Station (MTR)|Central]], [[Yau Ma Tei Station|Yau Ma Tei]] and [[Mong Kok Station|Mong Kok]] stations were originally named after the streets crossing or above the stations, [[Chater Road]], [[Waterloo Road, Hong Kong|Waterloo Road]], and [[Argyle Street, Hong Kong|Argyle Street]] respectively, but the name of each station was later changed to represent the district of the station. Moreover, Mong Kok station was planned to be built a bit further north of its present location, which would have taken the place of [[Prince Edward Station]]; and [[Sham Shui Po Station|Sham Shui Po]] was planned to be built a bit further south of its present location.

[[Mei Foo Station|Mei Foo]] was originally named Lai Chi Kok, which was originally named Cheung Sha Wan, and Cheung Sha Wan was originally named [[So Uk]], after the [[Ming dynasty]] tombs in the area of the station. [[Kwai Fong Station|Kwai Fong]] was originally named [[Lap Sap Wan]],  which means "rubbish bay" since the station is close to a now disused [[landfill]] in [[Gin Drinker's Bay]], and was intended to be further south to its present site.  [[Kwai Hing Station|Kwai Hing]] was originally named [[Kwai Chung]].

Kwai Fong, Kwai Hing, Lai Chi Kok, and Cheung Sha Wan stations gained their present names before opening, and Mei Foo was also renamed from "Lai Chi Kok" to "Lai Wan" (??). The other stations had their Chinese name changed when they opened, and were renamed in 1985 together with Mei Foo station.

===Transfer with Tung Chung Line===
When the [[Tung Chung Line|Tung Chung&nbsp;Line]] was constructed, it became necessary to build an interchange so that passengers did not have to go to [[Hong Kong Island]] to change lines. The site chosen for an interchange was at [[Lai King (MTR)|Lai King]] station. The northbound track on the Tsuen Wan Line was moved so that it ran above the southbound tracks at Lai King station. This allowed cross platform interchange with the Tung Chung Line possible at Lai King and the new platforms were opened in 1997, nearly a year before the Tung Chung Line started service. A pair of tracks was also built to the south of Lai King station linking the Tsuen Wan Line and Tung Chung Line, becoming the only point where the Tung Chung Line connects with the other urban lines.

===Transfer with former KCR systems===
To cope with extensions and new lines, Mei Foo station and [[Tsim Sha Tsui Station|Tsim Sha Tsui]] stations had new [[subsurface]] walkways added to connect to [[Mei Foo Station]]'s West Rail Line platforms and [[East Tsim Sha Tsui Station]]. The interchange facilities at Mei Foo opened in 2003, when the [[West Rail Line|West Rail&nbsp;Line]] was opened. The interchange located at Tsim Sha Tsui entered service in 2004, along with the completion of the [[East Rail Line|East Rail&nbsp;Line]] extension.

===Chronology===
* 1967: Tsuen Wan Line included in Hong Kong Mass Transport Study
* 1970: Tsuen Wan Line included in Hong Kong Mass Transit Further Studies, as Kong Kow Line and Tsuen Wan Branch
* 1977: Construction was approved and not long after, started in 1st March 1979.
* 16 Dec 1979: Jordan and Tsim Sha Tsui stations opened, as part of Kwun Tong Line.
* 16 Dec 1979: Waterloo and Argyle (later renamed Yau Ma Tei and Mong Kok respectively) stations opened, also as part of Kwun Tong Line.
* 12 Feb 1980: Admiralty and Chater (later renamed Central) stations opened, again, as part of Kwun Tong Line,
* 26 Apr 1982: Kwun Tong Line officially breaks down into itself and Tsuen Wan Line sections. Kwun Tong Line trains only runs as far as Waterloo (Yau Ma Tei), while Tsuen Wan Line trains run from Chater (Central) to Argyle (Mong Kok), and continue to Tsuen Wan (not open at the time) for training purposes.
* 10 May 1982: The line and part of its stations open to public. Only stations from Tsuen Wan to Lai King opened. Prince Edward Station was also opened for changing trains only.
* 17 May 1982: The rest of the stations, from Lai Wan (later renamed Mei Foo) to Sham Shui Po, opened. Passenegers are also able to use exits at Prince Edward Station.
* 31 May 1985: On the opening of the Island Line, 8 stations of Tsuen Wan Line were renamed. (See station list below for details)
* 23 May 1986: Central Station became an interchange station upon the extension of the Island Line to Sheung Wan.
* 11 Mar 1991: Tsuen Wan Line in breakdown, public transport in adverse effect.{{cn|date=July 2014}}
* 23 Apr 1993: Two interlinking carriages disconnzected during operation within the section between Tsuen Wan and Tai Wo Hau stations. Nobody was hurt, and MTRC reported that a hook between the two concerned carriages was not fastened, leading to the incident.
* 2 Jul 1997: To enable cross-platform interchange with the Tung Chung Line at Lai King Station, the original platform 1 (for westbound trains) was removed and filled, becoming part of today’s wider low-level island platform, allowing interchange with the new platform 4 (for Tung Chung Line eastbound trains) further behind. Tsuen Wan Line westbound trains now use the new platform 1 situated on the new high-level platform.
* 20 Mar 2003: To connect with the new KCR West Rail (now [[West Rail Line]]) Mei Foo Station, a passageway was built between the two stations, with a new exit D on about midway of the passageway.
* 5 Jan 2004: A fire started in a train on its way to Admiralty Station with 14 people injured. An arsonist was responsible for the fire, and the 65-year-old man was arrested the next day.
* 24 Oct 2004: A new exit G was constructed to link with new KCR East Rail (concerned section of the line now transferred to West Rail Line) East Tsim Sha Tsui Station, linking the passageway under Mody Road.
* 30 Mar 2005: Another new exit F was constructed to link with East Tsim Sha Tsui Station, linking the passageway under Middle Road.
* 21 Oct 2010: An overhead electric cable in Yau Ma Tei Station was broken during operation. At least 280,000 passengers were affected.

==Route description==
The Tsuen Wan Line runs from south to north. It is mostly underground, beginning at Central and crosses Victoria Harbour after Admiralty to Tsim Sha Tsui. Then, the line first runs underneath Nathan Road ([[Tsim Sha Tsui Station|Tsim Sha Tsui]] to [[Prince Edward Station|Prince Edward]]), then Cheung Sha Wan Road ([[Sham Shui Po Station|Sham Shui Po]] to [[Lai Chi Kok Station|Lai Chi Kok]]), before emerging from the hills at [[Lai King Station]].

The line is elevated between Lai King and [[Kwai Hing Station|Kwai Hing]] stations. Between [[Kwai Fong Station|Kwai Fong]] and Kwai Hing stations, the tracks are covered to minimise disturbance to residents nearby. After Kwai Hing station, the line re-enters the tunnel to [[Tai Wo Hau Station]], before finally re-emerging at ground level at [[Tsuen Wan Station]].

Some of the underground stations on the line are significantly deeper than the others. Tsim Sha Tsui and [[Admiralty Station (MTR)|Admiralty]] stations are deeper than the others (such as [[Sham Shui Po Station|Sham Shui Po]]) because they precede harbour crossings. Admiralty and [[Central Station (MTR)|Central]] stations are deeper than others because they provide [[cross-platform interchange]] with the deep level [[Island Line (MTR)|Island Line]].

{{nihongo|'''X Japan'''|?????????|Ekkusu Japan}} is a Japanese [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], formed in 1982 by [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]] and [[Toshi (musician)|Toshi]]. Originally named {{nihongo|'''X'''|????|Ekkusu}}, the group achieved their breakthrough success in 1989 with the release of their second album ''[[Blue Blood (X Japan album)|Blue Blood]]''. They started out mainly as a [[power metal|power]]/[[speed metal]] band, but later gravitated towards a [[progressive metal|progressive]] sound with an emphasis on ballads.

Besides being one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent label, the group is widely credited as one of the pioneers of [[visual kei]], a movement among Japanese musicians comparable to Western [[glam rock|glam]]. In 2003, [[HMV Group|HMV Japan]] ranked the band at number 40 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts.

After sixteen years, four albums, and selling out the 55,000 seat [[Tokyo Dome]] 18 times, X Japan disbanded in 1997. However after ten years, the band reunited in 2007 and recorded the new song "[[I.V.]]". Over the next two years they performed several concerts, including their first overseas show in Hong Kong, before holding their first North American tour from September 25 to October 10, 2010. In 2011, X Japan went on their first world tour throughout Europe, South America and Asia.

== History ==
=== 1977–92: X ===
In 1977, [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]] and [[Toshi (musician)|Toshi]] formed a band called Dynamite in their hometown of [[Tateyama, Chiba]], when they were just 11 years old. Dynamite changed its name to Noise in 1978, while they were still in high school. In 1982, Noise disbanded and Yoshiki and Toshi formed a new band, they named it X while they tried to think of another name,<ref>{{cite web| title = X Japan's Yoshiki on Touring the U.S., the Loss of Hide, and the Future of the Band| url = http://blogs.sfweekly.com/shookdown/2010/10/x_japans_yoshiki_on_coming_to.php?page=3| date = 2010-10-05| work=[[SF Weekly]]| accessdate = 2013-12-14}}</ref> but the name stuck. X began to actively perform in the Tokyo area in 1985 with a frequently changing lineup.

1992 began with three sold out concerts at the Tokyo Dome, titled Tokyo Dome 3 Days ~On the Verge of Destruction~, on January 5–7. The title was possibly more meaningful than it appears at first glance, as on January 31 it was announced that bass player [[Taiji (musician)|Taiji]] had left the group.<ref name="JRRLegend"/> The official reason given for his departure was due to musical differences. However in his autobiography, Taiji claims he was asked to leave because he confronted Yoshiki due to the substantial income gap between Yoshiki and each of the other members.<ref>

1995 was also quiet, until November 19 when the band began the tour for their next album, Dahlia Tour 1995–1996. Around this time, the group dropped most of its original [[visual kei]] aesthetics in favor of a more casual look.<ref name="JRRLegend"/> While it wasn't released until November 4, 1996, singles from the album had been released as early as a few months after ''Art of Life''. Though this caused ''[[Dahlia (album)|Dahlia]]'' to contain relatively little new material, the album reached number one on the charts.<ref>{{cite web| title = Oricon Weekly Album Chart for the third week of November 1996| url = http://www.oricon.co.jp/search/result.php?kbn=ja&types=rnk&year=1996&month=11&week=3&submit5.x=20&submit5.y=7| work = oricon.co.jp| accessdate = April 29, 2012| language = Japanese}}</ref> The tour was originally scheduled to end on March 31, 1996, however, it was cut short when Yoshiki [[hernia|herniated]] [[cervical vertebrae]] after the March 13 show.<ref name="JRRLegend"/> They did however perform their tradition of two Tokyo Dome concerts on December 30–31, titled {{nihongo|Resurrection Night|????}} and {{nihongo|Reckless Night|????}}.<ref name="JRRLegend"/>

On September  22, 1997, at 1pm, Yoshiki, hide, Pata and Heath held a press conference where they announced that X Japan would disband.<ref name="JRRLegend"/> Vocalist Toshi decided to leave the band as the glamorous, success-oriented life of a rock star failed to satisfy him emotionally, as opposed to a simpler life and career.<ref name="toshi_interview">{{cite web| title = Interview with Toshi| work = iyashi-no-concert.com| url = http://www.iyashi-no-concert.com/interview.html| accessdate = 2007-08-06| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071215071407/http://www.iyashi-no-concert.com/interview.html| archivedate = 2007-12-15}}</ref> He later stated that he had made the decision back in April 1996, though it wasn't publicly disclosed.<ref name="toshi_interview"/> X Japan performed their farewell show, aptly titled The Last Live ~Last Night~, at the Tokyo Dome on December 31, 1997, making it the last of five consecutive New Year's Eves the group performed at the stadium.

=== 1998–2007: Post X Japan ===
While reissues, compilations and live footage continued to be released, the members of X Japan pursued solo careers and other projects. [[hide (musician)|hide]], who released his first solo album ''[[Hide Your Face]]'' in 1994, continued his solo career with a sound distinctively different from X Japan's music, leaning more towards [[alternative rock]], until his death on May 2, 1998.<ref name="NYTimes"/> Just two months later, the debut album ''[[3.2.1.]]'' from his American-based band [[Zilch (band)|Zilch]], which included Ray McVeigh ([[The Professionals (band)|The Professionals]]), [[Paul Raven (musician)|Paul Raven]] ([[Killing Joke]]) and [[Joey Castillo]] ([[Queens of the Stone Age]]), was released.<ref name="NYTimes"/> His third solo album ''[[Ja, Zoo]]'', formally including his live band [[Spread Beaver]], was released and became his most successful, having reached number one and sold over a million copies.<ref name="RIAJ"/>

[[Toshi (musician)|Toshi]]'s solo career, which began in 1992, has been extensive, with him having released over 30 albums and performed numerous [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] shows for smaller audiences. According to his website, his Utatabi Traveling Concert tour included over 3,000 concerts between 1999 and 2003.<ref name="toshi_interview"/>

After both having released solo albums in the early 90s, [[Pata (musician)|Pata]] and [[Heath (musician)|Heath]] teamed up with Spread Beaver percussionist/[[Programming (music)|programmer]] I.N.A., who worked on several of X Japan's releases, to provide a track for the 1998 hide tribute album ''[[Tribute Spirits]]''.<ref name="tribute_spirits">{{cite web| title = hide TRIBUTE SPIRITS| work = amazon.co.jp| url = http://www.amazon.co.jp/hide-TRIBUTE-SPIRITS-%E3%82%AA%E3%83%A0%E3%83%8B%E3%83%90%E3%82%B9/dp/B00005FRAI| language = Japanese| accessdate = 2011-11-08}}</ref> The three would reunite again in 2000 to form Dope HEADz, which released two albums before ceasing activity.

Before the band's breakup, [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]] had already independently collaborated with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] drummer [[Roger Meddows Taylor|Roger Taylor]] on the single "Foreign Sand" and provided the Japanese contribution to the international [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] tribute album ''[[Kiss My Ass: Classic Kiss Regrooved]]'', an [[orchestra]]l arrangement of the song "[[Black Diamond (Kiss song)|Black Diamond]]".<ref name="kissfaq_kma">{{cite web| title = ''Kiss My Ass'' release information| work = kissfaq.com| url = http://www.kissfaq.com/discography/kma.html| accessdate = 2007-08-06}}</ref> A compilation with orchestral treatments of X Japan songs, titled ''[[Eternal Melody]]'' was also released.

X Japan's music developed in the wake of American and British [[glam metal|glam]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] music and is characterized by driving [[power metal]] compositions with [[symphonic metal|symphonic]] elements (e.g. "[[Kurenai (song)|Kurenai]]", "[[Silent Jealousy]]") and emotional [[Ballad (music)|ballad]]s (e.g. "[[Endless Rain]]", "[[Forever Love (X Japan song)|Forever Love]]").<ref name="NYTimes"/><ref name="asiaarts_x_best">{{cite web| last = Minnie| first = Chi| title = ''X Japan Best'' review| work = Asia Pacific Arts Online Magazine| url = http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=7936| accessdate = 2007-09-10}}</ref><ref name="amg_bio">{{cite web| last = Seida| first = Linda| title = X Japan biography at Allmusic| work = allmusic.com| url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p320432|pure_url=yes}}| accessdate = 2007-08-06}}</ref> Many of the group's songs make use of [[orchestra]]ted passages, particularly on longer tracks such as the ten and a half minute "[[Tears (X Japan song)|Tears]]", "[[Crucify My Love]]", and the twenty-nine minute "[[Art of Life]]". The majority of the band's lyrics are in Japanese, the band's native language, however many instances show the lyrics alternating from Japanese to English and back. Examples of this include the spoken-word background vocals during the bridge of "[[Rusty Nail (song)|Rusty Nail]]", and multiple lines (including the entire prechorus) of the song "[[Week End (X Japan song)|Week End]]".

The majority of the band's catalog of music was written by [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]] with relatively little composition from the other members. [[hide (musician)|hide]] contributed several songs, including the single "[[Scars (X Japan song)|Scars]]", while [[Pata (musician)|Pata]]'s only claim is "White Wind from Mr. Martin ~Pata's Nap~". [[Toshi (musician)|Toshi]]'s contributions are limited to lyrics for a few songs. [[Taiji (musician)|Taiji]] contributed music to a couple of songs, notably "Voiceless Screaming" from the album ''[[Jealousy (X Japan album)|Jealousy]]'', for which, when performed live, he played the acoustic guitar. [[Heath (musician)|Heath]]'s only writing credit is the instrumental song "Wriggle" on the 1996 album ''[[Dahlia (album)|Dahlia]]'', which he wrote with Pata. Only one song is credited as a full band collaboration, "Easy Fight Rambling" on the 1989 album ''[[Blue Blood (X Japan album)|Blue Blood]]''. Of song's from the band's lesser-known former members, only the track "Time Trip Loving" from the single "Orgasm", composed by Jun with Toshi writing the lyrics, was officially released. In 2010 it was reported that [[Sugizo]] had written some songs, though no further information has been given since.<ref>{{cite web |title=X JAPAN Heading Towards Their First American Tour in October.

Yoshiki's composing style tends to make use of chords in sequences of eights or more with riff-based motifs or call-and-response style phrasing. He has maintained this style for the majority of his career as a composer. Having played classical piano since he was four years old, Yoshiki claims to be as influenced by classical music as he is by rock. While also serving as the main songwriter Yoshiki has production credit on much of X Japan's later material. During live performances the band relies, for the most part, on its members (with drummer and pianist Yoshiki and guitarist and violinist Sugizo switching between their instruments) and prerecorded tracks for [[String section|orchestrated strings]], [[spoken word]] passages, and more recently, some of hide's guitar parts.<ref name="wowow_live_2008-03-28"/>

'''Dir En Grey''' (stylized as '''DIR EN GREY''' and previously as '''Dir en grey''') is a Japanese [[Heavy metal music|metal]] band formed in 1997 and currently signed to Firewall Div., a sub-division of [[Free-Will]]. As of 2013, they have recorded eight full-length records with a lineup consistent since its inception. Numerous stylistic changes have made the [[Music genre|genre]] of their music difficult to determine, though it is generally considered to be a form of metal. Originally a [[visual kei]] band, the band has opted for less dramatic attire in recent years.<ref name="blistering_deg">{{cite web| last = Mascia| first = Mike| title = Dir En Grey feature interview| publisher = ''[[Blistering]]''| url = http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/12842/tempidx/5/menuid/3| accessdate = 2007-08-07}}</ref><ref name="kerrang_kyo_interview">{{Citation| last = Brannigan| first = Paul| title = The Perfect Stranger| newspaper = [[Kerrang!]]| pages = 42–43| date = 2008-11-19| url = http://www2.kerrang.com/2008/11/kerrang_magazine_19112008.html}}</ref>


==History==
===1997–1999: Early career===
Dir En Grey was preceded by the [[Indie (music)|independent]] rock band La:Sadie's, which included four of Dir En Grey's members before it ended activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/groupe-groupe-Dir_En_Grey-l-en.html|title=Dir En Grey|publisher=Spirit of Metal|accessdate=2009-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jame-world.com/us/database-artists-overview-44-dir-en-grey.html|title=Dir En Grey|publisher=Jame World|author=Cage|date=2009-06-11}}</ref> They disbanded due to leader and bassist [[Kisaki]] not wanting to debut as he felt that it was too soon, but guitarist [[Kaoru (musician)|Kaoru]] believed that they were ready for it. After parting ways with Kisaki, Kaoru, [[Kyo (musician)|Kyo]], [[Die (musician)|Die]] and [[Shinya (musician)|Shinya]] recruited bassist [[Toshiya (musician)|Toshiya]] and regrouped as a new band on February 2, 1997.<ref name="yarouze_1999_p23">{{Citation| title     = All about Dir En Grey| newspaper = Yarouze| publisher = TJ Mook| page = 23| date = 1999-10-02| isbn = 978-4-7966-1613-3}}</ref> They released their first [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Missa (EP)|Missa]]'', a few months later. According to Toshiya, the name "Dir En Grey" was chosen because it "sounded right," and is composed of words from several languages, so that people would not be able to attach a specific meaning to it other than the band's name itself.<ref name="untitled_rock_show_interview">{{Citation| work = [[Steven's Untitled Rock Show]]| publisher = [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]]| date = 2007-02-27}}</ref> However, in another interview Kaoru said "At the time we chose the band name, it had some meaning but right now it doesn’t express the band anymore, so it has come to not mean anything specific. We chose the band name because it sounded right, and it also reflects an image that probably doesn’t exist elsewhere."<ref name="blistering_deg"/>

They first attracted mainstream attention in 1998 by entering the top ten on the [[Oricon]] music charts with the still independently produced songs "[[Jealous (Dir En Grey song)|Jealous]]" and "[[-I'll-]]".<ref name="amg_tmoab">{{cite web| last = Jurek| first = Thom| title = ''The Marrow of a Bone'' review| work = allmusic.com| url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r950208/review|pure_url=yes}}| accessdate = 2007-08-07}}</ref><ref name="oricon_singles">{{cite web| title = Single chart positions| work = oricon.co.jp| url = http://www.oricon.co.jp/artists/s/6902/| accessdate = 2007-08-07}}</ref> Five subsequent singles, arranged and produced by [[X Japan]] co-founder [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki Hayashi]], were published during the first half of 1999, the band's first full-length record, ''[[Gauze (album)|Gauze]]'', followed. One of the shows in support for the album (filmed at the [[Osaka-jo Hall]]) would later become the first of several live concerts to be released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]].

===2000–2004: From ''Macabre'' to ''Vulgar''===
In 2000, vocalist Kyo was hospitalized with hearing trouble and several dates of the tour in support of Dir En Grey's then upcoming album, ''[[Macabre (album)|Macabre]]'', had to be postponed. Tour 00 >> 01 Macabre eventually took off later the same year and was concluded at [[Nippon Budokan]], shortly after the release of the single "[[Ain't Afraid to Die]]" in April 2001.

In the following year, along with the release of a third full-length album, ''[[Kisou]]'', Dir En Grey gave their first performances abroad, touring China, Taiwan, and South Korea. Back in Japan, the last dates of the lengthy Rettou Gekishin Angya tour were already in support for the band's second EP, ''[[Six Ugly]]''. In summer 2003, Dir En Grey performed at [[Akasaka Blitz]] for five evenings in a single week, with each show (except the first) themed after a certain album, the last featuring songs from the then yet to be released ''[[Vulgar (album)|Vulgar]]''. A DVD set, titled  ''[[Blitz 5 Days]]'', was later released exclusively for members of the band's official fan club, titled A Knot. ''Vulgar'' was  released in September 2003, and tours in support for the record would last well into 2004.

===2005–2006: Early non-Asian touring===
In 2005, Dir En Grey performed in Europe for the first time. Their concerts in [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]] (as part of the It Withers and Withers tour) sold out without promotion, save for newsletters by import record stores and internet-based word of mouth.<ref name="grammy_kabuki">{{cite web| last = Reesman| first = Brian| title = Kabuki Rock| work = grammy.com| date = 2006-11-30| url = http://www.grammylive.com/Latin/News/Default.aspx?newsID=2278| accessdate = 2007-09-24}}</ref> The band also performed at two major festivals, [[Rock am Ring]] and Rock im Park. Becoming more involved with the international music scene, they had French band [[Eths]] open for them at the Paris concert and invited American musician [[Wednesday 13]] and his band to play at a show in Japan. Dir En Grey also appeared at the Japanese leg of that year's [[Taste of Chaos]] tour.

2005 saw the group's first official European releases as well, in the form of that year's album ''[[Withering to Death.]]'' The band's music had previously been available to fans not living in Asia through means of [[Import (international trade)|import]] and Internet [[file-sharing]] only. The album also managed to achieve Dir En Grey's first non-Asian chart position, reaching No.&nbsp;31 in the Finnish album charts. The subsequent single, "[[Clever Sleazoid]]", later climbed to No.&nbsp;15 on the singles charts in the same country.<ref name="finnish_charts">{{cite web| title = Finnish chart positions| work = finnishcharts.com| url = http://finnishcharts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Dir+en+Grey| accessdate = 2008-07-07}}</ref> Several Dir En Grey songs were also featured in the [[Film soundtrack|soundtrack]] of the 2005 film ''[[Death Trance]]''.<ref name="imbd_death_trace">{{cite web| title = Credits for ''Death Trance''| work = imdb.com| url = http://imdb.com/title/tt0443737/fullcredits| accessdate = 2007-08-07}}</ref>

Beginning in 2009, Dir En Grey made their first thorough tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland with ''[[Kerrang!]]'''s "Relentless Tour '09" alongside [[Mindless Self Indulgence]], [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[Black Tide]] and [[In Case of Fire]]. In February, the band announced the public release of the live DVD, ''[[Tour 08 The Rose Trims Again]]'', as well as switching European record labels to the newly founded [[Okami Records]], a sister label of their former European representation, [[Gan-Shin]].

During spring of 2009, the band began to fully promote ''Uroboros'' with a series of nationwide tours, under the title Tour 09 Feast of V Senses. The tour was interrupted briefly while in [[Sapporo]] and [[Sendai]], with an announcement on the band's official website, explaining that Kyo had been diagnosed with [[edema]] of the larynx, and would require the postponement of three shows, which were rescheduled for early May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.direngrey.co.jp/english/0406.html|title=

The festival performances included their third appearances at Rock am Ring and Rock im Park, as well as their initial concerts at [[Download Festival]], [[Nova Rock]], and [[Metaltown]]. Among the headlining shows, Dir En Grey were also making debut concerts in Italy and the Czech Republic.

Their new single was released on December 2, 2009 and reached number 2 on the Oricon Weekly Chart: the highest position to date for the band. Their 2009 tour season ended with a three-live tour titled Dorje. They finally ended their long ''Uroboros'' centered tour by doing two back to back performances at the [[Nippon Budokan]], titled Uroboros: with the proof in the name of living…, where tickets sold out in 15 minutes.

<!--When editing this section, please consider that throwing many unnecessary genres at the unsuspecting reader does little to provide an accessible overview.-->
Dir En Grey has been categorized in many genres such as [[extreme metal]], [[alternative music|alternative]], [[experimental music|experimental]], [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] and various others. Dir En Grey's format has been subject to change throughout their career, initially being a rather experimental form of [[alternative rock]]. Some tracks of their debut album ''[[Gauze (album)|Gauze]]'' also demonstrated a distinct [[pop music|pop]] appeal, which was largely dropped in favor of a more [[progressive rock|progressive]] sound on the following albums, ''[[Macabre (album)|Macabre]]'' and ''[[Kisou]]''. While up to that point some songs had already been more fast-paced, raw and aggressive than others, the band's music took a decisive turn with the release of the EP ''[[Six Ugly]]'', from then on sporting more [[heavy metal music|metal]] influences in general. Dir En Grey's style has since gravitated towards [[riff]]s and [[song structure (popular music)|song structures]] more along the lines of contemporary North American fusion genres, such as [[nu metal]] and [[metalcore]], though their album, ''[[Uroboros (album)|Uroboros]]'', sees them return to the more experimental and oriental sound of their earlier albums. Since its release many sources have begun classifying Dir En Grey as [[progressive metal]]. In a review of their sixth full length album, ''[[The Marrow of a Bone]]'', [[Allmusic]]'s Thom Jurek comments on their evolution and diversity, saying:

{{cquote2|quotetext=The band's sound has embraced tendencies of American metal and nu metal (they participated in Korn's Family Values tour in America), and Dir en Grey bring so many other sonic and musical elements into the mix that they extend not only the reach of their own music, but the boundaries of any music they happen to incorporate into their sound.|personquoted=Thom Jurek, ''Allmusic''<ref name="amg_tmoab"/>}}

Kyo's singing is considered a pivotal aspect of the band, and he has gained recognition for his distinctive vocal work and for his large range and versatility, being able to "howl, croon, emote cleanly, scream, shriek, growl, bellow, and make nearly inhuman sounds."<ref name="amg_tmoab">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r950208/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=Marrow of a Bone > Review by Thom Jurek|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> Jurek has compared him favorably to experimental and avant-garde vocalists [[Mike Patton]] and [[Diamanda Galas]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1441066/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=Uroboros > Review}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0002173137|pure_url=yes}}|title=Dum Spiro Spero > Review}}</ref> All lyrics are written by Kyo and deal with subjects such as society, mass media as well as sexual obsessions and love, usually with negative implications. The vocabulary varies from subtle to explicit and several songs rely heavily on [[double entendre]]s and other wordplay, often involving the multiple meanings of a [[kanji]] character.<ref name="centigrade_translations">{{cite web| last = Stewart| first = Brian|author2=Sakuma, Takako| title = Lyrics translations with notes| work = centigrade-j.com| url = http://www.centigrade-j.com/translations/direngrey.htm| accessdate = 2007-08-07| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070324061146/www.centigrade-j.com/translations/direngrey.htm| archivedate = 2007-03-24}}</ref>

'''''Abigail's Party''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] for stage and [[television]] devised and directed in 1977 by [[Mike Leigh]]. It is a [[suburb]]an [[situation comedy]] [[comedy of manners|of manners]], and a [[satire]] on the aspirations and tastes of the new [[middle class]] that emerged in Britain in the 1970s. The play developed in lengthy improvisations during which Mike Leigh explored the characters with the [[actor]]s, but did not always reveal the incidents that would occur during the play. The production opened in April 1977 at the [[Hampstead Theatre]], and returned after its initial run in the summer of 1977, 104 performances in all. A recording was arranged at the [[BBC]] as a ''[[Play for Today]]'', produced by  Margaret Matheson, shot at BBC Scotland, and transmitted in November 1977.

==Performances==
The [[Teleplay|television version]] was abridged from over two hours to 104 minutes; the record played by Beverly in the original stage production at the [[Hampstead Theatre]] was "Light My Fire" by [[José Feliciano]] and in the TV production it was the 1976 hit "Forever and Ever" by [[Demis Roussos]] - Leigh had to replace nearly all the music with artists recorded on British labels, for copyright reasons, in case the BBC sold the play to the United States. As José Feliciano became Demis Roussos, so [[Elvis Presley]] gave way to [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]. Other music used in the BBC production included "[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]" by Donna Summer and a piece of [[library music]] by [[Robert Farnon]] entitled "Blue Theme".

==Original cast==
The original play starred [[Alison Steadman]] as Beverly, and Tim Stern as her husband Laurence.  They are holding a drinks party for their new neighbours Angela ([[Janine Duvitski]]), and her husband Tony ([[John Salthouse]]). They also invite Susan (Thelma Whiteley), another neighbour. Abigail herself is [[Unseen character|never seen]] – she is Susan's 15-year-old daughter, who is holding her first teenage party next door. For the [[Teleplay|television version]] the original cast reprised their roles, with the exception of Thelma Whiteley, who was replaced by Harriet Reynolds.

Each of the original cast largely devised the [[back story]] to their character. John Salthouse brought his early career as a footballer with [[Crystal Palace FC|Crystal Palace]] to that of Tony. According to Leigh, discussions at the improvised sessions included whether Beverly's name should have a third 'e' or not. The most complex relationship was worked out between Angela and Tony. Little of this is disclosed during the narrative, although something of it becomes apparent when Angela steps in to care first for Sue, then the stricken Laurence, and the centre of power between the couple starts to shift noticeably.

==Characters==
*'''Beverly Moss''' - An ex-department store make-up representative, 'a quondam beautician', she has failed her driving test three times. During the play, she flirts with Tony and is always trying to impress her guests. She considers her taste in music ([[Jose Feliciano]]/[[Demis Roussos]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]) and art ([[kitsch]] [[erotica]]) to be every bit as good as that of her husband. Immensely proud of her home, she nonetheless admits that she cannot use the gadgets in her kitchen.  Beverly throughout the night offers her guests drinks and cigarettes (despite the fact that Tony and Angela have recently given up), which they usually refuse but end up taking due to her being unable to take no for an answer.  Beverly effectively forces her guests to agree with her on most topics, for instance on the music they should listen to, or whether olives should be served, in each instance using their apparent consensus to score points with her husband.  Despite her 'sophisticated' tastes and carefully groomed appearance, she was memorably described by [[Alan Bennett]] as having "shoulders like a [[lifeguard]], and a walk to match."  According to the critic [[Michael Coveney]]; "Beverly is undoubtedly a monster. But she is also a deeply sad and vulnerable monster...The whole point about Beverly is that she is childless, and there is a sense in which that grotesque exterior carapace is a mask of inner desolation."<ref>Coveney, p.119-120</ref>

*'''Laurence Moss''' - [[Estate agent]] with 'Wibley Webb'. Laurence is Beverly's husband, and the pair frequently argue. He aspires to the finer things in life: leather-bound [[Shakespeare]] (which he thinks "can't be read"), prints of [[Van Gogh]] and [[L. S. Lowry|Lowry]] paintings, and [[Beethoven]], which he forces on his guests at unfortunate moments. He seems powerless to compete with Beverly's more flamboyant persona, and compensates by working too much, as his wife points out on several occasions. He considers a brisk handshake to be correct practice after a dance.  While Laurence starts off behaving normally during the party, as he becomes increasingly hen-pecked by his wife, he begins to act in a more [[neurosis|neurotic]] manner, to the point where he too becomes an annoyance to his guests. While Susan welcomes the increasing 'cosmopolitanism' of the area, Laurence does not.

*'''Tony Cooper''' - He works in computing—merely as a [[computer operator]], his wife twice points out—and used to play professional football for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] but it "didn't work out". Tony is quiet throughout most of the play, usually appearing uneasy and giving one-word answers, but towards the end he becomes somewhat irate and quick-tempered, particularly with his wife.  Beverly flirts with him in the second half of the play, much to Laurence's annoyance. At one point Beverly asks Angela if he is violent. 'No, he's not violent. Just a bit nasty. Like, the other day, he said to me, he'd like to sellotape my mouth. And that's not very nice, is it? 'It certainly isn't, Ange!' says Beverly. The surname Cooper was not mentioned in the original script or [[teleplay]] and is taken from a picture on the Mike Leigh At The BBC DVD box set.

*'''Angela Cooper''' -  Tony's wife.  A [[nurse]], Angela appears very meek and somewhat childlike, unintelligent and tactless (much like Steadman's character in a previous Leigh play, [[Nuts in May]]).  She cannot drive, as Tony does not want her to.  Interested in the mundane and commonplace, much to her husband's annoyance, she comes into her own when Sue feels queasy and after Laurence suffers a heart attack.

*'''Susan Lawson''' - Sue was getting divorced at the same time the other characters were getting married, as pointed out by Angela. She is a quiet character who does not really have the courage to say no. She is the only female visibly not 'dressed-up' for the gathering; clearly, she would rather be elsewhere. Throughout the play, Laurence attempts to find common ground with her.  As originally cast, she towers over the diminutive Laurence, and Beverly's exhortations for her to dance with him only compound her awkwardness.

==Plot==
The terrain is 'the [[London]] side of [[Essex]]', 'theoretical [[Romford]]' according to Leigh.<ref>Coveney, p.116</ref> Beverly Moss invites her new neighbours, Angela and Tony, who moved into the road just two weeks ago, over for drinks. She has also invited her neighbour Susan (Sue), divorced for three years, whose fifteen-year-old daughter Abigail is holding a party at home. Beverly's husband Laurence comes home late from work, just before the guests arrive. The gathering starts off in a stiff, insensitive, British-middle-class way as the virtual strangers tentatively gather, until Beverly and Laurence start sniping at each other. As Beverly serves more drinks and the [[alcohol]] takes effect, Beverly flirts more and more overtly with Tony, as Laurence sits impotently by. After a tirade about art, Laurence suffers a fatal heart attack. Within this simple framework, all of the obsessions, prejudices, fears and petty competitiveness of the protagonists are ruthlessly exposed.

==Class==
Sue represents the middle-class, being the ex-wife of an architect and living in one of the older houses on the street. She also brings a bottle of wine, and has not yet eaten, indicating that she is expecting dinner, as opposed to an extended evening of drinks. The others present have already had their "tea". Beverly and Laurence represent the aspirational lower middle-classes, and Tony and Angela the "new arrivals" are also lower middle-class, but Tony is less successful than Laurence. Despite their similar background, Laurence seeks to differentiate between himself and Tony by highlighting the differences in their general level of culture, and makes a couple of condescending comments directed at him, and/or for Sue's benefit. For example, Laurence shows off a leather-bound collected works of Shakespeare to Sue (which we know are unread), before pointedly asking Tony if he reads, insinuating that he doesn't.

==Critical response==
[[Channel 4]]'s reviewer said: "''Abigail's Party'' still ranks as the most painful hundred minutes in British comedy-drama."

In a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] drawn up by the [[British Film Institute]] in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, ''Abigail's Party'' was placed 11th. It also appeared in a ''[[Radio Times]]'' poll to find the top 40 greatest TV shows on British television, published in August 2003.

Some critics (notably [[Tom Paulin]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/2151325.stm |title=Programmes &#124; Newsnight &#124; Review &#124; Abigail's Party |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-07-25 |accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref>) have responded more negatively, noting that ''Abigail's Party'' appears to represent a middle-class ''[[schadenfreude]]'', with the only true middle class character, Sue, looking on at the antics of the couples with disdain. Nonetheless Leigh has responded that none of this prevents the characters (Beverly and Laurence in particular) reflecting the real-life behaviour of aspiring couples in mid-1970s suburbia. Other aspects of the narrative which appear to conform to this stereotype have become 'correct practice' but the naive storing of a red wine, a [[beaujolais]], in the [[refrigerator]] ironically is the correct practice for beaujolais nouveau.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article185085.ece | location=London | work=The Independent | first=David | last=Thomson | title=Mike Leigh: Cruel chronicler of suburbia's nasty secrets and lies | date=2002-07-21}}</ref>

==Revival==
The TV version was released on [[VHS]] in 1984 and [[DVD]] in 2003.

The play was staged in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 2003 with [[Elizabeth Berrington]] as Beverly. It was revived in [[Wolverhampton]] at the [[Grand Theatre, Wolverhampton|Grand Theatre]] (2005), and at the [[Northcott Theatre]] in [[Exeter]] (2006).

In March 2012, a new revival of the play directed by [[Lindsay Posner]] opened at the [[Menier Chocolate Factory]] in London. Starring [[Jill Halfpenny]] as Beverly, [[Joe Absolom]] as (Tony), [[Natalie Casey]] as (Angela), [[Susannah Harker]] as (Sue) and [[Andy Nyman]] as (Laurence), it subsequently transferred to [[Wyndham's Theatre]] in the West End.

In May 2013 Abigail's Party was put up by [[San Francisco Playhouse]] and received outstanding reviews.<ref>{{cite web|title=SF Gate Abigail's Party|url=http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/Abigail-s-Party-review-Fine-diversion-4550185.php|accessdate=2014-05-14}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* The play features an argument between Beverly and Laurence over the artistic merit of the memorable 1970s painting ''Wings of Love'' by Stephen Pearson, popular yet controversial at the time due to its portrayal of a naked man and woman with a giant swan.
* On its third showing, there was an ITV strike, leaving viewers with a choice of either BBC 1 or a highbrow BBC 2 offering, (Channel 4 had not yet started), and ''Abigail's Party'' attracted 16 million viewers.<ref>Coveney, p.114</ref>

'''Aris Christofellis''' ({{lang-el|???? ????????????}}; born 5 February 1960) is a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[sopranist]] (male soprano) and musicologist.

==Life and career==
Aris Christofellis was born in [[Athens]] in 1960. After studying [[piano]] in Athens and [[Paris]] with several teachers including the famous pianist Francis Clidat, he decided to concentrate on developing his unique singing voice of male soprano, studying with Fofi Sarandopoulo. He made his debut in [[Bordeaux]] in 1984. In 1985 he sang [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s "Exsultate, jubilate" at [[Cannes]] Midem Classique inauguration concert, where he was received enthusiastically by both the public and the critics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tp4.rub.de/~ak/disc/ac|title=Aris Christofellis|accessdate=21 December 2011}}</ref>

His repertoire extends from [[Renaissance]] to contemporary music, but he focuses on the Italian [[baroque]] [[opera]] of the 18th and early 19th century. Aris Christofellis' vocal technique and taste for historically informed ornaments have been highly acclaimed across the world and as a [[musicologist]], he has brought to light many works of this period and has dealt in particular with the ornamentation of the vocal music of the 18th and 19th centuries. In addition to lieder and folk songs, he concentrates mainly on Baroque opera and is known for singing roles written for castrati.<ref>{{cite book |title=Therapeutic voicework: principles and practice for the use of singing as a Therapy (Art Therapies Series)|author=Newham, Paul|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year=1998|page=243}}</ref> He maintains an extensive discography and his numerous recordings made for EMI Classics between the mid 1990s and early 2000 are of enormous importance for the rediscovery of the vocal music from the late Baroque and early Classic period.

Since the end of the 1990s, Aris Christofellis reduced significantly his concert and opera performances and has started a successful career as a singing teacher in Greece and in several other Countries, including Italy.

'''Lahti''' ({{IPA-fi|?l?xti}}, {{lang-sv|Lahtis}}) is a [[List of cities and towns in Finland|city]] and [[Municipalities of Finland|municipality]] in [[Finland]].

Lahti is the capital of the [[Päijänne Tavastia|Päijänne Tavastia region]]. It is situated on a bay at the southern end of lake [[Vesijärvi]] about {{convert|100|km|-1}} north-east of the capital [[Helsinki]]. In English, the Finnish word Lahti literally means ''bay''.

The symbol of the city depicts a train wheel surrounded by sparkling flames.

==History==

Lahti was first mentioned in documents in 1445. The village belonged to the [[parish]] of [[Hollola]] and was located at the medieval trade route of [[Ylinen Viipurintie]], which linked the towns of [[Hämeenlinna]] and [[Vyborg]].

[[File:Alfred-Caweenin-asemaaka-vuodelta-1878.jpg|thumb|left|320px|Lahti town plan from 1878 by Alfred Caween.]]
[[File:Lahti old map.jpg|thumb|left|320px|A map of Lahti made by Nils Westermark in 1750-1752.]]
The completion of the [[Riihimäki-Saint Petersburg railroad|Riihimäki – St. Petersburg railway line]] in 1870 and the [[Vesijärvi]] canal in 1871 turned Lahti into a lively station, and industrial installations began to spring up around it. For a long time, the railway station at Vesijärvi Harbour was the second busiest station in Finland. Craftsmen, merchants, a few civil servants and a lot of industrial workers soon mixed in with the existing agricultural peasantry.

On 19 June 1877, almost the entire village was burned to the ground. However, the accident proved to be a stroke of luck for the development of the place, as it led to the authorities resuming their deliberations about establishing a town in Lahti. The village was granted [[market town]] rights in 1878 and an empire-style, grid town plan was approved, which included a large market square and wide [[boulevard]]s. This grid plan still forms the basis of the city center. Most of the buildings were low wooden houses bordering the streets.

Lahti was founded during a period of severe economic recession. The [[Russian Empire]] was encumbered by the war against [[Turkey]]. The recession also slowed down the building of the township: land would not sell and often plots were not built on for some time. In its early years, the town with its meagre 200 inhabitants was too small to provide any kind of foundation for trade. At the end of the 1890s, Lahti’s [[Township Board]] increased its efforts to enable Lahti to be turned into a city. In spring 1904, the efforts finally bore fruit as the [[Governing Senate|Senate]] approved of the application, although it was another eighteen months before [[Tsar Nicholas II]] finally gave his blessing and issued an ordinance for establishing the city of Lahti.

At the end of 1905, the area that now comprises Lahti accommodated around 8,200 people of whom just under 3,000 lived in the city itself. All essential municipal institutions were built in just ten years, including a hospital 
and a city hall. At the same time, a rapid increase in brick houses was taking place in the centre of the city.

In the early 1920s the city gained possession of the grounds of the Lahti Manor, an important piece of land previously blocking the city from the lake. Large-scale industrial operations grew rapidly in the 1930s as did the population; Lahti, at the time, was one of Finland’s fastest-growing cities, and before the start of the [[Winter War]] its population was approaching 30,000.

[[File:Centre of Lahti.JPG|thumb|right|320px|The city centre of Lahti]]

Through the addition of new areas in 1924, 1933 and 1956, Lahti grew, both in terms of population and surface area. Especially strong was the growth after the wars, when Lahti accepted about 10,000 immigrants from [[Karelia]], after the region was surrendered to the [[Soviet Union]], and then later in the 1960 and 70's as a result of mass urbanization. The population growth came to a sharp end in 1975 and the city has since grown very little.

==Culture==

[[File:Sibelius Hall.jpg|165px|thumb|right|Sibelius Hall]]

Lahti harbors cultural ambitions, and recent years saw the building of a large congress and concert center, the [[Sibelius Hall]]. This has sparked much controversy amongst the population, many of whom {{who|date=November 2013}} feel that the money used for these purposes 
would be better spent on [[health care]] and [[education]]. Lahti has one of Finland's most widely known symphony orchestras, the [[Lahti Symphony Orchestra]] (''Sinfonia Lahti''), which performs both classical and popular music, notably concentrating on music by [[Jean Sibelius]].

Lahti’s annual music festival programme includes such events as Lahti Organ Festival, Jazz at the market place and Sibelius Festival.

==Sports==

[[File:Lahti sports center.jpg|thumb|left|165px|[[Lahden Stadion|Lahti Sports Center – Stadium]]]]
Lahti is best known for its annually held World Cup winter games, the [[Lahti Ski Games]] (Salpausselän kisat). Ski jumping events of Lahti Ski Games are part of the [[Nordic Tournament]].

For the [[1952 Summer Olympics]], it hosted some of the [[Football at the 1952 Summer Olympics|football]] preliminaries.

The city endeavors for achievements in [[sport]], which has led to such things as the hosting of a [[World Games]] event. As of 2010, it is the only city to host the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships]] six times, doing so in 1926, 1938, 1958, 1978, 1989, and 2001.

The city also has an [[ice hockey]] team, the [[Pelicans (ice hockey)|Lahden Pelicans]], an [[Association Football]] (soccer) club, [[FC Lahti]], and a [[basketball]] team [[Namika Lahti]]. In July–August 2009, Lahti hosted the 18th [[World Masters Athletics Championships]], an outdoor age-group track meet for men and women 35 and over.

==Education==
[[File:Lahti - yhteiskoulu.jpg|right|thumb|160px| Lahden Yhteiskoulu from 1896]]
[[File:Lahden Kansanopiston torni.jpg|right|thumb|160px| Lahti Folk High School]]

Lahti's greatest educational asset is the highly valued [[Lahti Institute of Design|Institute of Design]], which is a part of [[Lahti University of Applied Sciences]]. The institute has gained international recognition in particular for jewelry and industrial design. Other areas of expertise include metal, woodworking and furniture.

The Faculty of Physical Activity at Lahti University of Applied Sciences offers a bachelor's degree programme in Sports Studies. The Sports Institute of Finland, which is based in Vierumäki near Lahti, is the most versatile centre of sports education in the country. In addition, Pajulahti Training Center, located in the neighboring town of Nastola, is one of the leading sports and training centres in Finland.

Lahti is also the home of Helsinki University's department of Environmental and Ecological Sciences (Faculty of Biosciences). It's the only science department of the University of Helsinki located outside the greater Helsinki area.

==Economy==

The economic region of Lahti, which includes the surrounding municipalities, was strongly affected by the collapse of Finnish-Soviet trade and by the recession in the early 1990s.

The value of production slumped, especially in the mechanical engineering industry and other manufacturing industries (e.g. the furniture industry). Production also decreased in the textile and clothing industry. 
In 1990, there were 90,370 jobs in the Lahti Region. The number of jobs diminished over the next couple of years, so that in 1993 there were fewer than 70,000 jobs in the Lahti Region. The number of jobs had slowly increased to 79,138 in 1999.

'''Ch'arki''' ([[Quechua language|Quechua]] for dried, salted meat,<ref>Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)</ref> hispanicized spellings ''charque, charqui, charquí'') is a form of [[Jerky (food)|jerky]] common in [[South America]] made from dried and salted [[meat]], originally [[llama]], nowadays mostly [[beef]]. [[Llama]] is still widely used in [[Bolivia]]. This was a very popular way to preserve meat in [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Brazil]]. It was industrialized in ''charqueadas'', also named ''saladeros'' (in Uruguay).

When encountered by the [[Spanish people|Spanish]], the [[Inca Empire]] supplied ''[[Tambo (Incan structure)|tampu]]'' ([[Public_house#Inns|inn]]s) along the [[Inca road system]] with llama jerky so that travelers would have something to eat. The Inca used a [[freeze drying]] process that took advantage of both the cold dry mountain air and strong sun in their homeland.

The [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] word ''ch'arki'' is the origin of the word jerky.<ref>http://etimologias.dechile.net/?charqui</ref><ref>http://academic.uprm.edu/dpesante/5355/charqui.pdf</ref>

'''Kuopio''' is a city and a [[municipality]] located in the region of [[Northern Savonia]], [[Finland]]. A population of {{formatnum: {{Infobox Finnish municipality/population count|Kuopio}} }}<ref name="population_count" /> makes it the eighth biggest city in the country. The city has a total area of {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish municipality/total area|Kuopio}}|km2}}, of which {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish municipality/waters area|Kuopio}}|km2|abbr=on}} is water<ref name="total_area" /> and half forest. The [[population density]] is only {{convert|{{#expr: {{Infobox Finnish municipality/population density|Kuopio}} round 0}}|PD/km2|abbr=on}}, but the city's [[urban area]]s are populated very densely (urban area: 1 617.6 /km²<ref name="statsf">{{cite web |url= http://www.tilastokeskus.fi/ajk/tiedotteet/v2008/tiedote_001_2008-01-15.html|title= Taajamissa asuu 84 prosenttia väestöstä|accessdate=7 January 2009 |work= |publisher= Statistics Finland|date=15 January 2008}}</ref>), nationally second only to capital [[Helsinki]] (urban area: 1,690.0/km²<ref name="statsf" />).<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = Leo Kosonen | title = Kuopio 2015: Jalankulku-, joukkoliikenne- ja autokaupunki| publisher = Finland’s Ministry of the Environment | page = 42 | url = http://www.ymparisto.fi/download.asp?contentid=75863&lan=fi | date = | isbn = 978-952-11-2852-3 }}</ref> The population of the entire Kuopio region is 119,472.<ref name="kuopion_kaupunkilehti_20080319">''Kuopion Kaupunkilehti'', 19 March 2008, bottom of page 4)</ref>

The town of [[Nilsiä]] joined Kuopio at the beginning of the year 2013 and Kuopio’s population surpassed the 100,000 mark.

== Name ==
There are several explanations behind the name ''Kuopio''. The first is that in the 16th century, a certain influential person named Kauhanen in [[Tavinsalmi]] changed his name to Skopa and the people's pronunciation was ''Coopia'' and finally ''Cuopio''. The second explanation is that it comes from the verb ''kuopia'', meaning "paw", as when a [[horse]] paws the ground with its [[hoof]]. A third theory is that it came from a certain [[Karelian language|Karelian]] man's name ''Prokopij'', from [[Ruokolahti]] in the Middle Ages.<ref>[http://www.kuopio.fi/net.nsf/TD/091003151756754?OpenDocument ]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> This is the most probable explanation, supported by the [[Research Institute for the Languages of Finland]].

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=November 2011}}
Kuopio was founded in 1653 by Governor [[Peter Brahe]], but the official date is recognized as November 17, 1775, when King [[Gustav III of Sweden]] ordered the establishment of the city of Kuopio. The municipality of [[Karttula]] joined the city of Kuopio in 2011,<ref>{{Cite news | title = Karttula sulautuu Kuopioon" & "Karttula ja Kuopio yhteen | work= Myöhänen, Pentti & Manner, Matias & Hartikainen, Jarno; Savon Sanomat | pages = 1 and 3 |date = 1 July 2008 | url = | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref> like did [[Vehmersalmi]] in 2005, [[Riistavesi]] in 1973 and [[Kuopion maalaiskunta]] in 1969.
[[File:Kallavesi.png|thumb|left|Kuopio is almost completely surrounded by lake [[Kallavesi]].]]

== Geography ==
The city is surrounded by lake [[Kallavesi]], and several parts of it are built on islands. Kuopio's ample waterfronts and islands are also utilized in the ''Saaristokaupunki'' (lit. ''Archipelago city'') -project, the biggest residential area currently being built in Finland.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Kuopion korkein asuinkerrostalo nousi harjakorkeuteen | newspaper = Suomen Kiinteistölehti | page = 14 | year = | date = 2008-10-16 | url = http://www.kiinteistolehti.fi/uutiset.php?id=4289 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> Saaristokaupunki will accommodate a total of 14,000 inhabitants in 2015.

== Transport ==
The city has a nationally unique feature in its street network, where every second street is practically a pedestrian and cycle street,<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = | title = WP2: Accessibility, Synthesis Report | publisher = Universell utforming | page = 14 | url = http://www.universell-utforming.miljo.no/file_upload/wp2_accessibility_synthesis.pdf | date =26 March 2004 | isbn =  }}</ref> so called "rännikatu" (lit.

Originally rännikatu, [[Alley|gränd]] (in Swedish) were created as a fire barrier to prevent a possible fire escalating in a city mostly built with wood.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pohjois-savonmuisti.fi/verkko_nayttelyt/napoleon_ja_kuopio/kustaa_III.htm|title= Napoleon ja Kuopio: Kuninkaiden Kuopio|accessdate=11 January 2009 |work= Memory of Northern Savonia|publisher= Museums of Northern Savonia|date=}}</ref>

Transport connections to Kuopio include [[Pendolino]] trains and air service from [[Kuopio Airport]] with [[Finnair]], [[Blue1]] and [[Finncomm Airlines|Finncomm]] (domestic, to [[Helsinki-Vantaa Airport|Helsinki-Vantaa]])

During the 2000s (decade), Kuopio has placed very well in a number image, popularity and city-attractiveness surveys. In 2007 it was placed third, behind [[Tampere]] and [[Oulu]].

== Religion ==
The largest church of Finland, [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland|Evangelical Lutheran Church]] has a [[Diocese of Kuopio|diocese in Kuopio]], which is shepherded by bishop [[Jari Jolkkonen]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Koskinen|first=Jerri|title=Jari Jolkkonen vihittiin Kuopion piispan virkaan|url=http://www.savonsanomat.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/jari-jolkkonen-vihittiin-kuopion-piispan-virkaan/1192715|accessdate=11 May 2012|newspaper=Savon Sanomat|date=6 May 2012}}</ref>

Kuopio is home of the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]] where its primate, archbishop of Karelia and all Finland [[Leo (Makkonen) of Finland|Leo (Makkonen)]] is seated. This is an autocephalous jurisdiction affiliated with the Patriarchate of Constantinople. It is the only mainstream Orthodox faction to celebrate Easter on the Latin date. The late [[Archbishop Paul]] had been successful in producing literature of popular theology. The city is also the location of [[RIISA- Orthodox Church Museum of Finland]].

Kuopio has also an Islamic mosque.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kuopio Mosque|url=http://www.islamicfinder.org/getitWorld.php?id=22039}}</ref> Muslims from various parts of the world and certain Finnish Muslims are living in Kuopio.

The town is also home to the first [[Buddhism in Burma|Burmese Buddhist]] monastery in Finland, named the Buddha Dhamma Ramsi monastery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=71,7596,0,0,1,0 |title=Buddhist Channel &#124; Buddhism News, Headlines &#124; World &#124; Burmese Buddhist monastery opens in Finland |publisher=Buddhistchannel.tv |date=2009-01-05 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>

== Sports in Kuopio ==
Kuopio bid for the [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics]], a youth sports festival in the tradition of the Olympics.  It became a finalist in November 2008, but ultimately lost to [[Innsbruck, Austria]].  Kuopio's image as a small city with a large University and many active young people was considered a model of what the [[International Olympic Committee]] seeks for the Games.<ref>[http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/youth_olympic_bids/youth_winter_2012/1216133865.html Innsbruck and Kuopio Make Final Shortlist For 2012 Youth Olympic Winter Games]</ref>

'''''M.A.S.K.''''' is an [[animated television series]] produced by the French-American [[DIC Entertainment|DIC Enterprises, Inc]] and [[Kenner Products|Kenner]]. The series was based on the [[M.A.S.K.]] action figures.<ref>{{cite news|title= Battle of the Fun Factories|work= Time|date=1985-12-16|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960379-2,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> It was animated in Asia by studios; KK C&D Asia, Studio Juno, Studio World, and [[Production Reed|Ashi Production]].

==History==
A total of 75 [[television syndication|syndicated]] episodes of ''M.A.S.K.'' were broadcast from 1985 to 1986. One of many cartoons produced during the 1980s as a vehicle for [[toy]] merchandising, ''M.A.S.K.'' (which is an acronym for the <u>M</u>obile <u>A</u>rmored <u>S</u>trike <u>K</u>ommand), was a hybrid of popular era cartoons ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]'' and ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]''.

When originally broadcast, ''M.A.S.K.'' was the first [[closed captioning|closed-captioned]] series to air in first-run syndication.<ref name=pantheon>{{cite book|last=Engelhardt|first=Tom|editor1-last=Gitlin|editor1-first=Todd|title=Watching Television: A Pantheon Guide to Popular Culture|chapter=Children's Television: The Shortcake Strategy|page=94|isbn=0-394-74651-1|year=1986|accessdate=September 27, 2010|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] ([[Random House]])}}</ref>

===M.A.S.K. and V.E.N.O.M.===
M.A.S.K. (an acronym for Mobile Armored Strike Kommand) is a special task force featuring an array of characters, led by Matt Trakker, with transforming [[vehicles]] engaged in an ongoing battle against the [[criminal]] organization ''V.E.N.O.M.'' (an acronym for Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem), with an emphasis on super-powered masks worn by the characters on the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/49804/mask-the-complete-series/ |title=MASK.: The Complete Series : DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video |publisher=Dvdtalk.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}</ref>

It is never made clear what sort of criminal organization V.E.N.O.M. is, exactly. They were not the typical world-conquering villains and their schemes mostly revolve around profiting from illegal activities and doing mercenary services.

==Reception==
''M.A.S.K.'' was named the 99th best animated series by [[IGN]]. They called it one of the most popular cartoon/toy marketing franchises of the eighties, and that it took many of the strengths of ''[[G.I. Joe]]'' and ''[[Transformers]]'' while taking few of their flaws.<ref name="ign100">{{cite web |title=99, M.A.S.K. |url=http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/99.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-01-23 |date=2009-01-23}}</ref>

==Video releases==
Several episodes of the series were released under [[Karl-Lorimar]]'s "Kideo Video" branding on [[VHS]] in the 1980s, with two episodes per tape. The "racing season" of the series would be distributed by Tempest Video. Several episodes were also released under the label ''M.A.S.K The Movie'', and ''M.A.S.K The Movie II''. No true direct-to-video or theatrical M.A.S.K movie was ever made.

M.A.S.K. episodes have been released on [[DVD]] in three languages.

* '''English (U.S.)''': [[Shout! Factory]] acquired the Region 1 DVD rights to the first season of the original series (65 episodes) of the series in 2011 and released a Complete Series set on August 9, 2011, as well as a separate 2-Disc collection of the first 11 episodes. The second season, which consists of 10 episodes, are owned by [[Cookie Jar Entertainment]] and are not part of the acquisition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/MASK-DVDs-Planned/15148 |title='&#39;M.A.S.K.'&#39; DVD news: DVD Plans for '&#39;M.A.S.K.'&#39; |publisher=Tvshowsondvd.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref> To avoid confusion [[FremantleMedia North America]] was not partially responsible for this release. The company has taken over [[LBS Communications]] and some of its assets, however LBS only handled the distribution of DiC shows back in the 80's for syndication, those rights have since expired, like they have with other DiC shows they distributed in the 80's. All DiC cartoon rights are currently held by Cookie Jar's successor; [[DHX Media]].
* '''English (UK)''': Collection 1 was released in the UK in November 2007 by [[Jetix|Jetix Films]] - Maximum Entertainment, containing the same amount of episodes as the Australian set. Collection 1 was re-released on 31 August 2009, and Collection 2 was finally released on 28 September 2009. Both sets (The re-issue Collection 1 and Collection 2) are distributed through Lace DVD, replacing Maximum Entertainment, and both sets are in Region 2 PAL format. All 75 episodes were released across both sets.
* '''English (Australia/New Zealand)''': [[Madman Entertainment]] released the complete series over two DVD collections for the first time in Australia and New Zealand. Collection 1 was released in November 2006 and contains episodes 1 - 38, Collection 2 was released in March 2007 and contains episodes 39 - 75 which includes the season 2 episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madman.com.au/actions/catalogue.do?releaseId=7141&method=view |title=M.A.S.K. Collection 2 (Mask) |publisher=Madman.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref>

== Cultural references ==
* ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' has done multiple parodies of M.A.S.K. in each of its episodes. In "Gold Dust Gasoline," Matt Trakker is among the characters taking part in the race that is seen in a sketch that parodies ''[[The Fast and the Furious (film series)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' movies. The episode "Rabbits on a Roller Coaster" had a sketch in which after grounding his son Scott for holding a wild party at Boulder Hill, Matt Trakker developed an internet relationship with an overweight woman named Darlene. On their wedding day, Matt is shocked to discover that Darlene is actually Miles Mayhem in disguise so he could know all of M.A.S.K.'s secrets and gain legal ownership of half of the M.A.S.K. organization. The sketch ends by honoring the [[homoerotic]] undertones in Trakker and Mayhem's relationship. The show also parodies the intro sequence to M.A.S.K.
* The M.A.S.K logo was parodied by wrestling group [[Chikara (professional wrestling)|Chikara]] as part of their promotional artwork for their first live internet PPV "High Noon".
* Dubstep producer J:Kenzo sampled audio clips from the "The Roteks" episode in his track entitled "The Roteks".
* Hip-Hop producer zerosignal sampled both the theme song and audio from "The Currency Conspiracy" in his track entitled "V.E.N.O.M."

==Diversitas mission <ref>{{cite web|title=Diversitas website - About: mission and history|url=http://www.Diversitas-international.org/about/mission-and-history}}</ref>==
Biodiversity underpins the life-support system of our planet. Both natural and managed ecosystems deliver important ecological services such as the production of food and fibre, carbon storage, climate regulation and recreation opportunities.

'''Diversitas''' (the Latin word for “diversity”) was established to address the complex scientific questions posed by the loss in biodiversity and ecosystem services and to offer science based solutions to this crisis.

'''Diversitas''' is an international programme of biodiversity science with a dual mission:
* Promoting, facilitating and conducting integrative biodiversity science, that links biological, ecological and social disciplines; and
* Providing the sound scientific basis for decision making to secure the planet’s variety of life, while contributing to human well-being and poverty eradication.

'''Diversitas''' achieves its mission by:
* Fostering an integrated network of the world’s leading biodiversity scientists to address critical biodiversity issues;
* Producing new knowledge by catalysing exchanges between scientists across nations and disciplines;
* Synthesising new biodiversity knowledge to address the global science priorities;
* Ensuring an effective engagement of the biodiversity science community globally with policy and decision makers, especially with relevant international conventions;
* Developing biodiversity science capacity by nurturing younger scientists around the world.

The '''Diversitas''' International Secretariat is based in Paris, France (hosted by the French National Museum of Natural History - [[Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle]] (MNHN)), while the different core projects are based all around the world.

==Diversitas history <ref>{{cite web|title=Diversitas website - About: mission and history|url=http://www.Diversitas-international.org/about/mission-and-history}}</ref>==

=== Phase 1 (1991-2001): Biodiversity gains attention on the global scale ===

'''Diversitas''' was established in 1991 by three international organizations: the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO),<ref>{{cite web|title=UNESCO - Biodiversity research, monitoring and management|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/special-themes/biodiversity-initiative/biodiversity-science-and-policy/biodiversity-research-monitoring-and-management/}}</ref> the [[Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment]] (SCOPE) and the [[IUBS|International Union of Biological Science]] (IUBS),<ref>{{cite web|title=IUBS - Diversitas|url=http://www.iubs.org/iubs/Diversitas.html}}</ref> at the time the need to address the complex scientific questions posed by the loss of and change in global biodiversity was identified. The goal of the initiative was to develop an international, non-governmental umbrella programme for research projects.

In 1996, '''Diversitas''' welcomed two new sponsors, the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) <ref>{{cite web|title=ICSU - Diversitas: An International Programme of Biodiversity Science|url=http://www.icsu.org/what-we-do/interdisciplinary-bodies/Diversitas/about}}</ref> and the [[International Union of Microbiological Societies]] (IUMS).

The key findings during its first decade were synthesised in a series of books and laid the groundwork for experimental and theoretical research carried out by '''Diversitas''' and the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP).<ref>{{cite web|title=IGBP Partners|url=http://www.igbp.net/networks/igbppartners.4.d8b4c3c12bf3be638a80001081.html}}</ref> 
These findings also contributed to the Global Biodiversity Assessment, an initiative of the [[World Resources Institute]] (WRI), and to the work of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD), established in 1992, and with which Diversitas has a Memorandum of Understanding.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBD – Partnership Agreements|url=http://www.cbd.int/agreements/}}</ref>

=== Phase 2 (2002-2011): An international framework for biodiversity science ===

In 2001, '''Diversitas''' organised an international consultation of its stakeholders on the need to launch a second phase of the programme. The conclusions of this consultation were in favour of launching a second phase, which would be more integrative and inter-disciplinary, and more policy relevant. 

The new '''Diversitas''' Science Plan was published in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Diversitas Science Plan Phase 2: 2002-2011|url=http://www.Diversitas-international.org/resources/publications/reports-1/Diversitassp.pdf}}</ref> To implement this science plan, nine projects were established embracing a cycle of discovery, observation, analysis, and information sharing, on overarching scientific questions on biodiversity and related ecosystem services: 
* Global Invasive Species Programme (GISP) <ref>{{cite web|title=Global Invasive Species Programme|url=http://www.Diversitas-international.org/about/global-invasive-species-programme-gisp}}</ref> – a project aiming at preventing and managing invasive species
* Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment (GMBA) <ref>{{cite web|title=Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment|url=http://www.Diversitas-international.org/activities/research/global-mountain}}</ref> – a project aiming at exploring and understanding mountain biodiversity
* bioGENESIS <ref>{{cite web|title=bioGENESIS|url=http://www.Diversitas-international.org/activities/research/biogenesis}}</ref> – a project aiming at providing an evolutionary framework for biodiversity science
* bioDISCOVERY <ref>{{cite web|title=bioDISCOVERY|url=http://www.Diversitas-international.org/activities/research/biodiscovery}}</ref> – a project aiming at assessing, monitoring, and predicting biodiversity change
* ecoSERVICES <ref>{{cite web|title=ecoSERVICES|url=http://www.Diversitas-international.org/activities/research/ecoservices}}</ref> – a project aiming at exploring the links between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and services

In addition to these scientific projects, '''Diversitas''' has been strongly engaged in the [[Earth System Science Partnership]] (ESSP),<ref>{{cite web|title=ESSP Partners|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=20&L=en%25252F%25252F%25252F%25253F_SERVER%25255BDOCUMENT_ROOT%25255D%25253D}}</ref> a partnership for the integrated study of the Earth System, the ways that it is changing, and the implications for global and regional sustainability.
During this second phase, '''Diversitas''' continued its engagement in serving policy fora, and the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD), in particular.
'''Diversitas''' organized its first Open Science Conference in Oaxaca, Mexico, in October 2005, where the scientific community reiterated its support for the establishment of a scientific panel on biodiversity that included an intergovernmental component (cf. [[International Mechanism of Scientific Expertise on Biodiversity]] (IMoSEB )) and its second Open Science Conference in Cape Town, South Africa, in October 2009; the Cape Town conference attracted an international audience of 700 scientists and policy makers from about 70 countries representing many facets of biodiversity science and policy.

=== Phase 3 (2012-2020): Biodiversity and ecosystem services science for a sustainable planet ===

Since mid-2009, and in the light of the changes in the biodiversity science-policy landscape, '''Diversitas''' has been engaged in a phase of reviewing its activities and revising its 2002 Science Plan. The new '''Diversitas''' Science Plan was published in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Larigauderie|first=Anne et alii|title=Biodiversity and ecosystem services science for a sustainable planet: the Diversitas vision for 2012–20|url=http://www.Diversitas-international.org/resources/publications/scientific-publications-1/Larigauderie-et-al_COSUST_2012_4.pdf|publisher=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, Elsevier}}</ref> 
During this on-going phase, '''Diversitas''' has been or is being strongly involved in:
* the establishment of a global observing system for biodiversity, called GEO BON - Group on Earth Observations - Biodiversity Observation Network. GEO BON represents the biodiversity component of the [[Global Earth Observation System of Systems]] (GEOSS) under the auspices of the [[Group on Earth Observations]] (GEO),<ref>{{cite web|title=GEO Participating Organisations|url=http://www.earthobservations.org/ag_partorg.shtml}}</ref>
* the consultation on an [[Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services]] (IPBES) which was launched in April 2012,<ref>{{cite web|title=IPBES and the Scientific Community|url=http://www.ipbes.net/scientificcommunity}}</ref>

'''Kreuzberg''', a part of the combined [[Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg]] borough located south of [[Berlin-Mitte|Mitte]] since 2001, is one of the best-known areas of Berlin.  Kreuzberg, colloquially also known as '''''X-Berg''''', is often described as consisting of two distinctive parts: the ''SO 36'', home to many immigrants; and ''SW 61'', roughly coterminous with the old [[Postleitzahl|postal codes]] for the two areas in [[West Berlin]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901030421-443145,00.html |newspaper=Time |first=Regine |last=Wosnitza |title=Berlin on its wild site |date=13 April 2003 |accessdate=2008-03-21 }}</ref>  Kreuzberg has emerged from its history as one of the poorest quarters in Berlin in the late 1970s, during which it was an isolated section of [[West Berlin]]<ref>[http://www2.tu-berlin.de/fb2/sozpaed/tps/kreuzber.html Kreuzberg]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref>  to one of Berlin's cultural centers in the middle of the now reunified city.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/06/01/berlin.culture/index.html | work=CNN | title=Berlin's culture club - CNN.com | date=30 June 2007}}</ref><ref>[http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2007/1027/magazin/0002/ Kreuzbergs Retter : Textarchiv : Berliner Zeitung Archiv]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref>

Kreuzberg is one of the trendy districts of Berlin, and many bars, pubs and [[nightclub]]s can be found in the area.

==Overview==
The borough is known for its very large percentage of immigrants and second-generation immigrants, many of whom are of [[Turks in Germany|Turkish ancestry]].  As of 2006, 31.6% of Kreuzberg's inhabitants did not have German citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web1.bbu.de/publicity/bbu/internet.nsf/index/de_nachrichtenpool.htm?OpenDocument&50BC6CB63623F96BC12571EE00357CB3 |title=Verband Berlin-Brandenburgischer Wohnungsunternehmen e.V |publisher=Web1.bbu.de |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}</ref>  While Kreuzberg thrives on its diverse culture and is still an attractive area for many, the district is also characterized by high levels of unemployment and some of the lowest average incomes in Berlin.<ref>[http://www.ifa.de/journal/rep2004_hall.htm IFA.de], retrieved on 2008-03-21</ref>

The [[counterculture]] tradition of Kreuzberg led to a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes for the Green Party, which is unique among all Berlin boroughs. The local MP [[Hans-Christian Ströbele]] is the only Green politician directly elected to the federal [[Bundestag]] parliament.

==Geography==
===Layout===
Kreuzberg is bounded by the river [[Spree]] in the east. The [[Landwehrkanal]] flows through Kreuzberg from east to west, with the [[Paul-Lincke-Ufer]] running alongside it. Other characteristics are the old [[Berlin u-bahn|U-Bahn]] line of the present-day U1, the Görlitzer Park in ''SO 36'' and the [[Viktoriapark]] on the slope of the [[Kreuzberg (Tempelhofer Berge)|Kreuzberg hill]] in ''SW 61''.

===Subdivision===
Kreuzberg is divided into 2 zones (''Ortslagen''):
*[[Östliches Kreuzberg]] (''Berlin SO 36'');
*[[Westliches Kreuzberg]] (''Kreuzberg 61'').

== History ==
In contrast to many other areas of Berlin, which were villages before their integration into Berlin, Kreuzberg has a rather short history.<ref> Eva Brücker, Hasso Spode et al.: Kreuzberg (Geschichtslandschaft Berlin V), Berlin: Nicolai 1994 [http://www.amazon.de/Geschichtslandschaft-Berlin-Orte-Ereignisse-Kreuzberg/dp/3875844742%3FSubscriptionId%3D0H7E2ABGRZR51KQBN202%26tag%3Duniversitat09-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D3875844742]</ref> It was formed on 1 October 1920 by the [[Greater Berlin Act]] providing for the incorporation of suburbs and the reorganisation of Berlin into twenty boroughs. The eastern Friedrichsvorstadt, the southern [[Friedrichstadt (Berlin)|Friedrichstadt]], the western and southern [[Luisenstadt]] and the [[Tempelhofer Vorstadt]] were merged into the new VIth borough of Berlin, first named ''Hallesches Tor''. On 27 September 1921 the borough assembly of Hallesches Tor decided to rename the borough after the [[Kreuzberg (Tempelhofer Berge)|homonymous hill]].<ref name="Wille 1986 21"> Klaus-Dieter Wille, ''Spaziergänge in Kreuzberg'', Berlin: Haude & Spener, 1986, (=Berliner Kaleidoskop: Schriften zur Berliner Kunst- und Kulturgeschichte; vol. 32), p.&nbsp;21. ISBN 3-7759-0287-2.</ref> Kreuzberg, literally meaning ''cross hill'', is the point of highest elevation in the Kreuzberg locality, which is {{convert|66|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.muz-online.de/sights/berlinB3.html Muz-online.de] retrieved on 2008-03-21</ref> The hill is traditionally a place for weekend trips.  It received its name from the 1821 [[Prussian National Monument for the Liberation Wars]] by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] within the [[Viktoriapark]], built in commemoration of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  Except for its northernmost part, the quarter Friedrichstadt (established in the end of the 17th century), today's "Kreuzberg" was a very rural place until well into the 19th century.

This changed when, in the 1860s, industrialization caused Berlin to grow rapidly. This called for extensive housing &ndash; much of which was built exploiting the dire needs of the poor, with widespread land speculation. Many of Kreuzberg's buildings originate from that time.<ref>[http://www.visitberlin.de/english/sightseeing/e_si_architektur.php Visitberlin.de], retrieved on 2008-03-21</ref> Far into the 20th century, Kreuzberg was the most populous of Berlin's boroughs even in absolute numbers, with more than 400,000 people, although it was and still is geographically the smallest.  As a result, with more than 60,000 people per square kilometer (155,000 people per square mile), Kreuzberg had the highest population density in Berlin.

In addition to housing, Kreuzberg was also one center of Berlin's industry. The  "export quarter" along Ritter Street consisted of many profitable small businesses, and the "press quarter" along Koch Street ([[Friedrichstadt (Berlin)|Friedrichstadt]]) was the home of most of Germany's large newspapers, as well as the [[Ullstein-Verlag|Ullstein]], [[August Scherl|Scherl]], and [[Rudolf Mosse|Mosse]] book publishers.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Both of these industrial quarters were almost entirely destroyed by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|air raids during World War II]], with the bombings of a single night from February 3, 1945. In remembrance of the old tradition, the [[Axel Springer]] press company erected its German headquarters at Kochstraße again, right next to the [[Berlin Wall]].

After World War II, Kreuzberg's housing rents were regulated by law which made investments unattractive. As a result, housing was of low quality, but cheap, which made the borough a prime target for immigrants coming to Germany (and Berlin).<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901030421-443145,00.html Time.com], Regine Wosnitza "Berlin on its wild site" 13 April 2003, retrieved on 2008-03-21</ref>
Starting in the late 1960s, increasing numbers of students, artists, and immigrants began moving to Kreuzberg. Enclosed by the [[Berlin Wall]] on three sides, the area became famous for its alternative lifestyle and its [[squatting|squatters]], especially the ''SO 36'' part of Kreuzberg.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,482795,00.html Spiegel.de] retrieved on 2008-03-21; see Brücker/Spode op.cit.</ref> Starting in 1987, there have been violent riots in ''SO 36'' on Labour day.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Kreuzberg suddenly found itself in the middle of the city again.  The initially cheap rents and high degree of 19th century housing made some parts of the borough more attractive as a residential area for a much wider (and richer) variety of people.  Today, Kreuzberg has one of the youngest populations of all European city boroughs; statistically, its population has been swapped completely twice in the last two decades.

[[Berlin's 2001 administrative reform]] combined Kreuzberg with [[Friedrichshain]] to form the new [[Boroughs of Berlin|borough]] of [[Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg]]. Since the two areas are linked only by a single bridge over the [[Spree]] River, the [[Oberbaumbrücke]], {{Reference necessary|text=this combination seemed awkward to many residents.|date=July 2010}} The two areas not being able to agree on a common location for the future borough's city hall, the present location in Friedrichshain was decided by flipping a five-[[Deutsche Mark|Mark]] coin.

== Culture ==
Kreuzberg has historically been home to the Berlin's [[punk rock]] movement as well as other alternative subcultures in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The ''[[SO36]]'' club remains a fixture on the Berlin music scene.  It was originally focused on punk music and in the 1970s was often frequented by [[Iggy Pop]] and [[David Bowie]].  In those days the club rivalled New York's [[CBGB]] as one of the finest new-wave venues in the world.<ref>[http://www.so36.de The SO36 Club]</ref>

There has also been a significant influence stemming from [[African-American culture|African-American]] and [[hip hop]] culture on Kreuzberg's youth and the area has become a centre for [[Hip hop music|rap]] and [[breakdance]] within Berlin.  Though the majority of Kreuzberg's residents are of German or [[Turks in Germany|Turkish descent]], some identify more with American or African-American culture.<ref>Brown, Timothy S. “‘Keeping it Real’ in a Different ‘Hood: (African-) Americanization and Hip-hop in Germany.” In The Vinyl Ain’t Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, 137-50. London; A</ref>
Hip hop was largely introduced to the youth of Kreuzberg by the children of American servicemen who were stationed nearby until the [[reunification of Germany]].<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E1D7143BF931A25757C0A9659C8B63 The Saturday Profile; A Bold New View of Turkish-German Youth], ''[[New York Times]]''</ref>

Every year there is a big festival in Kreuzberg called the ''Carnival of Cultures'' where different cultures and heritages are celebrated in colourful street parades which include music, street entertainment, food, and art and craft stalls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karneval-berlin.de |title=Karneval der Kulturen |publisher=Karneval-berlin.de |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}</ref>

Kreuzberg has long been the epicenter of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered and Queer life and Arts in Berlin. Kreuzberg is home to the [[Schwules Museum]] which was established in the late 1980s. The museum is dedicated to preserving, exhibiting, and discovering LGBTQ history, art and culture. The museum is composed of three main divisions: archives, library, and exhibitions.
== Kreuzberg in literature and music ==
[[File:Kottbusser Tor Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Kottbusser Tor]] by Night]]
*Turkish-German filmmaker [[Neco Celik]], who portrays the American influence over the youth culture in Kreuzberg in his first film, ''[[Alltag]]'', notes that "Kreuzberg is a kind of biotope where different nationalities live, but the environment determines their lives, not their nationalities."
*German musician [[Sven Regener]]'s first novel, ''[[Herr Lehmann|Berlin Blues]]'', and third novel, ''{{Ill|de|Der Kleine Bruder}}'', are set in the district of Kreuzberg.
*"Kreuzberg" is a song by English indie rock band [[Bloc Party]] on the album ''[[A Weekend in the City]]'', which also mentions the [[East Side Gallery]].
*American musician [[Stephen Malkmus]] mentions taking a "locomotive to Kreuzberg" in his song "[[Black Book]]".
*Kreuzberg's bohemian way of life is reflected in the song ''Find the Time'' by English singer/songwriter Sam Duckworth's band [[Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly]] on the album ''[[Searching for the Hows and Whys]]''.
*Kreuzberg-based Turkish/German rapper {{Ill|de|Killa Hakan}} mentions Kreuzberg in most of his songs, most notably in his 2007 single "Kreuzberg City".
*The acclaimed documentary {{Ill|de|Prinzessinnenbad}} by {{Ill|de|Bettina Blümner}} focuses on the lives of three young girls from Kreuzberg.
*Canadian musician [[Shotgun Jimmie]]'s 2011 album [[Transistor Sister]] contains a song titled "The King of Kreuzberg", where in he sings about taking the train to Kreuzberg and "jump[ing] right into it".
*English post-punk band [[Killing Joke]] have a song on their first album titled "SO 36".
*Phoenix folk-punk band [[Andrew Jackson Jihad]] make a reference to Kreuzberg in the song "Kokopelli Face Tattoo" with the lyric "...Kreuz is German for Williams." Vocalist Sean Bonnette claims this pokes fun at the young, hipness of Kreuzberg, in that it is similar to a German version of [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]].

'''Petrozavodsk''' ({{lang-rus|????????????|p=p??tr?z??votsk}}; [[Karelian language|Karelian]]/[[Veps language|Vepsian]]/{{lang-fi|Petroskoi}}) is the [[capital city|capital]] [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of the [[Republic of Karelia]], [[Russia]], which stretches along the western shore of [[Lake Onega]] for some {{convert|27|km|sp=us}}. Population: {{ru-census|p2010=261,987|p2002=266,160|p1989=269,485}}

==History==
Archeological discoveries in the urban area indicate the presence of a settlement as far back as seven thousand years ago, and during the [[Middle Ages]] the site of modern city was marked by several [[Lake Onega|lakeside]] villages.  Within the city limits, the district of Solomennoje appears in surviving records dating back to the sixteenth century, and a map produced by the [[Low Countries|Flemish]] [[cartographer]] [[Abraham Ortelius]] at the end of that century places a settlement called, here, Onegaborg on the site of modern Petrozavodsk.<ref>http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_geo/3842/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA</ref>

On September&nbsp;11, 1703, [[Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov|Prince Menshikov]] founded the settlement of Petrovskaya Sloboda ("Petrine [[Sloboda]]"). He did so at the behest of Tsar [[Peter the Great]], who needed a new iron foundry to manufacture cannons and anchors for the [[Baltic Fleet]] at the time of the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721). At first the foundry used the name ''Shuysky zavod'' (literally, "[[factory]] at the [[Shuya River, Karelia|Shuya River]]"), but a decade later it became ''Petrovsky zavod'' ("Petrine factory"), after the name of the reigning monarch. From this form the present name of the city derives.

By 1717, Petrovskaya Sloboda had grown into the largest settlement in [[Karelia]], with about 3,500 inhabitants, a timber fort, a [[Gostiny Dvor|covered market]], and miniature palaces of the Tsar and Menshikov. The town's best-known landmark became the wooden church of Saints Peter and Paul, rebuilt in 1772 and renovated in 1789. The church retained its original [[iconostasis]] until this relic of Peter's reign was destroyed by fire on October&nbsp;30, 1924.

After Peter's death, Petrovskaya Sloboda became depopulated and the factory declined. It closed down in 1734, although foreign industrialists maintained copper factories in the vicinity.

The industry revived in 1773 when [[Catherine the Great]] established a new iron foundry upstream the Lososinka River. Designed to provide cannons for the ongoing [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Russo-Turkish Wars]], the foundry was named Alexandrovsky, after [[Alexander Nevsky]], who was considered a patron saint of the region. The factory was modernized and expanded under supervision of [[Charles Gascoigne]] in 1787–96. Local pundits claim that the first [[railway]] in the world (???????? ????????????) was inaugurated for industrial uses of the Alexandrovsky foundry in 1788.

[[File:Petroz kruglaya.jpg|thumb|left|Round Square in central Petrozavodsk]]

During Catherine's municipal reform of 1777, Petrovskaya Sloboda was incorporated as a town, whereupon its name was changed to Petrozavodsk. A new [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] city center was then built, focused on the newly planned Round Square. In 1784 Petrozavodsk was large enough to supplant [[Olonets]] as the administrative center of the region. Although [[Emperor Paul]] abolished [[Olonets Governorate]], it was revived as a separate [[guberniya]] in 1801, with Petrozavodsk as its administrative center.

During the [[Finnish military administration in Eastern Karelia, 1941–1944|Finnish occupation of East Karelia]] in the [[Continuation War]] (1941–1944), the occupier chose to style the city ''Äänislinna'' (or ''Ääneslinna''), rather than the traditional ''Petroskoi''. The new name was a literal translation of ''Onegaborg'', the name of a settlement marked on a 16th-century map by [[Abraham Ortelius]] near the present-day city, ''Ääninen'' being the Finnish toponym for Lake Onega.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The city was occupied by Finnish troops for nearly three years before it was retaken by Soviet forces on June&nbsp;28, 1944. The Finns set up [[East Karelian concentration camps|concentration camp]]s for the civilians which they operated until the Red Army reoccupied the area. The first camp was located at Petrozavodsk (October&nbsp;24, 1940). Six such camps were set up in Petrozavodsk, with about 25,000 women, children and old people confined in them. Some of the camps were old soviet union camps and some only fenced city areas. One source estimated 4,000 people perished there, primarily because of malnourishment, most dying during the spring and summer of 1942.

In 1977, Petrozavodsk was the siege of what is called the [[Petrozavodsk phenomenon]].

==Administrative and municipal status==
Petrozavodsk is the [[capital city|capital]] of the republic and, within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it also serves as the [[administrative center]] of [[Prionezhsky District]],<ref name="Ref62" /> even though it is not a part of it.<ref name="Constitution">Constitution of the Republic of Karelia</ref> As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the '''[[city of federal subject significance|city of republic significance]] of Petrozavodsk'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of the Republic of Karelia|districts]].<ref name="Ref62">Law #871-ZRK</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the city of republic significance of Petrozavodsk is incorporated as '''Petrozavodsky Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref737">Law #824-ZRK</ref>

==Landmarks==
Petrozavodsk is distinguished among other towns of North Russia by its [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] architectural heritage, which includes the Round Square (1775, reconstructed in 1789 and 1839) and the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral (consecrated in 1832). Among the town's landmarks are the outdoor statues of Peter I (bronze and granite, [[Ippolit Monighetti]], 1873), [[Gavrila Derzhavin]] (a Russian poet who was the governor of Olonets in the 18th century), and [[Alexander Nevsky]] (erected outside Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in 2010).

The city has a fine frontage on the Gulf of Petrozavodsk. The modern embankment, inaugurated in 1994, displays an assortment of Karelian granites and marbles. It is lined with extravagant postmodernist sculptures presented by sister cities of Petrozavodsk from around the world. There is also a birch copse, where the first church of Petrozavodsk was built in 1703.

Petrozavodsk is home to the Karelia Philharmonic Orchestra (1933)[http://www.marius-stravinsky.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6&Itemid=10], the Karelian Musical Theater (1955, statuary by [[Sergey Konenkov]]), National Library of Karelia (1959), Finnish-speaking National Theater of Karelia (1965), [[Petrozavodsk State University]], a conservatory, a city museum founded in 1871, and a branch of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

One of the city's central landmarks is Lenin Square, an oval space with a large Soviet-era statue of Lenin in the center. The square is especially notable for English-speaking visitors because it is also called "round square" - a paradox in English, but not in Russian (''kruglaya ploshad'').

==Suburbs==
[[File:petroz fishers.jpg|thumb|Statue of fishermen on the Onega embankment]]

The village of Shoksha near Petrozavodsk contains a quarry of red and pink quartzite which was used in construction of [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] and [[Lenin Mausoleum]], among many other notable structures. There are also other quarries in the region excavating road aggregates (Goloday Gora – gabbro-diabase) near Derevyanka.

The suburb of Martsialnye Vody is the oldest [[destination spa|spa]] in [[Russia]], founded by [[Peter the Great]] in 1714 and visited by the Tsar on four occasions. Its name means "The Waters of Mars" in Russian. Although Peter's palace at Martsialnye Vody has not survived, there is a museum devoted to the spa's history.

From Petrozavodsk harbor a [[hydrofoil]] service of "KareliaFlot" company carries people to the island of [[Kizhi]], a [[World Heritage Site]] with an outdoor museum of ancient wooden architecture.

==Transportation==
The city is served by the [[Petrozavodsk Airport]], and a train station on the [[Murmansk Railway]] with train connections to the main population centers of Russia.

==Climate==
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Petrozavodsk experiences a [[subarctic climate]] (''Dfc'', one to three months with mean temperatures of {{convert|+10|C}} or greater), though with winters that are less severe than in many localities with this type of climate, thanks to the moderating influence of the [[Baltic Sea]] and the many nearby lakes. Winters, though long and cold, are mild for the high latitude, while summers are short and warm. Precipitation averages {{convert|581|mm|abbr=on}} annually.

'''Olivenza''' ({{IPA-es|oli??en?a|lang}}) or '''Olivença''' ({{IPA-pt|oli?v?s?|lang}}) is a town in the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Extremadura]], situated on a disputed section of the border between [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]. Olivenza is administered by Spain as part of its territory. Portugal holds a claim on the town and its surrounding territory.<ref>Rongxing Guo, ''[http://books.google.ch/books?id=z5Le627xQLgC&printsec=frontcover&hl=fr#v=onepage&q&f=false Territorial Disputes and Resource Management: A Global Handbook]'', Nova Science Publisher/New York, 2007</ref>

As Olivença, the town was under Portuguese sovereignty between 1297 ([[Treaty of Alcañices]]) and 1801 when it was ceded to Spain under the [[Treaty of Badajoz (1801)|Treaty of Badajoz]]. Spain has since administered the territory (now split into two municipalities, Olivenza and [[Táliga]]), whilst Portugal invokes the self-revocation of the Treaty of Badajoz, plus the [[Congress of Vienna|Treaty of Vienna]] of 1815, to claim the return of the territory. In spite of the territorial dispute between [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], the issue has not been a sensitive matter in the relations between these two countries.<ref>[http://www.elperiodicoextremadura.com/noticias/noticia.asp?pkid=70565 Portugal desmiente a la CIA y niega que haya un conflicto por Olivenza] {{es icon}}</ref><ref>[http://www.olivenca.org/actualidadeDetalhe.asp?categoria=NOTICIAS&ID=54 Martins da Cruz Afirma Que a Questão de Olivença "Está Congelada"] {{pt icon}}</ref> Olivenza and other neighbouring Spanish ([[La Codosera]], [[Alburquerque, Badajoz|Alburquerque]] and [[Badajoz]]) and Portuguese ([[Arronches]], [[Campo Maior, Portugal|Campo Maior]], [[Estremoz]], [[Portalegre, Portugal|Portalegre]] and [[Elvas, Portugal|Elvas]]) towns reached an agreement in 2008 to create a [[euroregion]].<ref>[http://www.elperiodicoextremadura.com/noticias/noticia.asp?pkid=362510 Europacto en la frontera hispano-lusa] {{es icon}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cm-estremoz.pt/pt/conteudos/noticias/EUROREGIAO%20E%20DECLARACAO%20DE%20OLIVENCA.htm Euroregião e Declaração de Olivença] {{pt icon}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref>

==Geography==
Olivenza is located on the left (east) bank of the [[Guadiana]] river, at an equal distance of {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Elvas Municipality|Elvas]] in [[Portugal]] and [[Badajoz]] in [[Spain]]. The territory is triangular, with a smaller side resting on the Guadiana and the opposite vertex entering south-east and surrounded by Spanish territory. By an agreement between Spain and Portugal, the left bank of the river was recognized as being Portuguese territory (to a non-defined width, though), and sets [[de facto]] border in that area.

Besides the town, the municipality of Olivenza includes six villages: San Francisco, San Rafael, Villarreal, Santo Domingo de Guzmán, San Benito de la Contienda, and San Jorge de Alor (Portuguese: São Francisco, São Rafael, Vila Real, São Domingos de Gusmão, São Bento da Contenda, and São Jorge da Lor). Another village, Táliga, was detached to become the seat of a separate municipality in 1850.

Total population is 10,762 (2002), of which 8,274 live in Olivenza. The total area is {{convert|750|km²|0|abbr=out}}. Like the surrounding regions, [[population density]] is low, at 11 inhabitants per km².[The Mayor is Bernardino Piriz]

Some monuments include the Saint Mary of the Castle Church (Spanish: ''Iglesia de Santa María del Castillo'', Portuguese: ''Igreja de Santa Maria do Castelo''), Holy Ghost Chapel (''Capilla del Espíritu Santo'', ''Capela do Espírito Santo''), Saint Mary Magdalene Church (''Iglesia de Santa María Magdalena'', ''Igreja de Santa Maria Madalena'', considered a masterwork of Portuguese [[Manueline]] architecture), Saint John of God Monastery (''Monasterio de San Juan de Dios'', ''Mosteiro de São João de Deus''), the keep (''torre del homenaje'', ''torre de menagem''), and the ruins of the Our Lady of Help Bridge (''Puente de Nuestra Señora de Ayuda'', ''Ponte de Nossa Senhora da Ajuda'', destroyed in 1709 and never rebuilt).

There are still traces of Portuguese culture and language in the people, although the younger generations speak Spanish only. At the beginning of the 1940s the city was reportedly mainly Portuguese-speaking, but after the 1940s a language shift towards Spanish took place. Famous people born in Olivenza include Cardinal [[Pedro da Fonseca (cardinal)|Pedro da Fonseca]] (?-after 1419) and music composer [[Vicente Lusitano]] (?-after 1561).

*29 June 1926 - Portugal and Spain sign an agreement demarcating the border from the confluence of the Cuncos river with the [[Guadiana]], just south of Olivenza, to the estuary of the Guadiana, on the far South.

The only difference between this section and the rest is that the term "international" is omitted (all the sections are named "international section" but the non-demarcated one in the Guadiana river).<ref>[http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1969/04/22/pdfs/A05929-05933.pdf Instrumento de ratificación del Convenio y Protocolo adicional entre España y Portugal para regular el uso y aprovechamiento hidráulico de los tramos internacionales de los ríos Limia, Miño, Tajo, Guadiana y Chanza y sus afluentes, firmado en Madrid el 29 de mayo de 1968.].

*1994, November - After internal criticism that the agreement of 1990 would mean the recognition of the ''de facto'' border by the government of Portugal, the agreement is modified in another Iberian Summit. Portugal is now in full charge of constructing the new bridge and preserving the old bridge, therefore not putting the Portuguese claim to the territory of Olivenza at stake.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}
*March 1995 - The Portuguese government sends its Spanish counterpart a study on the effects of the construction of the [[Alqueva Dam]] on Spanish territory. Information on Olivenza is not included.

==Claims of sovereignty==
{{main|Disputed status of Olivenza}}
Olivenza was under Portuguese sovereignty since 1297. During the [[War of the Oranges]], French and Spanish troops under the command of [[Manuel de Godoy]] took the town on May 20, 1801.
In the aftermath of that conflict the [[Treaty of Badajoz]] was signed, with the Olivenza territory remaining a part of Spain.


Spain claims the ''[[de jure]]'' sovereignty over Olivenza on the grounds that the Treaty of Badajoz still stands and has never been revoked.
Thus, the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza should be as demarcated by that treaty.


Portugal claims the ''de jure'' sovereignty over Olivenza exactly evoking the same Treaty of Badajoz, since it was revoked by its own terms. The breach of any of its articles would lead to its cancellation, and that happened when Spain invaded Portugal in the [[Peninsular War]] of 1807. Portugal further bases its case on Article 105 of the [[Congress of Vienna|Treaty of Vienna]] of 1815 (which Spain signed in 1817) that states that the winning countries are to ''"endeavour with the mightiest conciliatory effort to return Olivenza to Portuguese authority"''.<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sp.html#Issues</ref>
Thus, the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza should be as demarcated by the Treaty of Alcanizes of 1297.

Spain interprets Article 105 as not being mandatory on demanding Spain to return Olivenza to Portugal, thus not revoking the Treaty of Badajoz.

Portugal has never made a formal claim to the territory after the Treaty of Vienna, but has equally never directly acknowledged the Spanish sovereignty over Olivenza.


Portuguese military maps don't show the border at that area, implying it to be undefined. 
Also, the latest road connection between Olivenza and Portugal (entirely paid by the Portuguese state,<ref>http://www.ionline.pt/artigos/portugal/fronteira-invisivel-se-dia-portugal-espanha-se-unirem-capital-sera-olivenca</ref> although it involved the building of a bridge over the Guadiana, an international river) has no indication of the Portuguese border, again implying the undefined status.


There is no research on the opinion of the inhabitants of Olivenza about their status. Spanish public opinion is not generally aware of the Portuguese claim on Olivenza (in contrast to the Spanish claim on [[Gibraltar]] or the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] claims on [[Ceuta]], [[Melilla]] and the ''[[Plazas de soberanía]]''). On the other hand, awareness in Portugal has been increasing under the efforts of pressure groups to have the question raised and debated in public.<ref>

'''Dog fighting''' is a type of [[blood sport]], generally defined as pitting two [[Game (dog)|game dogs]] against one another in a ring or a pit for the [[entertainment]] of the spectators or the gratification of the dogfighters, who are sometimes referred to as dogmen.<ref name="Gibson 2005">{{cite web|last=Gibson |first=Hannah |url=http://animallaw.info/topics/tabbed%20topic%20page/spusdogfighting.htm |title=Quick Summary of Dog Fighting |publisher=Animal Legal and Historical Center at Michigan State University College of Law |year=2005 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}</ref>

The act also makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly use the mail service of the United States Postal Service or any instrumentality of interstate commerce for commercial speech for purposes of advertising a dog for use in an animal fighting venture, promoting or in any other manner furthering an animal fighting venture except as performed outside the limits of the States of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last= |first= |url=http://animallaw.info/statutes/stusawa.htm#2156|title=The Animal Welfare Act |publisher=United States Code |year=2008 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}</ref> Worldwide, several countries have banned dog fighting, but it is still legal in some countries like Japan, Honduras, and parts of Russia.<ref name="animallaw.info"/>

In 43 AD, for example, dogs fought alongside the Romans and the British in the [[Roman Conquest of Britain]].<ref name="Villavicencio"/> In this war, the Romans used a breed that originated from Greece called [[Molossus_(dog)|Molossus]]; the Britons used broad-mouth Mastiffs, which were thought to descend from the Molossus bloodline and which also originated from Greece.<ref name="Massey">{{cite thesis |degree=M.A. |first=Wil |last=Massey |title=Bloodsport and the Michael Vick Dogfighting Case: A Critical Cultural Analysis |publisher=East Tennessee University |year=2012}}</ref> Though the British were outnumbered and ultimately lost this war, the Romans were so impressed with the [[English Mastiff]]s that they began to import these dogs for use in the [[Colosseum]], as well as for use in times of war.<ref name="Villavicencio"/> While spectators watched, the imported English Mastiffs were pitted against animals such as wild elephants, lions, bears, bulls, and gladiators.<ref name="Villavicencio"/>

Later, the Romans bred and exported fighting dogs to Spain, France and other parts of Europe until eventually these dogs made their way back to England.<ref name="Villavicencio"/> Though [[Bull-baiting|bull baiting]] and [[bear baiting]] were popular throughout the Middle Ages up to the 19th century in Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, and Holland, the British pitted dogs against bulls and bears on a scale like no other.<ref name="Massey"/> In 12th century England during the feudal era, the landed aristocracy, who held direct military control in decentralized feudal systems and thus owned the animals necessary for waging war, introduced bull baiting and bear baiting to the rest of the British population.<ref name="Massey" /> In later years, bull baiting and bear baiting became a popular source of entertainment for the British royalty.<ref name="Massey" /> For instance, [[Queen Elizabeth I]], who reigned from 1558-1603, was an avid follower of bull and bear baiting; she bred Mastiffs for baiting and would entertain foreign guests with a fight whenever they visited England.<ref name="Massey" /> In addition to breeding Mastiffs and entertaining foreign guests with a fight, Queen Elizabeth, and later her successor, King James I, built a number of bear gardens in London.<ref name="Fleig 1996">{{cite book |last=Fleig |first= Dieter|year=1996 |title=The History of Fighting Dogs |url= |location=Neptune, NJ|publisher=TFH Publications |isbn= |accessdate=2013-11-07 }}</ref> The garden buildings were round and roofless, and housed not only bears, but also bulls and other wild animals that could be used in a fight.<ref name="Fleig 1996"/> Today, a person can visit the Bear Garden museum near the Shakespeare Global Complex in Bankside, Southwark.

With the popularity of bull and bear baiting, bears needed for such fights soon became scarce.<ref name="Massey" /> With the scarcity of bear population, the price of bears rose and, because of this, bull baiting became more common in England over time.<ref name="Massey" /> Bulls who survived the fights were slaughtered afterwards for their meat, as it was believed that the fight caused bull meat to become more tender.<ref name="Massey" />  In fact, if a bull was offered for sale in the market without having been baited the previous day, butchers were liable to face substantial fines.<ref name="Massey" /> Animal fights were temporarily suspended in England when [[Oliver Cromwell]] seized power, but were reinstated again after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]].<ref name="Fleig 1996"/>  Dog fighting, bear baiting, and bull baiting were officially outlawed in England by the Humane Act of 1835.<ref name="animallaw.info"/> The official ban on all fights, however, actually served to promote dog fighting in England.<ref name="Fleig 1996"/>  Since a small amount of space was required for the pit where a dog fight took place, as compared to the ring needed for bull or bear baiting, authorities had a difficult time enforcing the ban on dog fighting.<ref name="Fleig 1996"/>

==U.S. history==
[[File:Jacco3.jpg|thumb|A turn-up between a dog and [[Jacco Macacco]], the fighting monkey, 1822]]

In 1817, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier was brought to America and dog fighting became part of American culture.<ref name="Gibson 2005"/> Yet, though historical accounts of dog fighting in America can be dated back to the 1750s, it was not until the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861-1865) that widespread interest and participation in the blood sport began in the United States.<ref name="Boucher 2011" /> For instance, in 1881, the Mississippi and Ohio railroads advertised special fares to a dog fight in Louisville; public forums such as Kit Burns' Tavern, "The Sportman's Hall," in Manhattan regularly hosted matches.<ref name="Gibson 2005"/> Many of these dogs thrown into the "professional pits" that flourished during the 1860s came from England and Ireland—where citizens had turned to dogs when bear baiting and bull-baiting became illegal in their countries.<ref name="Boucher 2011" />

In twentieth century America, despite the expansion of laws to outlaw dog fighting, dog fighting continued to flourish underground.<ref name="Boucher 2011" /> Aiding in the expansion of dog fighting were the police and firemen, who saw dog fighting as a form of entertainment amongst their ranks.<ref name="Boucher 2011" /> In fact, the Police Gazzette served as a "go to" source for information about where one could attend a fight.<ref name="Boucher 2011" /> When [[Henry Bergh]], who started the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), witnessed police involvement in these fights, he was motivated to seek and receive authority for the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Agents to have arresting power in New York.<ref name="Boucher 2011" /> Additionally, Bergh's 1867 revision to New York's animal cruelty law made all forms of animal fighting illegal.<ref name="Boucher 2011" /> According to the ASPCA website, the Humane Law Enforcement department of ASPCA is still in effect today.<ref name="Boucher 2011" />  As laws were passed to outlaw the activity, high profile organizations, such as the United Kennel Club, who once endorsed the sport by formulating rules and sanctioning referees, withdrew their endorsement.<ref name="Gibson 2005" />

===Breed origins===
According to one scholar, Richard Strebel, the foundation for modern fighting dogs came from: 1. The Tibetan Dog; 2. The [[English Mastiff|Mastiff]], out of which came the Bordeaux dog, the English Bull dog, and the Pug; 3. The [[Great Dane]], out of which came the Danish Dog and the [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]]; 4. The [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]]; and 5. The [[St. Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernard]], out of which came the Leonberg dog.<ref name="Fleig 1996"/> However, Dieter Fleig disagreed with Strebel and offered the following list as composing of the foundation for modern fighting dogs: 1, The Tibetan Dog; 2. The [[Molossus (dog)|Molossus]]; 3. The Bull Biter; 4. The [[Great Dane]]; 5. The [[English Mastiff|Mastiff]]; 6. The Bull Dog; 5. The [[Bull and Terrier]]; and 6. The Chincha Bulldog.<ref name="Fleig 1996"/>

The foundation breed of the fighting dog was, in its outward appearance, a large, low, heavy breed with a powerful build and strongly developed head, and tremendously threatening voice.<ref name="Fleig 1996"/> Additionally, these foundation breeds were also bred for a powerful jaw that would enable them to defend and protect humans, to overpower and pull down large animals on a hunt, and to control large, unmanageable domestic animals.<ref name="Fleig 1996"/> These dogs were also sometimes equipped with metal plates, chains, and collars with sharp spikes or hooked knives in order to be used in wars throughout history.<ref name="Fleig 1996"/>

When bullbaiting became popular in England due to the shortage of bears, bull baiters soon realized that large fighting dogs were built too heavy and too slow for this type of combat.<ref name="Massey" />  When fighting a bull, dogs were trained to grab onto the bull's nose and pin the bull's head to the ground<ref name="Massey" /> If the dog failed to do this, the bull would fling the dog out of the ring with its horns.<ref name="Massey" /> The British therefore decided to selectively breed fighting dogs for shorter legs and a more powerful jaw.<ref name="Massey" />  These efforts resulted in the [[Old English Bulldog]].<ref name="Massey" />

However, when countries started outlawing bull and bear baiting, dog fighters started pitting dogs against other dogs.<ref name="Massey" /> With the prevalence of such combat, dogfighters soon realized bulldogs were inadequate and began to breed bulldogs with terriers for more desired characteristics.<ref name="Massey" /> Terriers were most likely crossbred with bulldogs due to their "generally rugged body structure," speed, aggression, and "highly developed gameness."<ref name="Massey" />  Yet, there is a debate over which type of terrier was bred with bulldogs in order to create the Bull and Terrier. For instance, Joseph L. Colby claimed that it was the old English White Terrier that the Bull and Terrier is descended from, while Rhonda D. Evans and Craig J. Forsyth contend that its ancestor is the Rat Terrier.<ref name="Massey" />  Carl Semencic, on the other hand, held that a variety of terriers produced the Bull and Terrier.<ref name="Massey" />

Eventually, out of cross breeding bulldogs and terriers, the English created the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.<ref name="Boucher 2011" /> When the [[Staffordshire Bull Terrier]] came to America in 1817, Americans began to selectively breed for  [[gameness]] and created the [[American Pit Bull Terrier]] (originally known as the Pit Bull Terrier), which is a unique breed due to its absence of threat displays when fighting and its docility towards humans.<ref name="Massey" />  Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, and Bull Terriers are all breeds that are commonly labeled as pit bulls.<ref>{{cite web|last=staff |first= |url=http://animallaw.info/local/topics/lotobsl.htm

== Societal aspects ==

After interviewing 31 dogmen and attending 14 dog fights in the Southern United States, Evans, Gauthier, and Forsyth theorized on what attracts men to dog fights.<ref name="Iliopoulou 125–140">{{cite journal |last= Iliopoulou |first=Maria A.  |last2=Rosenbaum |first2=Rene P.  |date= |title=Understanding Blood Sports |url= |journal=Journal of Animal & Natural Resource Law |publisher=Michigan State University College of Law |volume=9 |issue= |pages=125–140 |doi= |accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref> In their study, Evans, et al., discussed dog fighting's attractiveness in terms of masculinity and class immobility.<ref name="Iliopoulou 125–140"/> In the United States, masculinity embodies the qualities of strength, aggression, competition, and striving for success. By embodying these characteristics, a man can gain honor and status in his society.<ref name="Iliopoulou 125–140"/> Yet, working class occupations, unlike middle or upper class occupations, provide limited opportunities to validate this culturally accepted definition of masculinity.<ref name="Iliopoulou 125–140"/> So, working class men look for alternative ways to validate their masculinity and obtain honor and status. One way to do this is through dogfighting.<ref name="Iliopoulou 125–140"/> This is supported by the Evans, et al. findings: the majority of committed dogmen were mostly drawn from the working class, while the middle and upper classes were barely represented.<ref name="Iliopoulou 125–140"/> Men from middle and upper classes have opportunities to express their masculinity through their occupations; dog fighting, therefore, is just a hobby for them while it plays a central role in the lives of working class men.<ref name="Iliopoulou 125–140"/> Those from the higher classes are drawn in by the thrill and excitement of the fight.

Aside from enjoyment of the sport and status, people are also drawn to dog fighting for money.<ref name="Boucher 2011"/> In fact, the average dog fight could easily net more money than an armed robbery, or a series of isolated drug transactions.<ref name="Gibson">{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Hannah|title=Overview of Dog Fighting|url=http://animallaw.info/topics/tabbed%20topic%20page/spusdogfighting.htm|work=Animal Legal and Historical Center|publisher=Michigan State University College of Law|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>

Dogs that are born, bought or stolen for fighting are often neglected and abused from the start.<ref name="Gibson"/>  Most spend their entire lives alone on chains or in cages and only know the attention of a human when they are being trained to fight and they only know the company of other animals in the context of being trained to kill them.<ref name="Gibson"/>  Additionally, most dogs spend their entire lives without adequate food, water, or shelter.<ref name="Gibson"/>

All fighting dogs are conditioned from a very early age to develop what dog-fighters refer to as "gameness."<ref name="Gibson"/>  In the early stages of training, the dogs are incited to lunge at each other without touching and engage in quick, controlled fights called "rolls" or "bumps".<ref name="Gibson"/>  Once the dogs appear match ready, they are pitted against stronger dogs to test their "gameness"  or tenacity in the face of exhaustion and impending defeat.<ref name="Gibson"/>  If the dogs pass the test, they are deemed ready to fight. The scope and method of training varies dramatically depending on the level and experience of the dog-fighter; however, the following implements and techniques are commonly used to train the dogs:<ref name="Gibson"/>

*'''Treadmill:''' Dogs are run on the treadmills to increase cardiovascular fitness and endurance.

*'''Catmill/Jenny:''' Apparatus that looks like a carnival horse walker with several beams jetting out from a central rotating pole. The dogs are chained to one beam and another small animal like a cat, small dog, or rabbit, is harnessed to or hung from another beam. The dogs run in circles, chasing the bait. Once the exercise sessions are over, the dogs are usually rewarded with the bait they had been pursuing.

*'''Springpole/Jumppole:''' A large pole with a spring hanging down to which a rope, tire, or animal hide is affixed that the dogs jump to and dangle from for extended periods of time. This strengthens the jaw muscles and back legs. The same effect is achieved with a simpler spring loaded apparatus hanging from tree limbs. A variation of the springpole is a hanging cage, into which bait animals are placed. The dogs repeatedly lunge up toward the cage.

*'''Flirtpole:''' A handheld pole with a lure attached. The dogs chase the lure along the ground.

*'''Chains:''' Dogs have very heavy chains wrapped around their necks, generally in lieu of collars; they build neck and upper body strength by constantly bearing the immense weight of the chains.

*'''Weights:''' Weights are often affixed to chains and dangled from the dogs' necks. This builds neck and upper body strength. Generally, dogs are permanently chained this way. However, sometimes the trainers run them with their weights attached.

*'''Bait:''' Animals are tied up while the dogs tear them apart or sometimes they are confined in an area to be chased and mauled by the dogs.

*'''Drugs/Vitamins/Supplements:''' Dogs are given vitamins, supplements and drugs to condition them for or to incite them to fight. Commonly utilized vitamins, supplements, and drugs include: iron/liver extract; vitamin B-12; Provim; Magnum supplement; hormones (testosterone, Propionate, Repotest, Probolic Oil); weight-gain supplements; creatine monohydrate; speed; steroids (Winstrol V, Dinabol, Equipose); and cocaine.

Often associated with gang activity, street fighters fight dogs over insults, turf invasions, or simple taunts like "my dog can kill your dog."<ref name="Boucher 2011"/> These type of fights are often spontaneous; unorganized; conducted for money, drugs, or bragging rights;  and occur on street corners, back alleys, and neighborhood playgrounds.<ref name="Boucher 2011"/>  Urban street fighters generally have several dogs chained in back-yards, often behind privacy fences, or in basements or garages.<ref name="animallaw.info"/>  After a street fight,  the dogs are often discovered by police and animal control officers either dead or dying.<ref name="Boucher 2011"/> Due to the spontaneity of a street fight, they are very difficult to respond to unless reported immediately.<ref name="Boucher 2011"/>

Hobbyists and professionals often decry the techniques street fighters use to train their dogs.<ref name="Boucher 2011"/> Such techniques include starving, drugging, and physically abusing the dog.<ref name="Boucher 2011"/>

====Hobbyists====

Hobbyists fight dogs for supplemental income and entertainment purposes.<ref name="Boucher 2011"/>  They typically have one or more dogs participating in several organized fights and operate primarily within a specific geographic network.<ref name="Boucher 2011"/> Hobbyists are also acquainted with one another and tend to return to predetermined fight venues repeatedly.<ref name="animallaw.info"/>

====Professionals====

Professional fighters breed generations of skilled "game dogs" and take a great pride in their dogs' lineage.<ref name="animallaw.info"/> These fighters make a tremendous amount of money charging stud fees to breed their champions, in addition to the fees and winnings they collect for fighting them.<ref name="animallaw.info"/> They also tend to own a large number of dogs—sometimes 50 or more.<ref name="Boucher 2011"/> Professionals also use trade journals, such as Your Friend and Mine, Game Dog Times, The American Warrior, and The Pit Bull Chronicle, to discuss recent fights and to advertise the sale of training equipment and puppies. Some fighters operate on a national or even international level within highly secret networks.<ref name="animallaw.info"/> When a dog is not successful in a fight, a professional may dispose of it using a variety of techniques such as drowning, strangulation, hanging, gunshot, electrocution or some other method.<ref name="Boucher 2011"/> Sometimes professionals and hobbyists dispose of dogs deemed aggressive to humans to street fighters.<ref name="Boucher 2011"/>

===Gang and criminal activities===
[[Image:Dog fighting gang members caught on hidden surveillance camera .jpg|right|thumb|Gang members dog fighting in a vacant office building]]

Dog fighting is a felony in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.<ref name="animallaw.info"/> While dog fighting statutes exist independently of general anti-cruelty statutes and carry stiffer penalties than general state anti-cruelty statutes, a person can be charged under both or can be charged under one, but not the other—depending on the evidence.<ref name="animallaw.info"/> In addition to felony charges for dog fighting, forty-eight states and the District of Columbia, have provisions within their dogfighting statutes that explicitly prohibit attendance as a spectator at a dogfighting exhibition.<ref name="animallaw.info"/> Since Montana and Hawaii do not have such provisions, a person can pay an entrance fee to watch a dog-fight in either state and not be convicted under these statutes. Additionally, forty-six states, and the District of Columbia, make possessing, owning or keeping a fighting dog a felony.<ref name="animallaw.info"/>

While dog fighting was previously seen as isolated animal welfare issues—and therefore rarely enforced, the last decade has produced a growing body of legal and empirical evidence that has revealed a connection between dog-fighting and other crimes within a community, such as organized crime, racketeering, drug distribution, and/or gangs.<ref name="animallaw.info"/> Within the gang community, fighting dogs compete with firearms as the weapon of choice; indeed, their versatile utility arguably surpasses that of a loaded firearm in the criminal underground. Drug dealers distribute their illicit merchandise, wagers are made, weapons are concealed, and the dogs mutilate each other in a bloody frenzy as crowds cheer on.<ref name="animallaw.info"/> Violence often erupts among the usually armed gamblers when debts are to be collected and paid.<ref name="animallaw.info"/> There is also a concern for children who are routinely exposed to dogfighting and are forced to accept the inherent violence as normal.<ref name="animallaw.info"/> The routine exposure of the children to unfettered animal abuse and neglect is a major contributing factor in their later manifestation of social deviance.<ref name="animallaw.info"/>

===Animal welfare and rights===
Animal advocates consider dog fighting to be one of the most serious forms of [[animal abuse]], not only for the violence that the dogs endure during and after the fights, but because of the suffering they often endure in training.

According to a filing in U.S. District Court in Richmond by federal investigators in Virginia, which was obtained under the [[Freedom of Information Act]] and published by the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' on July 6, 2007, a losing dog or one whose potential is considered unacceptable faces "being put to death by drowning, strangulation, hanging, gun shot, electrocution or some other method".<ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/bal-vick0706,0,1487730.story?track=rss Topic Galleries – baltimoresun.com]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref>
Some of the training of fighting dogs may entail the use of small animals (including kittens) as prey for the dogs.

== Status by region ==
Dog fighting has been popular in many countries throughout history and continues to be practiced both legally and illegally around the world.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, dog fighting has increasingly become an unlawful activity in most of the world.

===South Africa===

Dog fighting has been declared illegal in the Republic of South Africa, however it is still very popular in the underground world, with dog fighting being a highly syndicate and organized crime. The NSPCA (National Council of SPCA's) is the largest animal welfare organization in Africa, and has been the organization that has conducted the most raids and busts, of which the most recent was in 2013, where 18 people were arrested, and 14 dogs were involved. Dog fighting is mostly practiced in the Western Cape, in the townships area where gangs and drugs are mostly associated with dog fighting.

Dog fighting has been documented in South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region of [[Stellenbosch]]. The Stellenbosch Animal Welfare Society (AWS) frequently responds to complaints of night-time dog fighting in the town of Cloetesville in which hundreds of dogs fight. Young children may be used to transport fighting dogs to avoid arrest of the owners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animal-info.co.za/dog-fights-back-news-again.html |title=Dog fights are back in the news… again |publisher=Animal-info.co.za |date= |accessdate=2014-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Murphy |first=Caryle |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-167924565.html |title=Hundreds of animals savaged in night-time dog fighting in Cloetesville |publisher=Highbeam.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-10}}</ref>

===Asia===

====Afghanistan====
Previously banned by the [[Taliban]], dog fighting has made a resurgence throughout [[Afghanistan]] as a winter weekend pastime.

In [[Kabul]], the fights are public and policed for safety to the spectators.  Dogs are not fought to the death, but to submission.  Top dogs are worth as much as a new car.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://content.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,810066760001_2056513,00.html | title=The Dog Fighters of Kabul | work=Time | accessdate=February 19, 2014 | author=Motlagh, Jason | location=Kabul}}</ref>

====India====
Dog fighting is not common, but can be found in some rural areas, and is [[law|illegal]] as defined by the Indian law.

====Japan====
[[Image:Boss - Janev.jpg|thumb|[[Tosa (dog)]], fighting breed of Japan]]
According to historical documents, [[H?j? Takatoki]], the 14th [[shikken]] ([[shogun|shogun's]] regent) of the [[Kamakura shogunate]] was known to be obsessed with dog fighting, to the point where he allowed his [[samurai]] to pay taxes with dogs. During this period dog fighting was known as {{nihongo|''inuawase''|????}}.

Dog fighting was considered a way for the Samurai to retain their aggressive edge during peaceful times. Several [[daimy?]], such as [[Chosokabe Motochika]] and [[Yamauchi Yodo]], both from [[Tosa Province]] (present-day [[K?chi Prefecture]]), were known to encourage dog fighting. Dog fighting was also popular in [[Akita Prefecture]], which is the origin of the [[Akita Inu|Akita]] breed.

Dog fighting evolved in [[K?chi Prefecture|K?chi]] to a form that is called {{nihongo|''t?ken''|??}}. Under modern rules, dogs fight in a fenced ring until one of the dogs barks, yelps, or loses the will to fight.  Owners are allowed to throw in the towel, and matches are stopped if a doctor judges it is too dangerous.  Draws usually occur when both dogs will not fight or both dogs fight until the time limit.  There are various other rules, including one that specifies that a dog will lose if it attempts to [[mating|copulate]].  Champion dogs are called [[yokozuna (sumo)|yokozuna]], as in [[sumo]].  Dog fighting is not banned at a nationwide level, but the prefectures of [[Tokyo]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture|Kanagawa]], [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]], [[Ishikawa Prefecture|Ishikawa]], [[Toyama Prefecture|Toyama]] and [[Hokkaid?]] all ban the practice.<ref>[http://www.weblio.jp/content/%E9%97%98%E7%8A%AC%E3%80%81%E9%97%98%E9%B6%8F%E3%80%81%E9%97%98%E7%89%9B%E7%AD%89%E5%8F%96%E7%B7%A0%E6%9D%A1%E4%BE%8B Weblio Dictionary] {{jp icon}}</ref>  Currently, most fighting dogs in Japan are of the [[Tosa (dog)|Tosa]] breed which is native to K?chi.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bulldoginformation.com/Tosa-inu.html |title=Tosa inu history and breed information |work=Bulldog Information |accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref>

====Pakistan====
Dog fighting and other forms of animal fighting are extremely popular in all parts of rural [[Pakistan]], and is deeply rooted in the rural culture, where some 70 percent of the population resides. It has been a way for tribes, clans and the rural people to socialize while being entertained. 
<ref>{{cite news | title = The horrific world of dog fighting tournaments in Pakistan | url =
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1361475/Pictured-The-horrific-world-dog-fighting-tournaments-Pakistan-baying-mob-urges-animals-fight-death.html
|date= February 28, 2011 | accessdate = August 27, 2012 | location=London | work=Daily Mail}}</ref>
Even though it has recently been banned by law, it is still being practiced in rural Pakistan, especially in provinces such as [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Azad Kashmir]], [[Sindh]] and [[Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa]]. There can apparently be as much as millions of [[Pakistani Rupees|rupees]] at stake for the owners of winning dogs,<ref>{{cite web | title = Dog fighting in pakistan is alive and kicking | url =

|date= January 23, 2012 | accessdate = August 27, 2012}}</ref> so different breeds have carefully been bred and selected specifically for the purpose, such as the [[Bully Kutta]] and [[Gull Dong]].

===Australia===
Dog fighting and the possession of any fighting equipment designed for dog fighting is illegal in Australia. Dog fighting in Australia is often associated with gambling activities and other illegal practices such as drug dealing and firearms.<ref name=RSPCA>{{cite web
| title = Is dog fighting illegal in Australia?  | work = RSPCA Australia Knowledgebase | url = http://kb.rspca.org.au/Is-dog-fighting-illegal-in-Australia_237.html
|date= n.d. | accessdate = January 26, 2010 }}</ref> The RSPCA is concerned that dog fighting involves the suffering or even the death of dogs for the purpose of entertainment. The illegal nature of dogfighting in Australia means that injured dogs rarely get veterinary treatment placing the dog's health and welfare at even greater risk.<ref name=RSPCA/> "Restricted Breed Dogs" cannot be imported into Australia. These include the [[Dogo Argentino]], the [[Japanese Tosa]], the [[Fila Brasileiro]], the [[Perro de Presa Canario]] and the [[American Pit Bull Terrier]]. Of these, the Pit Bull Terrier and the Perro de Presa Canario are the only breeds currently known to exist in Australia and there are strict regulations on keeping these breeds, including a prohibition on transferring ownership.<ref>{{cite web | title = Things you should know about restricted breed dogs | url = http://www.pets.dpi.vic.gov.au/community/attachments/attachment15.pdf |date= November 4, 2005 | accessdate = January 26, 2010}}</ref>

===Europe===

====Russia====
Although animal cruelty laws exist in Russia, dog fighting is widely practiced. Laws prohibiting dogfights have been passed in certain places, and in others dogfights are legally held generally using [[Caucasian Shepherd Dog]], [[Georgian shepherd]], [[Central Asian Shepherd Dog]]. [[Temperament test]]s, which are a common and relatively mild form of dog fighting used for breeding purposes, are fairly commonplace. Dog fighting is prohibited in Moscow by order of that city's mayor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/09/world/europe/09dogfight.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1 |title=A Brutal Sport Is Having Its Day Again in Russia |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-10}}</ref>

====United Kingdom====
Despite periodic dog-fight prosecutions, illegal canine pit battles continued after the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1835]] of England and Wales. Sporting journals of the 18th and 19th centuries depict the [[Black Country]] and [[London]] as the primary [[England|English]] dog fight centres of the period.

===North America===
{{Main|Dog fighting in the United States}}

Dog fighting is illegal in the United States. It has been illegal in Canada since 1892; however, the current law requires police to catch individuals during the unlawful act, which is often difficult.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cfhs.ca/law/federal_legislation/ |title=Canadian Federal Legislation regarding animal welfare |publisher=Cfhs.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-05-10}}</ref>

According to a study by the College of Law of [[Michigan State University]] published in 2005, in the United States, dog fighting was once completely legal and was sanctioned and promoted during the colonial period (17th century through 1776) and continuing through the Victorian era in the late 19th century. It has become increasingly outlawed, a trend which has continued into the 21st century.

As of 2008, dog fighting is a [[felony]] in all states. It is against the law even to attend a dog fighting event, regardless of direct participation.

CNN estimated that in the United States about 40,000 individuals are involved as professionals in the sport of dog fighting as a commercial activity. Top fights are said to have potential purses of $100,000 (USD). CNN also stated that more than 100,000 people are engaged in dog fighting on a non-professional basis.<ref name="CNN-20070719">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/07/18/dog.fighting/|title=Dogfighting a booming business, experts say|date=2007-07-19|accessdate=4 April 2013|work=CNN}}</ref>

Despite legality issues, dogs are still commonly used for fighting purposes all across the continent.

===South America===
Dog fighting is illegal in much of South America. The [[American Pit Bull Terrier]] is by far the most common breed involved in the bloodsport. The [[Fila Brasileiro]] and [[Dogo Argentino]] are also used as fighting dogs. The [[Dogo Cubano]] and [[Dogo Cordoba]] were used for fighting a century ago, but have become extinct.

'''Juris Hartmanis''' (born July 5, 1928) is a prominent [[computer scientist]] and [[computational theorist]] who, with [[Richard Stearns (computer scientist)|Richard E. Stearns]], received the 1993 [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Turing Award]] "in recognition of their seminal paper which established the foundations for the field of [[computational complexity theory]]".

Hartmanis was born in [[Latvia]]. He was a son of M?rti?š Hartmanis, a general in the Latvian Army. After the Soviet Union [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940|occupied Latvia in 1940]], M?rti?š Hartmanis was arrested by Soviets and died in a prison. At the end of [[World War II]], the wife and children of M?rti?š Hartmanis left Latvia as refugees, fearing for their safety if the Soviet Union took over Latvia again.

They first moved to [[Germany]], where Juris Hartmanis received the equivalent of a [[Master's degree]] in Physics from the [[University of Marburg]]. Then he moved to the [[United States]], where he received [[Master's degree]] in Applied Mathematics at the [[University of Kansas City]] (now known as the [[University of Missouri-Kansas City]]) in 1951 and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Mathematics from [[Caltech]] under the supervision of [[Robert P. Dilworth]] in 1955. The [[University of Missouri-Kansas City]] honored him with Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in May 1999. 

After teaching at [[Cornell University]] and [[Ohio State University]], Hartmanis joined the [[General Electric]] Research Laboratory in 1958. While at General Electric, he developed many principles of computational complexity theory. In 1965, he became a professor at [[Cornell University]]. At Cornell, he was one of founders and the first chairman of its [[computer science]] department (which was one of the first computer science departments in the world). Hartmanis is a [[Fellow]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] and of the [[American Mathematical Society]]<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-01-19.</ref> and a member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]] and [[National Academy of Sciences]].<ref>[http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/2013_04_30_NAS_Election.html National Academy of Sciences Members and Foreign Associates Elected], [[National Academy of Sciences]], April 30, 2013.</ref>

He is best known for his Turing-award winning paper with Richard Stearns, in which he introduced [[time complexity]] classes ''[[DTIME|TIME (f(n))]]'' and proved the [[time hierarchy theorem]]. Another paper by Hartmanis from 1977, with Leonard Berman, introduced the still-unsolved [[Berman–Hartmanis conjecture]] that all NP-complete languages are polynomial time isomorphic.

'''Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory''' (also known as '''VC theory''') was developed during 1960–1990 by [[Vladimir Vapnik]] and [[Alexey Chervonenkis]]. The theory is a form of [[computational learning theory]], which attempts to explain the learning process from a statistical point of view.

VC theory is related to [[statistical learning theory]]  and to [[empirical processes]].  [[Richard M. Dudley]] and [[Vladimir Vapnik]] himself, among others, apply VC-theory to [[empirical processes]].
== Introduction ==
VC theory covers at least four parts (as explained in ''The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory''{{ref|nslt}}):
*Theory of consistency of learning processes 
**What are (necessary and sufficient) conditions for consistency of a learning process based on the [[empirical risk minimization]] principle?
*Nonasymptotic theory of the rate of convergence of learning processes 
**How fast is the rate of convergence of the learning process?
*Theory of controlling the generalization ability of learning processes
**How can one control the rate of convergence (the [[Machine learning#Generalization|generalization]] ability) of the learning process?
*Theory of constructing learning machines
**How can one construct algorithms that can control the generalization ability?

VC Theory is a major subbranch of [[statistical learning theory]]. One of its main applications in statistical learning theory is to provide [[Machine learning#Generalization|generalization]] conditions for learning algorithms.  From this point of view, VC theory is related to '''[[Stability (learning theory)|stability]]''', which is an alternative approach for characterizing generalization.

In addition, VC theory and [[VC dimension]] are instrumental in the theory of [[empirical processes]], in the case of processes indexed by VC classes. Arguably these are the most important applications of the VC theory, and are employed in proving generalization. Several techniques will be introduced that are widely used in the empirical process and VC theory. The discussion is mainly based on the book "Weak Convergence and Empirical Processes: With Applications to Statistics"{{ref|wcep}}.

== Overview of VC theory in Empirical Processes ==

=== Background on Empirical Processes ===

Let <math>X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n</math> are random elements defined on a measurable space <math>(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{A})</math>. Define the empirical measure <math>\mathbb{P}_n = n^{-1} \sum_{i = 1}^n \delta_{X_i}</math>, where <math>\delta</math> here stands for the [[dirac measure]].  Denote with <math>Qf = \int f dQ</math> for a measure <math>Q</math>. Measurability issues, will be ignored here. For more technical detail consult{{ref|nslt}}.

Let <math>\mathcal{F}</math> be a class of measurable functions <math>f:\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</math>. The empirical measure induces a map from <math>\mathcal{F}</math>to <math>\mathbb{R}</math> given by:

<center><math>f \mapsto \mathbb{P}_n f</math></center>

Let <math>\vert\vert Q\vert\vert_{\mathcal{F}} = \sup \{\vert Qf \vert: f \in \mathcal{F} \}</math>. Empirical Processes theory aims at identifying classes <math>\mathcal{F}</math> for which statements like:

*  <math> \vert \vert \mathbb{P}_n - P\vert \vert_{\mathcal{F}} \rightarrow 0 </math>, aka uniform law of large numbers
*  <math> \mathbb{G}_n = \sqrt{n} (\mathbb{P}_n - P) \rightsquigarrow \mathbb{G}, \quad </math> in <math>\ell^{\infty}(\mathcal{F})</math>, aka uniform central limit theorem

hold. Here <math>P</math> is the underlying true distribution of the data, which is unknown in practice. In the former case the class  <math>\mathcal{F}</math>  is called ''Glivenko-Cantelli'', and in the latter case (under the assumption <math>\sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}}\vert f(x) - Pf \vert < \infty. \forall x</math>) the class <math>\mathcal{F}</math> is called ''Donsker'' or <math>P</math>-Donsker. Obviously, a Donsker class is Glivenko-Cantelli in probability by an application of [[Slutsky's theorem]] .

These statements are true for a single <math>f</math>, by standard [[Law of large numbers|LLN]], [[Central limit theorem|CLT]]  arguments under regularity conditions, and the difficulty in the Empirical Processes comes in because joint statements are being made for all <math>f \in \mathcal{F}</math>. Intuitively then, the set <math>\mathcal{F}</math> cannot be too large, and as it turns out that the geometry of <math>\mathcal{F}</math> plays a very important role.

One way of measuring how big the function set <math>\mathcal{F}</math> is to use the so-called [[covering number]]s. The covering number <math>N(\varepsilon, \mathcal{F}, ||\cdot||)</math> is the minimal number of balls <math>\{g: ||g - f|| < \varepsilon \}</math> needed to cover the set <math>\mathcal{F}</math> (here it is obviously assumed that there is an underlying norm on <math>\mathcal{F}</math>).  The entropy is the logarithm of the covering number.

Two sufficient conditions are provided below, under which it can be proved that the set <math>\mathcal{F}</math> is Glivenko-Cantelli or Donsker.

A class <math>\mathcal{F}</math>  is <math>P</math>-Glivenko-Cantelli if it is <math>P</math>-measurable with envelope <math>F</math> such that <math>P^{\ast} F < \infty</math> and satisfies:

<center><math>\sup_{Q} N(\varepsilon ||F||_Q, \mathcal{F}, L_1(Q)) < \infty</math> for every <math>\varepsilon > 0</math>.</center>

The next condition is a version of the celebrated [[Dudley's theorem]]. If <math>\mathcal{F}</math> is a class of functions such that

<center><math>\int_0^{\infty} \sup_{Q} \sqrt{\log N(\varepsilon ||F||_{Q,2}, \mathcal{F}, L_2(Q))}d \varepsilon < \infty</math></center>

then <math>\mathcal{F}</math> is <math>P</math>-Donsker for every probability measure <math>P </math> such that <math>P^{\ast} F^2 < \infty</math>. In the last integral, the notation means <math>||f||_{Q,2} = \left(\int |f|^2 d Q\right)^{1/2}</math>.

=== Symmetrization ===

The majority of the arguments of how to bound the empirical process, rely on symmetrization, maximal and concentration inequalities and chaining.  Symmetrization is usually the first step of the proofs, and since it is used in many machine learning proofs on bounding empirical loss functions (including the proof of the VC inequality which is discussed in the next section) it is presented here.

Consider the empirical process:

<center><math>f \mapsto (\mathbb{P}_n - P)f = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n (f(X_i) - Pf) </math></center>

Turns out that there is a connection between the empirical and the following symmetrized process:

<center><math>f \mapsto \mathbb{P}^0_n = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n \varepsilon_i f(X_i) </math></center>

The symmetrized process is a Rademacher process, conditionally on the data <math>X_i </math>. Therefore it is a sub-Gaussian process by [[Hoeffding's inequality]].

'''Lemma (Symmetrization).''' For every nondecreasing, convex <math>\Phi : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</math> and class of measurable functions <math>\mathcal{F}</math>,

<center><math> \mathbb{E} \Phi (||\mathbb{P}_n - P||_{\mathcal{F}}) \leq  \mathbb{E} \Phi (2 ||\mathbb{P}^0_n||_{\mathcal{F}}) </math></center>

The proof of the Symmetrization lemma relies on introducing independent copies of the original variables <math>X_i</math> (sometimes referred to as a ''ghost sample'') and replacing the inner expectation of the LHS by these copies. After an application of Jensen's inequality different signs could be introduced (hence the name symmetrization) without changing the expectation. The proof can be found below because of its instructive nature.

<div class="NavFrame collapsed">
  <div class="NavHead">[Proof]</div>
  <div class="NavContent">
    Introduce the "ghost sample" <math>Y_1,\ldots, Y_n</math> to be independent copies of <math>X_1,\ldots, X_n</math>. For fixed values of <math>X_1,\ldots, X_n</math> one has:
    <center><math>||\mathbb{P}_n - P||_{\mathcal{F}} = \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \dfrac{1}{n} \left|\sum_{i = 1}^n [f(X_i) - \mathbb{E} f(Y_i)] \right| \leq \mathbb{E}_{Y} \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \dfrac{1}{n} \left|\sum_{i = 1}^n [f(X_i) - f(Y_i)] \right|</math></center>
   Therefore by Jensen's inequality:
<center><math>\Phi(||\mathbb{P}_n - P||_{\mathcal{F}}) \leq \mathbb{E}_{Y} \Phi \left(\left|\left| \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n [f(X_i) - f(Y_i)] \right|\right|_{\mathcal{F}} \right)</math></center>
   Taking expectation with respect to <math>X</math> gives:
<center><math>\mathbb{E}\Phi(||\mathbb{P}_n - P||_{\mathcal{F}}) \leq \mathbb{E}_{X}  \mathbb{E}_{Y} \Phi \left(\left|\left| \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n [f(X_i) - f(Y_i)] \right|\right|_{\mathcal{F}}\right)</math></center>
   Note that adding a minus sign in front of a term <math>[f(X_i) - f(Y_i)]</math> doesn't change the RHS, because it's a symmetric function of 
  <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math>. Therefore the RHS remains the same under "sign perturbation":
<center><math>\mathbb{E} \Phi \left( \left|\left| \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n e_i[f(X_i) - f(Y_i)] \right|\right|_{\mathcal{F}} \right) </math></center>
   for any <math>(e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_n) \in \{-1,1\}^n</math>. Therefore:
<center><math>\mathbb{E}\Phi(||\mathbb{P}_n - P||_{\mathcal{F}}) \leq \mathbb{E}_{\varepsilon}  \mathbb{E} \Phi \left( \left|\left| \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n \varepsilon_i [f(X_i) - f(Y_i)] \right|\right|_{\mathcal{F}} \right)</math>
</center>
   Finally using first triangle inequality and then convexity of <math>\Phi</math> gives:
<center><math>\mathbb{E}\Phi(||\mathbb{P}_n - P||_{\mathcal{F}}) \leq \dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\varepsilon}  \mathbb{E} \Phi \left( 2 \left|\left| \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n \varepsilon_i f(X_i)\right|\right|_{\mathcal{F}} \right) + \dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\varepsilon}  \mathbb{E} \Phi \left( 2 \left|\left| \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n \varepsilon_i f(Y_i)\right|\right|_{\mathcal{F}} \right)</math>
   Where the last two expressions on the RHS are the same, which concludes the proof.
</center>
  </div>
</div>

A typical way of proving empirical CLTs, first uses symmetrization to pass the empirical process to <math>\mathbb{P}_n^0</math> and then argue conditionally on the data, using the fact that Rademacher processes are simple processes with nice properties.

=== VC Connection ===

It turns out that there is a fascinating connection between certain combinatorial properties of the set <math>\mathcal{F}</math> and the entropy numbers. Uniform  covering numbers can be controlled by the notion of ''Vapnik-Cervonenkis classes of sets'' - or shortly ''VC sets''.

Take a collection of subsets of the sample space <math>\mathcal{X}</math> -<math>\mathcal{C}</math>. A collection of sets <math>\mathcal{C}</math> is said to ''pick out'' a certain subset of the finite set <math>S = \{x_1,\ldots, x_n\} \subset \mathcal{X}</math> if <math>S = S \cap C</math> for some <math>C \in \mathcal{C}</math>. <math>\mathcal{C}</math> is said to ''shatter'' <math>S</math> if it picks out each of its <math>2^n</math> subsets. The ''VC-index'' (similar to [[VC dimension]] + 1 for an appropriately chosen classifier set) <math>V(\mathcal{C})</math> of <math>\mathcal{C}</math> is the smallest <math>n</math> for which no set of size <math>n</math> is shattered by <math>\mathcal{C}</math>.

[[Sauer–Shelah lemma|Sauer's lemma]] then states that the number <math>\Delta_n(\mathcal{C}, x_1, \ldots, x_n)</math> of subsets picked out by a VC-class <math>\mathcal{C}</math> satisfies:

<center><math>\max_{x_1,\ldots, x_n} \Delta_n(\mathcal{C}, x_1, \ldots, x_n) \leq \sum_{j = 0}^{V(\mathcal{C}) - 1} {n \choose j} \leq \left( \frac{n e}{V(\mathcal{C}) - 1}\right)^{V(\mathcal{C}) - 1}</math></center>

Which is a polynomial number <math>O(n^{V(\mathcal{C}) - 1})</math> of subsets rather than an exponential number. Intuitively this means that a finite VC-index implies that <math>\mathcal{C}</math> has an apparent simplistic structure.

A similar bound can be shown (with a different constant, same rate) for the so-called ''VC subgraph classes''. For a function <math>f : \mathcal{X} \mapsto \mathbb{R}</math> the [[Hypograph (mathematics)|''subgraph'']] is a subset of <math>\mathcal{X} \times \mathbb{R}</math> such that: <math>\{(x,t): t < f(x)\}</math>. A collection of <math>\mathcal{F}</math> is called a VC subgraph class if all subgraphs form a VC-class.

Consider a set of indicator functions <math> \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{C}} = \{1_C: C \in \mathcal{C} \}</math> in <math>L_1(Q)</math> for discrete empirical type of measure <math>Q</math> (or equivalently for any probability measure <math>Q</math>). It can then be shown that quite remarkably, for <math>r \geq 1</math>:

<center><math>N(\varepsilon, \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{C}}, L_r(Q)) \leq KV(\mathcal{C}) (4e)^{V(\mathcal{C})} \left(\dfrac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)^{r (V(\mathcal{C}) - 1)}</math></center>

Further consider the ''symmetric convex hull'' of a set <math>\mathcal{F}</math>: <math>\operatorname{sconv}\mathcal{F}</math> being the collection of functions of the form <math>\sum_{i =1}^m \alpha_i f_i</math> with <math>\sum_{i =1}^m |\alpha_i| \leq 1</math>. Then if

<center><math>N(\varepsilon||F||_{Q,2}, \mathcal{F}, L_2(Q)) \leq C \left(\dfrac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)^V</math></center>

the following is valid for the convex hull of <math>\mathcal{F}</math>:

<center><math>\log N(\varepsilon||F||_{Q,2}, \operatorname{sconv}\mathcal{F}, L_2(Q)) \leq K \left(\dfrac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)^{\frac{2V}{V + 2}}</math></center>

The important consequence of this fact is that the power of <math>1/\varepsilon</math> -- <math>2V/(V + 2)</math> is strictly less than 2, which is just enough so that the entropy integral is going to converge, and therefore the class <math>\operatorname{sconv}\mathcal{F}</math> is going to be <math>P</math>-Donsker.

Finally an example of a VC-subgraph class is considered. Any finite-dimensional vector space <math>\mathcal{F}</math> of measurable functions <math>f:\mathcal{X} \mapsto \mathbb{R}</math> is VC-subgraph of index smaller than or equal to <math>\dim(\mathcal{F}) + 2</math>.

<div class="NavFrame collapsed">
  <div class="NavHead">[Proof]</div>
  <div class="NavContent">
   Take <math>n = \dim(\mathcal{F}) + 2 </math> points <math>(x_1, t_1), \ldots, (x_n, t_n)</math>. The vectors:
<center><math>(f(x_1), \ldots, f(x_n)) - (t_1, \ldots, t_n)</math></center>
   are in a <math>n - 1</math> dimensional subspace of <math>\mathbb{R}^n</math>. Take <math>a \neq 0</math>, a non-zero vector that is orthogonal to this subspace. Therefore:
<center><math>\sum_{a_i > 0} a_i (f(x_i) - t_i) = \sum_{a_i < 0} (-a_i) (f(x_i) - t_i), \quad \forall f \in \mathcal{F}</math></center>
   Consider the set <math>S = \{(x_i, t_i): a_i > 0\}</math>. This set cannot be picked out since if there is some <math>f</math> such that <math>S = \{(x_i,t_i): f(x_i) > t_i\}</math> that would imply 
   that the LHS is strictly positive but the RHS is non-negative.
  </div>
</div>

There are generalizations of the notion VC subgraph class, e.g. there is the notion of pseudo-dimension. The interested reader can look into{{ref|pollard}}.

== VC Inequality ==

A similar setting is considered, which is more common to [[machine learning]]. Let <math>\mathcal{X}</math> is a feature space and <math>\mathcal{Y} = \{0,1\}</math>. A function <math>f : \mathcal{X} \mapsto \mathcal{Y}</math> is called a classifier. Let <math>\mathcal{F}</math> be a set of classifiers. Similarly to the previous section, define the ''[[Shattered set|shattering coefficient]]'' <math>S(\mathcal{F},n) = \max_{x_1,\ldots, x_n} |\{(f(x_1), \ldots, f(x_n)), f \in \mathcal{F}\}|</math>. The shattering coefficient is also known as growth function. Note here that there is a 1-1 mapping between each of the functions in <math>\mathcal{F}</math> and the set on which the function is 1. Therefore in terms of the previous section the shattering coefficient is precisely <math>\max_{x_1,\ldots, x_n} \Delta_n(\mathcal{C}, x_1, \ldots, x_n)</math> for <math>\mathcal{C}</math> being the collection of all sets described above. Now for the same reasoning as before, namely using Sauer's Lemma it can be shown that <math>S(\mathcal{F},n)</math> is going to be polynomial in <math>n</math> provided that the class <math>\mathcal{F}</math> has a finite VC-dimension or equivalently the collection  <math>\mathcal{C}</math> has finite VC-index.

Let <math>D_n = \{(X_1, Y_1), \ldots, (X_n,Y_m)\}</math> is an observed dataset. Assume that the data is generated by an unknown probability distribution <math>P_{XY}</math>. Define <math>R(f) = P(f(X) \neq Y)</math> to be the expected 0/1 loss. Of course since <math>P_{XY}</math> is unknown in general, one has no access to <math>R(f) </math>. However the ''empirical risk'', given by:

<center><math>\hat{R}_n(f) = \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n \mathbb{I}(f(X_n) \neq Y_n)</math></center>

can certainly be evaluated. Then one has the following Theorem:

'''Theorem (VC Inequality)''' For binary classification and the 0/1 loss function we have the following generalization bounds:

<center><math>P\left(\sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} |\hat{R}_n(f) - R(f)| >\varepsilon \right) \leq 8 S(\mathcal{F},n) e^{-n\varepsilon^2/32} </math></center>

and

<center><math>\mathbb{E}\left[\sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} |\hat{R}_n(f) - R(f)| \right] \leq 2 \sqrt{\dfrac{\log S(\mathcal{F},n)  + \log 2}{n}}</math></center>

In words the VC inequality is saying that as the sample increases, provided that <math>\mathcal{F}</math> has a finite VC dimension, the empirical 0/1 risk becomes a good proxy for the expecred 0/1 risk. Note that both RHS of the two inequalities will converge to 0, provided that <math>S(\mathcal{F},n)</math> grows polynomially in <math>n</math>.

The connection between this framework and the Empirical Process framework is evident. Here one is dealing with a modified empirical process <math>|\hat{R}_n - R|_{\mathcal{F}}</math> but not surprisingly the ideas are the same. The proof of the (first part of) VC inequality, relies on symmetrization, and then argue conditionally on the data using concentration inequalities (in particular [[Hoeffding's inequality]]). The interested reader can check the book {{ref|aptpp}} Theorems 12.4 and 12.5.

[[File:Raummeter hg.jpg|thumb|280px| The stère as a cubic metre of stacked firewood]]
The '''stere''' or '''stère''' is a [[units of measurement|unit]] of [[volume]] in the [[metric system|original metric system]] equal to one [[cubic metre]]. The name was coined from the Greek ??????? ''stereos'', "solid", in 1793 [[France]] as a metric analogue to the [[Cord (unit of volume)|cord]]. The stère is typically used for measuring large quantities of firewood or other cut wood,<ref>{{cite web

In Dutch there's also a ''kuub'', short for ''kubieke meter'' which is similar but different. Whereas a "kuub" is a full cubic metre, as it was traditionally used for wood a stère is a cubic metre pile of woodblocks. Such a stère is a little bit less than a kuub or full cubic metre of wood, because the spaces between the woodblocks are included in a stère while they're not in a kuub. In Finnish, the same unit is known as ''motti'' (from Swedish ''mått'', "measure").

Note that the stère as used in contexts outside the timber industry is not subject to the same ambiguity.<ref>[http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict1&Query=kilostere&Strategy=*&Database=*&submit=Submit+query Webster 1913]</ref> In particular, stère and kilostère are sometimes used in hydrology, as the kilostere is a slightly larger metric analog of an [[acre-foot]], similar to the relationship of the [[tonne]] and [[short ton|(short) ton]].<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/34/885.toc.pdf ] {{doi|10.1126/science.34.885.813}}</ref>

WARN  - 2014-11-30 14:42:44.628; org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.SolrWriter; Error creating document : SolrInputDocument(fields: [contents=In [[Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory|statistical learning theory]], or sometimes [[computational learning theory]], the '''VC dimension''' (for '''Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension''') is a measure of the '''capacity''' of a [[statistical classification]] [[algorithm]], defined as the [[cardinality]] of the largest set of points that the algorithm can [[Shattering (machine learning)|shatter]]. It is a core concept in [[Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory]], and was originally defined by [[Vladimir Vapnik]] and [[Alexey Chervonenkis]].

Informally, the capacity of a classification model is related to how complicated it can be. For example, consider the [[Heaviside step function|thresholding]] of a high-[[degree of a polynomial|degree]] [[polynomial]]: if the polynomial evaluates above zero, that point is classified as positive, otherwise as negative. A high-degree polynomial can be wiggly, so it can fit a given set of training points well. But one can expect that the classifier will make errors on other points, because it is too wiggly. Such a polynomial has a high capacity. A much simpler alternative is to threshold a linear function. This function may not fit the training set well, because it has a low capacity. This notion of capacity is made rigorous below.

== Shattering ==

A classification model <math>f</math> with some parameter vector <math>\theta</math> is said to ''shatter'' a set of data points <math>(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)</math> if, for all assignments of labels to those points, there exists a <math>\theta</math> such that the model <math>f</math> makes no errors when evaluating that set of data points.

The VC dimension of a model <math>f</math> is the maximum number of points that can be arranged so that <math>f</math> shatters them.  More formally, it is <math>h'</math> where <math>h'</math> is the maximum <math>h</math> such that some data point set of [[cardinality]] <math>h</math> can be shattered by <math>f</math>.

For example, consider a [[linear classifier|straight line]] as the classification model: the model used by a [[perceptron]]. The line should separate positive data points from negative data points. There exist sets of 3 points that can indeed be shattered using this model (any 3 points that are not collinear can be shattered). However, no set of 4 points can be shattered: by [[Radon's theorem]], any four points can be partitioned into two subsets with intersecting convex hulls, so it is not possible to separate one of these two subsets from the other. Thus, the VC dimension of this particular classifier is&nbsp;3. It is important to remember that while one can choose any arrangement of points, the arrangement of those points cannot change when attempting to shatter for some label assignment. Note, only 3 of the 2<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;8 possible label assignments are shown for the three points.

== Uses ==

The VC dimension has utility in statistical learning theory, because it can predict a [[probabilistic]] [[upper bound]] on the test error of a classification model.

Vapnik <ref>Vapnik, Vladimir. The nature of statistical learning theory. springer, 2000.</ref>  proved that the probability of the test error distancing from an upper bound (on data that is drawn [[Independent identically-distributed random variables|i.i.d.]] from the same distribution as the training set) is given by

<math>
   P \left(\text{test error} \leq \text{training error} + \sqrt{h(\log(2N/h)+1)-\log(\eta/4)\over N} \right) = 1 - \eta
</math>

where <math>h</math> is the VC dimension of the classification model, and <math>N</math> is the size of the training set (restriction: this formula is valid when <math>h \ll N</math>). Similar complexity bounds can be derived using [[Rademacher complexity]], but Rademacher complexity can sometimes provide more insight than VC dimension calculations into such statistical methods such as those using [[kernel methods|kernels]].

In [[computational geometry]], VC dimension is one of the critical parameters in the size of [[E-net (computational geometry)|?-nets]], which determines the complexity of approximation algorithms based on them; range sets without finite VC dimension may not have finite ?-nets at all.

[[File:Greekhistory.GIF|thumb|The territorial expansion of Greece, 1832-1947.]]

The '''Megali Idea''' ({{lang-el|?????? ????}} ''Megáli Idéa'', "Great Idea"<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=AjDYlMB9amwC|title=The Mediterranean in the Age of Globalization: Migration, Welfare & Borders|last=Mateos|first=Natalia Ribas|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]}}</ref>) was an [[irredentist]] concept of [[Greek nationalism]] that expressed the goal of establishing a Greek state that would encompass all ethnic [[Greeks|Greek]]-inhabited areas, including the large Greek populations that, after the restoration of [[Greek War of Independence|Greek independence]] in 1830 from the [[Ottoman Empire]], still lived under Ottoman occupation.<ref>http://www.nsd.uib.no/european_election_database/country/greece/introduction.html</ref>

The term appeared for the first time during the debates of [[Prime Ministers of Greece|Prime Minister]] [[Ioannis Kolettis]] with [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]] that preceded the promulgation of the 1844 constitution.<ref name="BA0">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-26420 ''History of Greece''] Encyclopædia Britannica Online</ref> This was a visionary nationalist aspiration that was to dominate foreign relations and, to a significant extent, determine domestic politics of the Greek state for much of the first century of its independent existence. If the expression was new in 1844, the concept had roots in the Greek popular psyche, nurtured as it was by prophecies and legends that had kept hopes of eventual liberation from Turkish rule and imperial (Byzantine) restoration alive.<ref name="BA0" /> This is reflected in the folk saying:
<blockquote>???? ?? ?????? ?? ???????,
:???? ???? ??? ?? '???!
(''Once more, as years and time go by, once more they shall be ours'').<ref name="BK0">D. Bolukbasi and D. Bölükba??, ''Turkey And Greece: The Aegean Disputes'', Routledge Cavendish 2004</ref></blockquote>
The ''Megali Idea'' implied the goal of reviving the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire by establishing a [[Greece|Greek state]], which would be, as ancient geographer [[Strabo]] wrote, a Greek world encompassing mostly the former Byzantine lands from the [[Ionian Sea]] to the west, to [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Black Sea]] to the east, and from [[Thrace]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Epirus]] to the north, to [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]] to the south. This new state would have [[Constantinople]] as its capital: it would be the "Greece of Two Continents and Five Seas" (Europe and Asia, and the Ionian, Aegean, Marmara, Black, and Libyan Seas, respectively).

The ''Megali Idea'' dominated foreign policy and domestic politics of [[Greece]] from the [[Greek War of Independence|War of Independence]] in the 1820s through the [[Balkan wars]] in the beginning of the 20th century. It started to fade after the defeat of Greece in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] and the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]] in 1922, followed by the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|exchange of population between Greece and Turkey in 1923]]. Despite the end of the Megali Idea project in 1922, the Greek state expanded five times in its history, either through military conquest or through successful diplomacy (often with British support). In particular, after the creation of Greece in 1830, the following regions were annexed and became Greek territory: [[Ionian Islands]] (1864), [[Thessaly]] (1881), [[Macedonia (Greece)|southern Macedonia]], [[Crete]], [[Epirus (region)|southern Epirus]] and the Eastern Aegean Islands (1913), [[Western Thrace]] (1920), and the [[Dodecanese]] (1947).

==Fall of Constantinople==
{{Main|Fall of Constantinople}}
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
[[File:Zonaro GatesofConst.jpg|thumb|180px|Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]]'s entry into Constantinople.]]
Though the [[Byzantine Empire]] was [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] in origin and was called the "Roman Empire" by its inhabitants in antiquity, it became [[Byzantium under the Heraclians|Hellenistic with time to the point where Greek replaced Latin as the official language]] in AD 610, owing to its location (in the Greek-speaking realm and sphere of influence) and the fact that, following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], it became the eastern continuation of the Roman Empire. Byzantium held out against the invasions of the centuries with a vitality that the Western Roman Empire lost, repelling the Visigoths, the Huns, the Saracens, the Mongols and finally the Turks (during the first siege). Constantinople, the capital of Byzantium, fell to the [[Fourth Crusade]]rs in the early years of the 13th century. The city was eventually liberated by the [[Empire of Nicaea]], a Byzantine successor, and the Empire was restored. However, the city fell to a different foe in 1453—the Muslim Turk—and this fall of Constantinople marked the nadir of Byzantine civilization; the city was comprehensively sacked and looted; the [[Hagia Sophia]] was turned into a mosque. Following the conquest of Constantinople, the capture of the remainder of the Byzantine territories was easily accomplished by the Ottomans.

== Greeks under Ottoman rule==
{{Further|Ottoman Greece}}
In the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet]] system in force during the [[Ottoman empire]], the population was classified according to religion rather than language or ethnicity. Orthodox Greeks were seen as part of the ''millet-i Rûm'' (literally "Roman community") which included all [[Orthodox Christians]], including besides Greeks also [[Bulgarians]], [[Serbs]], [[Vlachs]], [[Macedonian Slavs]], [[Georgians]], [[Arabs]], [[Romanians]] and [[Albanians]], despite their differences in ethnicity and language and despite the fact that the religious hierarchy was Greek dominated. It is not clear to what extent one can speak of a Greek identity during those times as opposed to a Christian or Orthodox identity.<ref>{{cite book |title=Greece: The Modern Sequel |last1=Koliopoulos |first1=John S. |last2=Veremis |first2=Thanos |year=2007 |publisher=C Hurst & Co Publishers Ltd |location= |isbn= }}</ref> In the late 1780s, [[Catherine II of Russia]] and [[Joseph II of Austria]] intended to reclaim the Byzantine heritage and restore the Greek statehood as part of their joint [[Greek Plan]].

|source=Kolettis voicing his convictions in the National Assembly in January 1844.<ref>Smith M., ''Ionian Vision'', (1999), p. 2</ref>}}

After the [[Greek War of Independence]] ended in 1829, a new Southern Greek state was established, with assistance from the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Imperial Russia]]. However, the new Greek state under [[John Capodistria]] after the [[Greek War of Independence]] was, with Serbia, one of the only two countries of the era with ethnic population which was smaller than the population of those outside its borders; most of ethnic Greeks still resided within the borders of Ottoman Empire.  This version of  Greece was designed by the [[Great Powers]], who had no desire to see a larger Greek state supplant the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The Great Idea embodied a desire to bring all ethnic Greeks into the Greek state, and subsequently revive the [[Byzantine Empire]]; specifically those Greeks in [[Epirus]], [[Thessaly]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Thrace]], the [[Aegean Islands]], [[Crete]], [[Cyprus]], parts of [[Anatolia]], and the city of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], which would replace [[Athens]] as capital.

When the [[George I of Greece|young Danish prince Vilhelm Georg]] was elected king in 1863, the title offered to him by the Greek National Assembly was ''not'' "King of Greece", the title of his deposed predecessor, King [[Otto of Greece|Otto]]; but rather "King of ''the [[Hellene]]s''". Implicit in the wording was that George I was to be king of all Greeks, regardless of whether they then lived within the borders of his new kingdom.

The first areas to be incorporated into the Kingdom were the [[Ionian islands]] in 1864, and later [[Thessaly]] with the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]].

==Revolts, Cretan crisis and Greco-Turkish War (1897)==
{{See also|Epirus Revolt of 1854|Cretan Revolt (1866–69)|Epirus Revolt of 1878|Macedonian Struggle|Greco-Turkish War of 1897}}

In January 1897, violence and disorder were escalating in [[Crete]], polarizing the population. Massacres of the Christian population took place in Chania and Rethimno. The Greek government, pressured by public opinion, intransigent political elements, extreme nationalist groups (e.g. [[Ethniki Etairia]]) and with the Great Powers reluctant to intervene, decided to send warships and personnel to assist the Cretans. The Great Powers had no option then but to proceed with the occupation of the island, but they were too late. A Greek force of 1,500 men had landed at Kolymbari on 1 February 1897, and its commanding officer, Colonel [[Timoleon Vassos]] declared that he was taking over the island "in the name of the King of the Hellenes" and that he was announcing the union of Crete with Greece. This led to an uprising that spread immediately throughout the island. The Great Powers finally decided to land their troops and stopped the Greek army force from approaching Chania. At the same time their fleets blockaded Crete, preventing both Greeks and Turks from bringing any more troops to the island.

The Ottoman Empire, in reaction to the rebellion of Crete and the assistance sent by Greece, relocated a significant part of its army in the Balkans to the north of Thessaly, close to the borders with Greece. Greece in reply reinforced its borders in Thessaly. However, irregular Greek forces and followers of the Megali Idea acted without orders and raided Turkish outposts, leading the Ottoman Empire to declare war on Greece; the war is known as the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1897]]. The Turkish army, far outnumbering the Greek, was also better prepared, due to the recent reforms carried out by a German mission under [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz|Baron von der Goltz]]. The Greek army fell back in retreat. The other Great Powers then intervened and an armistice was signed in May 1897. The war, however, only ended in December of that year.

The military defeat of Greece in the Greco-Turkish war cost it small territorial losses along the border line in northern Thessaly, and a large sum of financial reparations that wrecked Greece's economy for years, while giving no lasting solution to the Cretan Question. The Great Powers (Britain, France, Russia, and Italy) in order to prevent future clashes and trying to avoid the creation of a revanchist climate in Greece, imposed what they thought of as the final solution on the Cretan Question: Crete was proclaimed an autonomous ''[[Cretan State]]''. The four Great Powers assumed the administration of Crete; and, in a decisive diplomatic victory for Greece, Prince George of Greece (second son of King George I) became High Commissioner.

==Partial realization and subsequent defeat==

[[File:Greece in the Treaty of Sèvres.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Megali Hellas after the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] and featuring a picture of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]].]]

===Balkan Wars===
{{Main|Greece in the Balkan Wars}}
A major proponent of the Megali Idea was [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], under whose leadership Greek territory doubled in the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912-13 &mdash; southern [[Epirus]], [[Crete]], [[Lesbos]], [[Chios]], [[Samos]] along with the totality of Aegean Islands and the majority of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] were attached to Greece. Born and raised in Crete, in 1909 Venizelos was already a prominent Cretan and had influence in mainland Greece. As such, he was chosen after the [[Goudi coup]] in 1909 to become Prime Minister of Greece. A proponent of the ''Megali Idea'', Venizelos pressed forward a series of reforms in society, as well as the military and administration, which helped Greece succeed in its goals during the Balkan Wars.

===World War I===
{{Main|Greece during World War I|Treaty of Sèvres}}
Victory in [[World War I]] seemed to promise an even greater realization of the Megali Idea. Greece gained in Asia Minor the administration of [[Smyrna]] and its hinterland for five years (after with a referendum it could be incorporated), the islands of [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]], [[Western Thrace|Western]] and [[Eastern Thrace]], the border then drawn a few miles from the walls of [[Constantinople]]: the Imperial City seemed within reach.

===Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)===
{{Main|Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)}}

A major defeat followed in 1922, however, when the [[Turkish revolutionaries]] defeated and expelled the Greeks from Anatolia during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]]. The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] saw Greece lose Eastern Thrace, Imbros and Tenedos, [[Smyrna]] and the possibility of staying in [[Anatolia]]. To avoid any further territorial claims, both Greece and Turkey engaged in an "[[exchange of populations]]": During the conflict, 151,892 Greeks had already fled Asia Minor. The Treaty of Lausanne moved 1,104,216 Greeks from Turkey,<ref>André Billy, ''La Grèce'', Arthaud, 1937, p. 188.</ref> while 380,000 Turks left the Greek territory for Turkey. Also, in Greece had also moved (after WWI) 40,027 Greeks from Bulgaria, 58,522 from Russia (because of the defeat of Wrangel) and 10,080 from other lands (for example [[Dodecanese]] or [[Albania]]), while 60,000 Bulgarians from [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] had moved to [[Bulgaria]].

The immediate reception of refugees to Greece cost 45 million francs, so the League of Nations arranged for a loan of 150 million francs to aid settlement of refugees. In 1930, Venizelos even went on an official visit to [[Turkey]], where he proposed that [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] be awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

== World War II, annexation of Dodecanese and the Cyprus dispute ==
{{See also|Military history of Greece during World War II|EOKA|1974 Cypriot coup d'état}}

Although the Great Idea ceased to be a driving force behind Greek foreign policy, some remnants continued to influence Greek foreign policy throughout the remainder of the 20th century.

Thus, after his coup d'état of 4 August 1936, [[Ioannis Metaxas]] proclaimed the advent of the "Third Hellenic Civilization" after the civilization of the ancient Greek and Byzantine Civilization.<ref>R. Clogg, op. Cit, p. 118.</ref> The attack by Italy from Albania and the Greek victories enabled Greece to conquer, during the winter of 1940-1941, parts of southern [[Albania]] ([[Northern Epirus]], as it is identified by [[Greeks]]) which were administered as a province of Greece for a short time until the German offensive of April 1941.

The occupation, resistance and the [[Greek civil war|civil war]] initially put the Great Idea in the background. Nevertheless, another very good diplomatic performance by the Greek side at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1946]] secured a further enlargement of Greek territory, in the form of the Dodecanese Islands, despite the very strong opposition of [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and the Soviet delegates.<ref>K. Svolopoulos, Greek Foreign Policy 1945-1981. Cit, p. 134.</ref> The Soviet opposition was also the main reason for the non incorporation of the [[Northern Epirus]], since Albania was, after WW2, communist controlled.

The British colony of [[Cyprus]] became the "apple of discord" in Greco-Turkish relations. In 1955, a [[Hellenic Army|Greek army]] colonel of Greek Cypriot origin, [[George Grivas]], began a campaign of civil disobedience whose purpose was primarily to drive the British from the island, then move for ''[[Enosis]]'' with Greece. The Greek Prime Minister, [[Alexandros Papagos]], was not unfavourable to this idea{{fact|date=June 2014}}. The British played the Turkish Cypriots against Greek Cypriots, resulting in the polarisation of opinion between the dominant Greek population and the minority Turks{{fact|date=June 2014}}.

The problems in Cyprus had an impact on the continent itself. In September 1955, in response to the demand for ''Énosis'', an anti-Greek riot took place in Istanbul. During the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] 4,000 stores, 100 hotels and restaurants and 70 churches were destroyed or damaged.<ref>R. Clogg, op. Cit, p. 153.</ref> This led to the last great wave of migration from Turkey to Greece.

[[File:Cyprus districts named.png|thumb|The partition of Cyprus showing the [[Northern Cyprus|Turkish-occupied north]] and government controlled south.]]

The [[Zürich and London Agreement|Zürich Agreement]] of 1959 culminated in independence of the island within the [[British Commonwealth]] . The inter-ethnic clashes from 1960 led to the dispatch of a [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|peacekeeping force]] of the [[United Nations Organisation|United Nations]] in 1964.

The Cyprus issue was revived by the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|dictatorship of the colonels]], who presented their April 21, 1967, ''coup d'état'' as the only way to defend the traditional values of what they called the "Hellenic-Christian Civilization".

Against the backdrop of the oil crisis in the Aegean, Brigadier General Ioannidis arranged, in July 1974, to overthrow Cypriot President [[Archbishop]] [[Makarios III|Makarios]], and proceed to ''[[Enosis]]'' with Greece{{fact|date=June 2014}}. This led to an immediate reaction from Turkey. Turkey invaded the north part of the island. The two countries moved to a general mobilization and there was a well-founded fear of an imminent war with Turkey.

In a stabilized Europe, the Great Idea has disappeared, while there is no longer any significant population of Greeks in Turkey. The Greek-Turkish disputes about the borders are now based mainly on the economy, such as oil and fishing rights.  With the most notable disputes taking place at [[Imia/Kardak]] and on the [[Cyprus dispute]].

Relations between Greece and Turkey improved after the Greek aid sent after the [[1999 ?zmit earthquake]] and the Turkish aid sent after the [[1999 Athens earthquake]].

[[File:Texting.jpg|thumb|A user typing a text message on an [[LG enV (VX9900)]]]]
'''Text messaging''', or '''texting''', is the act of composing and sending brief, electronic messages between two or more mobile phones, or fixed or portable devices over a phone network. The term originally referred to messages sent using the [[Short Message Service]] (SMS). It has grown to include messages containing image, video, and sound content (known as [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] messages). The sender of a text message is known as a '''texter''', while the service itself has different [[colloquialism]]s depending on the region. It may simply be referred to as a '''text''' in North America, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines, an '''SMS''' in most of mainland Europe, and a '''MMS''' or '''SMS''' in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.

Text messages can be used to interact with automated systems to, for example, order products or services, or participate in contests. Advertisers and service providers use [[Direct Text Marketing|direct text marketing]] to message mobile phone users about promotions, payment due dates, etcetera instead of using mail, e-mail or [[voicemail]].

In a straight and concise definition for the purposes of this English Language article, ''text messaging'' by phones or mobile phones should include all 26 letters of the alphabet and 10 numerals, i.e., alpha-numeric messages, or text, to be sent by texter or received by the textee.

== History ==
1933 – RCA Communications, New York introduced the first "[[telex]]" service.<ref>{{cite web|last=A. OQUINDO|first=FEDERICO|title=HISTORY OF THE PHILIPPINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY|url=http://www.angelfire.com/pq/telecommunications/}}</ref>  The first messages over RCA transatlantic circuits were sent between New York and London. Seven million words or 300,000 radiograms transmitted the first year. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}} 
Alphanumeric messages have long been sent by radio using via [[Radiotelegraphy]].<ref>{{cite web|title=INTRODUCTION TO RADIO-FREQUENCY COMMUNICATIONS|url=http://www.navymars.org/national/training/nmo_courses/nmoc/module17/14189_ch1.pdf}}</ref>  Digital information began being sent using radio as early as 1971 by the University of Hawaii using [[ALOHAnet]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The concept of the SMS (Short Messaging Service) was created by Friedhelm Hillebrand, while he was working for [[Deutsche Telekom]]. Sitting at a typewriter at home, Hillebrand typed out random sentences and counted every letter, number, punctuation, and space. Almost every time, the messages amounted to 160 characters, thus being the basis for the limit one could type via text.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/237240/the-text-message-turns-20-a-brief-history-of-sms|title=The Text Message Turns 20: A Brief History of SMS|work=theweek.com}}</ref> With Bernard Ghillebaert of [[France Télécom]], he developed a proposal for the [[GSM]] group meeting in February 1985 in Oslo.<ref>GSM document 19/85, available in the [[ETSI]] archive</ref> The first technical solution was developed in a GSM subgroup under the leadership of Finn Trosby.

Modern SMS text messaging is understood to be messaging from one mobile phone to another mobile phone. Radiolinja became the first network to offer commercial person-to-person SMS text messaging service in 1994. When Radiolinja's domestic competitor, Telecom Finland (now part of TeliaSonera) also launched SMS text messaging in 1995 and the two networks offered cross-network SMS functionality, Finland became the first nation where SMS text messaging was offered as a competitive as well as commercial basis.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The first text messaging service in the United States was provided by American Personal Communications (APC), the first GSM carrier in America.  Sprint Telecommunications Venture, a partnership of Sprint Corp. and three large cable TV companies, owned 49 percent of APC. The Sprint venture was the largest single buyer at a government-run spectrum auction that raised $7.7 billion in 2005 for PCS licenses.  APC operated under the brand name of Sprint Spectrum and launched service on November 15, 1995 in Washington D.C. and Baltimore Maryland.  The initial call to launch the network was made from Vice President Al Gore in Washington, D.C. to Mayor Kurt Schmoke in Baltimore.<ref>http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-11-16/business/1995320051_1_cellular-sprint-pcs-network</ref> Soon to follow was Omnipoint Communications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/53461/omnipoints-george-schmitt-burns-midnight-oil-build-pcs-firm|title=George Schmitt Burns Midnight Oil to Build PCS Firm|work=connection.ebscohost.com}}</ref>&nbsp;Omnipoint's George Schmitt, a former Airtouch executive<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcrwireless.com/article/19971229/sub/rcrs-1997-person-of-the-year-george-schmitt-omnipoints-george-schmitt-burns-the-midnight-oil-to-build-pcs-firm/|date=29 December 1997|title=RCR'S 1997 Person of the Year, Omnipoint's George Schmitt, Burns the Midnight Oil to Build PCS Firm|work=rcrwireless.com}}</ref>&nbsp;who launched commercial GSM in Germany, recruited [[Roger Cameron Wood|Roger Wood]]<ref>[[Roger Cameron Wood]]</ref> from competitor iDEN / Nextel led a team that introduced texting as a commercial service in New York City in November 1996.[9]&nbsp;In preparation for the company's launch party in New York's Central Park, Wood and co-worker Mark Caron<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bmobilized-announces-new-ceo-mark-caron-215669981.html|title=Bmobilized Announces New CEO: Mark Caron|work=prnewswire.com}}</ref>&nbsp;sent the first SMS Text message of "George are you there?" to Schmitt during a Sunday morning RF drive test on October 20, 1996.

Initial growth of text messaging was slow, with customers in 1995 sending on average only 0.4 message per GSM customer per month.<ref name="gsmworld">{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmworld.com/news/press_2001/press_releases_4.shtml|title=GSM World press release|work=gsmworld.com|date=12 February 2001|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020215194430/http://www.gsmworld.com/news/press_2001/press_releases_4.shtml|archivedate=15 February 2002}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref> One factor in the slow take-up of SMS was that operators were slow to set up charging systems, especially for prepaid subscribers, and eliminate billing fraud, which was possible by changing [[Short message service center|SMSC]] settings on individual handsets to use the SMSCs of other operators. Over time, this issue was eliminated by switch-billing instead of billing at the SMSC and by new features within SMSCs to allow blocking of foreign mobile users sending messages through it.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

SMS is available on a wide range of networks, including [[3G]] networks. However, not all text messaging systems use SMS, and some notable alternate implementations of the concept include [[SoftBank Mobile|J-Phone]]'s [[SkyMail]] and [[NTT Docomo]]'s [[Short Mail]], both in Japan. E-mail messaging from phones, as popularized by NTT Docomo's [[i-mode]] and the RIM [[BlackBerry]], also typically use standard mail protocols such as [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] over [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]].<ref>{{cite web|title=TCP/IP Internetworking With `gawk'|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawkinet/gawkinet.html|publisher=Gnu.org}}</ref>

Today, text messaging is the most widely used mobile data service, with 74% of all mobile phone users worldwide, or 2.4 billion out of 3.3 billion phone subscribers, at end of 2007 being active users of the Short Message Service. In countries such as Finland, Sweden and Norway, over 85% of the population use SMS. The European average is about 80%, and North America is rapidly catching up with over 60% active users of SMS by end of 2008. The largest average usage of the service by mobile phone subscribers is in the Philippines, with an average of 27 texts sent per day by subscriber.

[[File:Smstextmessage eng.gif|thumb|right|An English text messaging interface on a mobile phone]]
Text messaging is most often used between private mobile phone users, as a substitute for voice calls in situations where voice communication is impossible or undesirable.

Some text messages such as SMS can also be used for the remote controlling of appliances. It is widely used in [[domotics]] systems. Some amateurs have also built own systems to control (some of) their appliances via SMS.<ref>{{cite web|author=ELEKTOR.nl |url=http://www.elektor.nl/artikelen-als-pdf/2011/juni/lange-afstandsbediening-met-uw-mobieltje.1811625.lynkx |title=Using SMS to control devices; amateur-built system based on ATM18 |publisher=Elektor.nl |date=12 May 2011 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=ELEKTOR.com |url=http://www.elektor.com/magazines/2011/june/geolocation-with-the-atm18.1810917.lynkx |title=An ATM18 system for sms'ing your car to give away his position |publisher=Elektor.com |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> Other methods such as group messaging, which was patented in 2012 by the GM of Andrew Ferry, Devin Peterson, Justin Cowart, Ian Ainsworth, Patrick Messinger, Jacob Delk, Jack Grande, Austin Hughes, Brendan Blake, and Brooks Brasher are used to involve more than two people into a text messaging conversation{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}.

Short message services are developing very rapidly throughout the world.

SMS is particularly popular in Europe, Asia (excluding Japan; see below), United States, Australia and New Zealand and is also gaining influence in Africa. Popularity has grown to a sufficient extent that the term ''texting'' (used as a [[verb]] meaning the act of mobile phone users sending short messages back and forth) has entered the common lexicon. Young Asians consider SMS as the most popular mobile phone application.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synovate.com/changeagent/index.php/site/full_story/living_the_fast_living_young_in_asia/|title=Living the fast, young life in Asia|work=synovate.com}}</ref> Fifty percent of American teens send fifty text messages or more per day, making it their most frequent form of communication.<ref>{{cite news|last=NGAK|first=CHENDA|title=Teens are sending 60 texts a day, study says|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-57400228-501465/teens-are-sending-60-texts-a-day-study-says/|publisher=CBS NEWS|accessdate=March 19, 2012}}</ref>

In China, SMS is very popular and has brought service providers significant profit (18 billion short messages were sent in 2001).<ref name="2001 message rate">{{cite web|url=http://www.tymcc.com.cn/news/linenews/export.asp?id=1313|title=News report on text rates for 2001|work=tymcc.com.cn}}</ref> It is a very influential and powerful tool in the Philippines, where the average user sends 10–12 text messages a day.

SMS is hugely popular in India, where youngsters often exchange lots of text messages, and companies provide alerts, infotainment, news, cricket scores updates, railway/airline booking, mobile billing, and banking services on SMS.

Texting became popular in the Philippines in 1998. In 2001, text messaging played an important role in deposing former Philippine president [[Joseph Estrada]]. Similarly, in 2008, text messaging played a primary role in the implication of former Detroit Mayor [[Kwame Kilpatrick]] in an SMS sex scandal.<ref name="huliq1">{{cite web|author=HULIQ |url=http://www.huliq.com/48240/detroit-mayor-kwame-kilpatrick-christine-beatty-sex-sms-scandal |title=Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, Christine Beatty in Sex SMS Scandal |publisher=Huliq.com |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref>

Short messages are particularly popular among young urbanites. In many markets, the service is comparatively cheap. For example, in Australia, a message typically costs between [[Australian dollar|A$]]0.20 and $0.25 to send (some prepaid services charge $0.01 between their own phones), compared with a voice call, which costs somewhere between $0.40 and $2.00 per minute (commonly charged in half-minute blocks). The service is enormously profitable to the service providers. At a typical length of only 190&nbsp;bytes (including protocol overhead), more than 350 of these messages per minute can be transmitted at the same data rate as a usual voice call (9&nbsp;kbit/s). There are also free SMS services available, which are often sponsored and allow sending SMS from a PC connected to the internet.

Mobile service providers in New Zealand, such as [[Vodafone]] and [[Telecom NZ]], provide up to 2000 SMS messages for NZ$10 per month. Users on these plans send on average 1500 SMS messages every month.

Text messaging has become so popular that advertising agencies and advertisers are now jumping into the text messaging business. Services that provide bulk text message sending are also becoming a popular way for clubs, associations, and advertisers to reach a group of opt-in subscribers quickly.

Research suggests that IP-based mobile messaging will have grown to equal the popularity of SMS in 2013, with nearly 10 trillion messages being sent through each technology.<ref name=Tyntec>{{cite web|url=https://www.tyntec.com/fileadmin/tyntec.com/whitepapers/Whitepaper-GigaOM_tyntec_-_Converged_Mobile_Messaging_-_Jan_15_2013.pdf|title=Converged-mobile-messaging analysis and forecasts|work=tyntec.com|format=PDF|first=Peter|last=Crocker|date=15 January 2013|accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=mobilenewscwp>[http://www.mobilenewscwp.co.uk/2013/01/23/tyntec-predicts-surge-in-ip-based-messaging-this-year/ "Mobile and SMS interaction service conducts study that says that IP-based mobile messaging will be just as popular as traditional SMS"] mobile news, 23 January 2013.Retrieved: 23 January 2013</ref>

== Applications ==

=== Microblogging ===
{{main|Microblogging}}
Of many texting trends, a system known as microblogging has surfaced, which consists of a minituarised blog, inspired mainly by people's tendency to jot down babble and post it. They consist of sites like [[Twitter]] and Chinese equivalent [[Microblogging in China|Weibo]] (??) which are very popular.

=== Emergency services ===
In some countries, text messages can be used to contact emergency services. In the UK, text messages can be used to call emergency services only after registering with the emergency SMS service. This service is primarily aimed at people who, by reason of disability, are unable to make a voice call. It has recently been promoted as a means for walkers and climbers to call<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcofs.org.uk/news.asp?s=2&id=MCS-N10616&nc= |title=Mountaineering Council of Scotland news 24/11/10 |publisher=Mcofs.org.uk |date=24 November 2010 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.go4awalk.com/the-bunkhouse/walking-news-and-discussions/walking-news-and-discussions.php?news=710209 |title=goforawalk.com news December 2010 |publisher=Go4awalk.com |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> emergency services from areas where a voice call is not possible due to low signal strength.

=== Reminders of hospital appointments ===

SMS messages are used in some countries as reminders of hospital appointments. Missed outpatient clinic appointments cost the [[National Health Service (England)]] more than £600 million ($980 million) a year<ref>Lakhani, Nina. (24 September 2011) [http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/text-reminders-could-save-nhs-millions-2360098.html Text reminders could save NHS millions – Health News – Health & Families]. The Independent. Retrieved on 2012-04-05.</ref> SMS messages are thought to be more cost effective, swifter to deliver, and more likely to receive a faster response than letters. A recent study by Sims and colleagues (2012) examined the outcomes of 24,709 outpatient appointments scheduled in mental health services in South-East London. The study found that SMS message reminders could reduce the number of missed psychiatric appointments by 25–28%, representing a potential national yearly saving of over £150 million.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sims, H., Sanghara, H., Hayes, D., Wandiembe, S., Finch, M., Jakobsen, H., Tsakanikos, E., Okocha, C.I., Kravariti, E. |year=2012|title= Text message reminders of appointments: a pilot intervention at four community mental health clinics in london|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.201100211|journal=Psychiatric Services|volume=63|issue=2|pages=161–8|pmid=22302334}}</ref>

=== Commercial uses ===
[[File:MMS.jpg|right|thumb|A multimedia message displayed on a mobile phone]]

==== Short codes ====
[[Short codes]] are special telephone numbers, shorter than full telephone numbers, that can be used to address SMS and MMS messages from mobile phones or fixed phones. There are two types of short codes: dialing and messaging.

==== Text messaging gateway providers ====
[[SMS gateway]] providers facilitate the SMS traffic between businesses and mobile subscribers, being mainly responsible for carrying mission-critical messages, SMS for enterprises, content delivery and entertainment services involving SMS, e.g., TV voting. Considering SMS messaging performance and cost, as well as the level of text messaging services, [[SMS gateway]] providers can be classified as resellers of the text messaging capability of another provider's [[Short Message Service Center|SMSC]] or offering the text messaging capability as an operator of their own [[Short Message Service Center|SMSC]] with [[Signaling System 7|SS7]].<ref>HSL Mobile Messaging [http://www.hslsms.com/technical/infrastructure/ "Infrastructure – HSL's SMS Message Delivery Network"], ''www.hslsms.com'', accessed 14 June 2011.</ref><ref>BudgetSMS SMS Gateway [http://www.budgetsms.net/en/http-api/ "BudgetSMS's HTTP Docs"], ''www.budgetsms.net'', accessed 14 June 2011.</ref>

SMS messaging gateway providers can provide gateway-to-mobile (Mobile Terminated–MT) services. Some suppliers can also supply mobile-to-gateway (text-in or Mobile Originated/MO services). Many operate text-in services on shortcodes or mobile number ranges, whereas others use lower-cost geographic text-in numbers.<ref name="autogenerated1">Andrew Orlowski [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/18/aql_textable_landlines/ Cheapo textable landline numbers for all]. The Register (2008-04-18)</ref>

==== Premium content ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
SMS is widely used for delivering digital content, such as news alerts, financial information, logos and ringtones. Such messages are also known as premium-rated short messages (PSMS).<ref>{{cite web|title=Short Message Service (SMS)|url=http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/encyclopedia/index/short-message-service-sms.html}}</ref>  The subscribers are charged extra for receiving this premium content, and the amount is typically divided between the [[mobile network operator]] and the [[Value-added service|value added service provider]] (VASP), either through revenue share or a fixed transport fee. Services like [[Texperts|82ASK]] and [[63336|Any Question Answered]] have used the PSMS model to enable rapid response to mobile consumers' questions, using on-call teams of experts and researchers.

Premium short messages are increasingly being used for "real-world" services. For example, some vending machines now allow payment by sending a premium-rated short message, so that the cost of the item bought is added to the user's phone bill or subtracted from the user's prepaid credits. Recently, premium messaging companies have come under fire from consumer groups due to a large number of consumers racking up huge phone bills.

A new type of free-premium or hybrid-premium content has emerged with the launch of text-service websites. These sites allow registered users to receive free text messages when items they are interested in go on sale, or when new items are introduced.

An alternative to inbound SMS is based on [[long number]]s (international mobile number format, e.g., +44 7624 805000, or geographic numbers that can handle voice and SMS, e.g., 01133203040<ref name="autogenerated1"/>), which can be used in place of short codes or premium-rated short messages for SMS reception in several applications, such as TV voting, product promotions, and campaigns. Long numbers are internationally available, as well as enabling businesses to have their own number, rather than short codes, which are usually shared across a lot of brands. Additionally, Long numbers are non-premium inbound numbers.

=== In business ===
The use of text messaging for business purposes has grown significantly during the mid-2000s. As companies seek competitive advantages, many employees turn to new technology, collaborative applications, and real-time messaging such as SMS, [[instant messaging]], and mobile communications. Some practical uses of text messaging include the fuse of SMS for confirming delivery or other tasks, for instant communication between a service provider and a client (e.g., stock broker and investor), and for sending alerts. Several universities have implemented a system of texting students and faculties campus alerts. One such example is [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://live.psu.edu/story/29845 |title=Penn State Live – PSUTXT test a success |publisher=Live.psu.edu |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref>

As text messaging has proliferated in business, so too have regulations governing its use. One regulation specifically governing the use of text messaging in financial-services firms engaged in stocks, equities, and securities trading is ''Regulatory Notice 07-59, Supervision of Electronic Communications, December 2007'', issued to member firms by the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]]. In 07-59, FINRA noted that "electronic communications", "e-mail", and "electronic correspondence" may be used interchangeably and can include such forms of electronic messaging as instant messaging and text messaging.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finra.org/RulesRegulation/NoticestoMembers/2007NoticestoMembers/P037554 |title=FINRA, Regulatory Notice 07-59, Supervision of Electronic Communications, December 2007 |publisher=Finra.org |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> Industry has had to develop new technology to allow companies to archive their employees' text messages.

Security, confidentiality, reliability and speed of SMS are among the most important guarantees industries such as financial services, energy and commodities trading, health care and enterprises demand in their mission-critical procedures. One way to guarantee such a quality of text messaging lies in introducing SLAs ([[Service Level Agreement]]), which are common in IT contracts. By providing measurable SLAs, corporations can define reliability parameters and set up a high quality of their services.<ref>[http://www.smstextnews.com/2008/04/tyntec_calls_for_industry_benchmarked_sms_service_level_agreements.html "TynTec calls for industry benchmarked SMS service level agreements"] Mobile Industry Review (29 April 2008)</ref> Just one of many SMS applications that has proven highly popular and successful in the financial-services industry is mobile receipts. In January 2009, [[Mobile Marketing Association]] (MMA) published the ''Mobile Banking Overview'' for financial institutions in which it discussed the advantages and disadvantages of mobile channel platforms such as Short Message Services (SMS), Mobile Web, Mobile Client Applications, SMS with Mobile Web and Secure SMS.<ref>[http://www.mmaglobal.com/mbankingoverview.pdf Mobile Banking Overview (NA)]. mmaglobal.com January 2009</ref>

Mobile interaction services are an alternative way of using SMS in business communications with greater certainty.

Typical business-to-business applications are [[telematics]] and [[Machine-to-Machine]], in which two applications automatically communicate with each other. Incident alerts are also common, and staff communications are also another use for B2B scenarios.

Businesses can use SMS for time-critical alerts, updates and reminders, mobile campaigns, content and entertainment applications.

Mobile interaction can also be used for consumer-to-business interactions, such as media voting and competitions, and for consumer-to-consumer interaction, for example, with mobile social networking, chatting and dating.

=== Online SMS Services ===
There is a growing number of websites that allow users to send free SMS messages online. The services are generally provided free of charge.

Some websites provide free SMS on the backing of promoting their premium packages for businesses.{{cn|date=September 2014}}

=== Worldwide use ===

==== Europe ====
[[File:SMS roaming welcome messages - Redvers.jpg|thumb|SMS is used to send "welcome" messages to mobile phones [[roaming]] between countries. Here, [[T-Mobile]] welcomes a [[Proximus]] subscriber to the UK, and [[BASE (mobile)|BASE]] welcomes an [[Orange United Kingdom|Orange]] UK customer to Belgium.]]
Europe follows next behind Asia in terms of the popularity of the use of SMS. In 2003, an average of 16 billion messages were sent each month. Users in Spain sent a little more than fifty messages per month on average in 2003. In Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom, the figure was around 35–40 SMS messages per month. In each of these countries, the cost of sending an SMS message varies from €0.04–0.23, depending on the payment plan (with many contractual plans including all or a number of texts for free). In the United Kingdom, text messages are charged between £0.05–0.12. Curiously, France has not taken to SMS in the same way, sending just under 20 messages on average per user per month. France has the same [[GSM]] technology as other European countries, so the uptake is not hampered by technical restrictions.

In the Republic of Ireland, a total of 1.5 billion messages are sent every quarter, on average 114 messages per person per month.<ref name="RTE report">{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0926/comreg-business.html |title=RTE article on Ireland SMS usage |publisher=Rte.ie |date=26 September 2006 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> In the United Kingdom over 1 billion text messages are sent every week.<ref name="Mobile Data Association UK">{{cite web|author=Mobile Data Association |url=http://www.text.it/mediacentre/press_release_list.cfm?thePublicationID=0F3FA21C-15C5-F4C0-99335F38D7517452 |title=The UK's definitive text related information source |publisher=Text.it |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref>

The [[Eurovision Song Contest]] organized the first pan-European SMS voting in 2002, as a part of the voting system (there was also a voting over traditional phone lines). In 2005, the Eurovision Song Contest organized the biggest televoting ever (with SMS and phone voting).

During [[roaming]], that is, when a user connects to another network in different country from his own, the prices may be higher, but in July 2009, EU legislation went into effect limiting this price to €0.11.<ref>{{cite web| title= The new proposal for reducing roaming prices | url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/roaming/regulation/index_en.htm | accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref>

===== Finland =====
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
In addition to SMS voting, a different phenomenon has risen in more mobile-phone-saturated countries. In Finland, some TV channels began "SMS chat", which involved sending short messages to a phone number, and the messages would be shown on TV a while later. Chats are always moderated, which prevents sending harmful material to the channel. The craze soon became popular and evolved into games, at first slow-paced quiz and strategy games. After a while, faster-paced games were designed for television and SMS control. Games tend to involve registering one's nickname and, after that, sending short messages for controlling a character on screen. Messages usually cost 0.05 to 0.86 Euro apiece, and games can require the player to send dozens of messages. In December 2003, a Finnish TV channel, [[MTV3]], put a [[Santa Claus]] character on air reading aloud messages sent in by viewers. On 12 March 2004, the first entirely "interactive" TV channel, VIISI, began operation in Finland. That did not last long, as SBS Finland Oy took over the channel and turned it into a music channel named The Voice in November 2004.Also in 2004, Finnair became the first airline in the world to enable passengers to check-in in advance for flights with text messages.<ref>“Making More of SMS, much more” High Tech Finland. 2009 http://www.hightech.fi/direct.aspx?area=htf&prm1=794&prm2=article</ref>

In 2006, the [[Prime Minister of Finland]], [[Matti Vanhanen]], made front-page news when he allegedly broke up with his girlfriend with a text message.

In 2007, the first book written solely in text messages, ''[[Viimeiset viestit]]'' (''Last Messages''), was released by Finnish author [[Hannu Luntiala]]. It is about a business executive who travels throughout Europe and India.

Mobile-service providers in Finland offer contracts in which one can send 1000 text messages a month for the price of €10.

==== United States ====
In the United States, text messaging is very popular; as reported by CTIA in December 2009, the 286 million US subscribers sent 152.7 billion text messages per month, for an average of 534 messages per subscriber per month.<ref>[http://www.ctia.org/consumer_info/service/index.cfm/AID/10323 Wireless Quick Facts<!-- Bot generated title -->] from [[CTIA – The Wireless Association]]</ref> The Pew Research Center found in May 2010 that 72% of U.S. adult cellphone users send and receive text messages.<ref>Kristen Purcell, Roger Entner and Nichole Henderson [http://pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2010/PIP_Nielsen%20Apps%20Report.pdf The Rise of Apps Culture 35% of U.S. adults have cell phones with apps, but only 24% of adults actually use them]. Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project. pewinternet.org 15 September 2010</ref>

In the U.S., SMS is often charged both at the sender and at the destination, but, unlike phone calls, it cannot be rejected or dismissed. The reasons for lower uptake than other countries are varied—many users have unlimited "mobile-to-mobile" minutes, high monthly minute allotments, or unlimited service. Moreover, [[push to talk]] services offer the instant connectivity of SMS and are typically unlimited. Furthermore, the integration between competing providers and technologies necessary for cross-network text messaging has only been available recently. Some providers originally charged extra to enable use of text, further reducing its usefulness and appeal. In the third quarter of 2006, at least 12 billion text messages crossed AT&T's network, up almost 15 percent from the preceding quarter.

In the United States, while texting is widely popular among the ages of 13–22 years old, it is increasing among adults and business users as well. The age that a child receives his/her first cell phone has also decreased, making text messaging a very popular way of communication for all ages. The number of texts being sent in the United States has gone up over the years as the price has gone down to an average of $0.10 per text sent and received.

In order to convince more customers to include text messaging plans, some major cellphone providers have recently increased the price to send and receive text messages from $.15 to $.20 per message.<ref>[http://www.nextel.com/en/services/messaging/text_messaging.shtml Sprint Nextel Text Messaging<!-- Bot generated title -->] from the company's website</ref><ref>[http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/globalText?contentType=Legal%20Notice&textId=122 Legal Notice – Notice of Text Messaging Increase<!-- Bot generated title -->] from [[Verizon Wireless]]</ref> This is over $1,300 per [[megabyte]].<ref>[http://government.zdnet.com/?p=3991 "Sen. to carriers: Why do text messages cost $1,300 per meg?"], [[ZDNet]], 10 September 2008</ref> Many providers offer unlimited plans, which can result in a lower rate per text given sufficient volume.

==== Japan ====
Japan was among the first countries to adopt short messages widely, with pioneering non-GSM services including [[SoftBank Mobile|J-Phone]]'s [[SkyMail]] and [[NTT Docomo]]'s [[Short Mail]]. Japanese adolescents first began text messaging, because it was a cheaper form of communication than the other available forms. Thus, Japanese theorists created the selective interpersonal relationship theory, claiming that mobile phones can change social networks among young people (classified as 13- to 30-year-olds). They theorized this age group had extensive but low-quality relationships with friends, and mobile-phone usage may facilitate improvement in the quality of their relationships. They concluded this age group prefers "selective interpersonal relationships in which they maintain particular, partial, but rich relations, depending on the situation."<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0265407505056492 |author=Igarashi, T., Takai, J., & Yoshida, T. |year=2005|title=Gender differences in social network development via mobile phone text messages: A longitudinal study|journal=[[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]]|volume=22|issue=5|page=691}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00023.x|author=Ishii, Kenichi|title=Implications of Mobility: The Uses of Personal Communication Media in Everyday Life|year=2006|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|volume=56|issue=2|page=346}}</ref> The same studies showed participants rated friendships in which they communicated face-to-face and through text messaging as being more intimate than those in which they communicated solely face-to-face. This indicates participants make new relationships with face-to-face communication at an early stage, but use text messaging to increase their contact later on. It is also interesting to note that as the relationships between participants grew more intimate, the frequency of text messaging also increased.

However, short messaging has been largely rendered obsolete by the prevalence of mobile Internet e-mail, which can be sent to and received from any e-mail address, mobile or otherwise. That said, while usually presented to the user simply as a uniform "mail" service (and most users are unaware of the distinction), the operators may still internally transmit the content as short messages, especially if the destination is on the same network.

==== China ====
Text messaging is popular and cheap in China. About 700 billion messages were sent in 2007.
Text message spam is also a problem in China. In 2007, 353.8 billion spam messages were sent, up 93% from the previous year. It is about 12.44 messages per week per person.

It is routine that the People's Republic of China government monitor text messages across the country for illegal content.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/world/20text.html | work=The New York Times | first=Sharon | last=Lafraniere | title=China to Scan Text Messages to Spot ‘Unhealthy Content' | date=20 January 2010}}</ref>

Among Chinese migrant workers with little formal education, it is common to refer to SMS manuals when text messaging. These manuals are published as cheap, handy, smaller-than-pocket-size booklets that offer diverse linguistic phrases to utilize as messages.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lin, Angel and Avin Tong|title=Mobile Cultures of Migrant Workers in Southern China: Informal Literacies in the Negotiation of (New) Social Relations of the New Working Women|journal=Knowledge, Technology, and Policy |doi=10.1007/s12130-008-9045-9|year=2008|volume=21|issue=2|page=73}}</ref>

==== Philippines ====
In 1995, Short Message Service was introduced as a promotional gimmick but soon became very popular.  In 1998, Philippine mobile-service providers launched SMS as part of their services, with initial television marketing campaigns targeting hearing-impaired users. The service was initially free with subscriptions, but Filipinos quickly exploited the feature to communicate for free instead of using voice calls, which they would be charged for. After Telcos caught on to this, they soon started charging for SMS. The current rate across networks is 1 peso per SMS (about US$0.023).  Though users were now charged for SMS, it remained very cheap, about one-tenth of the price of a voice call.  This low price led to about five million Filipinos owning a cell phone by 2001.<ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2002"/>

Because of the highly social nature of Philippine culture and the affordability of SMS compared to voice calls, SMS usage shot up, and texting quickly became a popular tool for Filipinos to keep in touch with their friends and loved ones. Filipinos used texting not only for social but also for political purposes, as it allowed the Filipinos to express their opinions on current events and political issues.<ref>[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/07/biztech/articles/05talk.html Manila's Talk of the Town Is Text Messaging]. Partners.nytimes.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-05.</ref> As a result, it became a powerful tool for Filipinos in promoting or denouncing certain issues and was a key factor during the 2001 [[EDSA II]] revolution, which overthrew then-President [[Joseph Estrada]], who was eventually found guilty of corruption.

According to 2009 stats, there are about 72 million mobile-service subscriptions (roughly 80% of the Filipino population), with around 1.39 billion SMS messages being sent in the Philippines daily.<ref>[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100823005660/en/Research-Markets-Philippines---Telecoms-Mobile-Broadband Research and Markets: Philippines – Telecoms, Mobile and Broadband].

Retrieved on 2012-04-05.</ref> Because of the large amount of text messages being sent by Filipinos, the Philippines became known as the "text capital of the world" during the late 1990s until the early 2000s.

==== New Zealand ====
There are three mobile network companies in New Zealand. <br />
[[Spark New Zealand | Spark NZ]], (formally Telecom NZ), was the first telecommunication company in New Zealand. In 2011, Spark was broken into two companies, with Chorus Ltd taking the landline infrastructure and Spark NZ providing services including over their mobile network.<br />
[[Vodafone NZ]] acquired mobile network provider Bellsouth New Zealand in 1998 and has 2.32 million customers as at July 2013<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/vodafone-boosts-mobile-customers-ending-long-run-losses-wb-143170/|title=Vodafone boosts mobile customers}}</ref><ref>[http://www.vodafone.co.nz/about/company-information Company information] from the [[Vodafone New Zealand]] website</ref> Vodafone launched the first Text messaging service in 1999<ref>[http://www.vodafone.co.nz/about/#history Vodafone history timeline]</ref> and has introduced innovative TXT services like Safe TXT and CallMe<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vodafone.co.nz/mobile-services/callme/|title=A free TXT service to say Call Me}}</ref><br />
[[2degrees]] Mobile Ltd launched in August 2009. <br />

==== Africa ====
Text messaging will become a key revenue driver for mobile network operators in Africa over the next couple of years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepinehillsnews.com/wp/2009/03/17/text-messaging-will-be-key-revenue-driver-for-mobile-operators-in-africa/ |title=Text Messaging will be Huge for Mobile Operators in Africa |publisher=thepinehillsnews.com |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> Today, text messaging is already slowly gaining influence in the African market. One such person used text messaging to spread the word about HIV and AIDS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brianshall.com/content/silence-death-south-africa-text-messages-can-end-silence |title=Silence = Death. In South Africa, text messages can end the silence |publisher=brian s hall |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> Also, in September 2009, a multi-country campaign in Africa used text messaging to expose stock-outs of essential medicines at public health facilities and put pressure on governments to address the issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plusnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=86192 |title=Global &#124; AFRICA: Text messages highlight drug stock-outs &#124; AFRICA &#124; Care/Treatment – PlusNews &#124; Health & Nutrition &#124; HIV/AIDS |publisher=PlusNews |date=17 September 2009 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> It's encouraging to see text messaging as a means to spread the word about health issues in Africa, the use of which is somewhat different from other continents.

== Social impact ==
The advent of text messaging made possible new forms of interaction that were not possible before. A person may now carry out a conversation with another user without the constraint of being expected to reply within a short amount of time and without needing to set time aside to engage in conversation. Mobile phone users can maintain communication during situations in which a voice call is impractical, impossible, or unacceptable. Texting has provided a venue for [[participatory culture]], allowing viewers to vote in online and TV polls, as well as receive information on the move.<ref>Levinson, Paul. 2004.</ref> Texting can also bring people together and create a sense of community through "Smart Mobs" or "Net War", which create "people power".<ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2002"/>

=== Effect on language ===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2008}}
{{Main|SMS language}}
[[File:SillyModernSociety.jpg|thumb|This sticker seen in Paris satirizes the popularity of communication in SMS shorthand. In French: "Is that you? / It's me! / Do you love me? / Shut up!"]]
The small [[telephone keypad|phone keypad]] has caused a number of adaptations of spelling: as in the phrase "txt msg", "lol", "brb", "HMU", or use of [[CamelCase]], such as in "ThisIsVeryLame". To avoid the even more limited message lengths allowed when using [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] or [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letters, speakers of languages written in those alphabets often use the [[Latin alphabet]] for their own [[language]].
In certain languages utilizing [[diacritic]] marks, such as Polish, SMS technology created an entire new variant of written language: characters normally written with diacritic marks (e.g., ''[[?]]'', ''[[?]]'', ''[[?]]'', ''[[?]]'' in Polish) are now being written without them (as ''a'', ''e'', ''s'', ''z'') to enable using cell phones without Polish [[Writing system|script]] or to save space in [[Unicode]] messages.

Historically, this language developed out of shorthand used in [[bulletin board system]]s and later in Internet [[chat room]]s, where users would abbreviate some words to allow a response to be typed more quickly, though the amount of time saved was often inconsequential. However, this became much more pronounced in SMS, where mobile phone users do not generally have access to a [[QWERTY]] keyboard as computer users did, more effort is required to type each character, and there is a limit on the number of characters that may be sent.

In [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], numbers that sound similar to words are used in place of those words. For example, the numbers 520 in Chinese (''w? èr líng'') sound like the words for "I love you" (''w? ài n?''). The sequence 748 (''q? sì b?'') sounds like the curse "go to hell" (''qù s? ba'').

[[Predictive text]] software, which attempts to guess words ([[Tegic]]'s [[T9 (predictive text)|T9]] as well as [[iTap]]) or [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] (Eatoni's [[LetterWise]]), reduces the labour of time-consuming input. This makes abbreviations not only less necessary, but slower to type than regular words that are in the software's [[dictionary]]; however, it does make the messages longer, often requiring the text message to be sent in multiple parts and, therefore, costing more to send.

An article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' explores how text messaging has [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] some of the world's languages. The use of [[diacritic]] marks is dropped in languages such as French, as well as symbols in [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopian languages]]. In his book, ''[[Txtng: the Gr8 Db8]]'', [[David Crystal]] says that texters in all eleven languages use "lol", "u", "brb", and "gr8", all English-based shorthands. The use of pictograms and logograms in texts are present in every language. They shorten words by using symbols to represent the word or symbols whose name sounds like a syllable of the word such as in 2day or b4. This is commonly used in other languages as well. Crystal gives some examples in several languages such as Italian ''sei'', "six", is used for ''sei'', "you are". Example: dv 6 = dove sei ("where are you") and French ''sept'' "seven" = ''cassette'' ("casette"). There is also the use of numeral sequences, substituting for several syllables of a word and creating whole phrases using numerals. For example, in French, a12c4 can be said as ''à un de ces quatres'', "see you around" (literally: "to one of these four ''[days]''"). An example of using symbols in texting and borrowing from English is the use of ''@''. Whenever it is used in texting, its intended use is with the English pronunciation. Crystal gives the example of the Welsh use of ''@'' in ''@F'', pronounced ataf, meaning "to me". In character-based languages such as Chinese and Japanese, numbers are assigned syllables based on the shortened form of the pronunciation of the number, sometimes the English pronunciation of the number. In this way, numbers alone can be used to communicate whole passages, such as in Chinese, "8807701314520" can be literally translated as "Hug hug you, kiss kiss you, whole life, whole life I love you." English influences worldwide texting in variation but still in combination with the individual properties of languages.<ref>Crystal, David [http://books.google.com/books?id=pKBnEGwmtZoC&pg=PA131 Txtng: the gr8 db8]. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. pp. 131–137 ISBN 0-19-162340-7</ref>
American [[popular culture]] is also recognized in shorthand. For example, [[Homer Simpson]] translates into: ~(_8^(|).<ref>''The New Yorker'' "Thumbspeak" Menand, Louis. 20 October 2008.</ref> Crystal also suggests that texting has led to more creativity in the English language, giving people opportunities to create their own slang, emoticons, abbreviations, acronyms, etc. The feeling of individualism and freedom excites people, making texting increasingly more popular and a more efficient way to communicate.<ref>Crystal, David: the gr8 db8. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. Print.</ref> Crystal has also been quoted in saying that "In a logical world, text messaging should not have survived." But text messaging didn't just come out of nowhere. It originally began as a messaging system that would send out emergency information. But it gained immediate popularity with the public. What followed is the SMS we see today, which is a very quick and efficient way of sharing information from person to person.

Research by Rosen et al. (2009)<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0093650210362465 |author=Rosen, L.D., Chang, J., Erwin, L., Carrier, L.M., & Cheever, N.A.|title=The Relationship Between "Textisms" and Formal and Informal Writing Among Young Adults|year=2010|journal=Communication Research|volume=37|issue=3|pages=420 }}</ref> found that those young adults who used more language-based textisms (shortcuts such as LOL, 2nite, etc.) in daily writing produced worse formal writing than those young adults who used fewer linguistic textisms in daily writing. However, the exact opposite was true for informal writing. This suggests that perhaps the act of using textisms to shorten communication words leads young adults to produce more informal writing, which may then help them to be better "informal" writers.

[[Joan H. Lee]] in her thesis ''What does txting do 2 language: The influences of exposure to messaging and print media on acceptability constraints'' (2011)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gradworks.umi.com/MR/75/MR75222.html|title=What does txting do 2 language: The influences of exposure to messaging and print media on acceptability constraints|accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> associates exposure to text messaging with more rigid acceptability constraints. The thesis suggests that more exposure to the colloquial, [[Generation text|Generation Text]] language of text messaging contributes to being less accepting of words. In contrast, Lee found that students with more exposure to traditional print media (such as books) were more accepting of both real and fictitious words. The thesis, which garnered international media attention, also presents a [[literature review]] of [[Academic publishing|academic literature]] on the effects of text messaging on language.

=== Texting while driving ===
[[File:Cell phone use while driving.jpg|thumb|right|A driver with attention divided between a mobile phone and the road ahead]]
{{Main|Texting while driving}}
Texting while driving leads to increased distraction behind the wheel. In 2006, Liberty Mutual Insurance Group conducted a survey with more than 900 teens from over 26 high schools nationwide. The results showed that 87% of students found texting to be "very" or "extremely" distracting.<ref>{{cite web | title=Teens Admit Text Messaging Most Distracting While Driving | url=http://www.libertymutualgroup.com/omapps/ContentServer?c=cms_asset&pagename=LMGroup%2FViews%2FlmgView98&cid=1138356953222&kw=true | publisher=[[Liberty Mutual Group]] | date=19 July 2007 | accessdate=2010-02-05}}</ref> Then later on, a study by [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] discovered that 46% of teens admitted to being distracted behind the wheel due to texting. One example of distraction behind the wheel is the [[2008 Chatsworth train collision]], which killed 25 passengers. Upon closer investigation, it became known that the engineer of that train had sent 45 text messages while operating.

A 2009 experiment with ''[[Car and Driver]]'' editor Eddie Alterman that took place at a deserted air strip showed that texting while driving had a bigger negative impact on driver safety than being drunk. While being legally drunk added four feet to Alterman's stopping distance while going 70&nbsp;mph, reading an e-mail added 36 feet, and sending a text added 70 feet.<ref>[http://www.cnbc.com/id/31545004 Texting And Driving Worse Than Drinking and Driving], CNBC, 25 June 2009</ref>

In 2009, the [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]] Transportation Institute released the results of an 18-month study that involved placing cameras inside the cabs of more than 100 long-haul trucks, which recorded the drivers over a combined driving distance of three million miles. The study concluded that when the drivers were texting, their risk of crashing was 23 times greater than when not texting.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/technology/28texting.html In Study, Texting Lifts Crash Risk by Large Margin], ''The New York Times'', 27 July 2009</ref>

=== Texting while walking ===
Text messaging among pedestrians leads to increased cognitive distraction, reduced situation awareness and increases in unsafe behavior leading to injury and death.<ref name=Lamberg>Lamberg, E.M. & Muratori, L.M. (2012) "Cell phones change the way we walk"  Gait & Posture 35 (4):688–690</ref> Recent studies conducted on cell phone use while walking showed that cell phone users recall fewer objects when conversing,<ref name=Nasar>Nasar, J.

"Changes in gait properties during texting messages by a cell phone.

It is unclear which processes may be impacted by distraction, which types of distraction may impact which cognitive processes, and how individual differences may impact the influence of distraction.<ref name=Schwebel>Schwebel, D., Stavrinos, D., Byington, K., Davis, T., O'Neal, E., & de Jong, D. (2012). "Distraction and pedestrian safety: How talking on the phone, texting, and listening to music impact crossing the street." Accident Analysis and Prevention, 45, 266-71.</ref> Lamberg and Muratori believe that engaging in a dual-task, such as texting while walking, may interfere with working memory and result in walking errors.<ref name=Lamberg /> Their study demonstrated that participants engaged in text messaging were unable to maintain walking speed or retain accurate spatial information, suggesting an inability to adequately divide their attention between two tasks. According to them, the addition of texting while walking with vision occluded increases the demands placed on the working memory system resulting in gait disruptions.<ref name=Lamberg />

Texting on a phone distracts participants, even when the texting task used is a relatively simple one.<ref name=Lopresti /> Stavrinos et al. investigated the impact of other cognitive tasks, such as engaging in conversations or cognitive tasks on a phone, and found that participants actually have reduced visual awareness.<ref name=Stavrinos>Stavrinos, D.,  Byington, K. W., &  Schwebel, D. C. (2011). "Distracted walking: Cell phones increase injury risk for college pedestrians". Journal of Safety Research 42 (2):101-107</ref>  For example, they may fail to notice unusual events in their environment, such as a unicycling clown.<ref name=Hyman>Hyman,I.E. Boss,S.M., Wise, B.M., McKenzie, K.E., Caggiano, J.M. (2010). "Did you see the unicycling clown? Inattentional blindness while walking and talking on a cell phone" Applied Cognitive Psychology 29(5): 597-607</ref> These findings suggest that tasks that require the allocation of cognitive resources can have an impact on visual attention even when the task itself does not require the participants to avert their eyes away from their environment. The act of texting itself would impair their visual awareness. It appears that the distraction produced by texting in is a combination of both a cognitive and visual perceptual distraction.<ref name=Lopresti />

These findings raise new concerns about a pedestrian's ability to avoid obstacles, maintain path direction, and safely cross intersections while texting. Text messaging while walking is distracting to a degree that could impact pedestrians’ safety in the community and as such should be avoided.

=== Sexting ===
{{Main|Sexting}}
Sexting is slang for the act of sending sexually explicit or suggestive content between mobile devices using SMS.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Risks and Threats">[http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/encyclopedia/index/sexting.html Encyclopedia of Risks and Threats.] MySecureCyberspace. Retrieved on 2009-01-13.</ref> A genre of texting, it contains either text, images, or video that is intended to be sexually arousing.

A [[portmanteau]] of ''sex'' and ''texting'', sexting was reported as early as 2005 in ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]] Magazine'',<ref name=SunTele>{{cite news |title=The One and Only |author=Yvonne Roberts |date=31 July 2005 <!--|accessdate=2009-01-14  -->|page=22 |quote=Following a string of extramarital affairs and several lurid "sexting" episodes, Warne has found himself home alone, with Simone Warne taking their three children and flying the conjugal coop.}}</ref> constituting a trend in the creative use of SMS to excite another with alluring messages throughout the day.<ref>[http://grandiva.wordpress.com/2007/02/13/texting-from-faux-pas-to-faux-sex/ Texting: From Faux Pas to Faux Sex] From the Mind of GrandDiva. Retrieved on 2009-01-13.</ref>

Although sexting often takes place consensually between two people, it can also occur against the wishes of a person who is the subject of the content.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Risks and Threats"/> A number of instances have been reported in which the recipients of sexting have shared the content of the messages with others, with less intimate intentions, such as to impress their friends or embarrass their sender. Celebrities such as [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Vanessa Hudgens]], and [[Adrienne Bailon]] have been victims of such abuses of sexting.<ref>[http://www.xyhd.tv/2008/12/risque/sexting-with-friends-is-the-new-high-school-note/ Sexting with friends is the new High School "note"] XYHD.TV. Retrieved on 2009-01-13.</ref>

A 2008 survey by The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and CosmoGirl.com<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/sextech/ |title=Sex and Tech Survey |publisher=Thenationalcampaign.org |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> suggested a trend of sexting and other seductive online content being readily shared between teens. One in five teen girls surveyed (22 percent)—and 11 percent of teen girls aged 13–16 years old—say they have electronically sent, or posted online, nude or semi-nude images of themselves. One-third (33 percent) of teen boys and one-quarter (25 percent) of teen girls say they were shown private nude or semi-nude images. According to the survey, sexually suggestive messages (text, e-mail, and instant messaging) were even more common than images, with 39 percent of teens having sent or posted such messages, and half of teens (50 percent) having received them.

More recently, a 2012 study that has received wide international media attention was conducted at the [[University of Utah]] Department of Psychology by Donald S. Strassberg, Ryan Kelly McKinnon, Michael Sustaíta and Jordan Rullo. They surveyed 606 teenagers ages 14–18 and found that nearly 20 percent of the students said they had sent a sexually explicit image of themselves via cell phone, and nearly twice as many said that they had received a sexually explicit picture. Of those receiving such a picture, over 25 percent indicated that they had forwarded it to others.
In addition, of those who had sent a sexually explicit picture, over a third had done so despite believing that there could be serious legal and other consequences if they got caught. Students who had sent a picture by cell phone were more likely than others to find the activity acceptable. The authors conclude: "These results argue for educational efforts such as cell phone safety assemblies, awareness days, integration into class curriculum and teacher training, designed to raise awareness about the potential consequences of sexting among young people."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Strassberg|first=Donald|last2=McKinnon|first2=Ryan K.|title=Sexting by High School Students: An Exploratory and Descriptive Study|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=7 June 2012|doi=10.1007/s10508-012-9969-8|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/b8657mwj0268j307/?MUD=MP}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Maffly|first=Brian|title=‘Sexting’ prevalent among high-schoolers, study finds|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/54324965-78/explicit-messages-nearly-onlinetoday.html.csp|publisher=Salt Lake Tribune|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Lois|title=As many as 20% of teens have 'sexted', according to new study|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765583658/As-many-as-20-of-teens-have-sexted.html?pg=all|publisher=Deseret News|accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sending Sexually Explicit Photos by Cell Phone Is Common Among Teens|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120613132939.htm|publisher=Science Daily|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U Study Finds ‘Sexting’ More Common Among Teens Than You Might Think|url=http://unews.utah.edu/news_releases/u-study-finds-sending-sexually-explicit-photos-by-cell-phone-more-common-among-teen-than-you-might-think/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title='Sexting' Prevalent Among High-Schoolers, Study Finds|url=http://www.cdcnpin.org/scripts/display/NewsDisplay.asp?NewsNbr=59999|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Prevention Information Network|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Nauert|first=Rick|title=1 in 5 Teens ‘Sexting’ – Many Without a Clue|url=http://psychcentral.com/news/2012/06/14/1-in-5-teens-sexting-many-without-a-clue/40142.html|publisher=PsychCentral|accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U study: More teens ‘sext’ than previously thought|url=http://fox13now.com/2012/06/14/u-of-u-study-says-high-percentage-of-teens-sharing-sexting-pics/|publisher=Fox 13 News|accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Most teens unaware about legal consequences of sexting: Study|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/personal-tech/computing/Most-teens-unaware-about-legal-consequences-of-sexting-Study/articleshow/14128744.cms|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sexting is More Common Among Teens Than Previously Thought, Say Researchers|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/352901/20120616/sexting-more-common-teens-previously-thought-researchers.htm|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Why teens indulge in so much 'sexting'?|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/SexAndRelationships/Why-teens-indulge-in-so-much-sexting/Article1-872741.aspx|publisher=Hindustan Times|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref>

=== In schools ===
[[File:Textinginclass.jpg|thumb|Two girls text during class at school]]
Text messaging has had an impact on students academically, by creating an easier way to cheat on exams. In December 2002, a dozen students were caught cheating on an accounting exam through the use of text messages on their mobile phones.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsline.umd.edu/business/specialreports/teentechnology/textmessaging051706.htm |title=Maryland Newsline – Business & Tech Special Report: Teens and Technology |publisher=Newsline.umd.edu |date=17 May 2006 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> In December 2002, Hitotsubashi University in Japan failed 26 students for receiving e-mailed exam answers on their mobile phones.<ref>[http://www.eschoolnews.com/news/top-news/index.cfm?i=34945&CFID=3922618&CFTOKEN=23513501 Top News – Students dial up trouble in new twist to cheating<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref>

The number of students caught using mobile phones to cheat on exams has increased significantly in recent years. According to Okada (2005), most Japanese mobile phones can send and receive long text messages of between 250 and 3000 characters with graphics, video, audio, and Web links.<ref>Okada, T. (2005). ''Youth culture and shaping of Japanese mobile media: personalization and the keitainInternet as multimedia'', in M. Ito, D. Okabe and M. Matsuda (eds), ''Personal, Portable, Pedestrian: Mobile Phones in Japanese Life'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press ISBN 0-262-09039-2</ref> In England, 287 school and college students were excluded from exams in 2004 for using mobile phones during exams.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/4448167.stm |work=BBC News | title=Exams ban for mobile phone users | date=15 April 2005 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref> Some teachers and professors claim that advanced texting features can lead to students cheating on exams.<ref>Goggin, G (2006) ''Cell Phone Culture: Mobile technology in everyday life''.

==== Bullying ====
{{Main|Cyberbullying}}
Spreading rumors and gossip by text is also an issue of great concern. Text "bullying" of this sort can cause distress and damage reputations. Harding and Rosenberg (2005) argue that the urge to forward text messages seems difficult to resist, describing text messages as "loaded weapons".<ref>Harding, S. & Rosenberg, D. (Ed). (2005). [http://books.google.com/books?id=59U4XLH001YC&pg=PA84 ''Histories of the Future'']. London: Duke University Press, p. 84 ISBN 0-8223-3473-9</ref>

==== Influence on perceptions of the student ====
When a student sends an email that contains phonetic abbreviations and acronyms that are common in text messaging (e.g., "gr8" instead of "great"), it can influence how that student is subsequently evaluated. In a study by Lewandowski and Harrington (2006), participants read a student's email sent to a professor that either contained text-messaging abbreviations (gr8, How R U?) or parallel text in standard English (great, How are you?), and then provided impressions of the sender.<ref>{{Cite journal| title = The influence of phonetic abbreviations on evaluation of student performance | first1 = Gary | last1 = Lewandowski | first2 = Samantha | last2 = Harrington | journal = Current Research in Social Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = 15 | year = 2006| pages = 215–226 | url = http://www.uiowa.edu/~grpproc/crisp/crisp11_15.pdf }}</ref> Students who used abbreviations in their email were perceived as having a less favorable personality and as putting forth less effort on an essay they submitted along with the email. Specifically, abbreviation users were seen as less intelligent, responsible, motivated, studious, dependable, and hard-working. These findings suggest that the nature of a student's email communication can influence how others perceive the student and their work.

=== Law and crime ===
Not only has text messaging had an impact in schools, but also on police forces around the world. A British company developed, in June 2003, a program called Fortress SMS for Symbian phones. This program used 128 bit AES encryption to protect SMS messages.<ref>Fortress SMS technical report</ref> Police have also retrieved deleted messages to incriminate cult member Sara Svensson after confessing to murdering the wife of pastor Helge Fossmo and having shot his lover's husband Daniel Linde in Knutby, Sweden. They traced the messages, because she said she had acted anonymously on text forwards received in her phone.<ref>Robert Burnett; Ylva Hård af Segerstad (8 September 2005).

Police in [[Tilburg]], Netherlands, started an SMS alert program, in which they would send a message to ask citizens to be vigilant when a burglar was on the loose or a child was missing in their neighborhood. Several thieves have been caught and children found using the SMS Alerts.

=== Social unrest ===
Texting has been used on a number of occasions with the result of the gathering of large aggressive crowds. SMS messaging drew a crowd to [[Cronulla Beach]] in Sydney resulting in the [[2005 Cronulla riots]]. Not only were text messages circulating in the Sydney area, but in other states as well (''Daily Telegraph''). The volume of such text messages and e-mails also increased in the wake of the riot.<ref>[http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0603/02-goggin.php SMS Riot: Transmitting Race on a Sydney Beach], December 2005 M/C Journal, Volume 9, Iss. 1, March 2006</ref> The crowd of 5000 at stages became violent, attacking certain ethnic groups.

Texting was used to coordinate gatherings during the [[2009 Iranian election protests]].

Between 2009 and 2012 the U.S. secretly created and funded a [[Twitter]]-like service for Cubans called [[ZunZuneo]], initially based on mobile phone text message service and later with an internet interface. The service was funded by the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] through its [[Office of Transition Initiatives]], who utiliized contractors and front companies in the Cayman Islands, Spain and Ireland. A longer term objective was to organize "smart mobs" that might "renegotiate the balance of power between the state and society." A database about the subscribers was created, including gender, age, and "political tendencies". At its peak ZunZuneo had 40,000 Cuban users, but the service closed as financially unsustainable when U.S. funding was stopped.<ref name=wp-20140403>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/us-secretly-created-cuban-twitter-to-stir-unrest/2014/04/03/8a2dc77c-bafa-11e3-80de-2ff8801f27af_story.html |title=U'S' secretly created 'Cuban Twitter' to stir unrest |author=Alberto Arce, Desmond Butler, Jack Gillum |newspaper=Washington Post |agency=Associated Press |date=3 April 2014 |accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=forbes-20140404>{{cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/04/03/why-the-u-s-governments-fake-cuban-twitter-service-failed/ |title=Why The U'S' Government's Fake 'Cuban Twitter' Service Failed |author=Parmy Olson |newspaper=Forbes |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref>

=== Texting in politics ===
[[File:Threatening text - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|A text message that (he says) promises 500 [[Libyan dinar]]s ($400) to anyone who "makes noise" in support of [[Gaddafi]] in the coming days]]
[[File:Sms.jpg|thumb|A recruitment ban in French [[SMS language]]: «Slt koi29 on é jamé 2tro @ s batre pour la P. ;-)» = «''Salut! Quoi de neuf? On n'est jamais de trop à se battre pour la Paix!»]]

Text messaging has had a major impact on the political world. American campaigns find that text messaging is a much easier, cheaper way of getting to the voters than the door-to-door approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/04/02/news/net.php |title=In politics, blogs and text messages are the new American way |work=International Herald Tribune |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> Mexico's president-elect Felipe Calderón launched millions of text messages in the days immediately preceding his narrow win over Andres Manuel Lopez Obradór.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/46675?tid=relatedcl |title=Text Messaging in U.S. Politics |work=Newsweek |date=1 August 2006 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> In January 2001, Joseph Estrada was forced to resign from the post of president of the Philippines. The popular campaign against him was widely reported to have been co-ordinated with SMS chain letters.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> A massive texting campaign was credited with boosting youth turnout in Spain's 2004 parliamentary elections.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> In 2008, Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and his Chief of Staff at the time became entangled in a sex scandal stemming from the exchange of over 14,000 text messages that eventually led to his forced resignation, conviction of perjury, and other charges.<ref name="huliq1"/>

Text messaging has been used to turn down other political leaders. During the 2004 U.S. Democratic and Republican National Conventions, protesters used an SMS-based organizing tool called TXTmob to get to opponents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.txtmob.com/ |title=TxtMob |publisher=TxtMob |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> In the last day before the 2004 presidential elections in Romania, a message against [[Adrian N?stase]] was largely circulated, thus breaking the laws that prohibited campaigning that day.

Text messaging has helped politics by promoting campaigns.

Furthermore, on 20 January 2001, President [[Joseph Estrada]] of the Philippines became the first head of state in history to lose power to a [[smart mob]].<ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2002">Rheingold, Howard (2002) Smart Mobs: the Next Social Revolution, Perseus, Cambridge, Massachusetts, pp. xi–xxii, 157–82 ISBN 0-7382-0861-2.</ref> More than one million Manila residents assembled at the site of the 1986 [[People Power Revolution|People Power]] peaceful demonstrations that has toppled the Marcos regime. These people have organized themselves and coordinated their actions through text messaging. They were able to bring down a government without having to use any weapons or violence. Through text messaging, their plans and ideas were communicated to others and successfully implemented. Also, this move encouraged the military to withdraw their support from the regime, and as a result, the Estrada government fell.<ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2002"/> People were able to converge and unite with the use of their cell phones. "The rapid assembly of the anti-Estrada crowd was a hallmark of early [[smart mob]] technology, and the millions of text messages exchanged by the demonstrators in 2001 was, by all accounts, a key to the crowds [[esprit de corps]]."<ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2002"/>

=== Texting in Healthcare ===
[[File:Text messaging used to provide encouragement to quit smoking.png|thumb|right|Some health organizations manage text messaging services to help people avoid smoking]]
Text messaging is a rapidly growing trend in Healthcare. "One survey found that 73% of physicians text other physicians about work- similar to the overall percentage of the population that texts." There are many advantages and risks that go along with this trend. The biggest risk involved is that these physicians could be violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act or [[HIPAA]] for short. For example, messages could be saved to a phone indefinitely and therefore, patient information could be subject to theft or loss, and could be seen by other unauthorized persons. The HIPAA privacy rule requires that any text message involving a medical decision must be available for the patient to access. Therefore, any texts that are not documented in an EMR system could be a HIPAA violation.<ref>Ken Terry (2012-10-31). "Text Messaging Between Clinicians Increasing in Hospitals"(http://www.informationweek.com/mobile/text-messaging-between-clinicians-increasing-in-hospitals/d/d-id/1107145?). ''Information Week''.

''HIT Consultant''. Retrieved 2013-10-30.</ref>

=== Medical concerns ===
{{Main|BlackBerry thumb}}
The excessive use of the thumb for pressing keys on mobile devices has led to a high rate of a form of [[repetitive strain injury]] termed "BlackBerry thumb". (Although this refers to strain developed on older Blackberry devices, which had a scroll wheel on the side of the phone.)

An inflammation of the tendons in the thumb caused by constant text-messaging is also called text-messager's thumb, or texting [[tenosynovitis]].<ref name="test">[http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/2007/12/018452.htm New Zealand woman diagnosed with text thumb]. textually.org (23 December 2007). Retrieved on 2012-04-05.</ref>

Texting has also been linked as a secondary source in numerous traffic collisions, in which police investigations of mobile phone records have found that many drivers have lost control of their cars while attempting to send or retrieve a text message. Increasing cases of Internet [[Behavioral addiction|addiction]] are now also being linked to text messaging, as mobile phones are now more likely to have e-mail and Web capabilities to complement the ability to text.

=== Texting etiquette ===
Texting etiquette refers to what is considered appropriate texting behavior.  These expectations may concern different areas, such as the context in which a text was sent and received/read, who each participant was with when the participant sent or received/read a text message or what constitutes impolite text messages.<ref name="Shuter 2010 123">{{cite journal|last=Shuter|first=Robert|first2=Sumana|last2=Chattopadhyay|title=Emerging Interpersonal Norms of Text Messaging in India and the United States|journal=[[Journal of Intercultural Communication Research]]|year=2010|volume=29|issue=2|page=123}}</ref>

At the website of [[The Emily Post Institute]], the topic of ''texting'' has spurred several articles with the "do's and dont's" regarding the new form of communication. One example from the site is: "Keep your message brief. No one wants to have an entire conversation with you by texting when you could just call him or her instead."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emilypost.com/lifething/tips/text_messaging.htm |title=Text Messaging |publisher=Emilypost.com |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref>  Another example is: "Don't use all Caps. Typing a text message in all capital letters will appear as though you are shouting at the recipient, and should be avoided."

Expectations for etiquette may differ depending on various factors.  For example, expectations for appropriate behavior have been found to differ markedly between the U.S. and India.<ref name="Shuter 2010 123"/>   Another example is generational differences. In ''The M-Factor: How the Millennial Generation Is Rocking the Workplace'', Lynne Lancaster and David Stillman note that younger Americans often do not consider it rude to answer their cell or begin texting in the middle of a face-to-face conversation with someone else, while older people, less used to the behavior and the accompanying lack of eye contact or attention, find this to be disruptive and ill-mannered.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

With regard to texting in the workplace, [[Plantronics]] studied [http://www.plantronics.com/north_america/en_US/howwework/ how we communicate at work] and found that 58% of US knowledge workers have increased the use of text messaging for work in the past five years. The same study found that 33% of knowledge workers felt text messaging was critical or very important to success and productivity at work.<ref name=alison>By Alison Diana, InformationWeek.

== Challenges ==

=== Text message spam ===
{{Further|Mobile phone spam}}
In 2002, an increasing trend towards [[Mobile phone spam|spamming]] mobile phone users through SMS prompted cellular-service carriers to take steps against the practice, before it became a widespread problem. No major spamming incidents involving SMS had been reported {{As of|2007|alt=as of March 2007}}, but the existence of mobile phone spam<ref name="3750 FREEMSG Scam">{{cite web|url=http://www.kathirvel.com/mobile-text-scam-claim-3750-for-the-accident-you-had/ |title=Accident Claim Text Scam |publisher=Kathirvel.com |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> has been noted by industry watchdogs including ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' magazine and the Utility Consumers' Action Network ([http://www.ucan.org/ UCAN]). In 2005, UCAN brought a case against Sprint for spamming its customers and charging $0.10 per text message.<ref name="Sprint spam">[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/21/business/21cells.html?ei=5090&en=90fb11e106a62920&ex=1279598400&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=print NY Times article on UCAN case against Sprint]</ref> The case was settled in 2006 with Sprint agreeing not to send customers Sprint advertisements via SMS.<ref name="Sprint spam result">{{cite web|url=http://www.ucan.org/telecommunications/wireless/ucan_sprint_cell_phone_spam_decision_by_cpuc |title=UCAN report on Sprint SPAM SMS settlement |publisher=Ucan.org |date=5 October 2006 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref>

SMS expert Acision (formerly LogicaCMG Telecoms) reported a new type of SMS malice at the end of 2006, noting the first instances of SMiShing (a cousin to e-mail [[phishing]] scams). In SMiShing, users receive SMS messages posing to be from a company, enticing users to phone premium-rate numbers or reply with personal information. Similar concerns were reported by PhonepayPlus, a [[Consumer protection in the United Kingdom|consumer watchdog]] in the United Kingdom, in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/17489393 |title=Warning over 'scam' that charges users to receive texts |publisher=bbc.co.uk|date=28 March 2012 |accessdate=29 September 2014}}</ref>

=== Pricing concerns ===
Concerns have been voiced<ref name="crunchgear.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/07/01/atts-text-messages-cost-1310-per-megabyte/ |title=AT&T's text messages cost $1,310 per megabyte |publisher=Crunchgear.com |date=1 July 2008 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> over the excessive cost of off-plan text messaging in the United States. [[AT&T Mobility]], along with most other service providers, charges texters 20 cents per message if they do not have a messaging plan or if they have exceeded their allotted number of texts. Given that an SMS message is at most 160 [[bytes]] in size, this cost scales to a cost of $1,310<ref name="crunchgear.com"/> per megabyte sent via text message. This is in sharp contrast with the price of unlimited data plans offered by the same carriers, which allow the transmission of hundreds of megabytes of data for monthly prices of about $15 to $45 in addition to a voice plan.  As a comparison, a one-minute phone call uses up the same amount of network capacity as 600 text messages,<ref>Ashley Jones {{Wayback |date=20100328180032 |url=http://universe.byu.edu/node/1163 |title=Texting prices rise as carriers make profits - News & Opinion - The Daily Universe }}. universe.byu.edu (2009-07-28)</ref> meaning that if the same cost-per-traffic formula were applied to phone calls, cell phone calls would cost $120 per minute.  With service providers gaining more customers and expanding their capacity, their overhead costs should be decreasing, not increasing.

In 2005, text messaging generated nearly 70 billion dollars in revenue, as reported by Gartner,industry analysts, three times as much as Hollywood box office sales in 2005.  World figures showed that over a trillion text messages were sent in 2005.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crystal|first=David|title=txting; the gr8 db8|year=2008|publisher=Oxford|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-954490-5|pages=4–5}}</ref>

Although major cellphone providers deny any collusion, fees for out-of-package text messages have increased, doubling from 10 to 20 cents in the United States between 2007 and 2008 alone.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2348890,00.asp | work=PC Magazine | first=Chloe | last=Albanesius | title=AT&T, Verizon Deny Text-Message Price Fixing | date=16 June 2009}}</ref> On 16 July 2009, Senate hearings were held to look into any breach of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Reardon |first=Marguerite |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-10265859-94.html |title=AT&T and Verizon deny price-fixing accusations |publisher=CNET News |date=16 June 2009 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> The same trend is visible in other countries, though increasingly widespread flatrate plans, for example in Germany, do make text messaging easier, text messages sent abroad still result in higher costs.

=== Increasing competition ===
While text messaging is still a growing market, traditional SMS are becoming increasingly challenged by alternative messaging services which are available on smartphones with data connections. These services are much cheaper and offer more functionality like exchanging of multimedia content (e.g. photos, videos or audio notes) and group messaging. Especially in western countries some of these services attract more and more users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phonearena.com/news/The-death-of-SMS-has-been-greatly-exaggerated_id19493|title=The death of SMS has been greatly exaggerated|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

=== Security concerns ===
Consumer SMS should not be used for confidential communication. The contents of common SMS messages are known to the network operator's systems and personnel. Therefore, consumer SMS is not an appropriate technology for secure communications.<ref name="Gartner Research Analytical Source">{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=111720 |title=Don't Use SMS for Confidential Communication |publisher=Gartner Group |date=26 November 2002 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref>

To address this issue, many companies use an [[SMS gateway]] provider based on [[Signaling System 7|SS7]] connectivity to route the messages. The advantage of this international termination model is the ability to route data directly through [[Signaling System 7|SS7]], which gives the provider visibility of the complete path of the SMS. This means SMS messages can be sent directly to and from recipients without having to go through the [[Short Message Service Centre|SMS-C]] of other mobile operators. This approach reduces the number of mobile operators that handle the message; however, it should not be considered as an end-to-end secure communication, as the content of the message is exposed to the [[SMS gateway]] provider.

Failure rates without backward notification can be high between carriers (T-Mobile to Verizon is notorious in the US){{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}.  International texting can be extremely unreliable depending on the country of origin, destination and respective carriers.

=== Records and competition ===
<!-- We should only list records accepted by the Guinness Book of World Records or other large neutral body. Otherwise, it will become a haven for spamming random text message records -->
The ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' has a world record for text messaging, currently held by Sonja Kristiansen of Norway. Kristiansen keyed in the official text message, as established by Guinness, in 37.28 seconds.<ref name="tv2nyhetene.no">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv2nyhetene.no/innenriks/sonja-satte-smsverdensrekord-3008895.html |title=Sonja satte sms-verdensrekord &#124; TV 2 Nyhetene |publisher=Tv2nyhetene.no |date=14 November 2009 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> The message is, "The razor-toothed piranhas of the general Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world.

''The Book of Alternative Records'' lists Chris Young of [[Salem, Oregon]], as the world-record holder for the fastest 160-character text message where the contents of the message are not provided ahead of time.

Elliot Nicholls of Dunedin, New Zealand, currently holds the world record for the fastest blindfolded text messaging. A record of a 160-letter text in 45 seconds while blindfolded was set on 17 November 2007, beating the old record of 1-minute 26 seconds set by an Italian in September 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/1452374/425827.xhtml|title=World's fastest texter in Dunedin |publisher= TECHNOLOGY News|work=Tvnz.co.nz|date=17 November 2007|accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref>

Ohio native Andrew Acklin is credited with the world record for most text messages sent or received in a single month, with 200,052.  His accomplishments were first in the World Records Academy and later followed up by ''Ripley's Believe It Or Not 2010: Seeing Is Believing''. He has been acknowledged by The Universal Records Database for the most text messages in a single month; however, this has since been broken twice and now is listed as 566607 messages by Mr. Fred Lindgren.<ref>[http://urdb.org/wr/text-messages-sent-or-received-single-month "Most Text Messages Sent or Received in a Single Month"], ''The Universal Records Database'', 14 September 2010.

The ''[[amir]]'' [[Abdor Rahman Khan]] dies at [[Kabul]]. During his reign of twenty years he effectually got rid of all possible rivals or persons likely to give trouble; he transformed his army from a mere rabble into a well-armed and efficient force; religious fanaticism was brought under control; a regular system of judicial and general administration was created; and the industries of the country were greatly developed by the establishment of factories under [[Europe]]an supervision at Kabul. As regards his foreign policy, he could hardly be expected to have any real love for [[England]]. His ideal would have been a really independent [[Muslim]] kingdom, free from the control or influence alike of England and of [[Russia]], and he was much disappointed at the failure of his efforts to be allowed direct representation at the [[Court of St. James's]]. Although there was occasional friction between the ''amir'' and the government of [[India]], he valued the English alliance and was faithful to it.

His eldest son, [[Habibullah Khan]], succeeds to the throne with an absence of disturbance or even excitement that is almost unexpected. Habibullah has been carefully trained by his father in all branches of the administration. Since 1897 he has had control of the State [[Treasury]] and Exchequer, and has been the [[Supreme Court]] of Appeal from all courts, ecclesiastical and secular. He acted as [[regent]] for his father during his prolonged absence in [[Turkestan]], and distinguished himself by the intelligence and sobriety of his administration. He is said to be popular with the people and with the army; he knows English fairly well and is believed to entertain very friendly sentiments towards the British government. After his accession he raises the pay of the army, and he is said to be going to adopt a much more liberal trade policy than his father and to reduce the poll tax on Hindus. His reception of Muslim gentlemen sent by the government of India in November to condole with him on the death of his father and to congratulate him on his own accession is cordial in the extreme. He also issues a proclamation inviting the return of exiles from India, and many of them are expected to go back.

The immediate prospects of the new ''amir'' are decidedly favourable. The possible competitors for the throne are few in number, and none of them are at present dangerous. Habibullah Khan's position has been much strengthened by the marriages his father made for him with the families of the leading chiefs. [[Nasrullah Khan (Afghanistan)|Nasrullah Khan]], the late ''amir''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s next son, is his full brother, and is destitute of ability, ambition, or influence. His half-brother, [[Mohammad Omar (prince)|Mohammad Omar]], whose mother is of high rank and of much ability and ambition, might give trouble, but he is only a boy of twelve, and his mother's great supporter, the commander-in-chief, [[Gholam Haidar Khan]], has lately died. The nearest collateral heir is [[Ishak Khan]], the son of ''amir'' [[Azim Khan]], and consequently the [[first cousin once removed]] of the new ''amir''. Much was heard of him in his early days; he was notorious for his debauchery and cruelty, and he was hated in Kabul, where he was regarded as a maniac. The late ''amir'' endeavoured to conciliate him, but he rebelled against him, and after showing conspicuous cowardice and incompetency fled to Russian territory. He is now a man of fifty; he is not likely to attempt, or to be allowed to attempt, any movement, and should he do so, he would hardly be dangerous. The two sons of the ''amir'' [[Shir Ali Khan]], [[Yakub Khan]], who was allowed to succeed his father, but was deposed for not preventing [[Louis Cavagnari]]'s murder, and [[Ayub Khan (Afghan commander)|Ayub Khan]], who defeated the British at [[Battle of Maiwand|Maiwand]], are still political prisoners in India, and are not likely to be let loose.England.

'''Aemilia Scaura''' (ca 100 BC – 82 BC) was the daughter of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] Roman [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]] and his second wife [[Caecilia Metella Dalmatica]].

By the time of her birth, Scaurus was around 70 and, as ''[[princeps senatus]]'', the speaker of the [[Roman senate|Senate]], was one of the most important politicians of [[Rome]]. After her father's death, Aemilia was raised by her mother's second husband [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], who took care of her education and fortune.

Sulla also used his stepdaughter for political alliances. In 82 BC, Aemilia was married and pregnant by a man who dared to criticize the dictator's conduct. Sulla was most displeased and forced the divorce. Immediately afterwards, Aemilia was married to Gnaeus [[Pompey Magnus]], while still pregnant by her first husband. This marriage boosted Pompey's political career because Aemilia was an aristocratic patrician, while he was from a recent senatorial family. Aemilia died in childbirth shortly afterwards.

'''[[Via Aemilia Scaura]]''' is a [[Roman road]] built by [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]].

'''Legio vigesima secunda ''Deiotariana''''' ('''Twenty-second ''Deiotaran'' Legion''') was a [[Roman legion]], levied approximately in 48 BC and disbanded during the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] of 132&ndash;135. Its [[cognomen]] comes from [[Deiotarus]], a Celtic king, and its emblem is unknown, but could be a Galatian symbol.

== Legion history ==

=== Origin of the legion ===

The legion was levied by Deiotarus, king of the [[Celt]]ic tribe of the ''Tolistobogii'', who lived in [[Galatia]], modern [[Turkey]]. Deiotarus became an ally of the [[Roman Republic]]'s general [[Pompey]] in 63 BC, who named him king of all the Celtic tribes of [[Asia minor]], which were collectively known as ''Galatians'' (hence the name Galatia for the region). Deiotarus levied an army and trained it with Roman help; the army, in 48 BC, was composed of 12,000 infantrymen and 2,000 horsemen. Cicero writes that the army was divided into to thirty cohortes, which were roughly equivalent to three Roman legions of the time. This army supported the Romans in their wars against king [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]], and contributed to Roman victory in the [[Third Mithridatic War]].

After a heavy defeat against king [[Pharnaces II of Pontus]] near [[Nicopolis]], the survivor soldiers of Deiotarius army formed a single legion, which marched besides [[Julius Caesar]] during his victorious campaign against [[Pontus]], and fought with him in the [[battle of Zela]] (47 BC).

=== Early history (BC) ===

When the [[Roman Empire]] integrated the Galatian kingdom, this legion, which had been trained by the Romans and had fought under Roman commanders, became part of the Roman army; since [[Caesar Augustus]] had already [[Legio XXI Rapax|21 legions]], the legion received the number XXII.

Augustus sent the Twenty-second to camp in [[Nicopolis]] (next [[Alexandria]], in [[Aegyptus (province)|Aegyptus]]) together with [[Legio III Cyrenaica|III ''Cyrenaica'']]. These two legions had the role of garrisoning the Egyptian province from threats both within and without, given the multi-ethnical nature of Alexandria.

In 26 BC, [[Aelius Gallus]], ''praefectus Aegypti'' (prefectus of Egypt), led a campaign against the [[Nubia|Nubian kingdoms]] and another to find ''Arabia Felix'' ([[Yemen]]). The campaign came quickly to a halt (25 BC) because of the heavy losses in the troops (Romans, Hebrews and Nabateans), due to hunger and epidemics.<br>
The losses were not recovered, so in 23 BC the Nubians, led by queen [[Candace]] [[Amanirenas]], took the initiative and attacked the Romans moving towards [[Elephantine]]. The new prefectus of Egypt, [[Gaius Petronius Pontius Nigrinus|Petronius]], obtained reinforcements, and after blocking the Nubians, marched up the [[Nile]] to the Nubian capital of [[Napata]], which was sacked in 22 BC.<br>
It is highly probable that XXII fought in these wars.<br>
After this actions, the Nubian front remained calm for a long time, so the legions could be employed otherwise. The legionaries were used not only as soldiers, but also as workers, as some of them were sent to the granite mines of ''Mons Claudianus''. Other legionaries were sent in the deepest south of the Egyptian province, and scratched their names on the stones of the ''[[Colossi of Memnon]]''.

=== Later history ===

Under [[Nero]], the Romans fought a [[Roman–Parthian War of 58–63|campaign]] (55&ndash;63) against the [[Parthian Empire]], which had invaded the kingdom of [[Armenia]], allied to the Romans. After gaining (60) and losing (62) Armenia, the Romans sent [[Legio XV Apollinaris|XV ''Apollinaris'']] from [[Pannonia]] to [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo|Cn. Domitius Corbulo]], ''legatus'' of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]]. Corbulo, with the legions XV ''Apollinaris'', [[Legio III Gallica|III ''Gallica'']], [[Legio V Macedonica|V ''Macedonica'']], [[Legio X Fretensis|X ''Fretensis'']] and XXII, forced [[Vologases I of Parthia]] to a compromise peace (63), whereby his brother [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates]] would become king of Armenia as a Roman client.

In 66, [[Zealot]] [[Jew]]s killed the Roman garrison in [[Jerusalem]]. After the ignominious defeat of the legatus of Syria (66), [[Vespasian|T. Flavius Vespasianus]] entered in [[Iudaea (Roman province)|Iudaea]] in 67 with the legions V ''Macedonica'', X ''Fretensis'', XV ''Apollinaris'', one [[vexillatio]] of 1,000 legionaries of the XXII, and 15,000 soldiers from the Eastern allies, and started the [[siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem]] (69), which would be completed by his son [[Titus|T. Flavius Vespasianus]] (better known as Titus) in 70. In fact in 69, the "[[year of the four emperors]]", Flavius Vespasianus senior returned to Italy to conquer the imperial throne after [[Galba]]'s rebellion and Nero's death. The Twenty-second sided with Flavius Vespasianus, who eventually became [[Roman Emperor|emperor]].

Under [[Trajan]], XXII is officially known as ''Deiotariana'', even if this was its unofficial name since Claudian times.

The last record of XXII ''Deiotariana'' is from 119. In 145, when a list of all existing legions was made, XXII ''Deiotariana'' was not listed.  It is possible XXII ''Deiotariana'' suffered serious losses during the Jewish rebellion of [[Simon bar Kokhba]].<ref>L. J. F.

'''Chesley Bonestell''' (January 1, 1888 – June 11, 1986) was an [[American people|American]] painter, designer and illustrator.<ref>[http://www.mira.org/bonestell/index.htm Chesley Bonestell (Photograph by Cedric Braun.)] Chesley Bonestell Memorial Lecture Series, ''Each year, the Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy presents a lecture for the general public supported by funds from the Chesley Bonestell Memorial Lecture Endowment.'' – Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy</ref> His paintings were a major influence on [[science fiction]] art and illustration, and he helped inspire the American [[space program]]. An early pioneering creator of astronomical art, along with the French astronomer-artist [[Lucien Rudaux]], Bonestell was dubbed the "Father of Modern [[Space art|Space Art]]".

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Bonestell was born in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. His first astronomical painting was done in 1905. After seeing Saturn through the {{convert|12|in|mm|sing=on}} telescope at [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]'s [[Lick Observatory]], he rushed home to paint what he had seen. The painting was destroyed in the fire that followed the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]]. Between 1915 and 1918 he exhibited lithographs in the 4th and 7th annual exhibitions of the California Society of Etchers (now the [[California Society of Printmakers]]) in San Francisco.

Bonestell studied architecture at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. Dropping out in his third year, he worked as a renderer and designer for several of the leading [[architecture|architectural]] firms of the time. While with [[William van Alen]], he and Warren Straton designed the [[art deco]] façade of the [[Chrysler Building]] as well as its distinctive eagles.  During this same period, he designed the [[Plymouth Rock|Plymouth Rock Memorial]], the [[U.S. Supreme Court Building]], the [[New York Central Building]], Manhattan office and apartment buildings and several state capitols.<ref name=ches>[http://www.bookpump.com/upb/pdf-b/1128290b.pdf Chesley Bonestell Chronology], By Melvin H. Schuetz, 1999, [[uPublish.com]] Parkland Florida, ISBN 1-58112-829-0</ref>

Returning to the West Coast, he prepared illustrations of the chief engineer's plans for the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] for the benefit of funders. When the [[Great Depression]] dried up architectural work in the [[United States]], Bonestell went to [[England]], where he rendered architectural subjects for the ''Illustrated London News''. In the late 1930s he moved to [[Hollywood]], where he worked (without screen credit) as a [[special effects]] artist, creating [[matte paintings]] for films, including ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1939), ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) and ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942).

===Magazines===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Galaxybonestell251.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Bonestell's first cover for ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' (Feb 1951), ''The Tying Down of a Spaceship on Mars in Desert Sandstorm'']] -->
[[Image:Beta Lyrae Reconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|160px|The Beta Lyrae binary in the sky of an airless planet, after the painting by Chesley Bonestell.]]Bonestell then realized that he could combine what he had learned about camera angles, miniature modeling, and painting techniques with his lifelong interest in [[astronomy]]. The result was a series of paintings of [[Saturn]] as seen from several of its [[natural satellite|moons]] that was published in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' in 1944. Nothing like these had ever been seen before: they looked as though photographers had been sent into space. His painting of Saturn seen from the frosty moon Titan<ref>[http://www.novaspaceart.com/Prints/Limited%20Editions/Bonestell/Titan.html Saturn as Seen from Titan], (1944)</ref> is perhaps the most famous astronomical landscape ever. It was constructed with a combination of clay models, photographic tricks and various painting techniques. (Titan has a thick haze such that such a view is probably not possible in reality.)

Bonestell followed up the sensation these paintings created by publishing more paintings in many leading national [[magazine]]s. These and others were eventually collected in the best-selling book ''[[The Conquest of Space]]'' (1949), produced in collaboration with author [[Willy Ley]]. Bonestell's last work in Hollywood was contributing special effects art and technical advice to the seminal [[science fiction]] films produced by [[George Pal]], including ''[[Destination Moon (film)|Destination Moon]]'', ''[[When Worlds Collide (1951 film)|When Worlds Collide]]'', ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'' and ''[[Conquest of Space]]'', as well as ''[[Cat-Women of the Moon]]''. Beginning with the October 1947 issue of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', Bonestell painted more than 60 cover illustrations for science fiction magazines, primarily the ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'' during the 1950s to 1970s, and numerous book covers.<ref name=isfdb/>

When [[Wernher von Braun]] organized a space flight symposium for ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'', he invited Bonestell to illustrate his concepts for the future of spaceflight.  For the first time, spaceflight was shown to be a matter of the near future. Von Braun and Bonestell showed that it could be accomplished with the [[technology]] then existing in the mid-1950s, and that the question was that of money and will. Coming as they did at the beginning of the [[Cold War]] and just before the sobering shock of the launch of [[Sputnik]], the 1952–54 ''Collier's'' series, "[[Man Will Conquer Space Soon!]]", was instrumental in kick-starting America's space program.

In 1986, Bonestell died in [[Carmel, California]], with an unfinished painting on his easel.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-26/news/mn-21324_1_chesley-bonestell OBITUARIES : Blended Astronomy and Art : Painter Chesley Bonestell, 98, Dies] – Los Angeles Times</ref>

During his lifetime, Bonestell was honored internationally for the contributions he made to the birth of modern [[astronautics]], from a bronze medal awarded by the [[British Interplanetary Society]] to a place in the [[International Space Hall of Fame]]<ref>[http://www.nmspacemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.php?id=97 Inductee Profile: Chesley K. Bonestell USA, Inducted in 1989], International Space Hall of Fame</ref> to an asteroid named for him. ''The Conquest of Space'' won the 1951 [[International Fantasy Award]] for nonfiction, one of the first two fantasy or science fiction awards anywhere, at the [[Eastercon|British SF Convention]].<!--also a special award at 1974 Worldcon--><ref name=SFAwards/> The [[EMP Museum#Science Fiction Hall of Fame|Science Fiction Hall of Fame]] inducted Bonestell in 2005, the first year it considered non-literary contributors.<ref name=sfhof2005/>{{efn|After inducting 36 fantasy and science fiction writers and editors from 1996 to 2004, the hall of fame dropped "fantasy" and made non-literary contributors eligible. Alongside one writer, the first three were Bonestell in the "Art" category, [[Model animation|"dynamation" animator]] [[Ray Harryhausen]], and film-maker [[Steven Spielberg]].<ref name=sfhof2005/><ref name=sfhof-old/>}}

His paintings are prized by collectors and institutions such as the [[National Air and Space Museum]] and the National Collection of Fine Arts. One of his classic paintings, an ethereally beautiful image of Saturn seen from its giant moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], has been called "the painting that launched a thousand careers." Wernher von Braun wrote that he had "learned to respect, nay fear, this wonderful artist's obsession with perfection. My file cabinet is filled with sketches of rocket ships I had prepared to help in his artwork—only to have them returned to me with…blistering criticism."

A [[Impact crater|crater]] on [[Mars]] and the [[asteroid]] [[3129 Bonestell]] are named after him.

A '''standard language''' (also '''standard dialect''' or '''standardized dialect''') is a language [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] used by a group of people in their public [[discourse]].<ref name=fineganp14>{{cite book |title=Language: Its Structure and Use|edition=5th |last=Finegan |first=Edward |year=2007 |publisher= Thomson Wadsworth|location=Boston, MA, USA|isbn=978-1-4130-3055-6 |page=14}}</ref> Alternatively, varieties become standard by undergoing a process of [[standardization]], during which it is organized for [[Linguistic description|description]] in grammars and dictionaries and encoded in such reference works.<ref name=fineganp14/> Typically, varieties that become standardized are the local [[dialect]]s spoken in the centers of [[commerce]] and [[government]], where a need arises for a variety that will serve more than local needs.

The only requirement for a variety to be standard is that it can frequently be used in public places or public discourse.<ref name=fineganp14/> The creation of a [[Prescription and description|prescriptive]] standard language derives from a desire for [[nationalism|national]] ([[cultural uniformity|cultural]], political, and [[social cohesion|social]]) cohesion with this considered as requiring an agreed-upon, standardized language variety.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Standard languages commonly feature:
* A recognized [[dictionary]] (standardized [[spelling]] and [[vocabulary]])
* A recognized [[grammar]]
* A standard [[pronunciation]] (educated speech)
* A linguistic institution defining usage norms; e.g. [[Académie française]] or [[Royal Spanish Academy|Real Academia Española]]

==Examples==
{{cleanup|section|date=January 2011}}

===Arabic===
[[Arabic language|Arabic]] comprises [[varieties of Arabic|many varieties]] (many of which are [[mutual intelligibility|mutually unintelligible]]) which are considered a single language because the standardized register of Arabic, called [[Literary Arabic]] (or, misleadingly, Modern Standard Arabic), is generally intelligible to literate speakers. It is based on simplified [[Classical Arabic]], the language of the [[Quran]], which dates from the 7th century CE.

===Chinese===
The [[Chinese language]] (??) comprises a wide variety of spoken forms, which are known as ''fangyan'' (??, “regional speech”). The major [[spoken Chinese|spoken variants]] are (i) [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], (ii) [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], (iii) [[Yue Chinese|Yue]], and (iv) [[Min Chinese|Min]]. These spoken variants are not mutually intelligible, so referring to them by the English term “dialect” is inaccurate, since this generally denotes mutual intelligibility. [[Standard Chinese]] is based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin, and is the official language of the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]), and [[Singapore|Republic of Singapore]]. It is called ''Putonghua'' ({{lang|zh-t|???}}, “common speech”) in the PRC, ''Guoyu'' ({{lang|zh-t|??}}, “national language”) in Taiwan, and ''Huayu'' ({{lang|zh-t|??}}, “Chinese language”) in Singapore. [[Classical Chinese]] previously served as the written standard before being replaced by [[written vernacular Chinese]] spoken according to [[Standard Mandarin]] pronounciation.

The Chinese language also enjoys official status in [[Hong Kong]] (together with [[English language|English]]) and in [[Macau]] (together with [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]). However, Standard Mandarin is not widely spoken in these territories. The majority of the population speaks, and often writes, [[Cantonese]].

In [[British English]] the standard, known as [[Standard English]] (SE), is historically based on the language of the medieval English [[court of Chancery]].<ref>[[#smith1996|Smith 1996]]</ref> The late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw the establishment of this standard as the norm of "polite" society, that is to say of the [[upper class]]es.<ref>[[#blake1996|Blake 1996]]</ref> The spoken standard has come to be seen as a mark of good education and social prestige.<ref>[[#baugh2002|Baugh and Cable, 2002]]</ref> Although often associated with the [[Received Pronunciation|RP accent]], SE can be spoken with any accent.<ref>[[#smith1996|Smith, 1996]]</ref>

The dialects of [[American English]] vary throughout the US, but the [[General American]] accent is the unofficial standard language for being considered accentless; it is based on Midwestern English, distributed within an [[isogloss]] area encompassing the states of [[Michigan]], [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], [[Iowa]], and to some extent [[Nebraska]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Filipino===
[[Filipino language|Filipino]] is the standardised form of the [[Manila]] dialect of [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], and is an official language of the [[Philippines]].  Most regions of the Philippines have a different [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine language]] as their first language, but all Filipinos learn Tagalog in school.  Tagalog is thus used as the ''lingua franca''.  National television is almost exclusively in Tagalog.  [[List of newspapers in the Philippines|National printed media]] are sometimes in Tagalog but more often in English.

===Finnish===
The basic structure and words of standard [[Finnish language|Finnish]] (''yleiskieli'') are mostly based upon the dialects of Western Finland, because [[Mikael Agricola]], who codified the written language in the sixteenth century, was from [[Turku]], the regional centre of the time. Finnish was developed to integrate all of the nation’s dialects, and so yield a logical language for proper written communication. One aim was national unification, in accordance to the [[nationalism|nationalistic principle]]; the second aim was linguistic regularity and consistency, even if contradicting general colloquial usage, e.g. in Standard Finnish, ''ruoka'' becomes  ''ruoan'', and the pronunciation is ''ruuan''.

===French===
[[Paris]]ian [[French language|French]] is the standard in French literature.

===German===
[[Standard German]] was developed over several centuries, during which time writers tried to write in a way intelligible to the greatest number of readers and speakers, thus, until about 1800, Standard German was mostly a written language. In that time, northern [[Germany]] spoke [[Low German]] dialects much different from Standard German. Later, the Northern pronunciation of written German became considered as the universal standard; in [[Hanover]], because of that adoption, the local dialect disappeared.

===Greek===
The Standard form of [[Modern Greek]] is based on the [[Varieties of Modern Greek#Spoken dialects|Southern dialects]]; these dialects are spoken mainly in the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Ionian Islands]], [[Attica]], [[Crete]] and the [[Cyclades]].<ref>Horrocks, Geoffrey (1997): ''Greek: A history of the language and its speakers.'' London: Longman. Ch.17.</ref> However the Northerners call this dialect, and the Standard form, 'Atheneika' which means 'the [[Athens]] dialect'. This form is also official in [[Cyprus]], where people speak a [[Varieties of Modern Greek#Spoken dialects|South-Eastern dialect]] (dialects spoken in the [[Dodecanese]] and Cyprus), [[Cypriot Greek]].

===Hindi===
Two standardized [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of the [[Hindustani language]] have legal status India: [[Standard Hindi]] (one of 23 co-official national languages) and [[Urdu]] ([[Pakistan]]’s official tongue), resultantly, Hindustani often called “Hindi-Urdu”.<ref name=Blum>{{cite book|last=Blum |first=Daniel| authorlink= |year=2002 |language=German |title=Sprache und Politik : Sprachpolitik und Sprachnationalismus in der Republik Indien und dem sozialistischen Jugoslawien (1945-1991) | trans_title=Language and Policy: Language Policy and Linguistic Nationalism in the Republic of India and the Socialist Yugoslavia (1945-1991) |url= |series= Beiträge zur Südasienforschung ; vol. 192 |location=Würzburg | publisher=Ergon | page=200 |isbn=3-89913-253-X  |lccn= |oclc=51961066  |ol= |archivedate= | archiveurl= |accessdate= }}</ref>

===Irish===
''An Caighdeán Oifigiúil'' ("The Official Standard"), often shortened to ''An Caighdeán'', is official standard of the [[Irish language]]. It is taught in most schools in Ireland, though with strong influences from local dialects. It was first published by the translators in [[Dáil Éireann]] in the 1950s.<ref name="blas">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/irish/blas/education/beginnersblas/dictionaries.shtml | title=Beginners' Blas | accessdate=18 March 2011 | date=June 2005 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> As of September 2013,<ref>{{cite news|title=Caighdeán Athbhreithnithe don Ghaeilge|url=http://www.gaelport.com/nuacht/Caighdean-athbhreithnithe-don-Ghaeilge/|accessdate=2012-08-02|newspaper=Gaelport.com|date=2012-08-02|author=Niamh Ní Shúilleabháin|language=Gaeilge, [ga]}}</ref> the first major revision of the Caighdeán Oifigiúil is available, both online<ref>{{cite web|title=An Caighdeán Oifigiúil—Caighdeán Athbhreithnithe|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/michelle/Final-Version.pdf|publisher=Seirbhís Thithe an Oireachtais|accessdate=2012-08-02|language=Gaeilge, [ga]|format=PDF|date=January 2012}}</ref> and in print.<ref>{{cite web|title=Foilseacháin Rialtais / Government Publications—Don tSeachtain dar críoch 25 Iúil 2012 / For the week ended 25 July 2012|url=http://www.opw.ie/en/media/wl25072012.pdf|publisher=Rialtas na hÉireann|accessdate=2012-08-02|page=2|language=Gaeilge, [ie]; English, [en]|format=PDF|date=27 July 2012|quote=M67B Gramadach na Gaeilge 9781406425766 390 10.00}}</ref> Among the changes to be found in the revised version are, for example, various attempts to bring the recommendations of the Caighdeán closer to the spoken dialect of Gaeltacht speakers,<ref>{{cite book|title=An Caighdeán Oifigiúil—Caighdeán Athbhreithnithe|publisher=Seirbhís Thithe an Oireachtais|page=7|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/Oireachtas_book(211211).pdf|editor=Vivian Uíbh Eachach|language=Gaeilge, [ga]|date=January 2012|quote=Rinneadh iarracht ar leith san athbhreithniú seo foirmeacha agus leaganacha atá ar fáil go tréan sa chaint sna mórchanúintí a áireamh sa Chaighdeán Oifigiúil Athbhreithnithe sa tslí is go mbraithfeadh an gnáthchainteoir mórchanúna go bhfuil na príomhghnéithe den chanúint sin aitheanta sa Chaighdeán Oifigiúil agus, mar sin, gur gaire don ghnáthchaint an Caighdeán Oifigiúil anois ná mar a bhíodh.}}</ref> including allowing further use of the nominative case where the genitive would historically have been found.<ref>{{cite book|title=An Caighdeán Oifigiúil—Caighdeán Athbhreithnithe|date=January 2012|publisher=Seirbhís Thithe an Oireachtais|page=7|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/Oireachtas_book(211211).pdf|editor=Vivian Uíbh Eachach|accessdate=2012-08-02|language=Gaeilge, [ga]|format=PDF|quote=Triaileadh, mar shampla, aitheantas a thabhairt don leathnú atá ag teacht ar úsáid fhoirm an ainmnigh in ionad an ghinidigh sa chaint.}}</ref>

===Italian===
[[Italian language|Standard Italian]] derives from [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]], specifically from its [[Florentine language|Florentine variety]]: the Florentine influence upon early [[Italian literature]] established that dialect as base for the standard language of Italy. In particular Italian became the language of culture for all the people of Italy, thanks to the prestige of the masterpieces of [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Francesco Petrarca]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and [[Francesco Guicciardini]]. It would later become the official language of all the [[Historical states of Italy|Italian states]], and after the [[Italian unification]] it became the [[national language]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].<ref>[http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/ling450ch/reports/Italian2.html A Brief History of the Italian Language by Cory Crawford]. linguistics.byu.edu</ref> Modern [[Italian language|Standard Italian]]'s lexicon has been deeply influenced by almost all [[Languages of Italy|regional languages of Italy]] while its [[received pronunciation]] (known as ''Pronuncia Fiorentina Emendata'', Amended Florentine Pronunciation) is based on the [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] of [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] ([[Rome]]'s dialect); these are the reasons why [[Italian language|Standard Italian]] can't be considered identical to [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]].<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/pronuncia_(Enciclopedia_dell'Italiano)/ La pronuncia italiana (Italian)]. treccani.it</ref>

===Latin===
[[Classical Latin]] was the literary standard dialect of Latin spoken by higher socioeconomic classes, as opposed to the [[Vulgar Latin]] which is the generic term of the colloquial [[sociolect]]s of Latin spoken across the [[Roman Empire]] by uneducated and less-educated classes.  The Latin brought by Roman soldiers to [[Gaul]], [[Hispania|Iberia]], or [[Dacia]] was not identical to the Latin of [[Cicero]], and differed from it in vocabulary, syntax, and grammar.<ref name="Palmer">L. R. Palmer The Latin Language (repr. Univ. Oklahoma 1988, ISBN 0-8061-2136-X)</ref>  Some literary works with [[Register (sociolinguistics)|low-register language]] from the Classical Latin period give a glimpse into the world of early Vulgar Latin.  The works of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], being [[comedy|comedies]] with many characters who were [[Slavery|slave]]s, preserve some early [[basilectal]] Latin features, as does the recorded speech of the freedmen in the ''[[Cena Trimalchionis#Chapters 26-78, Cena Trimalchionis (Trimalchio's dinner)|Cena Trimalchionis]]'' by [[Petronius Arbiter]].  At the third [[Council of Tours]] in 813, [[priest]]s were ordered to preach in the vernacular language — either in the ''rustica lingua romanica'' (Vulgar Latin), or in the [[Old High German|Germanic vernaculars]] — since the common people could no longer understand formal Latin. Catholic Church continued to use Latin at present, and the name of the form of Latin is named [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] which is regarded a modernized standard dialect of Latin based on simplified Classical Latin with some lexical variations, a simplified syntax in some cases, and, commonly, an Italianized pronunciation.

[[File:Målformer i Norge.svg|300px|thumb|'''Language distribution:''' The official form of written Norwegian by municipality in Norway. '''Red''': Bokmål. '''Blue''': New Norwegian. '''Grey''': Neutral (neither form is official, usually because of a fairly even number of users or lack of political decisions over the matter).]]

===Malay===
The [[Malay language]] exists in a Classical variety, and modern standard variety and several vernacular dialects.

===Manchu===
Standard [[Manchu language|Manchu]] was based on the language spoken by the [[Jianzhou Jurchens]] during [[Nurhaci]]'s time, while other unwritten Manchu dialects such as that of [[Aigun]] and [[Sanjiazi]] were also spoken in addition to the related [[Xibe language]].

===Mongolian===
[[Classical Mongolian language]] was the high register used for religious and official purposes while the various Mongolian dialects serve as the low reigster, like [[Khalkha Mongolian]], [[Chakhar Mongolian]], [[Khorchin Mongolian]], [[Kharchin Mongolian]], [[Baarin Mongolian]], [[Ordos Mongolian]], and the [[Buryat language]]. The [[Tibetan Buddhist canon]] was translated into Classical Mongolian. The [[Oirats|Oirat Mongols]] who spoke the [[Oirat language|Oirat Mongol language]] and dialects like [[Kalmyk language]] or [[Torgut Oirat]] used a seperate standard written with the [[Clear script]].

The [[Mongolian language]], based on Khalkha Mongolian, now serves as the high register in [[Mongolia]] itself while in [[Inner Mongolia]] a standard Mongolian based on Chakhar Mongolian serves as the high register for all Mongols in China. The Buryat language has been turned into a standard literary form itself in Russia.

===Norwegian===
In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] there are two parallel standard languages: (i) ''Bokmål'' (partly derived from the local pronunciation of [[Danish language|Danish]], when Denmark ruled [[Norway]]), (ii) ''Nynorsk'' (comparatively derived from Norwegian dialects).

===Portuguese===
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] has two official written standards, (i) [[Brazilian Portuguese]] (used chiefly in [[Brazil]]) and (ii) [[European Portuguese]] (used in [[Portugal]] and [[Angola]], [[Cape Verde]], [[East Timor]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Macau]], [[Mozambique]], and [[São Tomé and Príncipe]]). The written standards slightly differ in spelling and vocabulary, and are legally regulated. Unlike the written language, however, there is no spoken-Portuguese official standard, but the European Portuguese reference pronunciation is the educated speech of [[Lisbon]].

In Brazil, actors and journalists usually adopt an unofficial, but de facto, spoken standard Portuguese, originally derived from the middle-class dialect of [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]], but that now encompasses educated urban pronunciations from the different speech communities in the southeast. In that standard, <nowiki><s></nowiki> represents the phoneme {{IPA|/s/}} when it appears at the end of a syllable (whereas in Rio de Janeiro this represents {{IPA|/?/}}) the [[rhotic consonant]] spelled <r> is pronounced {{IPA|[x]}} in the same situation (whereas in [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]] this is usually an [[alveolar flap]] or [[alveolar trill|trill]]).  European and African dialects have differing realizations of {{IPA|/?/}} than Brazilian dialects, with the former using {{IPA|[?]}} and {{IPA|[r]}} and the latter using {{IPA|[x]}}, {{IPA|[h]}}, or {{IPA|[?]}}.<ref>Mateus, Maria Helena & d'Andrade, Ernesto (2000) ''The Phonology of Portuguese'' ISBN 0-19-823581-X [http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-823581-X.pdf (Excerpt from Google Books)]</ref> Between vowels, <r> represents {{IPA|/?/}} for most dialects.

===Serbo-Croatian===
Four standard variants of the [[Pluricentric language#Serbo-Croatian|pluricentric Serbo-Croatian]] are spoken in [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Montenegro]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Kordi? |first=Snježana | authorlink=Snježana Kordi? |editor1-last=Madelain |editor1-first=Anne |editor1-link= |title=Au sud de l'Est |trans_title= |series=vol. 3 |publisher=Non Lieu |pages=71–78 |language=French |chapter=La langue croate, serbe, bosniaque et monténégrine |trans_chapter=Croatian, Serbian, Bosniakian, and Montenegrin |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |location=Paris |year=2007 |isbn=978-2-35270-036-4 |oclc= |archivedate=4 August 2012 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69f5WqGAx |accessdate=8 August 2012 }}</ref> They all have the [[Language secessionism#In Serbo-Croatian|same dialect]] basis ([[Shtokavian dialect|Štokavian]]).<ref name=Blum/><ref>{{cite book |last=Brozovi? |first=Dalibor | authorlink=Dalibor Brozovi? |editor1-last=Clyne |editor1-first=Michael G |title= Pluricentric Languages: Differing Norms in Different Nations |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |pages=347–380 |chapter= Serbo-Croatian as a pluricentric language |url=http://books.google.hr/books?id=wawGFWNuHiwC&pg=PA347&lpg=PA347&dq=serbo-croatian+pluricentric&hl=hr#v=onepage&q=serbo-croatian%20pluricentric&f=false |series= Contributions to the sociology of language 62 |location=Berlin & New York |year=1992 |isbn= |oclc=24668375 }}</ref> These variants do differ slightly, as is the case with other pluricentric languages.<ref name=Blum/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kordi? |first=Snježana | authorlink=Snježana Kordi? |editor1-last=Badurina |editor1-first=Lada |editor1-link= |editor2-last=Pranjkovi? |editor2-first=Ivo |editor2-link=Ivo Pranjkovi? |editor3-last=Sili? |editor3-first=Josip  |editor3-link= |title=Jezi?ni varijeteti i nacionalni identiteti |trans_title= |publisher=Disput |pages=83–108 |language=Serbo-Croatian |chapter=Policentri?ni standardni jezik |trans_chapter=Polycentric Standard Language |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426269.POLICENTRICNI_STANDARDNI.PDF |series= |location=Zagreb |year=2009 |isbn=978-953-260-054-4 |oclc=437306433 |archivedate=4 August 2012 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69f5Mtzox |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> The differences between the variants do not hinder mutual intelligibility and do not undermine the integrity of the system as a whole.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pohl |first=Hans-Dieter| authorlink= |editor1-last=Ohnheiser |editor1-first=Ingeborg |editor1-link= |title= Wechselbeziehungen zwischen slawischen Sprachen, Literaturen und Kulturen in Vergangenheit und Gegenwart : Akten der Tagung aus Anlaß des 25jährigen Bestehens des Instituts für Slawistik an der Universität Innsbruck, Innsbruck, 25. - 27.

===Somali===
In [[Somalia]], [[Somali language#Varieties|Northern Somali]] (or North-Central Somali) forms the basis for [[Somali language|Standard Somali]],<ref name="Dalby">{{Harvcoltxt|Dalby|1998|p=571}}</ref> particularly the [[Mudug]] dialect of the northern [[Darod]] clan. Northern Central Somali has frequently been used by famous [[List of Somali poets|Somali poets]] as well as the political elite, and thus has the most prestige among other Somali dialects.<ref name="s5">{{Harvcoltxt|Saeed|1999|p=5}}</ref>

===Spanish===
In [[Spain]], Standard [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is based partly upon the speech of educated speakers from Madrid, but mainly upon the literary language. In [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] the Spanish standard is based on the local dialects of [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Montevideo]]. This is known as [[Rioplatense Spanish]] (“River Plate Spanish”), distinguishable, from other standard Spanish dialects, by the greater use of the [[voseo]]. Like Rioplatense Spanish, all Standard Spanish dialects in all Latin America, United States, and Canary Islands are related to Andalusian Spanish.  In Colombia, the dialect of Bogotá ("[[Colombian Spanish#Rolo or Bogot.C3.A1 dialect|Rolo]]") is valued across Latin America for its clear pronunciation.<ref>http://www.theworld.org/2010/06/the-clearest-spanish/</ref>

===Tibetan===
[[Classical Tibetan]] was the high register used universally by all Tibetans while the various mutually unintelligible [[Tibetic languages]] serve as the low register vernacular, like [[Central Tibetan language]] in [[Ü-Tsang]] (Tibet proper), [[Khams Tibetan]] in [[Kham]], [[Amdo Tibetan]] in Amdo, [[Ladakhi language]] in [[Ladakh]], and [[Dzongkha]] in [[Bhutan]]. Classical Tibetan was used for official and religious purposes, such as in Tibetan Buddhist religious texts like the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon]] and taught and learned in monasteries and schools in Tibetan Buddhist regions. 

Now [[Standard Tibetan]], based on the Lhasa dialect, serves as the high register in China. In Bhutan, the Tibetan [[Dzongkha]] language has been standarized and replaced Classical Tibetan for official purposes and education, in [[Ladakh]], the standard official language learned are now the unrelated languages Hindi-Urdu and English, and in [[Baltistan]], the Tibetan [[Balti language]] serves as the low register while the unrelated Urdu language is the official language.

===Uzbek and Uyghur===
The Turkic [[Chagatai language]] served as fhe high register literary standard for Central Asian Turkic peoples, while the vernacular low register languages were the [[Uzbek language]] and [[Uyghur language|Eastern Turki (Modern Uyghur)]]. The [[Soviet Union]] abolished Chagatai as the literary standard and had the [[Uzbek language]] standarized as a literary language for, and the [[Taranchi]] dialect of Ili was chosen as the literary standard for Modern Uyghur, while other dialects like the Kashgar and Turpan dialects continue to be spoken.

'''''Monthly Review''''', established in 1949, is an independent [[socialist]] [[academic journal|journal]] published monthly in New York City. As of 2013 the publication remains the longest continuously published [[socialism|socialist]] magazine in the United States of America.

==History==

===Establishment===

Following the failure of the independent [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 Presidential campaign]] of [[Henry A. Wallace]], two former supporters of the Wallace effort met at the farm in [[New Hampshire]] where one of them was living. The two men were literary scholar and [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] [[F. O. Matthiessen|F.O. "Matty" Matthiessen]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[economist]] [[Paul Sweezy]], who were former colleagues at [[Harvard University]]. Matthiessen came into an inheritance after his father died in an automobile accident in [[California]] and had no pressing need for the money. Matthiessen made the offer to Sweezy to underwrite such a magazine to the sum of $5,000 per year for three years. Matthiessen funds made the launch of ''Monthly Review'' possible, although the amount of the seed money was reduced to $4,000 per year in the second and third years by the executors of Matthiessen's estate following his suicide in 1950.<ref name=phelps3>{{Cite doi|10.14452/MR-051-01-1999-05_1}} p. 2-3.</ref>

Although Matthiessen was the financial angel of the new publication, from the outset the editorial task was handled by Sweezy and his co-thinker, the left wing popular writer [[Leo Huberman]]. The author of an array of books and pamphlets during the 1930s and early 1940s, the [[New York University]]-educated Huberman worked full-time on ''Monthly Review'' from its establishment until his death of a [[heart attack]] in 1968.<ref name=phelps3-4>{{Cite doi|10.14452/MR-051-01-1999-05_1}} p. 3-4</ref>

Sweezy and Huberman were complementary figures guiding the publication, with Sweezy's theoretical bent and writing ability put to use for a majority of the editorial content, while Huberman took charge of the business and administrative aspects of the enterprise. Sweezy remained at home in New Hampshire, traveling down to the New York City once a month to read [[manuscript]]s, where Huberman conducted the day-to-day operations of the magazine along with his wife, Gerty Huberman, and family friend Sybil Huntington May.<ref name=sweezy1987-1>{{Cite doi|10.14452/MR-038-11-1987-04_1}} p. 32-33</ref>

Briefly joining Sweezy and Huberman as a third founding editor of ''Monthly Review'' — although not listed as such on the publication's [[masthead (publishing)|masthead]] — was German émigré [[Otto Nathan]] (1893-1987). Although his time of editorial association with ''MR'' was short, Nathan was instrumental in obtaining what would become a seminal essay for the magazine, a lead piece for the debut May 1949 issue by [[physicist]] [[Albert Einstein]] entitled "[[Why Socialism?]]"<ref name=whysocialism>{{Cite doi|10.14452/MR-061-01-2009-05_7|date=May 2009|noedit}} HTML version available at the ''Monthly Review'' website: {{cite web|title=Why Socialism?|url=http://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism|accessdate=18 January 2014|date=May 1949}}</ref><ref name=AboutMR>[http://monthlyreview.org/about "About ''Monthly Review''"].</ref>

Another key contributor during the first 15 years of ''MR'' was economist [[Paul A. Baran|Paul Baran]], frequently considered as the third member of an editorial troika including Sweezy and Huberman. A [[tenure]]d professor at [[Stanford University]], Baran was one of a very few self-identified Marxists to teach economics at American universities during the [[Cold War]] period. Baran worked closely with Sweezy on a book regarded as a landmark in Marxist theory entitled ''Monopoly Capital,'' although he died of a heart attack prior to the work's first publication in 1966.<ref name=phelps4-5>{{Cite doi|10.14452/MR-051-01-1999-05_1}} p. 4-5.</ref>

''Monthly Review'' launched in 1949 with a circulation of just 450 copies, most of whom were personal acquaintances of either Huberman or Sweezy.<ref name=sweezy1987-2>{{Cite doi|10.14452/MR-038-11-1987-04_1}} p. 43-44</ref> The magazine's ideology and readership closely paralleled that of the independent Marxist weekly newspaper ''[[National Guardian|The National Guardian]]'', established in 1948. Despite a conservative political climate in the United States, the magazine quickly reached a critical mass of subscribers, with its paid circulation rising to 2,500 in 1950 and to 6,000 in 1954.<ref name=phelps7-9>{{Cite doi|10.14452/MR-051-01-1999-05_1}} p. 7-9.</ref>

===McCarthy period===

During the McCarthyism of the early 1950s, editors Paul Sweezy and Leo Huberman were targeted for "subversive activities." Sweezy's case, tried by [[New Hampshire Attorney General]], went all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and became a seminal case on [[freedom of speech]] when the Court ruled in his favor.<ref name=NYTimesObit/>

In 1953 the magazine added veteran radical [[Scott Nearing]] to the magazine's ranks. From that date and for nearly 20 years Nearing authored a monthly column descriptively entitled "World Events". During the Truman and Eisenhower years, a number of left wing intellectuals found a space for their work in ''MR,'' including a number that would gain in stature in the ensuing liberalized decade, such as pacifist activist [[Staughton Lynd]] (1952), historian [[William Appleman Williams]] (1952), and sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] (1958).<ref name=phelps18>{{Cite doi|10.14452/MR-051-01-1999-05_1}} p. 18-19.</ref>

===New Left era and after===

From the middle years of the 1960s, radical political theory saw a resurgence in association with the emergence of a [[New Left]] in Europe and North America. ''Monthly Review'' grew in stature in tandem with this resurgence.<ref name=jbf1990-485>John Bellamy Foster, "Monthly Review," in Mari Jo Buhle, Paul Buhle, and Dan Georgakas (eds.) ''Encyclopedia of the American Left'' New York: Garland Publishing Co., 1990; p. 485.</ref> While remaining an intellectual journal not oriented towards acquiring a mass readership, circulation of the publication nonetheless grew throughout this era, approaching 9,100 in 1970 before peaking at 11,500 in 1977.<ref name=phelps20>{{Cite doi|10.14452/MR-051-01-1999-05_1}} p. 20-21.</ref>

While ''MR'' remained essentially a publication with roots in the so-called "Old Left", it was not unfriendly to the young radical movement which grew in conjunction with the [[Civil Rights movement]] and the opposition to [[conscription]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. Among those associated with the 1960s New Left published by the ''Monthly Review'' were [[C. Wright Mills]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Todd Gitlin]], [[Carl Oglesby]], [[David Horowitz]], and [[Noam Chomsky]].<ref name=phelps20 />

The ''Monthly Review'' editorial staff was joined in May 1969 by radical economist [[Harry Magdoff]], replacing Leo Huberman, who had died in 1968. Magdoff, a reader of the publication from its first issue in 1949, bolstered the already well-developed "[[Third-Worldism|Third-Worldist]]" orientation of the publication, based upon revolutionary events in [[Cuba]], China, and [[Vietnam]]. Certain [[Maoism|Maoist]] influence made itself felt in the content of the publication in this period.<ref name=magdoff1999>{{Cite doi|10.14452/MR-051-01-1999-05_3}} p. 54, pp. 61-64</ref>

''Monthly Review'' became steadily more critical of the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s, with editor Paul Sweezy objecting to the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968 and the suppression of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Polish trade union "Solidarity"]] through [[martial law]] in 1981.<ref name=phelps24-25>{{Cite doi|10.14452/MR-051-01-1999-05_1}} p. 24-25.</ref> In the latter case, Sweezy declared the incident had proved beyond doubt that

<blockquote>
...the Communist regimes of the Soviet bloc have become the expression and the guardians of a new rigidified hierarchical structure which has nothing in common with the kind of socialist society Marxists have always regarded as the goal of modern working class movements."<ref name=sweezy1983>{{Cite doi|10.14452/MR-034-08-1983-01_3}} p. 30</ref> </blockquote>

With the decline of the American Left in the 1980s, ''MR'''s fortunes fell accordingly, with circulation hovering in the 8,000 range throughout the decade.<ref name=jbf1990-484>John Bellamy Foster, "Monthly Review," in Mari Jo Buhle, Paul Buhle, and Dan Georgakas (eds.)''Encyclopedia of the American Left.'' New York: Garland Publishing Co., 1990; p. 484.</ref>

===Publication today===

Since 2006 [[John Bellamy Foster]] has been the sole editor, together with [[Michael Yates (economist)|Michael D. Yates]], as associate editor, assistant editors, and an editorial committee.<ref name="archives-editorial">''Monthly Review'' Archives, "[http://archive.monthlyreview.org/index.php/mr/about/editorialTeam Editorial Team]."</ref>

==Political orientation==

From its first issue, ''Monthly Review'' attacked the premise that [[capitalism]] was capable of infinite growth through [[Keynesianism|Keynesian]] [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] fine-tuning. Instead, the magazine's editors and leading writers have remained true to the traditional Marxist perspective that capitalist economies contain internal contradictions which will ultimately lead to their collapse and reconstitution on a new socialist basis. Topics of editorial concern have included [[poverty]], unequal distribution of incomes and wealth, [[racism]], [[imperialism]] in relations between economically developed and less developed nations, and inefficiencies in production and distribution seen as endemic to the capitalist system.<ref name=phelps4-5 />

Although not adverse to discussion of esoteric matters of socialist theory, ''MR'' was generally characterized by an aversion to doctrinaire citations of Marxist canon in favor of the analysis of real world economic and historical trends. Readability was emphasized and the use of academic jargon discouraged.<ref name=jbf1990-484 />

Editors Huberman and Sweezy argued as early as 1952 that massive and expanding military spending was an integral part of the process of capitalist stabilization, driving corporate profits, bolstering levels of employment, and absorbing surplus production. The illusion of an external military threat was required sustain this system of priorities in government spending, they argued; consequently effort was made by the editors to challenge the dominant Cold War paradigm of "Democracy versus Communism" in the material published in the magazine.<ref name=Clecak667>Peter Clecak, "Monthly Review (1949—)," in [[Joseph R. Conlin]] (ed.), ''The American Radical Press, 1880-1960: Volume 2.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1974; pg. 667.</ref>

In its editorial line ''Monthly Review'' offered critical support of the [[Soviet Union]] during its early years although over time the magazine became increasingly critical of Soviet dedication to [[Socialism in One Country]] and [[peaceful coexistence]], seeing that country as playing a more or less conservative role in a world marked by national revolutionary movements. After the [[Sino-Soviet split]] of the 1960s, Sweezy and Huberman soon came to see the People's Republic of China as the actual center of the world revolutionary movement.<ref name=Clecak671>Clecak, "Monthly Review (1949—)," p. 671.</ref>

''Monthly Review'' remained true to an independent orientation throughout its history and never aligned with any specific [[revolution]]ary movement or political organization. Many of its articles have been written by academics, journalists, and freelance public intellectuals, including [[Tariq Ali]], [[Isabel Allende]], [[Samir Amin]], [[Julian Bond]], [[Marilyn Buck]], [[G. D. H. Cole]], [[Bernardine Dohrn]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Barbara Ehrenreich]], [[Andre Gunder Frank]], [[Eduardo Galeano]], [[Che Guevara]], [[Lorraine Hansberry]], [[Edward S. Herman|Edward Herman]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Michael Klare]], [[Saul Landau]], [[Michael Parenti]], [[Robert W. McChesney]], [[Ralph Miliband]], [[Marge Piercy]], [[Frances Fox Piven]], [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Daniel Singer (journalist)|Daniel Singer]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], and [[Raymond Williams]].<ref name=AboutMR/>

In 2004, ''Monthly Review'' editor [[John Bellamy Foster]] told the ''[[New York Times]]''

<blockquote>
"The ''Monthly Review''... was and is Marxist, but did not hew to the party line or get into sectarian struggles."<ref name=NYTimesObit>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5D9173FF931A35750C0A9629C8B63 Paul Sweezy, 93, Marxist Publisher and Economist, Dies], ''[[New York Times]]'', March 2, 2004.</ref></blockquote>

==Non-English editions==

In addition to the U.S.-based magazine, there are seven sister editions of ''Monthly Review''. They are published in Greece; Turkey; Spain; South Korea; as well as separate English, Hindi, and Bengali editions in India.<ref>{{cite web|title=Foreign Editions of Monthly Review|url=http://monthlyreview.org/about/foreign-editions}}</ref>

==Monthly Review Press==

Monthly Review Press, an allied endeavor, was launched in 1951 in response to the inability of the maverick left wing journalist [[I. F. Stone]] to otherwise find a publisher for his book ''The Hidden History of the Korean War''. Stone's work, which argued that the still ongoing [[Korean War]] was not a case of simple Communist military aggression but was rather the product of political isolation, South Korean military buildup, and border provocations, became the first title offered by the MR Press in 1952.<ref name=phelps15-16>{{Cite doi|10.14452/MR-051-01-1999-05_1}} p. 15-16.</ref>

{{italictitle}}
There is also an earlier encyclical of the same title, issued in 1741 by [[Pope Benedict XIV]], forbidding traffic in alms. <!-- maybe each should have its own article, [[Quanta Cura (1741)]] and [[Quanta Cura (1864)]], make a disambiguation page [[Quanta Cura]] -->

==Historical context==
The encyclical was prompted by the September Convention of 1864, an agreement between the [[Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Second French Empire]] of [[Napoleon III]], undertaken as a part of the [[Italy|Italian]] ''[[Risorgimento]]'', under which [[France]] was to withdraw its army from [[Rome]], which they had previously occupied in order to prevent Italy from capturing the city and completing the [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]].

Pius closed the encyclical by declaring a [[Jubilee (Christian)|Jubilee]] year for 1865, with a plenary [[indulgence]].

==Opposition to freedom of conscience==
Pius IX's 1864 encyclical specifically marks for condemnation that:
{{quote|liberty of conscience and worship is each man's personal right, which ought to be legally proclaimed and asserted in every rightly constituted society; and that a right resides in the citizens to an absolute liberty, which should be restrained by no authority whether ecclesiastical or civil, whereby they may be able openly and publicly to manifest and declare any of their ideas whatever, either by word of mouth, by the press, or in any other way. (section 3)}}

==Propositions condemned==
''Quanta Cura'' also condemns several other propositions, notably:
* That the will of the public is supreme and overrides any other law, human or divine
* That "in the political order accomplished facts, from the very circumstance that they are accomplished, have the force of right."
* That the outlawing of public begging and almsgiving is sound policy
* That parents have no rights with respect to their children's education, except what the civil law grants them
* That Catholics have no moral obligation to obey the church's laws unless they are ratified by the state
* That the state has a right to take the property of the church and the religious orders

These propositions were aimed at anticlerical governments in various European countries, which had been recently and would in the next few years be secularizing education (sometimes by taking over Catholic schools rather than starting their own competing public schools) and suppressing religious orders, confiscating their property. (Hales 1958)

==Subsequent commentary==
[[John Henry Newman]] comments on this passage in his ''[[Letter to the Duke of Norfolk]]'' (1874), [http://www.newmanreader.org/works/anglicans/volume2/gladstone/section5.html section 5]:

:It is a rule in formal ecclesiastical proceedings, as I shall have occasion to notice lower down, when books or authors are condemned, to use the very words of the book or author, and to condemn the words in that particular sense which they have in their context and their drift, not in the literal, not in the religious sense, such as the Pope might recognize, were they in another book or author. ..... Both Popes [Gregory XVI and Pius IX] certainly scoff at the so-called "liberty of conscience," but there is no scoffing of any Pope, in formal documents addressed to the faithful at large, at that most serious doctrine, the right and the duty of following that Divine Authority, the voice of conscience, on which in truth the Church herself is built.

And on the condemnation of absolute freedom of speech, he wrote, after discussing the restrictions on freedom of speech and worship in English law (ibid, [http://www.newmanreader.org/works/anglicans/volume2/gladstone/section6.html section 6]):

:Now, is there any government on earth that could stand the strain of such a doctrine as this? ... It is the liberty of every one to give public utterance, in every possible shape, by every possible channel, without any let or hindrance from God or man, to all his notions whatsoever.

==Syllabus of Errors==
''Quanta Cura'' is remembered mostly because of its annex, the ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]'', which condemns a number of [[politics|political]] propositions involving [[democracy]], [[socialism]], and freedom of speech and religion.

==Legacy==
The doctrines of ''Quanta Cura'' and the Syllabus were reaffirmed by Pius IX successors, most notably [[Leo XIII]], [[Pius X]] and [[Pius XI]] the latter instituting a major feast of [[Christ the King]] to enshrine the doctrines in the liturgical year. Allegations that ''Quanta Cura'''s opposition to religious pluralism was considerably softened by the constitutions of the [[Second Vatican Council]] and that in particular, ''[[Gaudium et Spes]]'' approves of the pluralistic culture of [[modernity]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2009|reason=approval of "pluralistic culture"? and "modernity", and does the document really approve "the church diminished ... sexual freedoms ... theories of "free love" and uninhibited sexual freedom ..." which are part of "modernity" according to the article on the subject}}  while ''[[Dignitatis Humanae]]'' supports Church-State separation have been the cause of considerable controversy.

He was born in [[Olivenza|Olivença]], but little else is known for certain of his life, including the dates of his birth and death. Some information is recorded in the 18th century biography by [[Barbosa Machado]]:  he came from Olivença, became a priest, and was employed as a teacher both at [[Padua]] and [[Viterbo]]. Very little of what Machado wrote about him has been verified by any other source, except the date of publication (1561) of a music theory treatise at [[Venice]].

As a composer he wrote a number of choral works, including [[motet]]s and a [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], but he is better known by far for his work as a theorist. In a 1551 debate in Rome, he espoused traditional views on the role of the three genera in music ([[diatonic]], [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] and [[enharmonic]]) over more radical ones put forward by [[Nicola Vicentino]] (Lusitano was deemed to have won the debate). His ''Introdutione facilissima et novissima de canto ferma'' ([[Rome]], 1553, and again at Venice, 1561), contains an introduction to music, a section on improvised [[counterpoint]], and his views on the three genera.

'''George Lawrence Mikan, Jr.''' (June 18, 1924&nbsp;– June 1, 2005), nicknamed '''Mr. Basketball''', was an American professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Chicago American Gears]] of the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) and the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Minneapolis Lakers]] of the NBL, the [[Basketball Association of America]] (BAA) and the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). Invariably playing with thick, round spectacles, the 6&nbsp;ft 10&nbsp;in 245&nbsp;lb. Mikan is seen as one of the pioneers of professional basketball, redefining it as a game of so-called [[center (basketball)|big men]] with his prolific [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]], [[Block (basketball)|shot blocking]] and his talent to shoot over smaller defenders with his [[ambidextrous]] [[hook shot]], result of his own [[Mikan Drill]].<ref name=nbacomsummary>{{cite web | last=nba.com | first= | title= George Mikan Bio | url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/mikan_bio.html | date=2007-02-23 |accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref>

Mikan had a successful player career, winning seven NBL, BAA, and NBA championships, an [[All-Star]] [[MVP]] trophy, and three scoring titles. He was a member of the first four NBA All-Star games, and the first six All-BAA and All-NBA Teams. Mikan was so dominant that he caused several rule changes in the NBA, among them widening the foul lane—known as the "Mikan Rule"—and introducing the [[shot clock]].<ref name=hoophall>{{cite web | last= hoophall.com | first= | title= George Mikan Biography | url= http://www.hoophall.com/halloffamers/Mikan.htm | date=2007-02-23 |accessdate=2008-02-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071101030146/http://www.hoophall.com/halloffamers/Mikan.htm |archivedate = November 1, 2007}}</ref>

After his playing career, Mikan became one of the founders of the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA), serving as commissioner of the league, and was also vital for the forming of the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]]. In his later years, Mikan was involved in a long-standing legal battle against the NBA, fighting to increase the meager [[pension]]s for players who had retired before the league became lucrative. In 2005, Mikan died after a long battle against [[diabetes]].<ref name=espnfirstdominator>{{cite web | last=espn.com | first= | title= Mikan was first pro to dominate the post | url= http://espn.go.com/classic/obit/s/2005/0602/2074322.html
 | date=2007-02-23 |accessdate=2008-02-16 }}</ref>

For his feats, Mikan was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 1959, made the 25th and 35th NBA Anniversary Teams of 1970 and 1980 and was elected one of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History|NBA 50 Greatest Players]] in 1996. Since April 2001, a statue of Mikan shooting his trademark hook shot graces the entrance of the Timberwolves' [[Target Center]].<ref name="hoophall"/>

==Early years==
George Mikan was born in [[Joliet, Illinois]], as an [[Croatian American|American of Croatian descent]]. As a boy, he shattered his knee so badly that he was kept in bed for a year and a half. In 1938, Mikan attended the [[Chicago]] [[Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary]] and originally wanted to be a [[priest]], but then moved back home to finish at Joliet Catholic.<ref name=csrjeffdavis>{{cite web | last=Davis | first=Jeff | title= The M and M boys | url=http://www.chicagosportsreview.com/inprint/contentview.asp?c=162722 | date=2007-02-23 |accessdate=2008-02-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070926225300/http://www.chicagosportsreview.com/inprint/contentview.asp?c=162722 |archivedate = September 26, 2007}}</ref> Mikan did not seem destined to become an athlete. When Mikan entered Chicago's [[DePaul University]] in 1942, he stood 6' 10",  weighed 245 pounds, moved awkwardly because of his frame, and wore thick glasses for his near-sightedness.<ref name=hickoksports>{{cite web | last=hickoksports.com | first= | title= Biography – George Mikan | url= http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/mikangeorge.shtml
 | date=2007-02-23 |accessdate=2008-02-16 }}</ref>

==DePaul University==
However, Mikan met 28-year-old rookie DePaul basketball coach [[Ray Meyer]], who saw potential in the bright and intelligent, but also clumsy and shy [[freshman]]. Put into perspective, Meyer's thoughts were revolutionary, because at the time it was believed that tall players were too awkward to ever play basketball well.<ref name=csrjeffdavis/> In the following months, Meyer transformed Mikan into a confident, aggressive player who took pride in his height rather than being ashamed of it. Meyer and Mikan worked out intensively, and Mikan learned how to make hook shots accurately with either hand. This routine would become later known as the [[Mikan Drill]].<ref name=hickoksports/> In addition, Meyer made Mikan punch a [[speed bag]], take dancing lessons and [[jump rope]] to make him a complete athlete.<ref name=espnfirstdominator/>
[[File:GeorgeMikan.jpg|thumb|left|175px|George Mikan in 1944, wearing his number 99 jersey]]

From his first [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) college games for DePaul on, Mikan dominated his peers. He intimidated opponents with his size and strength, was unstoppable on offense with his hook shot, and soon established a reputation as one of the hardest and grittiest players in the league, often playing through injury and punishing opposing centers with hard fouls.<ref name=csrjeffdavis/> In addition, Mikan also surprised the basketball world by his unique ability of [[goaltending]], i.e. jumping so high that he swatted the ball away before it could pass the hoop. In today's basketball, touching the ball after it reaches its [[apogee]] is forbidden, but in Mikan's time it was legal because people thought it was impossible anyone could reach that high. "We would set up a [[zone defense]] that had four men around the key and I guarded the basket," Mikan later recalled his DePaul days. "When the other team took a shot, I'd just go up and tap it out." As a consequence, the NCAA and later the NBA outlawed goaltending.<ref name=nbacomsummary/> One of the few opposing centers to have any success against Mikan was [[Bob Kurland]], a seven footer from [[Oklahoma State University–Stillwater|Oklahoma A&M]].<ref>Michael Schumacher. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=JiMUHHirvs0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22george+mikan%22+%22bob+kurland%22+rival&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DJo1T5ieC4H82gW1nOj-AQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=kurland&f=false Mr. Basketball: George Mikan, the Minneapolis Lakers, and the Birth of the NBA]''. University of Minnesota Press, 2008. 47.</ref>

Mikan was named the Helms NCAA College [[Helms Foundation Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] twice in 1944 and 1945 and an [[All-American]] three times, leading DePaul to the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] title in 1945, which was as prestigious as the NCAA tournament at the time.<ref name=reed>{{Cite book| last = Reed | first = Billy | title = Final Four | publisher = Host Communications | year = 1988 | page = 40| isbn = 0962013102}}</ref>  Mikan led the nation in scoring with 23.9 [[points per game]] in 1944–45 and 23.1 in 1945–46. When DePaul won the 1945 National Invitation Tournament, Mikan was named [[Most Valuable Player]] for scoring 120 points in three games, including 53 points in a 97–53 win over [[University of Rhode Island|Rhode Island]], equalling the score of the entire Rhode Island team.<ref name=hickoksports/>

==Professional player career==
[[File:George Mikan Chicago.jpeg|thumb|Mikan as member of the [[Chicago American Gears]]]]
===Chicago American Gears (1946–47)===
After the end of the 1945–46 college season, Mikan signed with the [[Chicago American Gears]] of the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]], a predecessor of the modern NBA. He played with them for 25 games in the end of the 1946-47 NBL season, scoring an impressive 16.5 points per game in his rookie games. Mikan led the Gears to the championship of the World Basketball Tournament. In the WBT, Mikan was elected Most Valuable Player after scoring 100 points in five games, and also voted into the All-NBL Team.<ref name=nbacomsummary/><ref name=hickoksports/>

However, before the start of the 1947–48 NBL season Maurice White, the president of the American Gear Company and the owner of the American Gears NBL team, pulled the team out of the league. White planned to create a 24-team league called the [[Professional Basketball League of America]], in which he owned all the teams and arenas. However, the PBLA folded after just a month, and the players of White's teams were equally distributed among the 11 remaining NBL [[professional sports league organization|franchises]]. As a consequence, every team had a 9.09% chance of landing the basketball prodigy Mikan, who ended up on the Minneapolis Lakers playing for coach [[John Kundla]].<ref name=nbacomsummary/>

===Minneapolis Lakers (1947–56)===
In his first season with the Lakers, Mikan led the league in scoring with 1,195 points, becoming the first and only NBL player to score more than 1,000 points in an NBL season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/nbl/leaders/pts_season.html |title=NBL Single Season Leaders and Records for Points |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref>  He was named the league MVP, and the Lakers won the NBL title.  

The following year, the Lakers and three other NBL franchises jumped to the fledgling [[Basketball Association of America]].  Mikan led his new league in scoring, and again set a single-season scoring record.  The Lakers defeated the [[Washington Capitols]] in the [[1949 BAA Finals]].

In 1949, the BAA and NBL merged to form the NBA. The new league started the inaugural [[1949–50 NBA season]] with 17 teams, with the Lakers in the [[Central Division (NBA)|Central Division]]. Mikan again was dominant, averaging 27.4 points per game and 2.9 assists per game and taking another scoring title;<ref name=stats>{{cite web | last=basketball-reference.com | first= | title= George Mikan Statistics | url= http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mikange01.html| date=2007-02-23 |accessdate=2008-02-16 }}</ref> only [[Alex Groza]] of Indianapolis also broke the 20-point-barrier that year.<ref name=nbacomsummary/> After comfortably leading his team to an impressive 51–17 record and storming through [[1950 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]], Mikan's team played the [[1950 NBA Finals]] against the [[Syracuse Nationals]]. In Game 1, the Lakers beat Syracuse on their home court when Lakers reserve [[guard (basketball)|guard]] [[Bob Harrison (basketball)|Bob Harrison]] hit a 40-foot [[buzzer beater]] to give Minneapolis a two-point win. The team split the next four games, and in Game 6, the Lakers won 110–95 and won the first-ever NBA championship. Mikan scored 31.3 points per game in the playoffs.<ref name=nbacomsummary/>

In the [[1950–51 NBA season]], Mikan was dominant again, scoring a career-best 28.4 points per game in the regular season, again taking the scoring crown, and had 3.1 assists per game.<ref name=stats/> In that year, the NBA introduced a new statistic: [[Rebound (basketball)|rebound]]s. In this category, the 6-foot-10 Mikan also stood out, his 14.1 [[rebounds per game]] (rpg) only second to the 16.4 rpg of Dolph Schayes of Syracuse.<ref name=stats/> In that year, Mikan participated in one of the most notorious NBA games ever played. When the [[Fort Wayne Pistons]] played against his Lakers, the Pistons took a 19–18 lead. Afraid that Mikan would mount a comeback if he got the ball, the Pistons passed the ball around without any attempt to score a basket.<ref name=pioneerdies>{{cite news | last=usatoday.com | first= | title= NBA pioneer and Hall of Famer Mikan dies | url= http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2005-06-02-mikan-obit_x.htm
 | date=2007-02-23 |accessdate=2008-02-16 | work=USA Today}}</ref> With no shot clock invented yet to force them into offense, the score stayed 19–18 to make it the lowest-scoring NBA game of all time. This game was an important factor in the development of the shot clock, which was introduced four years later. Mikan had scored 15 of the Lakers' 18 points, thus scoring 83.3% of his team's points, setting an NBA all-time record which will probably never be broken.<ref name=pioneerdies/> In the post season, Mikan fractured his leg before the 1951 Western Division Finals against the Rochester Royals. With Mikan hardly able to move all series long, the Royals won 3–1. Decades later, in 1990, Mikan recalled that his leg was taped with a plate; however despite effectively hopping around the court on one foot, he said he still averaged 20-odd points per game.<ref name=nbacomsummary/>

In the [[1951–52 NBA season]], the NBA decided to widen the foul lane under the basket from 6 feet to 12 feet. As players could only stay in the lane for three seconds at a time, it forced big men like Mikan to play post from double the distance.<ref name=nbacomsummary/> A main proponent of this rule was New York Knicks coach [[Joe Lapchick]], who regarded Mikan as his nemesis, and it was dubbed "The Mikan Rule".<ref name=mikanvsknicks>{{cite web | last=McPeek | first=Jeramie | title= George Mikan vs. The Knicks | url=http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/finals/Mikan_v_Knicks.html
 | date=2007-02-23 |accessdate=2008-02-16 }}</ref> While Mikan still scored an impressive 23.8 points per game, it was a serious reduction from his 27.4 points per game the previous season, and his [[field goal percentage]] sank from .428 to .385. He still pulled down 13.5 rebounds per game, asserting himself as a top rebounder, and logged 3.0 assists per game.<ref name=stats/> Mikan also had a truly dominating game that season, in which he scored a personal-best 61 points in a double overtime victory against the Rochester Royals. At the time it was the second-best performance in league history (to Joe Fulks' 63 point score in 1949), and Mikan's output more than doubled that of his teammates, whose output that game totaled 30 points. In the [[1952 NBA All-Star Game]], Mikan had a strong performance with 26 points and 15 rebounds in a West loss. Later that season, the Lakers reached the [[1952 NBA Finals]] and were pitted against the New York Knicks. This qualified as one of the strangest Finals series in NBA history, as neither team could play on their home court in the first six games. The Lakers' Minneapolis Auditorium was already booked, and the Knicks' Madison Square Garden was occupied by the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]]. Instead, the Lakers played in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] and the Knicks in the damp, dimly lit [[69th Regiment Armory]]. Perpetually [[double team|double-teamed]] by Knicks' [[Nat Clifton]] and [[Harry Gallatin]], Mikan was unable to assert himself and it was more Vern Mikkelsen's credit that the first six games were split. In the only true home game, Game 7 in the Auditorium, the Lakers won 82–65 and edged the Knicks 4–3, winning the NBA title and earning themselves $7,500 to split among the team.<ref name=mikanvsknicks/>

During the [[1952–53 NBA season]], Mikan averaged 20.6 points and a career-high 14.4 rebounds per game, the highest in the league, as well as 2.9 assists per game.<ref name=stats/> In the [[1953 NBA All-Star Game]], Mikan was dominant again with 22 points and 16 rebounds, winning that game's MVP Award. The Lakers made the [[1953 NBA Finals]], and again defeated the Knicks with 4–1.<ref name=nbacomsummary/>

In the [[1953–54 NBA season]], the now 29-year-old Mikan slowly declined, averaging 18.1 points, 14.3 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game.<ref name=stats/> Under his leadership, the Lakers won another NBA title in the [[1954 NBA Finals]], making it their third championship en bloc and the fifth in six years; the only time they lost had been when Mikan fractured his leg. From an NBA perspective, the Minneapolis Lakers dynasty has only been convincingly surpassed by the eleven-title Boston Celtics dynasty of 1957–69.<ref name=nbacomsummary/> At the end of the season, Mikan announced his retirement. He later said: "I had a family growing, and I decided to be with them. I felt it was time to get started with the professional world outside of basketball." Injuries also were a factor, as Mikan had sustained 10 broken bones and 16 stitches in his career, often having to play through these injuries.<ref name=nbacomsummary/> 

Without Mikan, the Lakers [[1955 NBA Playoffs|made the playoffs]], but were unable to reach the [[1955 NBA Finals]]. In the middle of the [[1955-56 NBA season]], Mikan returned to the Lakers lineup. He played in 37 games, but however, his long absence had affected his play. He averaged only 10.5 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.3 assists,<ref name=stats/> and the Lakers lost in the [[1956 NBA Playoffs|first playoff round]]. At the end of the season, Mikan retired for good.  His 10,156 points were then a career record; he was the first NBA player to score 10,000 points in a career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_progress.html |title=NBA & ABA Progressive Leaders and Records for Points |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref>  He was inducted into the inaugural Basketball Hall of Fame class of 1959 and was declared the greatest player of the first half of the century by [[The Associated Press]].<ref name=nbacomsummary/>

==Post-playing career==
In 1956 Mikan was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for the [[United States Congress]] in Minnesota's 3rd congressional district. He challenged incumbent Representative [[Roy Wier]] in a closely fought race that featured a high voter turnout. Despite the reelection of incumbent Republican President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], the inexperienced Mikan lost by a close margin of 52% to 48%. Wier received 127,356 votes to Mikan's 117,716. Returning to the legal profession, Mikan was frustrated, after hoping for an influx of work. For six months, Mikan did not get any assignments at all, leaving him in financial difficulties that forced him to cash in on his life insurance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minnesotamonthly.com/media/Minnesota-Monthly/November-2006/Blocked-Shot/|title=Blocked Shot|first=Jack|last=El-Hai|date=2007-04-17 |accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref>

Problems also arose in Mikan's professional sports career. In the [[1957-58 NBA season]], Lakers coach John Kundla became [[general manager]] and persuaded Mikan to become coach of the Lakers. However, this was a failure, the Lakers enduring 9–30 record until Mikan stepped down and returned coaching duties to Kundla. The Lakers ended with a 19–53 record, to record one of the worst seasons in their history.<ref name=nbacomsummary/> After this failure, Mikan then concentrated on his law career, raising his large family of six children, successfully specializing in [[corporate law|corporate]] and [[real estate law]], and buying and renovating buildings in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]].<ref name=nbacomsummary/>

In 1967, Mikan returned to professional basketball, becoming the first [[commissioner#Sports|commissioner]] of the American Basketball Association, a rival league to the NBA. In order to lure basketball fans to his league, Mikan invented the league's characteristic red-white-and-blue ABA ball, which he thought more patriotic, better suited for TV, and more crowd-pleasing than the brown NBA ball,<ref name=nbacomsummary/> and instituted the [[Three-point field goal|three-point line]]. Mikan resigned from the ABA in 1969.

In the mid-1980s, Mikan headed a task force with the goal to return professional basketball to Minneapolis, decades after the Lakers had moved to [[Los Angeles]] to become the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and after the ABA's [[Minnesota Muskies]] and [[Minnesota Pipers]] had departed. This bid was successful, leading to the inception of a new franchise in the [[1989-90 NBA season]], the Minnesota Timberwolves.<ref name=nbacomsummary/>

In 1994, Mikan became the part-owner and chairman of the board of [[Chicago Cheetahs]], a professional [[roller hockey]] team based in [[Chicago, Illinois]] that played in [[Roller Hockey International]]. The franchise folded after their second season.

In his later years, Mikan suffered from [[diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]] and failing kidneys, and eventually, his illness caused his right leg to be amputated below the knee. When his medical insurance was cut off, Mikan soon found himself in severe financial difficulties.<ref name=csrjeffdavis/> He fought a long and protracted legal battle against the NBA and the NBA Players' Union, protesting the $1,700/month pensions for players who had retired before 1965, the start of the so-called "big money era". According to Mel Davis of the National Basketball Retired Players Union, this battle kept him going, because Mikan hoped to be alive when a new [[collective bargaining agreement]] would finally vindicate his generation. In 2005, however, his condition declined.<ref name=espnfirstdominator/><ref name=pioneerdies/>

==Legacy==
Mikan is lauded as the pioneer of Modern Age basketball. He was the original center, who scored 11,764 points, an average of 22.6 per game, retired as the all-time leading scorer and averaged 13.4 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 520 NBL, BAA and NBA games. As a testament to his fierce playing style, he also led the league three times in personal fouls.<ref name=hoophall/><ref name=hickoksports/>  He won seven NBL, BAA, and NBA championships, an All-Star MVP trophy, and three scoring titles, and was a member of the first four NBA All-Star games and the first six All-BAA and [[All-NBA Team]]s. As well as being declared the greatest player of the first half of the century by The Associated Press, Mikan was on the [[Helms Athletic Foundation]] all-time All-American team, chosen in a 1952 poll, was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959, made the 25th and 35th NBA Anniversary Teams of 1970 and 1980 and was elected one of the [[NBA 50 Greatest Players]] in 1996.<ref name=nbacomsummary/><ref name=hoophall/><ref name=hickoksports/> Mikan's impact on the game is also reflected in the Mikan Drill, today a staple exercise of "big men" in basketball.

When superstar center [[Shaquille O'Neal]] became a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' graced its November 1996 issue with Mikan, O'Neal and fellow Lakers legend [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], calling Abdul-Jabbar and Mikan the "Lakers legends" to whom O'Neal was compared. Since April 2001, a statue of Mikan shooting his trademark hook shot graces the entrance of the Minnesota Timberwolves' [[Target Center]].<ref name=hoophall/> In addition, a banner in the [[Staples Center]] commemorates Mikan and his fellow Minneapolis Lakers. He is also honored by a statue and an appearance on a mural in his hometown of [[Joliet, Illinois]].

===Rule changes===
Mikan became so dominant that the NBA had to change its rules of play in order to reduce his influence such as widening the lane from six to twelve feet ("The Mikan Rule"). He also played a role in the introduction of the shot clock, and in the NCAA his dominating play around the basket led to the outlawing of defensive goaltending. Mikan was a harbinger of the NBA's future, which would be dominated by tall, powerful players.<ref name=nbacomsummary/><ref name=hoophall/>

As an official, Mikan is also directly responsible for the ABA three-point line, which was later adopted by the NBA, the multi-colored ABA ball, which still lives on as the "money ball" in the NBA All-Star Three Point Shootout,<ref>Scoring with this ball brings two shootout points instead of one</ref> and the existence of the Minnesota Timberwolves.<ref name=nbacomsummary/>

==Personal life==
In 1947, he married his girlfriend Patricia, who remained his wife the next 58 years until he died. Mikan fathered six children, sons [[Larry Mikan|Larry]] (George Lawrence Mikan III), Terry, Patrick and Michael and daughters Trisha and Maureen.<ref name=pioneerdies/> All his life, Mikan was universally seen as the prototypical "gentle giant", tough and relentless on the court, but friendly and amicable in private life.<ref name=pioneerdies/> He was also the older brother of [[Ed Mikan]], another basketball player for both DePaul and the [[Basketball Association of America|BAA]].

===Death===
Mikan died in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] on June 1, 2005, of complications from diabetes and other ailments. His son Terry reported that his father had undergone [[dialysis]] three times a week four hours a day for the last five years.<ref name=espnfirstdominator/><ref name=pioneerdies/> He was interred at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis. 

Mikan's death was widely mourned by the basketball world,<ref name=espnfirstdominator/> and also brought media attention to the financial struggles of several early-era NBA players. Many commentators felt that the current players of the big-money generation should rally for larger pensions for the pre-1965 predecessors in upcoming labor negotiations.<ref name=lakersplayer>{{cite web | last= lakersplayer.com | first= | title= George Mikan | url= http://www.lakersplayers.org/george-mikan.php | date=2007-02-23 |accessdate=2008-02-16 }}</ref>  [[Shaquille O'Neal]] offered to pay for Mikan's funeral. He said: "Without number 99 [Mikan], there is no me."<ref name=lakersplayer/> Before [[2005 NBA Playoffs|Game 5 of the 2005 Eastern Conference Finals]] between the Heat and the [[Detroit Pistons]], there was a moment of silence to honor Mikan. [[Bob Cousy]] remarked that Mikan figuratively carried the NBA in the early days and single-handedly made the league credible and popular.<ref name=espnfirstdominator/>

The '''''Syllabus of Errors''''' ({{lang-la|'''Syllabus Errorum'''}}) was a document issued by [[Holy See]] under [[Pope Pius IX]] on December 8, 1864, [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]], on the same day as the Pope's [[encyclical]] ''[[Quanta Cura]]''.

== Format ==
The Syllabus was made up of phrases and paraphrases from earlier papal documents, along with index references to them, and presented as a list of "condemned propositions".  For instance, in condemning proposition 14, "Philosophy is to be treated without taking any account of supernatural revelation", the Syllabus asserts the truth of the contrary proposition—that philosophy should take account of supernatural revelation.  The Syllabus does not explain why each particular proposition is wrong, but it cites earlier documents to which the reader can refer for the [[Pope]]'s reasons for saying each proposition is false.  With the exception of some propositions drawn from Pius' encyclical ''[[Qui pluribus]]'' of November 9, 1846, all the propositions were based on documents that postdated the shocks to the Pope and the [[papacy]] of the [[Revolutions of 1848]] (see [[Italian unification]]).

The Syllabus was divided into ten sections which condemned as false various statements about these topics:

* [[pantheism]], [[philosophical naturalism|naturalism]], and absolute [[rationalism]], Propositions 1–7;
* moderate rationalism, Propositions 8–14;
* [[indifferentism]] and [[Latitudinarian|latitudinarianism]], Propositions 15–18;
* [[socialism]], [[communism]], [[secret society|secret societies]], [[Bible Society|Bible societies]], and liberal [[clergy|cleric]]al societies, a general condemnation;
* the [[Christian Church|church]] and its rights, Propositions 19–38 (defending temporal power in the [[Papal States]], which were overthrown six years later);
* civil society and its relationship to the church, Propositions 39–55;
* natural and Christian [[ethics]], Propositions 56–64;
* [[Christian]] [[marriage]], Propositions 65–74;
* the [[Temporal power (Papal)|civil power]] of the sovereign Pontiff in the [[Papal States]], Propositions 75–76 and
* modern [[liberalism]], Propositions 77–80.

===Some statements of condemnation===
Statements the encyclical condemned as false include the following:

*"Human reason, without any reference whatsoever to God, is the sole arbiter of truth and falsehood, and of good and evil." (No. 3)
*"All the truths of religion proceed from the innate strength of human reason; hence reason is the ultimate standard by which man can and ought to arrive at the knowledge of all truths of every kind." (No. 4)
*"In the present day it is no longer expedient that the Catholic religion should be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other forms of worship." (No. 77)
*"Protestantism is nothing more than another form of the same true Christian religion, in which form it is given to please God equally as in the Catholic Church." (No. 18).
*"The Church ought to be separated from the State, and the State from the Church." (No. 55)
*"Every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light of reason, he shall consider true." (No. 15) and that "It has been wisely decided by law, in some Catholic countries, that persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public exercise of their own peculiar worship." (No. 78)
*"The Roman Pontiff can, and ought to, reconcile himself, and come to terms with, progress, liberalism and modern civilization." (No. 80) (cf [[Jamdudum cernimus]])

==Reactions==
===Non-Catholics===
Within the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] world, reactions were uniformly negative.  In 1874 the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[William Ewart Gladstone]] published a tract entitled ''The Vatican Decrees in their bearing on Civil Allegiance: A Political Expostulation'', in which he said that after the Syllabus:

:. . . no one can now become (Rome's) convert without renouncing his moral and mental freedom, and placing his civil loyalty and duty at the mercy of another.

The government of [[France]] briefly tried to suppress the circulation of the encyclical and the ''Syllabus'' within its borders; it forbade priests to explain the Syllabus from the pulpit, though newspapers were allowed to discuss it from a [[secular]] point of view.

===Catholics===
The document met with a mixed reception among Catholics; many accepted it wholeheartedly, others wanted a clarification of some points, and still others were as shocked as their Protestant neighbors by the apparent broad scope of the condemnations.

Catholic [[Apologetics|apologists]] such as [[Félix Dupanloup]] and [[John Henry Newman|Blessed John Henry Newman]] said that the ''Syllabus'' was widely misinterpreted by readers who did not have access to or did not bother to check the original documents of which it was a summary.  The propositions listed had been condemned as erroneous opinions ''in the sense and context in which they originally occurred''; without the original context, the document appeared to condemn a larger range of ideas than it actually did.  Thus it was asserted that no critical response to the ''Syllabus'' which did not take the cited documents and their context into account could be valid (Newman 1874).  Newman writes:<ref>[[Francis A. Sullivan]], ''Creative Fidelity'', ISBN 0-8091-3644-9, p. 143.</ref>
<blockquote>
The Syllabus then has no dogmatic force; it addresses us, not in its separate portions, but as a whole, and is to be received from the Pope by an act of obedience, not of faith, that obedience being shown by having recourse to the original and authoritative documents, (Allocutions and the like,) to which the Syllabus pointedly refers.  Moreover, when we turn to those documents, which are authoritative, we find the Syllabus cannot even be called an echo of the Apostolic Voice; for, in matters in which wording is so important, it is not an exact transcript of the words of the Pope, in its account of the errors condemned, just as would be natural in what is an index for reference.
</blockquote>

In the wake of the controversy following the document's release, Pius IX referred to it as "raw meat needing to be cooked." However, others within the church who supported the syllabus disagreed that there was any misinterpretation of the condemnations.

==Sources cited==
The Syllabus cited a number of previous documents that had been written during Pius' papacy. These include : [[Qui Pluribus]], [[Maxima quidem]], [[Singulari quadam]], [[Tuas libenter]], [[Multiplices inter]], [[Quanto conficiamur]], [[Noscitis]], [[Nostis et nobiscum]], [[Meminit unusquisque]], [[Ad Apostolicae]], [[Nunquam fore]], [[Incredibili]], [[Acerbissimum]], [[Singularis nobisque]], [[Multis gravibusque]], [[Quibus quantisque]], [[Quibus luctuosissimis]], [[In consistoriali]], [[Cum non sine]], [[Cum saepe]], [[Quanto conficiamur]], [[Jamdudum cernimus]], [[Novos et ante]], [[Quibusque vestrum]] and [[Cum Catholica]].

==Subsequent history==

Further thoughts in the same vein were expressed in Pius' encyclical of 21 November 1873, ''[[Etsi multa]]'' ("On the Church in Italy, Germany, and Switzerland"), which is often appended to the ''Syllabus.''  There Pius condemned contemporary liberalizing anti-clerical legislation in [[History of South America|South America]] as "a ferocious war on the Church."

In 1907 [[Lamentabili Sane]] was promulgated, a "''Syllabus condemning the errors of the Modernists''", being a list of errors that might be made by scholars engaged in [[biblical criticism]].<ref>[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius10/p10lamen.htm Lamentabili Sane text 1907]</ref>

Some think that the political or [[dogma]]tic propositions of the Syllabus may be abrogated by later documents coming from the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1962.  Others argue that this view results from an excessively broad interpretation of statements that had a narrower sense in their original context, and from contrasting the [[Infallibility of the Church|infallible]] documents of the ecumenical council with papal statements that were not infallible because they were not addressed to the whole church.

English historian E.E.Y. Hales argues that:
{{quote|[T]he Pope is not concerned with a universal principle, but with the position in a particular state at a particular date.  He is expressing his "wonder and distress" (no more) that in a Catholic country (Spain) it should be proposed to disestablish the Church and to place any and every religion upon a precisely equal footing. ... Disestablishment and toleration were far from the normal practice of the day, whether in Protestant or in Catholic states.  <ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Hales | first1 = E.E.Y.   | title = THE CATHOLIC CHURCH in the MODERN WORLD: A Survey from the French Revolution to the Present | publisher = Doubleday  | year= 1958}}</ref>}}

'''''Zoolander''''' is a 2001 American [[comedy film]] directed by and starring [[Ben Stiller]]. The film contains elements from a pair of short films directed by Russell Bates and written by [[Drake Sather]] and Stiller for the ''[[VH1]] Fashion Awards'' television specials in 1996 and 1997. The short films and the film itself feature a dimwitted male [[model (person)|model]] named Derek Zoolander (a play on the names of Dutch model [[Mark Vanderloo]] and American model Johnny Zander), played by Stiller. The film involves Zoolander becoming a pawn in a plot to assassinate the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] by corrupt fashion executives.

==Plot==
The dim-witted but good-natured Derek Zoolander ([[Ben Stiller]]) is ousted as the top male fashion model by the rising star, Hansel McDonald ([[Owen Wilson]]), and his reputation is further tarnished by a critical article from journalist Matilda Jeffries ([[Christine Taylor]]). After his three roommates and colleagues are killed in a "freak gasoline-fight accident", Derek announces his retirement from modeling and attempts to reconnect with his father Larry ([[Jon Voight]]) and brothers Luke ([[Vince Vaughn]]) and Scrappy ([[Judah Friedlander]]) by helping in the coal mines. Derek's delicate methods make him an impractical miner, and his family rejects him.

Meanwhile, fashion mogul Jacobim Mugatu ([[Will Ferrell]]) and Derek's model agent Maury Ballstein ([[Jerry Stiller]]) are charged by the fashion industry to find a model who can be [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]] into assassinating the new progressive-leaning [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], allowing them to retain cheap [[child labor]] in the country. Though Mugatu has previously refused to work with Derek for any show, Derek accepts Mugatu's offer to star in the next [[Fashion show|runway show]]. Mugatu takes Derek to his headquarters, masked as a [[day spa]], where Derek is [[Pavlovian reflex|conditioned]] to attempt the assassination when the song "[[Relax (song)|Relax]]" by [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] is played. Matilda, who felt partially responsible for Derek's retirement, is suspicious of Mugatu's offer, and tipped off by an anonymous caller, tries to enter the spa, but is thrown out. Matilda tries to voice her concerns to Derek once he leaves, but he ignores her.

Matilda follows Derek to a pre-runway party, where, upon being challenged by Hansel, Derek loses to Hansel in a "walk-off" judged by [[David Bowie]]. Matilda receives another anonymous call to meet at a nearby cemetery. Matilda along with Derek find the anonymous caller is [[hand model]] J.P. Prewett ([[David Duchovny]]), who explains that the fashion industry has been behind several political assassinations, and the brainwashed models are soon killed after they have completed their task (J.P. escaped because he himself is a hand model and so is smarter than the "face and body boys" like Derek.) Before J.P. can explain more, Katinka ([[Milla Jovovich]]), Mugatu's tough henchwoman, and her aides attack the group, forcing Derek and Matilda to flee.  They decide to go to Hansel's home, the last place they believe Mugatu will think to look, and Derek, Hansel, and Matilda bond. Matilda admits the reason she hates models is because, as a child, she was bullied for being overweight and developed [[bulimia]], and she believes models hurt people's self-esteem. Derek and Hansel resolve their differences while partaking of Hansel's collection of narcotics and participating in group sex with Matilda and others. While recovering, Derek also finds that he is falling in love with Matilda. Derek and Hansel break into Maury's offices to find evidence of the assassination plot, but cannot operate his computer to find them. Derek leaves for the show, Hansel following later with the computer in hand, believing that, as told to him by Matilda, "the files are in the computer".

Matilda tries to intercept Derek before the show, but Katinka thwarts her attempt. As Derek takes the runway, Mugatu's [[disc jockey]] starts playing "Relax", activating Derek's mental programming. Before Derek can reach the Prime Minister, Hansel breaks into the DJ booth, and switches the music to [[Herbie Hancock]]'s "[[Rockit]]", breaking Derek's conditioning. Hansel and the DJ have a brief "breakdance" fight before Hansel eventually unplugs the system, moments before Derek was about to snap the Prime Minister's neck. Mugatu attempts to cover up the incident, but Hansel offers Maury's computer as evidence, smashing it to the ground which he believes would release the incriminating files. Though the evidence is destroyed, Maury steps forward and reveals he had backed up the files, and offers to turn over the evidence of the assassination plot after years of guilt for his complicity in the conspiracy. Mugatu attempts to kill the Prime Minister himself by throwing a [[shuriken]], but Derek stops him by unleashing his ultimate model look, "Magnum", that stuns everyone and causes the shuriken to freeze in the air in front of Derek's face and fall harmlessly to the ground. At Derek's hometown, Larry is watching the event on TV, and proudly acknowledges Derek as his son. Mugatu is arrested, and Derek is thanked by the Prime Minister.

In the film's [[dénouement]], Derek, Hansel, and Maury have left the fashion industry to start "The Derek Zoolander Center for Kids Who Can't Read Good and Wanna Learn to Do Other Stuff Good Too". Derek and Matilda are shown as now having a son named Derek Zoolander, Jr., who has already developed his first modeling look.

==Derelicte==
"Derelicte" is the name given to the fashion line designed by Will Ferrell's character Mugatu and is a parody of a real fashion line created by [[John Galliano]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://onthemedia.org/transcripts/2008/02/01/08 | title=Political Threads | publisher=[[On The Media]] | date=2008-02-01 }}</ref> It is described by Mugatu in the film as "a fashion, a way of life inspired by the very homeless, the vagrants, the crack whores that make this wonderful city so unique."  The fashion line in the film consists of clothing made from everyday objects that could be found on the streets of New York; Galliano used clothing worn by the destitute as an inspiration for a real-life fashion line in 2000.

== Censorship ==
The film was never shown in Malaysia, the country mentioned in the film, as it is depicted as impoverished and dependent on [[sweatshop]]s. Malaysia's censorship board deemed it "definitely unsuitable".<ref>{{cite news | title = Zoolander faces Malaysian censorship controversy | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/censorship/news/0,11729,661800,00.html | date = 28 September 2001 | publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]]}}</ref> The film was also banned in neighboring [[Singapore]]<ref>{{cite news | title = Singapore bans US comedy film | date = 8 February 2002 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1809357.stm | publisher = BBC News}}</ref> due to [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] sensitivities and the movie's excessive [[Recreational drugs|drug]] use.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} It was subsequently made available in Singapore in 2006,<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] | title = Release dates for Zoolander (2001) | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196229/releaseinfo}}</ref> with the R rating. In the U.S., the film was originally rated R but was later re-rated PG-13 on appeal for sexual content, [[profanity]], and drug references.

In the Asian release, all references to the country of Malaysia were changed to [[Micronesia]], the subregion which Hansel mistook for Malaysia at one point in the western version.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In the United States, since the movie was released on September 28, 2001 (about 2 weeks after the [[September 11, 2001]]  attacks on the [[World Trade Center]]), Stiller made the executive decision to digitally remove any backgrounds that originally contained the Twin Towers in the background skyline. Stiller defended his decision to erase images of New York's World Trade Center Towers from the film, saying he did what he thought was appropriate at the time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Twin Towers Removed From Zoolander Film|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2001-10-30/news/0110300058_1_chocolate-factory-children-s-aid-society-crimes|work=Sun Sentinel|publisher=Sun Sentinel|accessdate=30 October 2001}}</ref>

In January 2011, Ben Stiller confirmed that the script has been completed though confirmation of the film depends on the studios.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=29894 |title=Ben Stiller Talks Submarine &#124; Movie News &#124; Empire |publisher=Empireonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref>  Stiller commented on the plot of the sequel,<blockquote>
It’s ten years later and most of it is set in Europe... it’s basically Derek and Hansel... though the last movie ended on a happy note a lot of things have happened in the meantime. Their lives have changed and they’re not really relevant anymore. It’s a new world for them. Will Ferrell is written into the script and he’s expressed interest in doing it. I think Mugatu is an integral part of the Zoolander story, so yes, he features in a big way.”</blockquote>

In September 2014 [[Will Ferrell]] said, "We are actually supposed to do a read-through of a sequel script soon, and Mugatu is a part of it." [[Ben Stiller]] had previously stated that they were taking their time because they wanted to get it right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/09/17/will-ferrell-expecting-read-through-of-zoolander-2-script-soon}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nypost.com/2014/09/15/will-ferrell-says-mugatu-will-appear-in-zoolander-2/}}</ref>

{{Spanish name 2|Hughes|Galeano}}
'''Eduardo Hughes Galeano''' (born 3 September 1940) is a [[Uruguay]]an journalist, writer and novelist. His best-known works are ''Las venas abiertas de América Latina'' ([[Open Veins of Latin America]], 1971) and ''Memoria del fuego'' (Memory of Fire Trilogy, 1976), which have both been translated into 20 languages and transcend orthodox genres: combining journalism, political analysis, and history. The author himself has proclaimed his obsession as a writer saying, "I'm a writer obsessed with remembering, with remembering the past of America and above all that of [[Latin America]], intimate land condemned to [[amnesia]]."<ref>[http://www.octopusbooks.org/content/mark-your-calendars Mark your calendars......] Octopus Books</ref>

==Life==
Galeano was born in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay.

He started his career as a journalist in the early 1960s as editor of ''[[Marcha (newspaper)|Marcha]]'', an influential weekly journal which had such contributors as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Mario Benedetti]], Manuel Maldonado Denis and [[Roberto Fernández Retamar]]. For two years he edited the daily ''Época'' and worked as editor-in-chief of the University Press. In 1962, having divorced, he remarried to Graciela Berro.

In 1973, a [[1973 Uruguayan coup d'état|military coup]] took power in Uruguay; Galeano was imprisoned and later was forced to flee. His book [[Open Veins of Latin America]] was banned by the right-wing military government, not only in Uruguay, but also in [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]].<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2009/5/28/eduardo Fresh Off Worldwide Attention for Joining Obama’s Book Collection, Uruguayan Author Eduardo Galeano Returns with "Mirrors: Stories of Almost Everyone"].</ref> He settled in Argentina where he founded the cultural magazine, ''Crisis''. In 1976 he married for the third time to Helena Villagra; however, in the same year, the [[Jorge Rafael Videla|Videla]] regime took power in Argentina in a [[1976 Argentine coup d'état|bloody military coup]] and his name was added to the lists of those condemned by the death squads. He fled again, this time to Spain, where he wrote his famous trilogy: ''Memoria del fuego'' (''Memory of Fire'').
[[File:Eduardo Galeano en 1984.jpg|thumb|Galeano in 1984]]

At the beginning of 1985 Galeano returned to Montevideo, where he continues to live. Following the victory of [[Tabaré Vázquez]] and the [[Broad Front - Progressive Encounter - New Majority|Broad Front]] alliance in the [[2004 Uruguay Presidential and Parliamentary Elections|2004 Uruguayan elections]] marking the first left-wing government in Uruguayan history Galeano wrote a piece for ''[[The Progressive]]'' titled "Where the People Voted Against Fear" in which Galeano showed support for the new government and concluded that the Uruguayan populace used "common sense" and were "tired of being cheated" by the traditional [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado]] and [[National Party (Uruguay)|Blanco]] parties.<ref>Eduardo Galeano, [http://progressive.org/node/340 "Where the People Voted Against Fear"] January 2005 ''[[The Progressive]]''</ref> Following the creation of [[TeleSUR]], a pan-Latin American television station based in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], in 2005 Galeano along with other left-wing intellectuals such as [[Tariq Ali]] and [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel]] joined the network's 36 member advisory committee.<ref>Alfonso Daniels, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1535981,00.html "'Chavez TV' beams into South America"] 26 July 2005 ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>

In 2006, Galeano signed a petition in support of the independence of [[Puerto Rico]] from the United States of America.

On 10 February 2007, Galeano underwent a successful operation to treat [[lung cancer]].<ref>[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cultura/51494.html ''Eduardo Galeano se recupera de operación''] [[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]], 11 February 2007 {{es icon}}</ref> During an interview with journalist [[Amy Goodman]] following [[Barack Obama]]'s election as President of the United States in November 2008, Galeano said, "The [[White House]] will be Barack Obama's house in the time coming, but this White House was built by black slaves. And I’d like, I hope, that he never, never forgets this".<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2008/11/5/uruguayan_writer_eduardo_galeano_on_barack Interview with Amy Goodman] on ''[[Democracy Now!]],'' 5 November 2008 (video, audio, and print transcript)</ref> At the 17 April 2009, opening session of the [[5th Summit of the Americas]] held in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Venezuela]]n President [[Hugo Chavez]] gave a copy of Galeano's ''[[Open Veins of Latin America]]'' to U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], who was making his first diplomatic visit to the region.<ref>[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/28/obama-fields-press-gifts-in-first-100-days/?page=all The Washington Times]</ref> This made the English language edition of the book go to No. 2 position and the Spanish version to No. 11 on the [[Amazon.com]] bestseller list.

In a May 2009 interview he spoke about his past and recent works, some of which deal with the relationships between freedom and slavery, and democracies and dictatorships: "not only the United States, also some European countries, have spread military dictatorships all over the world. And they feel as if they are able to teach democracy". He also talked about how and why he has changed his writing style, and his recent rise in popularity.<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2009/5/28/eduardo Audio and transcript of interview, May 2009]</ref>

In April 2014 Galeano gave an interview at the ''II Bienal Brasil do Livro e da Leitura'' in which he regretted some aspects of writing ''Las Venas Abiertas de América Latina'', saying "Time has passed, I've begun to try other things, to bring myself closer to human reality in general and to political economy specifically. 'The Open Veins' tried to be a political economy book, but I simply didn't have the necessary education. I do not regret writing it, but it is a stage that I have since passed."<ref>[http://www.soundsandcolours.com/articles/uruguay/eduardo-galeano-acknowledges-the-weaknesses-of-the-open-veins-of-latin-america-five-centuries-of-the-pillage-of-a-continent/ Sounds and Colours]</ref> This interview was picked up by many critics of Galeano's work in which they used the statement to reinforce their own criticisms.

But good luck doesn’t rain down, yesterday, today, tomorrow or ever. Good luck doesn’t even fall in a fine drizzle, no matter how hard the nobodies summon it, even if their left hand is tickling, or if they begin the new day on their right foot, or start the new year with a change of brooms. The nobodies: nobody’s children, owners of nothing. The nobodies: the no-ones, the nobodied, running like rabbits, dying through life, screwed every which way. Who are not, but could be. Who don’t speak languages, but dialects. Who don’t have religions, but superstitions. Who don’t create art, but handicrafts. Who don’t have culture, but folklore. Who are not human beings, but human resources. Who do not have faces, but arms. Who do not have names, but numbers. Who do not appear in the history of the world, but in the crime reports of the local paper. The nobodies, who are not worth the bullet that kills them."| Eduardo Galeano, ''"The Nobodies"''<ref>''Pathologies of Power: Health, Human Rights, and the New War on the Poor'', by Paul Farmer, University of California Press, ISBN 0-520-24326-9, pg 1</ref>}}

''[[Open Veins of Latin America|Las venas abiertas de América Latina]]'' (''Open Veins of Latin America'') is arguably Galeano's best-known work. In this book, he analyzes the history of Latin America as a whole from the time period of [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|European contact with the New World]] to contemporary Latin America arguing against the European and later U.S. economic exploitation and political dominance over the region. It was the first of his many books to be translated by [[Cedric Belfrage]] into English. It is a classic among scholars of [[History of Latin America|Latin American history]]. The book gained popularity in the English-speaking world after the [[President of Venezuela|Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Chavez]] gave it as a gift to U.S. President [[Barack Obama]].

''Memoria del fuego'' (''Memory of Fire'') is a three-volume narrative of the [[History of the Americas|history of America]], North and South. The characters are historical figures; generals, artists, [[Revolutionary|revolutionaries]], workers, conquerors and the conquered, who are portrayed in brief episodes which reflect the colonial history of the continent. It starts with [[pre-Columbian]] creation myths and ends in the 1980s. It highlights not only the colonial oppression that the continent underwent but particularly the long history of resistance, from individual acts of heroism to mass [[revolutionary movement]]s.

''Memoria del fuego'' is widely praised by [[literary critic|reviewers]]. Galeano was compared to [[John Dos Passos]] and [[Gabriel García Márquez]]. Ronald Wright wrote in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'': "Great writers...dissolve old genres and found new ones. This trilogy by one of South America's most daring and accomplished authors is impossible to classify."

In ''New York Times Book Review'' [[Jay Parini]] praised as perhaps his most daring work ''The Book of Embraces'' (''El libro de los abrazos''), a collection of short, often lyrical stories presenting Galeano's views on emotion, art, politics, and values, as well as offering a scathing critique of modern capitalistic society and views on an ideal society and mindset. (''The Book of Embraces'' was the last book [[Cedric Belfrage]] translated before he died in 1991.)

Galeano is also an avid soccer fan; in his childhood, Galeano had the dream of becoming a soccer player and this desire is the subject of some of his writings, among them ''Soccer in Sun and Shadow'' (1995), a review of the history of the game. Galeano compares it with a theater performance and with war; he criticizes its unholy alliance with global corporations but attacks [[left-wing politics|leftist]] intellectuals who reject the game and its attraction to the broad masses for ideological reasons.

Galeano's ''Espejos'' (''Mirrors'') is Galeano's most expansive work since ''Memory of Fire''. Galeano offers a broad mosaic of history told through the voices of the unseen, unheard, and forgotten. Recalling the lives of artists, writers, gods and visionaries, Galeano's makes "lore out of the mass of history and stories that make this world, and make us human." (Rick Simonson) ''Mirrors'' was published in the United States in English by Nation Books in June 2009.

Galeano is a regular contributor to ''[[The Progressive]]'' and the ''[[New Internationalist]]'', and has also been published in the ''[[Monthly Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]''.

'''Charles Welles Rosen''' (May 5, 1927{{spaced ndash}}December 9, 2012) was an American pianist and writer on music.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/arts/music/charles-rosen-pianist-polymath-and-author-dies-at-85.html New York Times, December 11, 2012]</ref> He is remembered for his career as a concert pianist, for his recordings, and for his many writings, notably the book ''The Classical Style''.

==Life and career==

===Youth and education===
He was born in New York City. His father Irwin Rosen worked as an architect; his mother, née Anita Gerber, was a semiprofessional actress and amateur pianist.<ref name="nytimes.com">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/arts/music/charles-rosen-pianist-polymath-and-author-dies-at-85.html?_r=0</ref>

Rosen began his musical studies at age 4 and at age 6 enrolled in the [[Juilliard School]].<ref name=chic>[http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2012/12/17/charles-rosen-music-scholar-and-acclaimed-pianist-1927-2012 University of Chicago]</ref> At age 11 he left Juilliard to study piano with [[Moriz Rosenthal]].<ref name=white>Rosen web page at Owen White Management</ref> and with Rosenthal's wife Hedwig Kanner.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov">http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200152723/default.html</ref> Rosenthal, born in 1862, had been a student of [[Franz Liszt]]. Rosenthal's memories of the 19th century in classical music were communicated to his pupil and appear frequently in Rosen's later writings.<ref>For instance, in ''Critical Entertainments'' (cited below), Rosen offers a memory from Rosenthal concerning how [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] performed on the piano; specifically that he "rolled" chords upward, starting with the bass note.</ref> Every year from the ages of three to twelve, Rosen heard [[Josef Hofmann]] play, and he later suggested that Hofmann had a greater influence on him than Rosenthal.<ref>In an interview published in the June 2007 edition of ''[[BBC Music Magazine]]'' Rosen recalled having played for [[Leopold Godowsky]] at age seven; Godowsky asked Rosen what he would like to be when he grew up, and, to Godowsky's amusement, Rosen answered, "I want to be a pianist like Józef Hofmann." In the same interview Rosen named [[Arturo Toscanini]] as a great influence.</ref>

Rosen's family background was not wealthy. ''[[The Guardian]]'' editor Nicholas Wroe interviewed him in old age and reported:

:His father had lost his job during the depression and "things were pretty tough for a while". The family moved from [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] to a ho[me] in the then less fashionable [[Upper West Side]], where Rosen still lives. Because money was so short Rosen's parents arranged a contract with the Rosenthals not to pay them for Charles's tuition, but instead to give them 15% of his earnings as a pianist until the age of 21. "As I didn't make my debut in New York until I was 23, it was not a very satisfactory deal. But when I made my first recording I took some money to Hedwig [Kanner] Rosenthal, who was very surprised because she had been teaching me for 13 or 14 years at that stage."<ref name="guardian.co.uk">http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/apr/09/charles-rosen-pianist-chopin-life?intcmp=239</ref>

At age 17, Rosen enrolled in [[Princeton University]], where he studied French, also taking courses in mathematics and philosophy.<ref name="ReferenceA">http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/dec/10/charles-rosen</ref> When he graduated in 1947, he was offered a fellowship of $2,000 to continue at Princeton in the French graduate program.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> While in graduate school he roomed with his fellow student [[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Michael Steinberg]], who also went on to become a classical music critic and scholar of renown.

Rosen attained his status as a musical scholar with very little classroom training. Although Rosen in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' is referred as one of the musicologist [[Oliver Strunk]]'s students,<ref>Kenneth Levy. "Strunk, Oliver." ''In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online'', http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/26999 (accessed July 27, 2008).</ref> he never formally studied musicology with Strunk or anyone else.<ref>Rosen, Charles, "?? ???? ?????????? ??? ???????? ????? ...??? ?? ????????." (The only problems of music are... all the rest) Interview by Paris Konstantinidis. ''Highlights'', 35, Athens, July–August 2008, 152–154.</ref> Rosen's very extensive knowledge of music appears to have arisen partly from a culturally rich family background and partly from reading.  Nicholas Wroe reported:

:Through the Rosenthals, Rosen was connected to the New York musical scene. He had played at a welcome concert for [[Bohuslav Martinu]] when he arrived in America in 1941, and says that by the time he went to Princeton, he knew all the music department socially. "So that made me too proud to take a degree in music, which I thought would be too easy. I sound like a snotty bastard, which I might have been, but I really did know more music as an undergraduate than the postgraduate students."<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/>

Ivan Hewett suggests that a major temptation of Rosen's 1947 fellowship offer was that it offered him time to practice and to read extensively in the Princeton library.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Launching his musical career===
The year 1951 was a busy one for Rosen:  he completed his French Literature Ph.D., gave his first piano recital, and made his first recordings, of works by Martinu and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]].<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200152723/default.html].</ref> His career as a pianist made progress only slowly at first, and he traveled to Paris on a [[Fulbright scholarship]] to study the relationship between poetry and music in 16th-century France.<ref>http://www.gramophone.co.uk/features/focus/charles-rosen-1927-2012</ref> In 1953 he moved to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to teach French.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> He described this period to Nicholas Wroe:

:I suppose I could have stayed on as an academic, but I never intended to do anything but play the piano. The only time I taught was when my playing would only support me for half a year, but I could only get a full-time job. So I taught French at MIT Monday to Wednesday, but Thursday through Sunday I was a pianist. In 1955, after two years there, I got an offer from [[Columbia Artists Management]] and so I resigned.<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/>

The Columbia offer initiated his successful career as a concert pianist:  Rosen appeared in numerous recitals and orchestral engagements around the world.  Musicologist [[Stanley Sadie]] reviewed his pianism as follows:

:As a pianist, Rosen is intense, severe and intellectual. His playing of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] and [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] has been criticized for lack of expressive warmth; in music earlier and later he has won consistent praise. His performance of Bach's [[Goldberg Variations]] is remarkable for its clarity, its vitality and its structural grasp; he has also recorded [[The Art of Fugue]] in performances of exceptional lucidity of texture. His [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] playing (he specializes in the late sonatas, particularly the [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|Hammerklavier]]) is notable for its powerful rhythms and its unremitting intellectual force. In [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] his attention is focussed rather on structural detail than on sensuous beauty. He is a distinguished interpreter of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] and [[Anton Webern|Webern]].<ref>From the [[New Grove]], online version</ref>

Rosen also made a large number of recordings, including recording various 20th century works at the invitation of their composers; his agent's web site (cited below) lists the following:

*[[Igor Stravinsky]]: Movements for Piano and Orchestra
*[[Elliott Carter]]: Double Concerto
*[[Pierre Boulez]]:  complete works for piano

In 1955, he also recorded [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200152723/default.html#disco] six [[Domenico Scarlatti|Scarlatti]]'s sonatas and the three movements of the [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s sonata K 333 [http://www.amazon.com/Siena-Pianoforte-Wolfgang-Amadeus-Mozart/dp/B000001UOB] on the historical [http://books.google.fr/books?id=SQaUAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT694&lpg=PT694&dq=Siena+piano&source=bl&ots=Dbs1xEk5Ci&sig=mGw6GxOZi9Tf-Qy0cChxHJw1RGg&hl=fr&sa=X&ei=qFOAU5bEGMH30gX8j4GYDw&ved=0CDAQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=Siena%20piano&f=false] {{ill|fr|Siena piano}} [http://www.naxos.com/person/Charles_Rosen/10899.htm].

His recordings also include earlier literature such as Debussy's ''[[Études (Debussy)|Études]]'' (1958),<ref name=white/> Schumann's works for solo piano, Beethoven's late sonatas and ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[The Art of Fugue|Art of Fugue]]'' and ''[[Goldberg Variations]]''.<ref>In the cited BBC interview, Rosen noted that he refused to perform the last-named work complete in concert, expressing a belief that it was intended for home study and cannot be played as Bach would have intended except in solitude, for personal pleasure.</ref> An extensive Rosen discography is given at the web site of the Library of Congress:  [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200152723/default.html].

===Career as a writer and teacher===
Rosen's career as an author and scholar began only when he had passed the age of 40.  Nicholas Wroe narrates how he started writing:

:Rosen released his first Chopin recording in 1960. It included one of the late [[Nocturnes (Chopin)|nocturnes]], opus 62 no 1 ... Rosen says he wasn't entirely happy with the recording, but he was even more disappointed with the sleeve note, which described the nocturne as "staggering drunken with the odour of flowers". "I had many thoughts about the piece," he says. "That was not one of them. So I started writing the sleeve notes myself. People liked them and after a while a publisher took me to lunch. Before he even offered me a drink he said he would publish whatever I'd like to write. Eventually it led to many books and articles. But to begin with I wrote just to keep nonsense off my record sleeves."<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/apr/09/charles-rosen-pianist-chopin-life</ref>

In 1970 Rosen wrote his first column for ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', a scathing review of the then-current edition of the ''[[Harvard Dictionary of Music]]''.<ref>Reprinted in ''Critical Entertainments''.</ref> His association with this journal continued for the rest of his life (his last column was published posthumously).<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

In 1971, Rosen published his first and most famous book, ''The Classical Style''. This work was highly successful, winning a National Book Award; and initiated a long series of books (see list below).

At various points in his career Rosen took positions as a university professor. His early stint teaching French at MIT is mentioned above. His later teaching was in music, in part-time or visiting positions offered to Rosen after he had achieved fame in his scholarly work. At [[Harvard University]] he held the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|Charles Eliot Norton Chair of Poetics]] in 1980/1981; the public lectures he gave there served as the basis of ''The Romantic Generation''.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/> He taught one academic quarter per year at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1985 to 1996.<ref name=chic/> He taught at [[Stony Brook University]] starting 1971,<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/> the [[University of Oxford]] (1988)<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/> and the [[Royal Northern College of Music]].

Even after the scholarly phase of his career had set in, Rosen continued to perform as a pianist for the rest of his life.

He gave his last lecture on April 18, 2012 in the series Music in 21st-Century Society, at the Barry S. Brook Center for Music Research and Documentation of the CUNY Graduate Center. The lecture may be heard in video format at http://vimeo.com/55583114?action=share&post_id=773882491_112504608918315#_=_

Rosen died of cancer on December 9, 2012, in New York City, aged 85.<ref>[http://www.artsjournal.com/slippeddisc/2012/12/death-of-a-great-musical-mind.html Arts Journal]</ref> His collection of scores and manuscripts was posthumously donated to the Music Department of the [[CUNY Graduate Center|Graduate Center]], [[City University of New York]].

==Books and other writings==
Rosen was the author of many acclaimed books about music, among them the following.

*His most famous work is ''The Classical Style'' (1971), which analyzes the nature and evolution of the style of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] as it was developed by Haydn, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and Beethoven. Rosen revised the work in 1997, leaving most of the text intact but adding a second chapter on Beethoven and a preface addressing comments on the first edition.
*''Sonata Forms'' (1980) is in some ways a follow-up on ''The Classical Style''; it is an intensive analysis of the primary musical form used in the classical era. Rosen wrote the work when his intended contribution to the [[New Grove]] on [[sonata form]] was rejected by the editors; he amplified the article he had written into book form.
*''The Romantic Generation'' (1995) is centered on the early generation of Romantic composers, including [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], Liszt, Schumann, and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]].
*''Beethoven's Piano Sonatas: A Short Companion'' (2001) gives general background on these famous works as well as sonata-by-sonata advice for performers.
*''Critical Entertainments: Music Old and New'' (2001) is a compilation of essays original published in magazines and scholarly journals, mostly the [[New York Review of Books]]. It covers a variety of topics, including [[Oliver Strunk]], the work of various composers, the status of contemporary music, and the New Musicology.
*''Piano Notes: The World of the Pianist'' (2002) is an account of the concert pianist's world, addressed to the general reader.  It covers piano technique, the instrument itself, the culture of piano performance, and the repertoire for the instrument.

Rosen frequently wrote on music for  ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', and a number of his books are compilations of essays and reviews he wrote for this journal.

The polymathic Rosen published in other areas of the humanities: ''Romanticism and Realism: The Mythology of Nineteenth-Century Art'' and ''Romantic Poets, Critics, and Other Madmen''.

===Some aspects of Rosen's writing===

In the introduction to ''Critical Entertainments'', Rosen stated his main goal in writing about music: to increase the listener's engagement with the music. Alluding to the unhappy program note mentioned above, he wrote:

:A Chopin recording I made ... had some notes that quoted [[James Huneker]] on one of the late nocturnes, which claimed that it "staggered drunken with the odor of flowers." This was not my view of the work ... Huneker's style is an invitation to the listener to dream, to dissipate attention into reverie. The writing about music that I prefer – and the performances of it, as well – fix and intensify the listener's attention. When I hear music, I prefer to lose myself in it, not drift outside in my own personal world with the music as a decorative and distant background.<ref>''Critical Entertainments'' pp.1–2.</ref>

In pursuing this goal Rosen often appealed to technical aspects of musical description, including the theories of [[harmony]] and [[musical form]].  In a ''New Yorker'' blog posting, [[Jeremy Denk]] rhapsodically describes this aspect of Rosen's work:

:My favorite, life-changing parts of “The Classical Style” are the blow-by-blow accounts of great passages of music in the [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wonk wonkiest] of terms. He delves into the exposition of Mozart's [[Piano Concerto No. 9 (Mozart)|piano concerto in E-flat, K. 271]], showing how each new idea fulfills various needs raised by the last, while leaving others still open: a continuous game of symmetry and asymmetry, expectation and fulfillment, hiding beneath the innocent surface. ... Charles insists on addressing the notes; but he shows us how behind the notes are felt needs, requirements, laws of how things ought to be—a whole system of judgment, of taste, of meaning. ... The book ... occasionally feels like a page-turner, a thriller: these three geniuses—Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven—building on each other’s discoveries, like scientists almost, creating unprecedented inventions, invoking a golden era of form meeting content.<ref>http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/12/postscript-charles-rosen.html</ref>

Another goal of the work is to set each composer's work in its historical and cultural background, describing the forms of composition that served as a musical background for a composer in his formative years and then illuminating his contributions. Thus, for example, Rosen largely sees Beethoven in the context of the Classical-period tradition from which he emerged, rather than anachronistically as a forerunner of the later [[Romantic music|Romantic movement]].<ref>Indeed Rosen makes a strong case that the Romantic movement in music emerged from a ''rejection'' of the principles on which Beethoven composed; and that the veneration the Romantics held for Beethoven was in some ways an impediment to their best work.</ref>

Rosen was unafraid to make strong generalizations about the music he studied; i.e. he frequently pointed out aspects of the music claimed to be invariably or almost invariably present. Here are examples.

:The first section of a [[Sonata form|sonata exposition]] always has an increasingly animated texture. (''Sonata Forms'', p. 238)

:The opening of a work by Mozart is always solidly based [i.e., in the tonic key], no matter how ambiguous and disturbing its expressive significance, while the most unassuming first measures of a quartet by Haydn are far more unstable, more immediately charged with a dynamic movement away from the tonic. (''The Classical Style'', 186)

:In this respect Chopin is one of the least pianistic of composers: a change of harmony [= a passage repeated later in a piece in a different key] that makes the original figuration exceedingly awkward does not lead him to change the figuration, and he always refuses to adapt his musical thought to the convenience of the hand. (''The Romantic Generation'', p. 364)

From time to time Rosen wielded his pen as a rapier, skewering other authors. He generally expressed his criticisms with a dose of wit, mixing damnation with faint praise,<ref>[[Malcolm Gladwell]] makes this point (as well as the one in the previous paragraph) thus:  "He is rarely shy about the broad assertion, or about the perfect poison insult, delivered with a smile."  From the ''New Yorker'' web site:  http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2012/12/best-books-of-2012.html</ref>  as in the following discussion of  a contribution by [[Richard Taruskin]] to a volume on [[historically informed performance]]:

:Taruskin writes brilliantly and at the top of his voice, and his most crushing arguments are often reserved for opinions that no one really holds. He asserts: "To presume that the use of historical instruments guarantees a historical result is simply preposterous." No doubt. Still, Taruskin beats his dead horses with infectious enthusiasm, and some of them have occasional twitches of life.<ref>''Critical Entertainments'', p. 204</ref>

Such passages were balanced by a fair amount of praise and appreciation (if not systematic citation) of others' work.

Rosen's prodigious memory for facts occasionally failed him, letting elementary factual errors creep into his work. Sometimes he would apologize for the errors in reprinted editions, retaining them in the text as a sort of self-reprimand. Thus Chapter 7 of ''Critical Entertainments'',  a reprinted essay, begins with an appended comment:

:At the opening of the following essay, the mistake of calling [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] the emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] is so egregious that I have let it stand in the text in the hope that the public humiliation will make me more careful in the future. Several readers wrote to signal other mistakes ...

==Assessment==

The musicologist [[Mark DeVoto]] has written of Rosen:

:Charles Rosen was a comprehensive musician, an outstanding pianist and one of the best writers on music ever.  The scope of his knowledge was immense, and its depth showed on every page of his many and various books and articles, from ''The Classical Style'' to ''The Romantic Generation'' to ''Sonata Forms'', and even to books on Schoenberg and Elliott Carter. Today's students and knowledgeable music lovers return to Rosen's writings again and again, not only to read about the great composers and their works, but to comprehend them historically and as components of the literary and dramatic traditions, which Rosen knew thoroughly.<ref>[http://classical-scene.com/2012/12/11/rosen-died/ Classical Scene]</ref>

The '''National Wrestling Alliance''' ('''NWA''') is a [[professional wrestling]] governing body which has historically been the largest league of independent wrestling promotions in the world. The organization sanctions various NWA [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championship]] bouts within its member promotions. The NWA has been in operation since 1948. Prior to the 1960s, it acted as the sole [[Sport governing body|governing body]] for most of professional wrestling, operating as a talent and brand name franchiser for the inter-regional "territory" system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aw8hS9psIsI/TX2U4tyXq7I/AAAAAAAAAGo/pYb5ZvDMbOg/s1600/WrestlingTerritories.png |title=WrestlingTerritories.png  |author= |date= |work=Freakin' Awesome Network Forums :: Freakin' Awesome Wrestling Forum :: (w)Rest of Wrestling |publisher= |accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref>

==History==

===1940s===
[[File:Nwalogobw.JPG|200px|left]]
Before the NWA was founded in 1948, there existed many regional [[professional wrestling promotion]]s across North America (each promoting its own "World" champion). None of them, however, had backing or recognition outside of their own respective geographic base-areas. The concept of the NWA was to consolidate the championships of these regional companies into one true world championship of pro wrestling, whose holder would be recognized worldwide.<ref name=sa8>Shaun Assael. ''Sex, Lies, & Headlocks'' (p.8)</ref> In 1948, Paul "Pinkie" George, a promoter from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], founded the original version of the National Wrestling Alliance with the backing of five other promoters (Al Haft, Tony Strecher, Harry Light, [[Orville Brown]], and [[Sam Muchnick]]). This newly formed NWA Board of Directors wanted Brown to be the first-ever NWA World champion.<ref name=sa8/> During the reign of the second [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]], [[Lou Thesz]] (1949–1956),<ref name=sa8/> the title was further unified with several more previously-competing "World" titles, such as those recognized jointly by the [[National Wrestling Association]] and the American Wrestling Alliance (in Boston), plus another version promoted from the [[Grand Olympic Auditorium|Los Angeles Olympic Auditorium]]. This legitimized the NWA's claim that its title was a "Unified World Title," and its lineage continues to this day.

The NWA members divided up North America, as well as [[Japan]], into territories that each promoter would "own" and operate in. Having a territory meant that no other NWA member could promote wrestling in that area unless special arrangements were made between the promoters involved. If non-NWA promoters tried to promote their show in an NWA territory, then the other member groups were obliged to send stars to help force the intruder out. Reportedly, threats of violence or physical retaliation were used against any promoters (and/or talent) who disregarded the territory system. If any member territory broke the NWA's rules, it faced expulsion, and thus risked missing out on having nationally-known wrestlers appear on their local shows. For most promoters under the NWA umbrella, the benefits of membership were well worth the dues. Usually, the NWA President's territory was the main territory of the entire alliance.

Beyond the benefit of having other promotions to draw on in case of an intruder, each territory also received periodic guest visits from the NWA World Heavyweight Champion. The champion did not have a "home territory" as such, but instead traveled from territory to territory, defending the title against the top stars of each territory. A number of former NWA World Champions often remarked that their primary goal was to make the top stars of each territory "look good" and give crowds the impression that those "local heroes" had the potential of being the champion by almost winning the title. Many promoters would build up to the appearance of "The NWA World Heavyweight Champion" weeks or months in advance, making the local World title matches that much more special, and the shows they headlined more lucrative. In addition, each NWA member promotion usually produced a TV show that aired in their territory only, meaning that the local fans only saw the World champion when he came to their area, not year-round. It was not just the champion that would travel the territories; often, wrestlers from a different area would come into a territory (often the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] / "bad guys"), and run an [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] or two with its top local [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] ("good guys"). Also, if the local fans ever tired of a wrestler, he could go to a whole new area and perform the same act for new audiences, who would think the act was brand-new.  This storyline was often advanced in the area from which the competitor was departing as resulting from the outcome of an especially-highly promoted "loser leaves town" match.

===1950s–1960s===
Upon becoming the booker for Lou Thesz in 1950, Muchnick, who was the head of the [[St. Louis Wrestling Club]], became the new NWA President and maintained that position until 1960.

In the mid-1950s, serious disputes broke out within the NWA. There were [[antitrust]] problems with the government and there were a number of competing factions who wanted to replace Thesz as champion with different wrestlers, such as [[Verne Gagne]]. The antitrust case led to the infamous NWA Consent Decree of 1956 in ''U.S. v. National Wrestling Alliance''.<ref>United States vs. National Wrestling Alliance http://wrestlingperspective.com/legal/consentdecree.html</ref> There were also disputes over the number of dates wrestled by the champion in various parts of the country. The first break within the organization occurred in 1957, when [[Montreal]] promoter [[Eddie Quinn]] walked out of the August NWA meeting in St. Louis. Quinn had fallen out with Muchnick over a number of issues. Quinn was a partner in the St. Louis territory and disagreed with how it was being run, and was also angry that Muchnick had business dealings with rogue promoter (and Quinn rival) Jack Pfefer. At the time Quinn walked out, a wrestler of his named [[Édouard Carpentier]] was involved in an angle where he and Lou Thesz were both being presented around the NWA as champion. This occurred after Carpentier had a disputed win over Thesz on June 14, 1957, and some of the NWA promoters considered it a legitimate title change, while others did not.<ref name=slam>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBios/carpentier.html|title=Canadian Hall of Fame: Edouard Carpentier|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2008-04-30}}</ref> The original idea was to build the idea of the "disputed" NWA title into a high profile rematch. When Quinn left the NWA, Muchnick announced that Carpentier had never been an official champion and had no claim on the title.

Afterward, Quinn saw the financial possibilities in the Carpentier situation and began to negotiate with factions within the NWA, as some territories such as Boston (AAC/Big Time Wrestling), Nebraska, and Los Angeles (NAWA/WWA) continued to recognize Carpentier as champion. He offered to have Carpentier lose a title match to their prospective champion thus giving them, if they decided to break away, a legitimate claim on the world title.  The AAC recognized [[Killer Kowalski]] as world champion when he defeated Carpentier in Boston, and Nebraska recognized [[Verne Gagne]] as champion when he defeated Carpentier in Omaha (after winning the belt, Gagne tried for two years to work things out with the NWA, but finally left the organization in 1960 forming the [[American Wrestling Association]].<ref name=slam/> Gagne's win over Carpentier was used to legitimize the world championship status of the AWA title). The NAWA/WWA recognized [[Freddie Blassie]] as world champion when he defeated Carpentier in 1961. The promotion then left the NWA officially and became the World Wrestling Association (WWA) until it returned to the NWA in 1968.

Muchnick's replacement at the NWA's helm in 1960 was [[Toronto]]'s [[Frank Tunney]]; he in turn was succeeded by Fred Kohler, who was the main booker for the new NWA world champion, [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|"Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers]]. Rogers had defeated NWA World Champion Pat O'Connor in 1961 in front of a then record crowd of over 36,000 fans at Comiskey Park in Chicago.  October 1962 saw Rogers defeat Kowalski in a match promoted by Doc Karl Sarpolis, the NWA member promoter in [[Amarillo, Texas]], and Sarpolis rose to the NWA presidency as a result. On January 24, 1963, at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto, Lou Thesz defeated Rogers in a one-fall match and was declared champion. After the event, however, [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] promoter [[Vincent J. McMahon]] refused to recognize the title change and withdrew his operation from the NWA, becoming the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, now [[WWE]]) with Rogers as the star performer.<ref name=sas14>Shaun Assael. ''Sex, Lies, & Headlocks'' (p.14–15)</ref> The WWWF recognized Rogers as its first world champion in April 1963.<ref name=sas14/> Although both Gagne and McMahon promoted their own world champions, their promotions continued to have representatives on the NWA Board of Directors and regularly exchanged talent with NWA promotions.

===Decline of the territory system===
In the 1980s, video tape trading and [[cable television]] paved the way for the eventual death of the NWA's inter-regional business model, as fans could now see for themselves the plot holes and inconsistencies between the different regional storylines. Also, the presence of stars like [[Ric Flair]] on TV every week made their special appearances in each region less of a draw. [[Vince McMahon|Vincent K. McMahon]], who had bought the WWWF from his father in 1982 and renamed it the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), used these gathering trends to turn his Northeastern territory into the first truly national promotion. To combat this threat, various NWA promoters, along with the AWA, attempted to co-promote shows under the [[Pro Wrestling USA]] banner. Internal disputes over power and money, however, caused this deal to eventually fall apart. The AWA ended up owning the group's [[ESPN]] timeslot, and used it to broadcast its own weekly shows.

In 1984, McMahon bought NWA member [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW) and merged it into the WWF, with the WWF taking over GCW's long-time TV slot on [[TBS (TV channel)|TBS]].<ref>Shaun Assael. ''Sex, Lies, & Headlocks'' (p.61)</ref> Meanwhile, to hold off the threat of the WWF, [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]-based [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP) decided to unify certain NWA territories and "go national" itself. Accordingly, [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]] began buying out some of the other NWA member promotions or, in some cases, allowed them to quietly die and just absorbed their rosters. Because of his acquisition spree, and because he failed to consistently match the WWF's ambitious marketing, TV production values, and merchandising, Crockett was facing bankruptcy by 1988. TBS owner [[Ted Turner]] bought JCP and renamed it [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) after the popular GCW TV show on TBS.<ref name=eb60>{{cite book|author=Eric Bischoff|title=Eric Bischoff: Controversy Creates Cash|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2006|page=60|isbn=1-4165-2729-X}}</ref> With the backing of Turner’s money, it grew into a national promotion. With time, WCW became the main NWA territory with the JCP versions of the [[NWA National Tag Team Championship|Tag-Team]], [[WWE United States Championship|United States]], and [[WCW World Television Championship|Television Champions]] being recognized on a national scale. Up until this point only the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] and [[NWA Junior Heavyweight Championship]] had had national recognition. WCW was still a member of the NWA, but with time felt that the NWA needed it more than it needed the backing of the NWA, especially since both WCW and the WWF toured the entire country instead of staying within a confined territory. To make matters even more confusing, WCW spent much of 1992 and 1993 recognizing and promoting both WCW-brand world champions and NWA-brand world champions.

Another promotion that withdrew from the NWA to operate on their own was Mid-South Sports. Originally owned by Leroy McGuirk (who booked the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion for the NWA), the promotion was sold to [[Bill Watts]] in 1979. Watts changed the name of the promotion to Mid-South Sports and declined to join the NWA. However, Watts did have a working agreement and exchanged talent with Jim Crockett Jr., allowing him to book the NWA world champion. In 1986, Watts renamed his promotion the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] (UWF) in a bid to expand nationally, but was eventually bought out by JCP in March 1987, after going bankrupt.<ref>Shaun Assael. ''Sex, Lies, & Headlocks'' (p.69)</ref>

In February 1986, promoter [[Fritz Von Erich]] withdrew [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) from the NWA in a bid to become a national promotion. He teamed with another former NWA member, the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA), and the AWA to try to compete with WCW and the WWF, but the arrangement soon fell apart due to inter-promotional politics. WCCW and the CWA later merged to form the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (USWA), which folded in 1997. Abroad, [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL), [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW), and [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) all seceded from the NWA in the mid-1980s, but not many American fans followed or even knew about these promotions.

===1990s–2000s===
In January 1991, WCW officially began to recognize a WCW World champion, with Ric Flair, who had just defeated [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] to regain the NWA World heavyweight championship, as the first title holder. Ric Flair was simultaneously recognized as the World champion of both the NWA and WCW until he left WCW over a dispute with WCW president [[Jim Herd]] (with the actual title belt in his possession) to join the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]]. Upon leaving, Flair was immediately stripped of the WCW World title but continued to be recognized as the NWA World champion, causing the separation of the WCW and NWA titles. He was officially stripped of the NWA World title upon his arrival in the WWF a few months later. Afterwards, the NWA World title lay dormant for a year until [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] hosted a tournament to crown a new champion. In September 1993, WCW withdrew completely from the NWA, and, despite Flair's possession of the physical belt, made no mention of the NWA name on air after the split.

In August 1994, [[Philadelphia]]-based Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) withdrew their membership from the NWA in somewhat surprising fashion. As one of the most popular independent promotions of the early 1990s, they hosted a tournament to crown a new NWA World Heavyweight Champion after WCW had withdrawn from the NWA. The finals of the tournament saw [[Shane Douglas]] defeat [[2 Cold Scorpio]] for the world title. Then, in a surprising turn, Douglas threw the title belt to the ground, claiming that he did not want to be the champion of a promotion that died "seven years before" (when JCP became WCW). Shane then grabbed the ECW Heavyweight Championship belt and declared himself the [[ECW Championship|ECW World Champion]]. ECW owner [[Tod Gordon]] then renamed the company to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] and officially withdrew ECW from the NWA. This act all but obliterated any remaining prestige connected to the NWA World Championship and relegated it to an all but forgotten status among wrestling fans.

After the secession of ECW in 1994, the NWA wasn't what it once was. Through the mid to late 1990s, the all-but-forgotten organization was left with a small collection of independent promotions during the peak of the [[Monday Night Wars]] between WCW and the WWF.


===NWA today===
{{see also|NWA Hall of Fame}}
Today, there is still a group of promoters which hold membership in the NWA and continue to use the NWA name, although no members are holdovers from the membership of the promotion's "glory days" of the 1940s–1980s.

In order to join the NWA, a promoter must have been operating for at least one year in a territory uncontested by any other NWA member, and their application must be approved by a majority vote of the Board of Directors—although, there are numerous exceptions to this bylaw currently within the organization. In August 2005, the presidency of the NWA was dissolved and the duties of the office assumed by the Board of Directors, following the resignation of Ernie Todd (NWA: Canadian Wrestling Federation). On his promotion's website, not only did he explain his reasons for resigning from the NWA and its Board of Directors, but Todd stated that he would be joining [[Wrestling Superstars Live|AWA Superstars of Wrestling]]. Other members on the NWA's message board posted their thoughts on Todd's departure, and his decision to join AWA Superstars of Wrestling. It was announced on the NWA's website on Monday, October 10, 2005, that NWA legal counsel Bob Trobich would become its new [[Executive director|Executive Director]]. In April 2012, North Carolina businessman and NWA Carolinas promoter David Baucom took over as the Executive Director after the resignation of Trobich.

In August 2012, the rights to the NWA name and trademarks were awarded to International Wrestling Corp, LLC following a lawsuit against Trobich, Baucom, and the organization.  A holding company run by Houston-based attorney and wrestling promoter R. Bruce Tharpe sued claiming insurance fraud regarding the NWA's liability insurance policy. A settlement was negotiated that transferred the NWA from Trobich's Pro Wrestling Organization LLC to Tharpe's group.<ref>{{cite web|title=NWA LAWSUIT SETTLED, PROMOTION TO TRANSFER TO NEW CORPORATION|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/70396/nwa-lawsuit-settled-promotion-to-transfer-to-new-corporation.html|publisher=PWInsider.com}}</ref>  The new organization is moving from a membership model to a licensing model, which caused many promotions to immediately cut ties with the NWA, including Championship Wrestling from Hollywood. CWF Hollywood was the unofficial home promotion of both the then-current NWA champion ([[Adam Pearce]]) and the most recent previous champion ([[Colt Cabana]]), both of whom publicly left the NWA, with Pearce vacating the NWA World Title while exiting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestling.net/artman/publish/miscnews/article10028079.shtml|title=NWA Video: Colt Cabana and Adam Pearce leave the NWA Championship in the ring|accessdate=November 3, 2012|publisher=Prowrestling.net}}</ref>

In 2013, NWA re-established a relationship with New Japan Pro Wrestling, where Bruce Tharpe became an on-screen character, portraying a villainous manager of wrestlers representing the NWA. Both the NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships have since changed hands at NJPW events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Other_News_4/article_74458.shtml|title=NJPW news: Double title change in IWGP Tag Title vs. NWA Tag Title match, Young Bucks add Tag Title gold|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2013-11-09|accessdate=2014-03-18|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/otherppvs/article_75461.shtml|title=Caldwell's NJPW Tokyo Dome results 1/4: Complete "virtual-time" coverage of New Japan's biggest show of the year - four title changes, former WWE/TNA stars featured, more|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2014-01-04|accessdate=2014-03-18|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref>

==Promotions==

===Regional promotions of the past===
Several smaller promotions that were once cornerstones of the NWA ceased to exist as the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] (now World Wrestling Entertainment) and WCW grew to national levels. [[Pacific Northwest Wrestling]] (PNW) was one of the main NWA territories into the 1980s, but, due to the aging of promoter [[Don Owen (wrestling promoter)|Don Owen]] and dwindling profit, it closed down in 1992. Another territory that was once considered a main territory of the NWA was promoter and two-time NWA President [[Sam Muchnick]]’s St. Louis-based promotion, the [[St. Louis Wrestling Club]], which ran until 1982 and was then sold to a promotion that [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] absorbed in 1985 in its attempt to create a national promotion. NWA Mid-America, booked by [[Nick Gulas]], and the [[Continental Championship Wrestling|Continental Wrestling Federation]], booked by the Fullers, both folded in the 1980s, but were long-time members. [[Southwest Championship Wrestling]] out of [[San Antonio]] was a member from 1978 until it was bought by another NWA member promotion, [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW), in 1985. When wrestler and [[Detroit]] NWA member [[Ed Farhat]] made several appearances as '''The Sheik''' in an "outlaw territory," his promotion, Big Time Wrestling, was deemed to have violated the NWA charter and was expelled from the organization. Another American former NWA member is [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]], which was a member until it was made a WWF developmental territory in 2001.

The NWA is not restricted to the [[United States]] alone. At various points, promotions in [[Mexico]], [[Canada]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Australia]] were members. In Canada, [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]] was a long-time member of the NWA, with its promoter, [[Frank Tunney]], serving as the NWA President in the early 1960s. Maple Leaf Wrestling withdrew from the NWA when it was incorporated into the WWF in 1984. Another Canadian promotion that was a key member in the NWA until also being absorbed into the WWF was [[Stu Hart]]’s [[Stampede Wrestling]] in [[Calgary]], although when it was relaunched in 1999, it did not become a member of the NWA. Another Canadian territory, encompassing the [[Canadian Maritimes|Maritime provinces]] of [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], and [[Prince Edward Island]], was known as the [[Eastern Sports Association]], and operated only in the summer months. This promotion dissolved in 1977, and promoter Al Zink’s subsequent ventures into wrestling were not affiliated with the NWA. Out of [[Vancouver]] came [[NWA All-Star Wrestling]]. Run by promoters [[Gene Kiniski]] and Sandor Kovac, NWA All-Star Wrestling was an NWA member until 1985, after which recognized a fictitious sanctioning body known as the "Universal Wrestling Alliance."

In Mexico, the primary NWA member was [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empresa Mexicana de la Lucha Libre]] (now called CMLL). Founded in 1933, it precedes the creation of the NWA. EMLL joined with the NWA later on, but broke away from the group in 1980. Despite not being a member of the NWA since 1980, CMLL still recognizes three titles with NWA lineage: [[NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship|NWA Light Heavyweight Championship]], [[NWA World Middleweight Championship]] and [[NWA World Welterweight Championship]], which are all unsanctioned and only defended at CMLL events.

In the Caribbean, long-time promotion the [[World Wrestling Council]], owned by [[Carlos Colón, Sr.|Carlos Colon]] and based out of [[Puerto Rico]], was a member from 1973 until 1988, when the territory concept became semi-obsolete due to [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW’s]] growth. Rival Puerto Rican promotion [[International Wrestling Association (Puerto Rico)|International Wrestling Association]], founded in 1994 by [[Victor Quiñones]], was a member of the NWA from its inception until its withdrawal in 2001.

The NWA’s presence in [[Japan]] was established in 1953, when Japanese wrestler/promoter [[Rikid?zan]] founded the [[Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance]], which quickly became the main promotion in Japan. In 1972, the JPWA’s two top draws [[Shohei Baba|Giant Baba]] and [[Antonio Inoki]] left to form their own promotions, [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) and [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) respectively. As a result, the JPWA soon folded. AJPW became an NWA member upon its inception in 1973 and stayed until the late 1980s. NJPW was also a member of the NWA at various points between 1975 and 1985, mainly in order to gain control of the [[NWA Junior Heavyweight Championship]]. In 1992 and 1993, NJPW joined with the NWA once more to re-establish and promote the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], but left the NWA when WCW withdrew. NJPW returned to the NWA in 2004, again mainly for the NWA Junior Heavyweight Championship, and it is not a connection that is strongly emphasized. Between NJPW's departure in 1993 and its return in 2004 NWA representation in Japan was scattered among a few independent promotions: the [[International Wrestling Association of Japan]] (1994–1996); the Wrestle Yume Factory (1995–1997), the Universal Fighting Arts Organization (1999–2000); and [[Pro Wrestling Zero1|Pro Wrestling Zero-One]] (2001–2004). In June 2007, it was announced that the [[Inoki Genome Federation]] would replace NJPW as the Japanese affiliate of the National Wrestling Alliance. In February 2008, however, New Japan returned to the NWA. At the annual meeting in 2010, New Japan did not renew its membership and left the NWA yet again. In 2011, Pro Wrestling Zero1 returned to the NWA as their Japanese territory.

The NWA brand name has been seen most prominently in recent years in conjunction with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), a former NWA member promotion started by [[Jeff Jarrett]] and his promoter father [[Jerry Jarrett|Jerry]] in 2002, which withdrew from the NWA in 2004. In 2004, TNA negotiated a new deal to license the NWA name and the use of the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] and the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]], for ten years. On May 13, 2007, the NWA announced that it had ended this deal, revoked official World Heavyweight and World Tag Team championship statuses from the current (TNA-based) holders, and announced tournaments for both newly vacated titles. In reality, both sides wanted to end the arrangement, as TNA wanted to brand its own World titles, and the NWA membership wanted final say on (and control of the booking dates for) NWA-brand champions.

===Current major promotions===

The most visible NWA member promotion in the [[United States]] recently was [[NWA Wildside]]. It aired 300 consecutive weeks of syndicated television before closing in April 2005, when the promoter, Bill Behrens, signed a deal to work as a television syndicator for [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]]. Bill Behrens and Jerry Palmer began [[NWA Anarchy]] after the closing of [[NWA Wildside]]. [[NWA Anarchy]] continues to broadcast weekly television programs appearing on stations all across the U.S. and Canada. NWA Pro Wrestling, operated out of [[Los Angeles]] by David Marquez and John Rivera, have been successful in running arena events throughout the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] using top [[Lucha libre]] stars to draw houses.  The current promotion, [[NWA Championship Wrestling from Hollywood]] is broadcast in the Southern California television market on [[KDOC-TV|KDOC]], NWA [[Main Event]], [[Tennessee]], Mike Porter

NWA Pro Wrestling also has affiliates throughout [[California]] and [[New Jersey]]. The NWA recently announced that they have signed one of Australia's premiere promotions to the NWA with and announcement set to take place later in the year.

The largest and most successful member promotion of the NWA was [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]], the second-largest and most profitable wrestling promotion in the world (after WWE). NJPW was sanctioned by NWA member and wrestler, Antonio Inoki, who at times has also sanctioned Zero-One and the Universal Fighting Organization as NWA promotions. NJPW holds events consistently throughout Japan, and has also run shows in [[Europe]] and the United States. However, it is no longer an NWA territory, as Inoki transferred the rights to his [[Inoki Genome Federation]] when he left New Japan.  At the 2010 Annual Meeting, New Japan did not renew its membership and has left the NWA. However, the NWA did re-appear in New Japan in 2013 as part of an angle with NWA wrestlers wrestling in Japan to try to take over the company, most notably current NWA Champion [[Rob Conway]].

The late 1990s also brought in the first European member, [[NWA UK Hammerlock]]. Due to European recognition of the [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[All Star Wrestling|All Star Promotions]] World Heavyweight Championship and the match rule differences (matches in Europe were usually divided into rounds), the NWA did not have a presence in Europe in its heyday.

In 2008 a new Mexican promotion, NWA Mexico run by [[Blue Demon, Jr.]] (adopted son of the original EMLL star [[Blue Demon]]) arose as the NWA's new Mexican affiliate. Demon, Jr., made an instant impact by winning the NWA World Heavyweight Championship (the first Mexican luchador to do so) without any EMLL involvement. NWA Mexico was disbanded on November 13, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestling-revolution.com/2013/11/13/pro-wrestling-revolution-welcomes-new-partner/|title=Pro Wrestling Revolution welcomes new partner|date=2013-11-13|accessdate=2013-11-14|work=Pro Wrestling Revolution}}</ref>

==Recent television programs==

===''NWA Wrestling Showcase''===
In January 2008, [[Colours TV]] on [[Dish Network]] and the NWA announced that they would begin airing an hour-long show entitled ''NWA Wrestling Showcase'', featuring the NWA's current lineup of stars in action. The show was hosted by David Marquez (with [[Rob Conway]] co-hosting the first four episodes) with match commentary by announcers Todd Kenneley, Kris Kloss and Rick Otazu. Ten episodes were shown before re-runs began. All the matches were taped at the [[Plaza Hotel & Casino|Plaza Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. In January 2009, ''NWA Wrestling Showcase'' started airing new episodes, this time the tapings took place in Hollywood California.

===''NWA Championship Wrestling from Hollywood''===
On July 12, 2010, NWA Pro Wrestling, Inc. and [[KDOC-TV]] [[Los Angeles]] announced a partnership in producing National Wrestling Alliance branded television programming to the station beginning September 2010.

''[[NWA Championship Wrestling from Hollywood]]'' is now an ongoing weekly television series that originates from KDOC-TV Los Angeles. The series premiere was on September 17, 2010.  On September 9, 2012, Championship Wrestling from Hollywood announced it had left the NWA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/71791/nwa-loses-major-member.html?p=1|title=NWA loses major member|last=Johnson|first=Mike|date=2012-09-09|accessdate=2012-09-10|work=Pro Wrestling Insider}}</ref>

==Personnel==

===Head of organization===
Since the NWA was founded in 1948, there have been twenty different presidents of the organization. In 2005, at its annual meeting, the position of President was abandoned in favor of the position of "Executive Director". However, after a lawsuit against the organization & its now former management by one of its members & it's current Owner/President, R. Bruce Tharpe, the organization came under Tharpe's ownership through a holding company he formed. Afterwards, the Executive Director position was abanonded in favor of a return to "President".

'''Computational fluid dynamics''', usually abbreviated as '''CFD''', is a branch of [[fluid mechanics]] that uses [[numerical methods]] and [[algorithms]] to solve and analyze problems that involve [[Fluid dynamics|fluid flows]]. Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the interaction of liquids and gases with surfaces defined by [[boundary conditions]]. With high-speed [[supercomputer]]s, better solutions can be achieved. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as [[transonic]] or [[turbulence|turbulent]] flows. Initial experimental validation of such software is performed using a [[wind tunnel]] with the final validation coming in full-scale testing, e.g. [[flight test]]s.

==Background and history==
[[Image:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|right|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around the [[Space Shuttle]] during re-entry.]]
[[Image:X-43A (Hyper - X) Mach 7 computational fluid dynamic (CFD).jpg|thumb|right|A simulation of the [[Hyper-X]] scramjet vehicle in operation at [[Mach number|Mach]]-7]] The fundamental basis of almost all CFD problems are the [[Navier–Stokes equations]], which define any single-phase (gas or liquid, but not both) fluid flow.  These equations can be simplified by removing terms describing [[viscous]] actions to yield the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]].  Further simplification, by removing terms describing [[vorticity]] yields the [[full potential equation]]s. Finally, for small [[Perturbation theory|perturbation]]s in subsonic and [[supersonic]] flows (not [[transonic]] or [[hypersonic]]) these equations can be [[Linearization|linearized]] to yield the linearized potential equations.

Historically, methods were first developed to solve the linearized potential equations. Two-dimensional (2D) methods, using [[conformal transformation]]s of the flow about a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] to the flow about an [[airfoil]] were developed in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Milne-Thomson|first=L.M.|authorlink=L. M. Milne-Thomson|title=Theoretical Aerodynamics|year=1973|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-61980-X}}</ref>

One of the earliest type of calculations resembling modern CFD are those by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]], in the sense that these calculations used finite differences and divided the physical space in cells. Although they failed dramatically, these calculations, together with Richardson's book "Weather prediction by numerical process",<ref>{{cite book|title=Weather prediction by numerical process|year=1965|publisher=Dover Publications|author=Richardson, L. F.|author2=Chapman, S.}}</ref> set the basis for modern CFD and numerical meteorology. In fact, early CFD calculations during the 1940s using [[ENIAC]] used methods close to those in Richardson's 1922 book.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hunt|title=Lewis Fry Richardson and his contributions to mathematics, meteorology, and models of conflict|journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics|year=1998|volume=30|doi=10.1146/annurev.fluid.30.1.0}}</ref>

The computer power available paced development of [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] methods.  Probably the first work using computers to model fluid flow, as governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, was performed at [[Los Alamos National Lab]], in the T3 group.<ref name=legacy_T3>{{cite web|title=The Legacy of Group T-3|url=https://www.lanl.gov/orgs/t/t3/history.shtml#early|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}</ref><ref name=harlow2004fluid>{{cite journal|last=Harlow|first=F.

Their method itself was simplified, in that it did not include lifting flows and hence was mainly applied to ship hulls and aircraft fuselages.  The first lifting Panel Code (A230) was described in a paper written by Paul Rubbert and Gary Saaris of Boeing Aircraft in 1968.<ref>Rubbert, Paul and Saaris, Gary, "Review and Evaluation of a Three-Dimensional Lifting Potential Flow Analysis Method for Arbitrary Configurations," AIAA paper 72-188, presented at the AIAA 10th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, San Diego California, January 1972.</ref>  In time, more advanced three-dimensional Panel Codes were developed at [[Boeing]] (PANAIR, A502),<ref>Carmichael, R. and Erickson, L.L., "PAN AIR - A Higher Order Panel Method for Predicting Subsonic or Supersonic Linear Potential Flows About Arbitrary Configurations," AIAA paper 81-1255, presented at the AIAA 14th Fluid and Plasma Dynamics Conference, Palo Alto California, June 1981.</ref> [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] (Quadpan),<ref>Youngren, H.H., Bouchard, E.E., Coopersmith, R.M. and Miranda, L.R., "Comparison of Panel Method Formulations and its Influence on the Development of QUADPAN, an Advanced Low Order Method," AIAA paper 83-1827, presented at the AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Conference, Danvers, Massachusetts, July 1983.</ref> [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] (HESS),<ref>Hess, J.L. and Friedman, D.M., "Analysis of Complex Inlet Configurations Using a Higher-Order Panel Method," AIAA paper 83-1828, presented at the AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Conference, Danvers, Massachusetts, July 1983.</ref> [[McDonnell Aircraft]] (MACAERO),<ref>Bristow, D.R., "Development of Panel Methods for Subsonic Analysis and Design," NASA CR-3234, 1980.</ref> [[NASA]] (PMARC)<ref>Ashby, Dale L.; Dudley, Michael R.; Iguchi, Steve K.; Browne, Lindsey and Katz, Joseph, “Potential Flow Theory and Operation Guide for the Panel Code PMARC”, NASA NASA-TM-102851 1991.</ref> and Analytical Methods (WBAERO,<ref>Woodward, F.A., Dvorak, F.A. and Geller, E.W., "A Computer Program for Three-Dimensional Lifting Bodies in Subsonic Inviscid Flow," USAAMRDL Technical Report, TR 74-18, Ft.

Some (PANAIR, HESS and MACAERO) were higher order codes, using higher order distributions of surface singularities, while others (Quadpan, PMARC, USAERO and VSAERO) used single singularities on each surface panel.  The advantage of the lower order codes was that they ran much faster on the computers of the time.  Today, VSAERO has grown to be a multi-order code and is the most widely used program of this class. It has been used in the development of many [[submarine]]s, surface [[ship]]s, [[automobile]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[aircraft]], and more recently [[wind turbines]].  Its sister code, USAERO is an unsteady panel method that has also been used for modeling such things as high speed trains and racing [[yacht]]s.  The NASA PMARC code from an early version of VSAERO and a derivative of PMARC, named CMARC,<ref>Pinella, David and Garrison, Peter, “Digital Wind Tunnel CMARC; Three-Dimensional Low-Order Panel Codes,” Aerologic, 2009.</ref> is also commercially available.

In the two-dimensional realm, a number of Panel Codes have been developed for airfoil analysis and design.  The codes typically have a [[boundary layer]] analysis included, so that viscous effects can be modeled.  Professor [[Richard Eppler]] of the [[University of Stuttgart]] developed the [[PROFILE]] code, partly with NASA funding, which became available in the early 1980s.<ref>Eppler, R.; Somers, D. M., "A Computer Program for the Design and Analysis of Low-Speed Airfoils," NASA TM-80210, 1980.</ref>  This was soon followed by [[MIT]] Professor Mark Drela's [[XFOIL]] code.<ref>Drela, Mark, "XFOIL: An Analysis and Design System for Low Reynolds Number Airfoils," in Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Engineering, No. 54, 1989.</ref> Both PROFILE and XFOIL incorporate two-dimensional panel codes, with coupled boundary layer codes for airfoil analysis work.  PROFILE uses a [[conformal transformation]] method for inverse airfoil design, while XFOIL has both a conformal transformation and an inverse panel method for airfoil design.

An intermediate step between Panel Codes and Full Potential codes were codes that used the Transonic Small Disturbance equations.  In particular, the three-dimensional WIBCO code,<ref>Boppe, C.W., "Calculation of Transonic Wing Flows by Grid Embedding," AIAA paper 77-207, presented at the AIAA 15th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Los Angeles California, January 1977.</ref> developed by Charlie Boppe of [[Grumman Aircraft]] in the early 1980s has seen heavy use.

Developers turned to Full Potential codes, as panel methods could not calculate the non-linear flow present at [[transonic]] speeds.  The first description of a means of using the Full Potential equations was published by Earll Murman and [[Julian Cole]] of Boeing in 1970.<ref>Murman, Earll and Cole, Julian, "Calculation of Plane Steady Transonic Flow," AIAA paper 70-188, presented at the AIAA 8th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, New York New York, January 1970.</ref> Frances Bauer, [[Paul Garabedian]] and [[David Korn (computer scientist)|David Korn]] of the Courant Institute at [[New York University]] (NYU) wrote a series of two-dimensional Full Potential airfoil codes that were widely used, the most important being named Program H.<ref>Bauer, F., Garabedian, P., and Korn, D. G., "A Theory of Supercritical Wing Sections, with Computer Programs and Examples," Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems 66, Springer-Verlag, May 1972. ISBN  978-3540058076</ref>  A further growth of Program H was developed by Bob Melnik and his group at [[Grumman Aerospace]] as Grumfoil.<ref>Mead, H. R.; Melnik, R. E., "GRUMFOIL: A computer code for the viscous transonic flow over airfoils," NASA CR-3806, 1985.</ref>  [[Antony Jameson]], originally at Grumman Aircraft and the Courant Institute of NYU, worked with David Caughey to develop the important three-dimensional Full Potential code FLO22<ref>Jameson A. and Caughey D., "A Finite Volume Method for Transonic Potential Flow Calculations," AIAA paper 77-635, presented at the Third AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Conference, Alburquerque New Mexico, June 1977.</ref> in 1975.  Many Full Potential codes emerged after this, culminating in Boeing's Tranair (A633) code,<ref>Samant, S.S., Bussoletti J.E., Johnson F.T., Burkhart, R.H., Everson, B.L., Melvin, R.G., Young, D.P., Erickson, L.L., Madson M.D. and Woo, A.C., "TRANAIR: A Computer Code for Transonic Analyses of Arbitrary Configurations," AIAA paper 87-0034, presented at the AIAA 25th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno Nevada, January 1987.</ref> which still sees heavy use.

The next step was the Euler equations, which promised to provide more accurate solutions of transonic flows.  The methodology used by Jameson in his three-dimensional FLO57 code<ref>Jameson, A., Schmidt, W. and Turkel, E., "Numerical Solution of the Euler Equations by Finite Volume Methods Using Runge-Kutta Time-Stepping Schemes," AIAA paper 81-1259, presented at the AIAA 14th Fluid and Plasma Dynamics
Conference, Palo Alto California, 1981.</ref> (1981) was used by others to produce such programs as Lockheed's TEAM program<ref>Raj, P. and Brennan, J.E., "Improvements to an Euler Aerodynamic Method for Transonic Flow Simulation," AIAA paper 87-0040, presented at the 25th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno Nevada, January 1987.</ref> and IAI/Analytical Methods' MGAERO program.<ref>Tidd, D.M., Strash, D.J., Epstein, B., Luntz, A., Nachshon A. and Rubin T., "Application of an Efficient 3-D Multigrid Euler Method (MGAERO) to Complete Aircraft Configuraitons," AIAA paper 91-3236, presented at the AIAA 9th Applied Aerodynamics Conference, Baltimore Maryland, September 1991.</ref>  MGAERO is unique in being a structured [[cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] mesh code, while most other such codes use structured body-fitted grids (with the exception of NASA's highly successful CART3D code,<ref>Melton, J.E., Berger, M.J., Aftosmis, M.J. and Wong, M.D., "3D Application of a Cartesian Grid Euler Method," AIAA paper 95-0853, presented at the 33rd Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, Reno Nevada, January 1995.</ref> Lockheed's SPLITFLOW code<ref>Karmna, Steve L.

In the two-dimensional realm, Mark Drela and Michael Giles, then graduate students at MIT, developed the ISES Euler program<ref>Giles, M., Drela, M. and Thompkins, W.T. Jr., "Newton Solution of Direct and Inverse Transonic Euler Equations," AIAA paper 85-1530, presented at the Third Symposium on Numerical and Physical Aspects of Aerodynamic Flows, Long Beach, California, January 1985.</ref> (actually a suite of programs) for airfoil design and analysis.  This code first became available in 1986 and has been further developed to design, analyze and optimize single or multi-element airfoils, as the MSES program.<ref>Drela, M. "Newton Solution of Coupled Viscous/Inviscid Multielement Airfoil Flows,", AIAA paper 90-1470, presented at the AIAA 21st Fluid Dynamics, Plasma Dynamics and Lasers Conference, Seattle Washington, June 1990.</ref>  MSES sees wide use throughout the world.  A derivative of MSES, for the design and analysis of airfoils in a cascade, is MISES,<ref>Drela, M. and Youngren H., "A User's Guide to MISES 2.53", MIT Computational Sciences Laboratory, December 1998.</ref> developed by Harold "Guppy" Youngren while he was a graduate student at MIT.

The Navier–Stokes equations were the ultimate target of developers.  Two-dimensional codes, such as NASA Ames' ARC2D code first emerged.  A number of three-dimensional codes were developed (ARC3D, [[Overflow (software)|OVERFLOW]], CFL3D are three successful NASA contributions), leading to numerous commercial packages.

==Methodology==
In all of these approaches the same basic procedure is followed.
* During [[preprocessor (CAE)|preprocessing]]
** The [[geometry]] (physical bounds) of the problem is defined.
** The [[volume]] occupied by the fluid is divided into discrete cells (the mesh). The mesh may be uniform or non-uniform.
** The physical modeling is defined – for example, the equations of motion + [[enthalpy]] + radiation + species conservation
** Boundary conditions are defined. This involves specifying the fluid behaviour and properties at the boundaries of the problem. For transient problems, the initial conditions are also defined.
* The [[computer simulation|simulation]] is started and the equations are solved iteratively as a steady-state or transient.
* Finally a postprocessor is used for the analysis and visualization of the resulting solution.

===Discretization methods===
{{see|Discretization of Navier–Stokes equations}}

The stability of the selected discretisation is generally established numerically rather than analytically as with simple linear problems.  Special care must also be taken to ensure that the discretisation handles discontinuous solutions gracefully.  The [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] and [[Navier–Stokes equations]] both admit shocks, and contact surfaces.

Some of the discretisation methods being used are:

==== Finite volume method ====

{{Main|Finite volume method}}

The finite volume method (FVM) is a common approach used in CFD codes, as it has an advantage in [[Random-access memory|memory]] usage and solution speed, especially for large problems, high [[Reynolds number]] turbulent flows, and source term dominated flows (like combustion).<ref>{{cite book|last=Patankar|first=Suhas V.|authorlink=Suhas Patankar|title=Numerical Heat Transfer and Fluid FLow|year=1980|publisher=Hemisphere Publishing Corporation
|isbn=0891165223}}</ref>

In the finite volume method, the governing partial differential equations (typically the Navier-Stokes equations, the mass and energy conservation equations, and the turbulence equations) are recast in a conservative form, and then solved over discrete control volumes. This [[discretise|discretisation]] guarantees the conservation of fluxes through a particular control volume. The finite volume equation yields governing equations in the form,
:<math>\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\iiint Q\, dV + \iint F\, d\mathbf{A} = 0,</math>
where <math>Q</math> is the vector of conserved variables, <math>F</math> is the vector of fluxes (see [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] or [[Navier–Stokes equations]]), <math>V</math> is the volume of the control volume element, and <math>\mathbf{A}</math> is the surface area of the control volume element.

==== Finite element method ====

{{Main|Finite element method}}

The finite element method (FEM) is used in structural analysis of solids, but is also applicable to fluids.  However, the FEM formulation requires special care to ensure a conservative solution. The FEM formulation has been adapted for use with fluid dynamics governing equations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Although FEM must be carefully formulated to be conservative, it is much more stable than the finite volume approach.<ref>{{cite journal

In this method, a weighted residual equation is formed:

:<math>R_i = \iiint W_i Q \, dV^e</math>

where <math>R_i</math> is the equation residual at an element vertex <math>i</math>, <math>Q</math> is the conservation equation expressed on an element basis, <math>W_i</math> is the weight factor, and <math>V^{e}</math> is the volume of the element.

==== Finite difference method ====

{{Main|Finite difference method}}

The finite difference method (FDM) has historical importance{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and is simple to program.  It is currently only used in few specialized codes, which handle complex geometry with high accuracy and efficiency by using embedded boundaries or overlapping grids (with the solution interpolated across each grid).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} 
:<math> 
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t}+
\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}+
\frac{\partial G}{\partial y}+
\frac{\partial H}{\partial z}=0
</math>
where <math>Q</math> is the vector of conserved variables, and <math>F</math>, <math>G</math>, and <math>H</math> are the fluxes in the <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, and <math>z</math> directions respectively.

==== Spectral element method ====

{{Main|Spectral element method}}

Spectral element method is a finite element type method. It requires the mathematical problem (the partial differential equation) to be cast in a weak formulation. This is typically done by multiplying the differential equation by an arbitrary test function and integrating over the whole domain. Purely mathematically, the test functions are completely arbitrary - they belong to an infinitely dimensional function space. Clearly an infinitely dimensional function space cannot be represented on a discrete spectral element mesh. And this is where the spectral element discretization begins. The most crucial thing is the choice of interpolating and testing functions. In a standard, low order FEM in 2D, for quadrilateral elements the most typical choice is the bilinear test or interpolating function of the form <math>v(x,y) = ax+by+cxy+d</math>. In a spectral element method however, the interpolating and test functions are chosen to be polynomials of a very high order (typically e.g. of the 10th order in CFD applications). This guarantees the rapid convergence of the method. Furthermore, very efficient integration procedures must be used, since the number of integrations to be performed in a numerical codes is big. Thus, high order Gauss integration quadratures are employed, since they achieve the highest accuracy with the smallest number of computations to be carried out.
At the time there are some academic CFD codes based on the spectral element method and some more are currently under development, since the new time-stepping schemes arise in the scientific world. You can refer to the [http://c-cfd.meil.pw.edu.pl/ccfd/index.php?item=7 C-CFD] website to see movies of incompressible flows in channels simulated with a spectral element solver or to the [http://numerical-mechanics.com/page19.php Numerical Mechanics (see bottom of the page)] website to see a movie of the lid-driven cavity flow obtained with a compeletely novel unconditionally stable time-stepping scheme combined with a spectral element solver.

==== Boundary element method ====

{{Main|Boundary element method}}

In the boundary element method, the boundary occupied by the fluid is divided into a surface mesh.

==== High-resolution discretization schemes ====

{{Main|High-resolution scheme}}

High-resolution schemes are used where shocks or discontinuities are present. Capturing sharp changes in the solution requires the use of second or higher-order numerical schemes that do not introduce spurious oscillations. This usually necessitates the application of [[flux limiters]] to ensure that the solution is [[total variation diminishing]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Turbulence models===
{{Expand section|
* Models should be listed in some order (increasing cost, increasing accuracy, alphabetically...)
* Add the [[One-dimensional turbulence]] model (and its predecessor [[Linear eddy model]])
|date=November 2010}}

In computational modeling of turbulent flows, one common objective is to obtain a model that can predict quantities of interest, such as fluid velocity, for use in engineering designs of the system being modeled.  For turbulent flows, the range of length scales and complexity of phenomena involved in turbulence make most modeling approaches prohibitively expensive; the resolution required to resolve all scales involved in turbulence is beyond what is computationally possible.  The primary approach in such cases is to create numerical models to approximate unresolved phenomena.  This section lists some commonly-used computational models for turbulent flows.

Turbulence models can be classified based on computational expense, which corresponds to the range of scales that are modeled versus resolved (the more turbulent scales that are resolved, the finer the resolution of the simulation, and therefore the higher the computational cost). If a majority or all of the turbulent scales are not modeled, the computational cost is very low, but the tradeoff comes in the form of decreased accuracy.

In addition to the wide range of length and time scales and the associated computational cost, the governing equations of fluid dynamics contain a [[Nonlinear system|non-linear]] convection term and a non-linear and non-local pressure gradient term.  These nonlinear equations must be solved numerically with the appropriate boundary and initial conditions.

==== Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes ====
{{main|Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations}}

[[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations|Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes]] (RANS) equations are the oldest approach to turbulence modeling. An ensemble version of the governing equations is solved, which introduces new ''apparent stresses'' known as [[Reynolds stresses]]. This adds a second order tensor of unknowns for which various models can provide different levels of closure. It is a common misconception that the RANS equations do not apply to flows with a time-varying mean flow because these equations are 'time-averaged'. In fact, statistically unsteady (or non-stationary) flows can equally be treated. This is sometimes referred to as URANS. There is nothing inherent in Reynolds averaging to preclude this, but the turbulence models used to close the equations are valid only as long as the time over which these changes in the mean occur is large compared to the time scales of the turbulent motion containing most of the energy.

RANS models can be divided into two broad approaches:

; [[Boussinesq approximation|Boussinesq hypothesis]]: This method involves using an algebraic equation for the Reynolds stresses which include determining the turbulent viscosity, and depending on the level of sophistication of the model, solving transport equations for determining the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation. Models include k-? ([[Brian Launder|Launder]] and [[Brian Spalding|Spalding]]),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Launder|first=B. E.|author2=D. B. Spalding|year=1974|title= The Numerical Computation of Turbulent Flows|journal=Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering|pages=269–289|doi = 10.1016/0045-7825(74)90029-2|bibcode = 1974CMAME...3..269L|volume=3|issue=2 }}</ref> Mixing Length Model ([[Ludwig Prandtl|Prandtl]]),<ref name=wilcox>{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=David C.|title=Turbulence Modeling for CFD|year=2006|publisher=DCW Industries, Inc.|isbn=978-1-928729-08-2|edition=3}}</ref> and Zero Equation Model (Cebeci and [[Apollo M. O. Smith|Smith]]).<ref name=wilcox /> The models available in this approach are often referred to by the number of transport equations associated with the method. For example, the Mixing Length model is a "Zero Equation" model because no transport equations are solved; the <math>k-\epsilon</math> is a "Two Equation" model because two transport equations (one for <math>k</math> and one for <math>\epsilon</math>) are solved.
; [[Reynolds stress model]] (RSM): This approach attempts to actually solve transport equations for the Reynolds stresses. This means introduction of several transport equations for all the Reynolds stresses and hence this approach is much more costly in CPU effort.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

====Large eddy simulation====
{{main|Large eddy simulation}}

[[Image:LESPremixedFlame.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Volume rendering of a non-premixed swirl flame as simulated by LES.]]
[[Large eddy simulation]] (LES) is a technique in which the smallest scales of the flow are removed through a filtering operation, and their effect modeled using subgrid scale models.  This allows the largest and most important scales of the turbulence to be resolved, while greatly reducing the computational cost incurred by the smallest scales. This method requires greater computational resources than RANS methods, but is far cheaper than DNS.

====Detached eddy simulation====
{{main|Detached eddy simulation}}

[[Detached eddy simulation]]s (DES) is a modification of a RANS model in which the model switches to a subgrid scale formulation in regions fine enough for LES calculations. Regions near solid boundaries and where the turbulent length scale is less than the maximum grid dimension are assigned the RANS mode of solution. As the turbulent length scale exceeds the grid dimension, the regions are solved using the LES mode. Therefore the grid resolution for DES is not as demanding as pure LES, thereby considerably cutting down the cost of the computation. Though DES was initially formulated for the Spalart-Allmaras model (Spalart et al., 1997), it can be implemented with other RANS models (Strelets, 2001), by appropriately modifying the length scale which is explicitly or implicitly involved in the RANS model. So while Spalart-Allmaras model based DES acts as LES with a wall model, DES based on other models (like two equation models) behave as a hybrid RANS-LES model. Grid generation is more complicated than for a simple RANS or LES case due to the RANS-LES switch. DES is a non-zonal approach and provides a single smooth velocity field across the RANS and the LES regions of the solutions.

====Direct numerical simulation====
{{main|Direct numerical simulation}}

[[Direct numerical simulation]] (DNS) resolves the entire range of turbulent length scales.  This marginalizes the effect of models, but is extremely expensive.  The computational cost is proportional to <math>Re^{3}</math>.<ref name="Pope_2000">{{cite book|title=Turbulent Flows|author=Pope, S. B.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-59886-6}}</ref> DNS is intractable for flows with complex geometries or flow configurations.

====Coherent vortex simulation====

The coherent vortex simulation approach decomposes the turbulent flow field into a coherent part, consisting of organized vortical motion, and the incoherent part, which is the random background flow.<ref name="Farge_2001">{{cite journal
|title=Coherent Vortex Simulation (CVS), A Semi-Deterministic Turbulence Model Using Wavelets

|pages=393–426
|doi=10.1023/A:1013512726409
|year=2001}}</ref>  This decomposition is done using [[wavelet]] filtering.  The approach has much in common with LES, since it uses decomposition and resolves only the filtered portion, but different in that it does not use a linear, low-pass filter.  Instead, the filtering operation is based on wavelets, and the filter can be adapted as the flow field evolves.  Farge and Schneider tested the CVS method with two flow configurations and showed that the coherent portion of the flow exhibited the <math>-\frac{40}{39}</math> energy spectrum exhibited by the total flow, and corresponded to coherent structures ([[vortex stretching|vortex tubes]]), while the incoherent parts of the flow composed homogeneous background noise, which exhibited no organized structures.

By employing both LES and CVS filtering, they showed that the SFS dissipation was dominated by the SFS flow field's coherent portion.

====PDF methods====

[[Probability density function]] (PDF) methods for turbulence, first introduced by [[Thomas S. Lundgren|Lundgren]],<ref name="Lundgren_1969">{{cite journal

This approach is analogous to the [[kinetic theory]] of gases, in which the macroscopic properties of a gas are described by a large number of particles.  PDF methods are unique in that they can be applied in the framework of a number of different turbulence models; the main differences occur in the form of the PDF transport equation.  For example, in the context of [[large eddy simulation]], the PDF becomes the filtered PDF.<ref name="Colucci_1998">{{cite journal

The PDF is commonly tracked by using Lagrangian particle methods; when combined with large eddy simulation, this leads to a [[Langevin equation]] for subfilter particle evolution.

====Vortex method====
{{expand section|disadvantages of the method, accessment of reasons behind it not being used everywhere.|date=September 2013}}
The vortex method is a grid-free technique for the simulation of turbulent flows. It uses vortices as the computational elements, mimicking the physical structures in turbulence. Vortex methods were developed as a grid-free methodology that would not be limited by the fundamental smoothing effects associated with grid-based methods. To be practical, however, vortex methods require means for rapidly computing velocities from the vortex elements – in other words they require the solution to a particular form of the [[N-body problem]] (in which the motion of N objects is tied to their mutual influences). A breakthrough came in the late 1980s with the development of the [[fast multipole method]] (FMM), an algorithm by V. Rokhlin (Yale) and L. Greengard (Courant Institute). This breakthrough paved the way to practical computation of the velocities from the vortex elements and is the basis of successful algorithms.  They are especially well-suited to simulating filamentary motion, such as wisps of smoke, in real-time simulations such as video games, because of the fine detail achieved using minimal computation.<ref>{{cite web

Software based on the vortex method offer a new means for solving tough fluid dynamics problems with minimal user intervention.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  All that is required is specification of problem geometry and setting of boundary and initial conditions. Among the significant advantages of this modern technology;
* It is practically grid-free, thus eliminating numerous iterations associated with RANS and LES.
* All problems are treated identically. No modeling or calibration inputs are required.
* Time-series simulations, which are crucial for correct analysis of acoustics, are possible.
* The small scale and large scale are accurately simulated at the same time.

====Vorticity confinement method====

{{Main|Vorticity confinement}}

The [[vorticity confinement]] (VC) method is an Eulerian technique used in the simulation of turbulent wakes. It uses a solitary-wave like approach to produce a stable solution with no numerical spreading. VC can capture the small scale features to within as few as 2 grid cells. Within these features, a nonlinear difference equation is solved as opposed to the [[finite difference equation]]. VC is similar to [[shock capturing methods]], where conservation laws are satisfied, so that the essential integral quantities are accurately computed.

====Linear eddy model====

The Linear eddy model is a technique used to simulate the convective mixing that takes place in turbulent flow.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Krueger|first=Steven K.|title=Linear Eddy Simulations Of Mixing In A Homogeneous Turbulent Flow|journal=Physics Of Fluids|year=1993|volume=5|issue=4|pages=1023|accessdate=2 December 2012|bibcode = 1993PhFl....5.1023M |doi = 10.1063/1.858667 }}</ref> Specifically, it provides a mathematical way to describe the interactions of a scalar variable within the vector flow field. It is primarily used in one-dimensional representations of turbulent flow, since it can be applied across a wide range of length scales and Reynolds numbers. This model is generally used as a building block for more complicated flow representations, as it provides high resolution predictions that hold across a large range of flow conditions.

===Two-phase flow===

The modeling of [[two-phase flow]] is still under development. Different methods have been proposed lately.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hirt|last2=Nichols|first1=C.W.|first2=B.D.|title=Volume of fluid (VOF) method for the dynamics of free boundaries|year=1981|publisher=Journal of Computational Physics }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Unverdi |first1=S.

Phys}}</ref> The [[Volume of fluid method]] has received a lot of attention lately,{{by whom|date=November 2010}} for problems that do not have dispersed particles,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} but the [[Level set method]] and [[front tracking]] are also valuable approaches {{According to whom|date=November 2010}}. Most of these methods are either good in maintaining a sharp interface or at conserving mass {{According to whom|date=November 2010}}.  This is crucial since the evaluation of the density, viscosity and surface tension is based on the values averaged over the interface.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Lagrangian multiphase models, which are used for dispersed media, are based on solving the Lagrangian equation of motion for the dispersed phase.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Solution algorithms===

Discretization in the space produces a system of [[ordinary differential equations]] for unsteady problems and algebraic equations for steady problems. Implicit or semi-implicit methods are generally used to integrate the ordinary differential equations, producing a system of (usually) nonlinear algebraic equations.  Applying a [[Newton's method#Nonlinear systems of equations|Newton]] or [[Fixed point iteration|Picard]] iteration produces a system of linear equations which is nonsymmetric in the presence of advection and indefinite in the presence of incompressibility. Such systems, particularly in 3D, are frequently too large for direct solvers, so iterative methods are used, either stationary methods such as [[Successive over-relaxation|successive overrelaxation]] or [[Krylov subspace]] methods. Krylov methods such as [[Generalized minimal residual method|GMRES]], typically used with [[Preconditioner|preconditioning]], operate by minimizing the residual over successive subspaces generated by the preconditioned operator.

[[Multigrid method|Multigrid]] has the advantage of asymptotically optimal performance on many problems. Traditional{{According to whom|date=November 2010}} solvers and preconditioners are effective at reducing high-frequency components of the residual, but low-frequency components typically require many iterations to reduce. By operating on multiple scales, multigrid reduces all components of the residual by similar factors, leading to a mesh-independent number of iterations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

For indefinite systems, preconditioners such as [[incomplete LU factorization]], [[Additive Schwarz method|additive Schwarz]], and [[Multigrid method|multigrid]] perform poorly or fail entirely, so the problem structure must be used for effective preconditioning.<ref>{{cite journal

'''Vitrification''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''vitreum'', "glass" via [[French language|French]] ''vitrifier'') is the transformation of a substance into a [[glass]].<ref>A.K. Varshneya. Fundamentals of inorganic glasses. Sheffield: Society of Glass Technology, 2006.</ref> Usually, it is achieved by rapidly cooling a liquid through the [[glass transition]]. Certain chemical reactions also result in glasses. An important application is the vitrification of an antifreeze-like liquid in [[cryopreservation]].

Vitrification is characteristic for amorphous materials or disordered systems and occurs when bonding between elementary particles (atoms, molecules, forming blocks) becomes higher than a certain threshold value.<ref>M.I. Ojovan, W.E. Lee. Connectivity and glass transition in disordered oxide systems J. Non-Cryst. Solids, 356, 2534-2540 (2010).</ref> Thermal fluctuations break the bonds; therefore, the lower the temperature, the higher the degree of connectivity. Because of that amorphous materials have a characteristic threshold temperature termed glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>): below T<sub>g</sub> amorphous materials are glassy whereas above T<sub>g</sub> they are molten.

In a wider sense, the embedding of material in a glassy matrix is also called ''vitrification''. An important application is the [[radioactive waste#Vitrification|vitrification of radioactive waste]] to obtain a stable compound that is suitable for ultimate disposal.

==Examples==
When [[sucrose]] is cooled slowly it results in crystal [[sugar]] (or [[rock candy]]), but when cooled rapidly it can form syrupy [[cotton candy]] (candyfloss). In the process of vitrification the solid waste is exposed to heat and is converted into a sort of glass-like substance.

Vitrification can also occur when starting with a liquid such as water, usually through very rapid cooling or the introduction of agents that suppress the formation of [[ice]] crystals. This is in contrast to ordinary [[freezing]] which results in ice crystal formation. Additives used in [[cryobiology]] or produced naturally by organisms living in [[polar region]]s are called [[cryoprotectant]]s.

[[Arctic]] [[frog]]s and some other [[ectotherm]]s naturally produce [[glycerol]] or [[glucose]] in their [[liver]]s to reduce ice formation. When glucose is used as a cryoprotectant by arctic frogs, massive amounts of glucose are released at low temperature and a special form of [[insulin]] allows for this extra glucose to enter the cells. When the frog rewarms during [[spring (season)|spring]], the extra glucose must be rapidly eliminated, but stored. Arctic [[insect]]s also use sugars as cryoprotectants. Arctic fish use [[antifreeze protein]]s, sometimes appended with sugars, as cryoprotectants.

==Applications==
Ordinary [[Soda-lime glass|soda-lime]] [[glass]], used in windows and drinking containers, is created by the addition of [[sodium carbonate]] and lime ([[calcium oxide]]) to [[silicon dioxide]]. Without these additives silicon dioxide will require very high temperature to obtain a melt and subsequently (with slow cooling) a glass.

Vitrification is a proven technique in the disposal and long-term storage of [[nuclear waste]] or other hazardous wastes<ref>	M.I. Ojovan, W.E. Lee. Glassy wasteforms for nuclear waste immobilisation. Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A, 42 (4), 837-851 (2011).</ref> in a method called [[geomelting]]. Waste is mixed with glass-forming chemicals in a melter to form molten glass that then solidifies in canisters, immobilizing the waste. The final waste form resembles [[obsidian]] and is a non-[[leachate|leaching]], durable material that effectively traps the waste inside. The waste can be stored for relatively long periods in this form without concern for [[air pollution|air]] or [[groundwater]] [[radioactive contamination|contamination]]. Bulk vitrification uses [[electrode]]s to melt soil and wastes where they lay buried. The hardened waste may then be disinterred with less danger of widespread contamination. According to the [[Pacific Northwest National Labs]], "Vitrification locks dangerous materials into a stable glass form that will last for thousands of years."<ref name="Waste">{{cite web  | title = Waste Form Release Calculations for the 2005 Integrated Disposal Facility Performance Assessment | work = PNNL-15198 |  publisher = Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  | date = July 2005 | format = [[PDF]] | url=http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-15198.pdf 
 | accessdate = 2006-11-08 }}</ref>

[[Ethylene glycol]] is used as automotive [[antifreeze]] and [[propylene glycol]] has been used to reduce ice crystals in [[ice cream]], making it smoother.

[[Vitrification in cryopreservation]] is used as a common method to preserve, for example, human egg cells ([[oocyte]]s) (in [[oocyte cryopreservation]]) and embryos (in [[embryo cryopreservation]]). For years, [[glycerol]] has been used in [[cryobiology]] as a cryoprotectant for blood cells and bull sperm, allowing storage at [[nitrogen|liquid nitrogen]] temperatures. However, glycerol cannot be used to protect whole [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] from damage. Instead, many biotechnology companies are researching the development of other cryoprotectants more suitable for such uses. A successful discovery may eventually make possible the bulk [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] storage (or "banking") of [[organ transplant|transplantable]] human and [[xenobiotic]] organs. A substantial step in that direction has already occurred.  [[Twenty-First Century Medicine]] has vitrified a [[rabbit]] [[kidney]] to -135°C with their proprietary vitrification cocktail. Upon rewarming, the kidney was successfully transplanted into a rabbit, with complete functionality and viability, able to sustain the rabbit indefinitely as the sole functioning kidney.<ref name="KidVit">{{cite journal | author=Fahy GM, Wowk B, Pagotan R, Chang A, Phan J, Thomson B, Phan L | title=Physical and biological aspects of renal vitrification| journal=ORGANOGENESIS  | volume=5 | issue=3 | year=2009 | pages=167–175  | id= | pmc=2781097 | pmid=20046680 | doi=10.4161/org.5.3.9974}}</ref>

Currently, vitrification techniques have only been applied to brains ([[neurovitrification]]) by [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation|Alcor]] and to the upper body by the [[Cryonics Institute]], but research is in progress by both organizations to apply vitrification to the whole body.

'''Harold Samuel Shapero''' (April 29, 1920&nbsp;– May 17, 2013) was an American composer.

==Early years==
Shapero was born in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] on April 29, 1920. He and his family later moved to nearby [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]]. He learned to play the piano as a child, and for some years was a pianist in dance orchestras {{harv|Kennedy|2006}}. With a friend, he founded the Hal Kenny Orchestra, a swing-era jazz band.

He was more interested in classical music. In his teens some of his teachers included [[Nicolas Slonimsky]] (editor of Baker's ''Biographical Dictionary of Musicians'') in 1936 and [[Ernst Krenek]] in 1937 {{harv|Tommasini|2013}}. At 18 he entered [[Harvard]], where he became friends with [[Leonard Bernstein]] and studied composition with [[Walter Piston]] in 1938 {{harv|Tommasini|2013}}. He also studied with [[Paul Hindemith]] at the Berkshire Music Center in 1940–41 {{harv|Pollack|2001}}.

Shapero was one of the first students at [[Tanglewood]] following its founding in the 1940s. When [[Igor Stravinsky]] was Norton Professor at Harvard in 1940, Shapero showed Stravinsky his ''Nine-Minute Overture''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Shapero hoped to get the Overture played at Tanglewood that summer, but Hindemith ordered that no student compositions would be played that season. [[Aaron Copland]] hastily put together an orchestra to play student compositions, including Shapero's Overture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Shapero was awarded the [[Rome Prize]] in 1941 for his ''Nine-Minute Overture'', which included a $1000 award. [[World War II]] prevented him from taking advantage of the residency in [[Italy]] the prize provided {{harv|Anon.|1941}}.

At Harvard he held the [[Walter W. Naumburg Foundation|Naumberg]] and Paine Fellowships. After graduating in 1941 {{harv|Anon.|1946b}}, Shapero undertook further studies with [[Nadia Boulanger]] at the Longy School of Music in 1942–43 {{harv|Pollack|2001}}. While studying with her, Shapero was also in contact with Stravinsky, who was helpful in his critiques of Shapero's music.

==Postwar years==
Shapero's output was prolific in the 1940s and included three piano sonatas, the Sonata for Violin and Piano, and a variety of songs and works for chamber ensembles. His major work was the ''[[Symphony for Classical Orchestra]]'', 45-minute work in four movements {{harv|Tommasini|2013}}. Decades later, he told a ''New York Times'' interviewer that was unaware while composing it of how lengthy it had become, that he "had wildly miscalculated my materials. When I measured out the slow movement, I was shocked. It was 15 minutes. I stopped working for a month. Then I tried to cut the thing. But it fought me and won. Slowly I became aware, with horror, of what I was writing: a long and difficult symphony. I thought I'd never get it performed" {{harv|Tommasini|1999}}. In 1946 Shapero won the [[Joseph H. Bearns Prize]] of US$1200 for the Symphony for String Orchestra {{harv|Anon.|1946b}}. Leonard Bernstein "fell in love" with the work and led its premiere with the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] in January 1948. [[Georg Szell]], though far less enthusiastic about the work, gave its second performance with the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] in March. Reviews were mixed {{harv|Tommasini|2013}}. It received an award from the Koussevitsky Foundation {{harv|Tommasini|1999}}. Bernstein recorded the work in 1953, but it was largely forgotten until revived in 1986 by [[André Previn]] to positive reviews. Previn recorded the work and played it several times with other orchestras {{harv|Tommasini|2013}}.

In 1945, Shapero married the painter Esther Geller. Throughout the rest of the decade they were often residents at the [[MacDowell Colony]] in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]] {{harv|Ng|2013}}. In 1946 he won the second annual George Gershwin Memorial Contest for his Serenade in D {{harv|Anon.|1946a}}, which included a performance of one movement from the work at [[Carnegie Hall]] on February 13, 1946. The prize also included publication of the score with royalties and US $1000. It was the first time Shapero had a score published.

Aaron Copland thought highly of Shapero's technical skill and the spontaneity of musical inspiration. Once, after being impressed with Shapero's Woodwind Quintet, he teased Leonard Bernstein, who was two years ahead of Shapero at Harvard with a note: "Look to your laurels! There may be another composer in your neighborhood!" {{harv|Tommasini|1999}}. But in a 1948 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, he wrote: "Stylistically, Shapero seems to feel a compulsion to fashion his music after some great model. Thus, his ... Serenade ... is founded upon neoclassical Stravinskian principles, his three ''Amateur Piano Sonatas'' on Haydnesque principles, and his recent long ''Symphony [for Classical Orchestra]'' is modeled after Beethoven.... [H]e seems to be suffering from a hero-worship complex&mdash;or perhaps it is a freakish attack of false modesty" {{harv|Copland|1948}}.

In the 1940s Shapero was closely associated with fellow Piston students [[Arthur Berger]] and [[Irving Fine]] in a "Stravinsky school" of American composers—a phrase first coined by Copland {{harv|Pollack|2001}}. He was also grouped in the "[[Boston School (music)|Boston school]]" along with [[Arthur Berger]], [[Lukas Foss]], [[Irving Fine]], [[Alexei Haieff|Alexeï Haieff]], and [[Claudio Spies]] {{harv|Taruskin|1997|loc=457}}.

He won a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1946 {{harv|Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|2013}}. He won the first of his two [[Fulbright Fellowship]]s in 1948.

His output fell off by the 1960s as his neo-classical style met increasing resistance, especially in academic music circles. He told an interviewer in 1986 that "Comfortable university life is a disaster, especially if you have a university that doesn’t pressure you to produce or perish. And I had a young child. I like home handicrafts and hobbies. I like gardening. I like photography. So it was only too easy to put off some of those hard operations like writing music" {{harv|Tommasini|2013}}.

In 1951 he was a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome {{harv|American Academy in Rome|n.d.(a)}}. That same year, [[Brandeis University]] hired Shapero and he later became chairman of the department and founder of its electronic music studio with the day's most advanced synthesizers. He taught at Brandeis for 37 years {{harv|Tommasini|2013}}. His notable students include [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], [[Gustav Ciamaga]], [[Scott Wheeler (composer)|Scott Wheeler]], and [[Richard Wernick]].

His daughter, Hannah Shapero, was born in 1953. She became a commercial artist and electronic musician {{harv|Tommasini|2013}}.

When Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic played the local premiere of Shapero's ''Credo'' in 1958, a work commissioned by the Louisville Orchestra, [[Harold Schonberg]] wrote: "The new Shapero work is in one movement, lasts about eight and a half minutes, ... a quiet and sensitive mood piece, harmonically rather conservative (a Copland type of conservatism, with strong echoes of ''Our Town''), but unmistakably of this generation. Mr. Shapero orchestrates beautifully; some of his combinations are very effective" {{harv|Schonberg|1958}}.

When awarded his second Fulbright Fellowship in 1961, Shapero took the opportunity to travel to Europe with his family for a year. In 1971 he returned to Europe to be composer-in-residence at the American Academy in Rome {{harv|American Academy in Rome|n.d.(b)}}.

In 1988, Shapero retired from Brandeis University. Encouraged by André Previn's interest in his work in the late 1980s, Shapero returned to composition. His late works included ''Three Hebrew Songs for Tenor, Piano and Strings Orchestra'' (1989) and, not long before his death, ''24 Bagatelles for Piano'' {{harv|Tommasini|2013}}.

Shapero died in a nursing home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 17, 2013, following complications from pneumonia ({{harvnb|Bowles|2013}}; {{harvnb|Ng|2013}}; {{harvnb|Tommasini|2013}}.

==Analyses==
''Symphony for Classical Orchestra''. The instrumentation is largely classical with a few modern additions: woodwinds in pairs, plus piccolo and contrabassoon, pairs of horns and trumpets, three trombones, three timpani, and the standard complement of strings. [[Alan Rich]] called it "the greatest American symphony" (Rich, cited in {{harvnb|Tommasini|1999}}). [[Anthony Tommasini]] has described it:
{{quote|The models for Mr. Shapero, in this work and in general, were Stravinsky, who was then in his prolonged Neo-Classical period, and Beethoven, who remains Mr. Shapero's hero. Indeed, the Symphony for Classical Orchestra is in some ways a soul mate of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, which it slyly quotes.<br>
As in the Beethoven, the first of its four movements opens with an Adagio that shimmers with flickering colors and sustained harmonies, leading to a long, bustling, contrapuntal Allegro. The second movement is a wistfully lyrical yet rhythmically restless Adagietto; then comes a misbehaving Scherzo, which hurtles toward the imposingly structured but spirited Finale.<br>
Mr. Shapero, however, fractures the Classical models while paying homage. The piece is essentially tonal, with the outer movements hewing to B flat; but the harmonic language contains elements of polytonality, and the music is spiky with dissonance, rhythmically shifty and utterly fresh. Phrases are filled with surprising asymmetries. There is a youthful challenge in Mr. Shapero's tribute, as if he were saying, "Take that, Beethoven!" It's the same quality that you hear in early Beethoven: "I'll show you, my revered teacher Haydn, how to write a piano sonata." Or that you see in early Picasso: "Take that, Cézanne!" {{harv|Tommasini|1999}} }}
In the ''Los Angeles Times'', Martin Bernheimer wrote of a 1986 performance of the Symphony that "Shapero reveals himself here as a superb craftsman, an artist totally in control of the grandiose variables at hand." He called the writing "clever, subtle, elegant" and added that the symphony "isn't affecting in spite of the inherent anachronisms, but because of them" {{harv|Bernheimer|1986|loc=4}}.

While Shapero uses some modern notation in his scores, he employs only procedures that have already been established by other modern composers or that are derived from traditional notation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

'''''Phelsuma astriata astriata''''' is a [[subspecies]] of [[Seychelles small day gecko]]. It is a small, slender [[lizard]] with bright green colour that feeds primarily on insects. It is found on several islands of the [[Seychelles]]. 

== Description ==
Its body is lime green with coloured dots and bars on the back. Those reddish dots sometimes form a mid-dorsal stripe, which can be very faint. Males often have a bluish or turquoise-coloured tail and lower back. On both sides of the snout, a reddish-brown stripe extends from the nostrils to the eyes. The undersurface of the body is off-white. These lizards reach a total length of about 14 cm. 

== Distribution ==
This gecko is found on the Seychelles islands of [[Astove Island|Astove]], [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahé]], [[Praslin]], [[Curieuse Island|Curieuse]], [[La Digue]], and Frégate.

== Habitat ==
This species is typically found on [[coconut]] palms and [[banana]] trees. It often lives near human settlements.

== Reproduction ==
''Phelsuma astriata astriata'' normally lays two 10&nbsp;mm eggs. Seychelles small day geckos are not gluers; they do not stick their eggs to the sides/underside of items, but instead place them in safe, well-hidden areas.  Incubation is generally 65 - 70 days at 82 degrees Fahrenheit.<ref>Day Geckos in Captivity, Leann and Greg Christenson, Page 113 (2002)</ref>

The '''Spanish Prisoner''' is a [[confidence trick]] originating in the late 16th century.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=980CE5D71638E433A25753C2A9659C94699ED7CF |title= AN OLD SWINDLE REVIVED.; The "Spanish Prisoner" and Buried Treasure Bait Again Being Offered to Unwary Americans |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= 20 March 1898 |page= 12 | accessdate= 2010-07-01 }}</ref><ref name=NETZHYPES/> In its original form, the confidence trickster tells his victim (the ''mark'') that he is (or is in correspondence with) a wealthy person of high estate who has been imprisoned in Spain under a false identity. Some versions had the imprisoned person being an unknown or remote relative of the mark.<ref name=NETZHYPES>{{cite news|title=100 Jahre alte Web-Phänomene Diese Netz-Hypes sind älter als das Internet|url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a26941/l25/l0/F.html#featuredEntry|accessdate=23 January 2013|newspaper=[[Spiegel Online]], einestages feature|language=German}}</ref> Supposedly the prisoner cannot reveal his identity without serious repercussions, and is relying on a friend (the confidence trickster) to raise money to secure his release.<ref name=NETZHYPES/> The confidence trickster offers to let the mark put up some of the funds, with a promise that he will be financially rewarded when the prisoner returns, and perhaps also by gaining the hand of a beautiful woman represented to be the prisoner's daughter. After the mark has turned over the funds, he is informed that further difficulties have arisen and more money is needed. With such explanations, the trickster continues to press for more money until the victim is cleaned out or declines to put up more funds.

==Characteristics==
Key features of the Spanish Prisoner trick are the emphasis on secrecy and the trust the confidence trickster apparently places in the mark not to reveal the prisoner's identity or situation. The confidence trickster will typically claim to have chosen the mark carefully, based on his reputation for honesty and straight dealing, and may appear to structure the deal so that the confidence trickster's ultimate share of the reward will be distributed voluntarily by the mark.

==Modern variants==
Modern variants of the Spanish Prisoner include the [[advance-fee fraud]], in particular the Nigerian money transfer (or 419) scam.<ref name=NETZHYPES/> In the advance-fee fraud, a valuable item must be ransomed from a warehouse, crooked customs agent, or lost-baggage facility before the authorities or thieves recognize its value. In the Nigerian variation, a self-proclaimed relative of a deposed African dictator offers to transfer millions of ill-gotten dollars into the bank account of the victim in return for small initial payments to cover bribes and other expenses. More recent examples feature people sharing the same surname as the intended victim, with the scammer guessing the surname from observing patterns in e-mail addresses, or obtaining full names from harvested e-mail headers. Another variation spreads via hijacked Facebook accounts, where a message is sent to all the Facebook-friends of the victim, claiming that the victim is in a foreign country, has been robbed, and needs one of the Facebook-friends to "send money" via Western Union to pay hotel and travel bills.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

'''David T. Dellinger''' (August 22, 1915 – May 25, 2004) was an influential [[United States|American]] radical, a [[pacifism|pacifist]] and activist for [[Nonviolence|nonviolent social change]].

==Chicago Seven==
Dellinger achieved peak notoriety as one of the [[Chicago Seven]], anti-war protesters [[1968 Democratic National Convention protests|whose activities]] at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]] led to charges of ''conspiracy'' and ''crossing state lines with the intention of inciting a riot''. The ensuing court case was turned by Dellinger and his co-defendants into a nationally-publicized platform for putting the [[Vietnam War]] on trial. On February 18, 1970, they were acquitted of the conspiracy charge, but five defendants, including Dellinger, were convicted of individually crossing state lines to incite a riot.

[[Julius Hoffman|Judge Hoffman's]] handling of the trial, along with the FBI's bugging of the defence lawyers, resulted, with the help of the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]], in the convictions being overturned by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] two years later, on 21 November 1972.  Although the contempt citations were upheld, the appeal court refused to sentence anyone.<ref>[http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/past-cases/united-states-v.-dellinger "United States v. Dellinger"], Center for Constitutional Rights.</ref><ref name="GUARDIANOBIT">Carlson, Michael, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2004/may/28/guardianobituaries.politics "Obituary: David Dellinger : Pacifist elder statesman of the anti-Vietnam Chicago Eight"], ''The Guardian'' (UK), Friday 28 May 2004</ref>

== Early life and career ==
Dellinger was born in [[Wakefield, Massachusetts]] to a wealthy family. His father, Raymond Dellinger, a graduate of [[Yale University]], was a lawyer and a prominent [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] and friend of [[Calvin Coolidge]].<ref name="NYTOBIT"/> His maternal grandmother, Alice Bird Fiske, was active in the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]].<ref name="NYTOBIT"/><ref name=dellinger/><ref name="DAR">[http://books.google.com/books?id=_AktAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover ''Directory of the national society of the Daughters of the American revolution''], 1911. Cf, [http://books.google.com/books?id=_AktAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=fiske&f=false p.530]</ref> 

A [[Yale University]] and [[Oxford University]] student, David Dellinger also studied theology at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]]. At Yale he had been a classmate and friend of the economist and political theorist [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Walt Rostow]]. Rejecting his comfortable background, he walked out of Yale one day to live with [[hobo]]s during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. While at Oxford University, he visited Nazi Germany and drove an ambulance during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. During [[World War II]], he was an imprisoned [[conscientious objector]] and anti-war agitator. In federal prison, he and fellow conscientious objectors &mdash; including [[Ralph DiGia]] and Bill Sutherland &mdash; protested racial segregation in the dining halls, which were ultimately integrated due to the protests.<ref>Matt Meyer and Judith Mahoney Pasternak, "David Dellinger, 1915-2004," ''Nonviolent Activist'', May–June 2004, pp. 10-11, 21.</ref>  In February 1946, Dellinger helped to found the radical pacifist [[Committee for Nonviolent Revolution]].<ref name=dellinger>{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Andrew E.|authorlink=Andrew E. Hunt|title=David Dellinger: the life and times of a nonviolent revolutionary|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=785AOwJFGmoC&pg=PA88|accessdate=2 October 2011|year=2006|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-3638-8|page=88ff}}</ref>

During the 1950s and 1960s, Dellinger joined freedom marches in the South and led many hunger strikes in jail. As US involvement in [[Vietnam]] grew, Dellinger applied [[Mohandas Gandhi]]'s principles of [[nonviolence]] to his activism within the growing anti-war movement, of which one of the high points was the [[Chicago Seven]] trial. He travelled to both [[North Vietnam|North]] and [[South Vietnam]] in 1966 to learn first-hand the impact of American bombing, and later recalled that critics ignored his trip to [[Saigon]] and focused solely on his visit to [[Hanoi]].<ref>[http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/org.wgbh.mla:16cbc320789fb3172a87adf19727b286336cba85 "Interview with David T. Dellinger, 1982.” 08/31/1982.WGBH Media Library & Archives. Retrieved 3 November 2010.]</ref>

In 1956, he and [[A. J. Muste]] founded the magazine ''[[Liberation (magazine)|Liberation]]'', as a forum for the non-Marxist left, similar to ''[[Dissent (magazine)|Dissent]]''.<ref>{{cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iMG34fB0g1IC&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=liberation+magazine&ct=result#PPA85,M1| title=Direct action | author=James Tracy| page=85| publisher=University of Chicago Press| year=1996| isbn=978-0-226-81127-7 }}</ref>

Dellinger had contacts and friendships with such diverse individuals as [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Abbie Hoffman]], [[A.J. Muste]], [[Greg Calvert]], [[James Bevel]], [[David McReynolds]] and numerous [[Black Panthers]], including [[Fred Hampton]], whom he greatly admired. As chairman of the [[Fifth Avenue Vietnam Peace Parade Committee]] he worked with many different anti-war organizations, and helped bring King and Bevel into leadership positions in the 1960s anti-war movement. He sat on the executive committee of the [[Socialist Party of America]] and the [[Young People's Socialist League]], its youth section, until he left in 1943; and was also a long-time member of the [[War Resisters League]]. In 1968, he signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.<ref>“Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''</ref>

Dellinger appeared at the December 1971 gathering of music and political views in favor of the then-jailed [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]].<ref>{{Citation

When his Yale class of 1936 held its fiftieth reunion, Dellinger wrote in the reunion book: "Lest my way of life sounds puritanical or austere,I always emphasize that in the long run one can't satisfactorily say no to war, violence, and injustice unless one is simultaneously saying yes to life, love, and laughter."<ref>[[Colman McCarthy|McCarthy, Colman]], "A Man Who Didn't Obey" (Obituary of David Dellinger), ''[[The Progressive]]'', August 1, 2004.</ref> 

For his lifelong commitment to pacifist values and for serving as a spokesperson for the peace movement, Dellinger was awarded the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience on September 26, 1992.

In 1996, during the first Democratic Convention held in Chicago since 1968, Dellinger and his grandson were arrested along with eight others, including [[Bradford Lyttle]] and [[Abbie Hoffman]]'s son Andrew, during a [[sit-in]] at Chicago's Federal Building. Later, in 2001, he led a group of young activists from [[Montpelier, Vermont]], to [[Quebec City]], to protest the creation of a [[free trade zone]].

'''Porphyritic''' is an adjective used in [[geology]], specifically for [[igneous rock]]s, for a rock that has a distinct difference in the size of the crystals, with at least one group of crystals obviously larger than another group.<ref>Dietrich, R. and Skinner, B., 1979, Rocks and Rock Minerals, pg. 108.</ref>  Porphyritic rocks may be [[aphanite]]s or [[extrusive]], with large crystals or [[phenocryst]]s floating in a fine-grained [[groundmass]] of non-visible crystals, as in a porphyritic [[basalt]], or [[phanerite]]s or [[intrusive]], with individual crystals of the groundmass may be easily distinguished with the eye, but one group of crystals clearly much bigger than the rest, as in a porphyritic [[granite]].  Most types of igneous rocks may display some degree of porphyritic texture.  One main type of rock that has a porphyritic texture are [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], though not all porphyritic rocks are porphyries.

== Formation ==

Porphyritic rocks are formed when a column of rising [[magma]] is cooled in two stages.  In the first stage, the magma is cooled slowly deep in the crust, creating the large crystal grains, with a diameter of 2&nbsp;mm or more.  In the final stage, the magma is cooled rapidly at relatively shallow depth or as it erupts from a [[volcano]], creating small grains that are usually invisible to the unaided eye.

'''International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers (IANTD)''' is a [[SCUBA diving]] organization concerned with certification and training in [[recreational diving]], [[technical diving]], [[cave diving]], [[wreck diving]], [[rebreather]] and [[Divemaster|diver leadership]].  It is a pioneer in the introduction of [[Nitrox|Enriched Air Nitrox]] diving to the recreational diving community.

== History ==
[[Dick Rutkowski]], the former dive supervisor for the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), formed the International Association of Nitrox Divers (IAND) in 1985 to teach [[nitrox]] to recreational divers. This program was developed through NOAA during his tenure. In 1992 [[Tom Mount]] became the President and CEO, and the name of the organization was changed to the International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers (IANTD). The 'T' was added when the European Association of Technical Divers (EATD) merged with IAND. [[Billy Deans (diver)|Billy Deans]] has also served as a director of IANTD.  Prior to founding IAND, Dick Rutkowski worked for Dr Wells and was director of the diver training at NOAA. This was the first organisation to offer international training to recreational scuba divers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}<ref name=IANTD>[http://www.iantd.com/iantd2.html About IANTD] {{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref>

As it was the first program to offer certification in Enriched Air Nitrox, the company was kept at a slow, yet steady pace from 1985 through February 1992 with the support of Hyperbarics International. In 1991 Tom Mount joined Dick and IAND became the first to offer training programs in all aspects of [[Technical diving]] (Advanced [[Nitrox]], [[Deep diving|Deep Air]], [[Technical diving|Technical Diver]], [[Cave Diving|Cave]] and [[Wreck diving|Wreck]] Penetration, Normoxic Trimix, [[Trimix (breathing gas)|Trimix]] and [[Rebreather]]s, etc.).

'''Henry Ernest Atkins''' (20 August 1872 – 31 January 1955) was a British [[chess]] [[chess master|master]] who is best known for his unparalleled record of winning the [[British Chess Championship]] nine times in eleven attempts. He won every year from 1905 to 1911, and again in 1924 and 1925. A schoolmaster, Atkins treated chess as a hobby, devoting relatively little time to it and playing in only a handful of international tournaments. He was an extremely gifted player who would likely have become one of the world's leading players had he pursued the game more single-mindedly. [[FIDE]], the World Chess Federation, awarded him the [[International Master]] title in 1950 in recognition of his past achievements.

{{algebraic notation|pos=tocleft}}

==Non-chess life==
Born in [[Leicester]], Atkins was educated at [[Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College|Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys]]. In 1890, he went to [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]] as a mathematical scholar.<ref name="Colesp.2">Coles 1952, p. 2.</ref><ref>{{acad|id=ATKS889HE|name=Atkins, Henry Ernest}}</ref> He was mathematical master at [[Northampton College]] from 1898 to 1902 and at the Wyggeston School from 1902 and 1909. He was then appointed principal of what later became [[Huddersfield New College]] in 1909, serving in that position until 1936.<ref name="Colesp.4">Coles 1952, p. 4.</ref>

Atkins died on 31 January 1955 in [[Huddersfield]], England.<ref>[[Jeremy Gaige]], ''Chess Personalia: A Biobibliography'', McFarland & Company, 1987, p. 16. ISBN 0-7864-2353-6.</ref>

==Chess career==
Atkins is considered by many to be Britain's most talented player ever.<ref name="Keenep.17">[[Raymond Keene]] in [[Harry Golombek]] (editor), ''Golombek's Encyclopedia of Chess'', Crown Publishers, 1977, p. 17.

He proceeded to win the next seven Championships: [[Southport]] 1905 and [[Shrewsbury]] 1906, again scoring 8.5/11 each time; [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] 1907 (7.5/11); [[Tunbridge Wells]] 1908 (8/11); [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] 1909, where he tied for first with [[Joseph Henry Blake (chess player)|Joseph Henry Blake]], each scoring 8.5/11, but won the playoff with 2.5/3; [[Oxford, England|Oxford]] 1910 (8.5/11); and [[Glasgow]] 1911, tying for first with [[Frederick Yates]] at 8.5/11, and winning all three games in the playoff.<ref>Sergeant, pp. 245-46, 248, 250, 252, 254, 325-27.</ref> Coles writes, "His success in these years was all the more striking because of his lack of other first-class practice, which not infrequently caused him to get away to a bad start; yet such was his natural ability and determination that he invariably overhauled the field before the end as confidence and skill returned."<ref name="Colesp.5"/> Atkins wrote the introduction to the first edition of ''[[Modern Chess Openings]]'' (1911).<ref>The introduction is reproduced in [[Richard Griffith (chess player)|R. C. Griffith]] and [[John Herbert White|J. H. White]], ''Modern Chess Openings'' (2nd ed. 1913), Longmans, Green and Co. (London), pp. x-xii.</ref>

After the 1911 Championship, Atkins retired completely from tournament chess for the next 11 years.<ref name="Colesp.5">Coles 1952, p. 5.</ref> He later remarked, "I really can't say why I didn't play after 1911 for so many years."<ref name="Colesp.5"/> He had agreed to play in the 1919 Hastings Victory Congress, but withdrew at the last moment "by doctor's orders".<ref>Sergeant, pp. 265-66.</ref> In 1922, a major international tournament was organized in London, the first in almost a quarter of a century; many of the world's leading players agreed to compete, such as newly crowned World Champion [[José Raúl Capablanca]], [[Alexander Alekhine]], and [[Akiba Rubinstein]]. Despite his long layoff from the game, Atkins was also invited, and agreed to play.<ref name="Colesp.5"/> After such a long hiatus, he unsurprisingly had a disappointing tournament, scoring only 6/15 and finishing 10th out of 16 players.<ref name="Keenep.18"/><ref name="Colesp.5"/> He finished just outside the prize list, for the first and only time in his career.<ref>Coles 1952, pp. 5-6.</ref> However, did have the consolation of claiming among his victims Rubinstein and [[Savielly Tartakower]].

His appetite for competition having been stirred, he returned to the British Championship, playing at Southport 1924.<ref name="Colesp.6">Coles 1952, p. 6.</ref> This time he showed his old form, winning his eighth championship with his usual score of 8.5/11. The following year, he exceeded himself, winning at [[Stratford-on-Avon]] with his best-ever score of 9.5/11 (8 wins, 3 draws).<ref>Sergeant, pp. 274-75, 330.</ref> His final Championship appearance was in 1937, when he tied for third at the age of 65.<ref name="Keenep.18"/><ref name="Colesp.7">Coles 1952, p. 7.</ref>

Atkins also represented England at the [[Chess Olympiads]] of 1927 and 1935.<ref name="Keenep.18"/> Playing first board for England in the [[1st Chess Olympiad|London 1927 Olympiad]], he scored 3 wins, 8 draws, and 1 loss (58.4%), leading the English team to what author Árpád Földeák calls an "unexpected but well deserved" third-place finish.<ref>Árpád Földeák, ''Chess Olympiads 1927&ndash;1968'', Dover Publications, 1979, pp. 14-15.

[[G. H. Diggle]] recollected of Atkins:<ref>[[Edward Winter (chess historian)|Edward Winter]], [http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/ Chess Note 5950] (quoting G. H. Diggle in ''Newsflash'', October 1976, reproduced in ''Chess Characters: Reminiscences of a Badmaster'', Chess Notes, Geneva, 1984, p. 16).</ref>
<blockquote>... we well remember his giving a "[[Glossary of chess#Simultaneous exhibition|simultaneous]]" at the [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] Chess Club in 1924, winning 17 and drawing two. One of his more elderly opponents (a notorious non-resigner) who for 30 moves had been wobbling along with a piece down until "time" had to be called, then proceeded to "demonstrate a draw" by concocting a continuation so optimistic that even clubmates with lifelong experience of his powers stood aghast. Atkins, with his greatcoat on ready to go home, made no attempt to refute this analytical masterpiece but merely remarked with great deference: "I don't think we can play it quite like that!" and then beat a craven retreat "escorted by Club Officials".</blockquote>

<blockquote>An unobtrusive man, we last saw him as a spectator at "[[Nottingham 1936 chess tournament|Nottingham, 1936]]" wandering about as if he was nobody.</blockquote>

==Contribution to chess theory==

Atkins originated an important defensive strategy in the [[Queen's Gambit Declined]]: an early ...Ne4 by [[White and Black in chess|Black]] in order to [[Exchange (chess)|exchange off]] a pair of [[Glossary of chess#Minor piece|minor pieces]] and ease the pressure on Black's position.<ref name="HooperWhyldpp.21,464">Hooper & Whyld, pp. 21, 464.</ref><ref name="Reinfeldp.47">[[Fred Reinfeld]], ''A Treasury of British Chess Masterpieces'', Bell Publishing (Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania), 1950, p. 47.</ref> He played it successfully against Marshall in a 1902 cable match between England and the United States, the game beginning 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.Nf3 Nbd7 6.e3 Ne4.<ref name="Reinfeldp.47"/> (See "Notable games" section below.) Today, the ...Ne4 maneuver is generally referred to as the "Lasker Variation", after Emanuel Lasker, who later adopted it, but is also sometimes referred to as the "Atkins Variation".<ref name="HooperWhyldpp.21,464"/> Today, Black usually employs a different [[Glossary of chess#Move order|move order]], such as 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.e3 0-0 6.Nf3 and now either 6...h6 7.Bh4 Ne4, or immediately 6...Ne4.<ref>[[Dražen Marovi?|D. Marovi?]], ''Play the Queen's Gambit'', Maxwell Macmillan, 1991, p. 87. ISBN 1-85744-016-1.</ref>

==Playing strength==

In 1950, [[FIDE]], in its first award of international titles, awarded Atkins the [[International Master]] title in recognition of his past achievements.<ref name="Colesp.1"/><ref name="Keenep.18"/> By [[Arpad Elo|Arpad Elo's]] calculation, Atkins' strength during his five-year peak was equivalent to an Elo rating of 2540.<ref>Arpad E. Elo, ''The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present'', Arco Publishing, 1978, p. 175. ISBN 0-668-04721-6.</ref>

World Champion [[Emanuel Lasker]] believed that if Atkins had devoted more time to chess, he would have become one of the world's leading players.<ref name="HooperWhyldp.21"/> [[George Alan Thomas|Sir George Thomas]], one of Britain's leading players in the first half of the 20th century, observed, "H. E. Atkins ranks, indisputably, as the greatest figure in English chess since Amos Burn, and only lack of opportunity prevented him, in my opinion, from definitely establishing his position in the world championship class."<ref name="Colesp.7"/> [[Anne Sunnucks]] writes that, "His devotion to teaching and his insistence on treating chess as merely a game was all that prevented him from becoming one of the leading players of the world."<ref name="Sunnucksp.13"/>

[[File:Quranic-arabic-corpus.png|right|400px|thumb|Visualization of Arabic grammar from the [[Quranic Arabic Corpus]]]]
'''Arabic grammar''' ({{lang-ar|??? ????}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|na?w ‘arab?}}'' or {{lang|ar|????? ????? ???????}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|qaw?‘id al-lughah al-‘arab?yah}}'') is the grammar of the [[Arabic language]].  Arabic is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]] and its grammar has many similarities with the [[Semitic languages#Grammar|grammar of other Semitic languages]].

The article focuses both on the grammar of [[Literary Arabic]] (i.e. [[Classical Arabic]] and [[Modern Standard Arabic]], which have largely the same grammar) and of the colloquial spoken [[varieties of Arabic]].  The grammar of the two types is largely similar in its particulars.  Generally, the grammar of Classical Arabic is described first, followed by the areas in which the colloquial variants tend to differ (note that not all colloquial variants have the same grammar).  The largest differences between the two systems are the loss of [[grammatical case]]; the loss of the previous system of [[grammatical mood]], along with the evolution of a new system; the loss of the inflected [[passive voice]], except in a few relic varieties; and restriction in the use of the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual number]].

==History==
The identity of the oldest Arabic grammarian is disputed; some sources state that it was  [[Abu-Aswad al-Du'ali]], who established [[diacritical]] marks and vowels for [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the mid-600s, though none of his works have survived.<ref name=kojiro>[[Kojiro Nakamura]], "Ibn Mada's Criticism of Arab Grammarians." ''Orient'', v. 10, pgs. 89-113. 1974</ref> Others have said that the earliest grammarian would have been [[Ibn Abi Ishaq]] (died AD 735/6, [[Islamic calendar|AH]] 117).<ref name=mon>Monique Bernards, "Pioneers of Arabic Linguistic Studies." Taken from In the Shadow of Arabic: The Centrality of Language to Arabic Culture, pg. 213. Ed. Bilal Orfali. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2011. ISBN 9789004215375</ref>

The schools of [[Basra]] and [[Kufa]] further developed grammatical rules in the late 700s with the rapid rise of Islam.<ref name="goodchild">Goodchild, Philip. ''Difference in Philosophy of Religion'', 2003. Page 153.</ref><ref name="old">[[Archibald Sayce]], ''Introduction to the Science of Language''. Pg. 28, 1880.</ref> From the school of Basra, generally regarded as being founded by [[Abu 'Amr ibn al-'Ala'|Abu Amr ibn al-Ala]],<ref>[http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/38758/al-Asmai#ref190690 al-A?ma??] at the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]. ©2013 [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]. Accessed 10 June 2013.</ref> two representatives laid important foundations for the field: [[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi]] authored the first Arabic dictionary and book of Arabic [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] authored the first book on theories of Arabic grammar.<ref name=kojiro/> From the school of Kufa, [[Al-Ru'asi]] is universally acknowledged as the founder though his own writings are considered lost,<ref>[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]], vol. 5, pg. 174, fascicules 81-82. Eds. [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]], E. van Donzel, [[Bernard Lewis]] and [[Charles Pellat]]. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1980. ISBN 9789004060562</ref><ref>Arik Sadan, ''The Subjunctive Mood in Arabic Grammatical Thought'', pg. 339. Volume 66 of Studies in Semitic Languages and Linguistics. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2012. ISBN 9789004232952</ref> with most of the school's development undertaken by later authors. The efforts of al-Farahidi and Sibawayh consolidated Basra's reputation as the analytic school of grammar, while the Kufan school was regarding as the guardian of [[Arabic poetry]] and [[Arab culture]].<ref name=mon/> The differences were polarizing in some cases, with early Muslim scholar [[Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi]] favoring the Kufan school due to its concern with poetry as a primary source.<ref>"Sibawayh, His Kitab, and the Schools of Basra and Kufa." Taken from ''Changing Traditions: Al-Mubarrad's Refutation of S?bawayh and the Subsequent Reception of the Kit?b'', pg. 12. Volume 23 of Studies in Semitic Languages and Linguistics. Ed. Monique Bernards. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1997. ISBN 9789004105959</ref>

Early Arabic grammars were more or less lists of rules, without the detailed explanations which would be added in later centuries. The earliest schools were different not only in some of their views on grammatical disputes, but also their emphasis. The school of Kufa excelled in Arabic poetry and [[exegesis]] of the [[Qur'an]], in addition to [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and Arab genealogy. The more rationalist school of Basra, on the other hand, focused more on the formal study of grammar.<ref>Sir [[Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb]], ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'', pg. 350. Leiden: Brill Archive, 1954. New edition 1980.</ref>

==Division==
For classical Arabic grammarians, the grammatical sciences are divided into five branches:

*''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-lughah}}'' ????? (language/lexicon) concerned with collecting and explaining vocabulary.
*''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-ta?r?f}}'' ??????? (morphology) determining the form of the individual words.
*''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-na?w}}'' ????? (syntax) primarily concerned with inflection (''[[?I?rab|{{transl|ar|ALA|I‘r?b}}]]'') which had already been lost in dialects.
*''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-ishtiq?q}}'' ???????? (derivation) examining the origin of the words.

The grammar or grammars of contemporary [[varieties of Arabic]] are a different question. [[El-Said Badawi|Said M. Badawi]], an expert on Arabic grammar, divided Arabic grammar into five different types based on the speaker's level of [[literacy]] and the degree to which the speaker deviated from [[Classical Arabic]]. Badawi's five types of grammar from the most colloquial to the most formal are Illiterate Spoken Arabic (????? ??????? {{transl|ar|ALA|‘?mm?yat al-umm?y?n}}), Semi-literate Spoken Arabic (????? ????????? {{transl|ar|ALA|‘?mm?yat al-mutanawwir?n}}), Educated Spoken Arabic (????? ???????? {{transl|ar|ALA|‘?mm?yat al-muthaqqaf?n}}), [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (???? ????? {{transl|ar|ALA|fu??á al-‘a?r}}), and [[Classical Arabic]] (???? ?????? {{transl|ar|ALA|fu??á al-tur?th}}).<ref>Alaa Elgibali and El-Said M. Badawi. ''Understanding Arabic: Essays in Contemporary Arabic Linguistics in Honor of El-Said M. Badawi'', 1996. Page 105.</ref>

==Phonology==
{{main|Arabic phonology}}
Classical Arabic has 28 [[consonant]]al [[phoneme]]s, including two [[semi-vowel]]s, which constitute the [[Arabic alphabet]]. It also has six [[vowel]] phonemes (three short vowels and three long vowels). These appear as various [[allophone]]s, depending on the preceding consonant. Short vowels are not usually represented in written language, although they may be indicated with diacritics.

''{{transl|ar|ALA|Hamzat al-wa?l}}'' (???? ?????), elidable ''hamza'', is a phonetic object prefixed to the beginning of a word for ease of pronunciation, since [[literary Arabic]] doesn't allow consonant clusters at the beginning of a word. Elidable ''hamza'' drops out as a vocal, if a word is preceding it. This word will then produce an ending vocal, "helping vocal" to facilitate pronunciation. This short vocal may be, depending on the preceding vowel, ?? a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fat?ah}}'' (????) /a/, ?? a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}}'' (????) {{IPA|/i/}} or {{lang|ar|??}} a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|?ammah}}'' (???) {{IPA|/u/}}. If the preceding word ends in a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|suk?n}}'' (????) (i.e. not followed by a short vowel), the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Hamzat al-wa?l}}'' assumes a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}}'' {{IPA|/i/}}. Symbol ?? ''{{transl|ar|ALA|shaddah}}'' (???) indicates a gemination or consonant doubling. See more in [[Tashk?l]].

==Nouns and adjectives==
{{main|Arabic nouns and adjectives}}
[[File:Arabic Noun Chart.png|right|250px|thumb|Arabic Noun Chart]]
In Classical Arabic, nouns and adjectives are declined according to case, state, gender and number. In colloquial or spoken Arabic, there are number of simplifications such as loss of certain final vowels and loss of case. A number of derivational processes exist for forming new nouns and adjectives. Adverbs can be formed from adjectives.

==Pronouns==

===Personal pronouns===
In Arabic, [[personal pronoun]]s have 12 forms: In singular and plural, the 2nd and 3rd persons differentiate gender, while the 1st person does not. In the dual, there is no 1st person, and only a single form for each 2nd and 3rd person. Traditionally, the pronouns are listed in order 3rd, 2nd, 1st.

{| class="wikitable"

|-
!<small>feminine</small>
|  ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hiya}} ''??'' ''
|  ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hunna}} ''???'' ''
|-
|}

Informal Arabic tends to avoid the dual forms ''{{transl|ar|ALA|antum?}}'' ????? and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hum?}}'' ???.  The feminine plural forms ''{{transl|ar|ALA|antunna}}'' ????? and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hunna}}'' ??? are likewise avoided, except by speakers of conservative colloquial varieties that still possess separate feminine plural pronouns.

====Enclitic pronouns====
[[Enclitic]] forms of personal pronouns ('''??????? ???????''' ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-?am?’ir al-mutta?ilah}}'') are affixed to various parts of speech, with varying meanings:
*To the [[construct state]] of nouns, where they have the meaning of possessive demonstratives, e.g. "my, your, his"
*To verbs, where they have the meaning of direct object pronouns, e.g. "me, you, him"
*To prepositions, where they have the meaning of objects of the prepositions, e.g. "to me, to you, to him"
*To conjunctions and particles like ''{{transl|ar|ALA|anna}} "that ...", ''{{transl|ar|ALA|li-anna}} "because ...", ''{{transl|ar|ALA|(wa)l?kinna}}'' "but ...", ''{{transl|ar|ALA|inna}}'' (topicalizing particle), where they have the meaning of subject pronouns, e.g. "because I ...", "because you ...", "because he ...". (These particles are known in Arabic as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|akhaw?t inna}}'' {{lang|ar|????? ???}} (lit. "sisters of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|inna}}''&nbsp;".)
* If a word ends on a vowel and the enclitic form personal pronoun is—? (e.g. ra´aytan? "you saw me"), an extra -n- will be added between the word and the enclitic form so that there won´t be a hiatus between two vowels.

Most of them are clearly related to the full personal pronouns.

=====Variant forms=====
For all but the first person singular, the same forms are used regardless of the part of speech of the word attached to.  In the third person masculine singular, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-hu}}'' occurs after the vowels ending in ''u'' or ''a'' (''{{transl|ar|ALA|-a, -?, -u, -?, -aw}}''), while ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-hi}}'' occurs after vowels ending in ''i'' (''{{transl|ar|ALA|-i, -?, -ay}}'').  The same alternation occurs in the third person dual and plural.

In the first person singular, however, the situation is more complicated.  Specifically, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-n?}}'' &nbsp;'me'&nbsp; is attached to verbs, but ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-?/-ya}}'' &nbsp;'my'&nbsp; is attached to nouns.  In the latter case, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-ya}}'' is attached to nouns whose construct state ends in a long vowel or diphthong (e.g. in the sound masculine plural and the dual), while ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-?}}'' is attached to nouns whose construct state ends in a short vowel, in which case that vowel is elided (e.g. in the sound feminine plural, as well as the singular and broken plural of most nouns).  Furthermore, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-?}}'' of the masculine sound plural is assimilated to ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-?}}'' before ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-ya}}'' (presumably, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-aw}}'' of masculine defective ''-an'' plurals is similarly assimilated to ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-ay}}''). Examples:
*From ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kit?b}}'' &nbsp;'book', pl. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kutub}}'': ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kit?b-?}}'' &nbsp;'my book' (all cases), ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kutub-?}}'' &nbsp;'my books'&nbsp; (all cases), ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kit?b?-ya}}'' &nbsp;'my two books (nom.)', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kit?bay-ya}}'' &nbsp;'my two books (acc./gen.)'
*From ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kalimah}}'' &nbsp;'word', pl. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kalim?t}}'': ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kalimat-?}}'' &nbsp;'my word'&nbsp; (all cases), ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kalim?t-?}}'' &nbsp;'my words'&nbsp; (all cases)
*From ''{{transl|ar|ALA|duny?}}'' &nbsp;'world', pl. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|dunyay?t}}'': ''{{transl|ar|ALA|duny?-ya}}'' &nbsp;'my world'&nbsp; (all cases), ''{{transl|ar|ALA|dunyay?t-?}}'' &nbsp;'my worlds'&nbsp; (all cases)
*From ''{{transl|ar|ALA|q??in}}'' &nbsp;'judge', pl. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|qu??h}}'': ''{{transl|ar|ALA|q??iy-ya}}'' &nbsp;'my judge'&nbsp; (all cases), ''{{transl|ar|ALA|qu??t-?}}'' &nbsp;'my judges'&nbsp; (all cases)
*From ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mu‘allim}}'' &nbsp;'teacher', pl. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mu‘allim?n}}'': ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mu‘allim-?}}'' &nbsp;'my teacher'&nbsp; (all cases), ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mu‘allim?-ya}}'' &nbsp;'my teachers'&nbsp; (all cases, see above)
*From ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ab}}'' &nbsp;'father': ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ab?-ya}}'' &nbsp;'my father'&nbsp; (nom.) (or is it assimilated?), ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ab?-ya}}'' &nbsp;'my father' (acc.), ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ab?-ya}}'' &nbsp;'my father'&nbsp; (gen.)
Prepositions use ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-?/-ya}}'', even though in this case it has the meaning of "me" (rather than "my").  The "sisters of {{transl|ar|ALA|inna}}" can use either form (e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|inna-n?}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|inn-?}}''), but the longer form (e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|inna-n?}}'') is usually preferred.

The second-person masculine plural past tense verb ending ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-tum}}'' changes to the variant form ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-tum?}}'' before enclitic pronouns, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|katab-tum?-hu}}'' &nbsp;'you (masc. pl.) wrote it (masc.)'.

=====Pronouns with prepositions=====
Some very common prepositions — including the proclitic preposition ''{{transl|ar|ALA|li-}}'' &nbsp;'to'&nbsp; (also used for indirect objects) — have irregular or unpredictable combining forms when the enclitic pronouns are added:
{|class="wikitable"
! Meaning !! Independent form !! With "... me" !! With "... you" (masc. sg.) !! With "... him"
|-
| "to", [[indirect object]] || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|li-}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|l?}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|laka}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|lahu}}''
|-
| "in", "with", "by" || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bi-}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|b?}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bika}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bihi}}''
|-
| "in" || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|f?}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|f?ya}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|f?ka}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|f?hi}}''
|-
| "to" || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ilá}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ilayya}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ilayka}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ilayhi}}''
|-
| "on" || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|‘alá}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|‘alayya}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|‘alayka}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|‘alayhi}}''
|-
| "with" || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ma‘a}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ma‘?}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ma‘aka}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ma‘ahu}}''
|-
| "from" || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|min}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|minn?}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|minka}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|minhu}}''
|-
| "on", "about" || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|‘an}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|‘ann?}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|‘anka}}'' || ''{{transl|ar|ALA|‘anhu}}''
|-
|}

In the above cases, when there are two combining forms, one is used with "... me" and the other with all other person/number/gender combinations. (More correctly, one occurs before vowel-initial pronouns and the other before consonant-initial pronouns, but in Classical Arabic, only ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-?}}'' is vowel-initial.  This becomes clearer in the spoken varieties, where various vowel-initial enclitic pronouns exist.)

Note in particular:
*''{{transl|ar|ALA|ilá}}'' &nbsp;'to'&nbsp; and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|‘alá}}'' &nbsp;'on'&nbsp; have irregular combining forms ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ilay-}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|‘alay-}}''; but other pronouns with the same base form are regular, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ma‘a}}'' &nbsp;'with'.
*''{{transl|ar|ALA|li-}}'' &nbsp;'to'&nbsp; has an irregular combining form  ''{{transl|ar|ALA|la-}}'', but ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bi-}}'' &nbsp;'in, with, by'&nbsp; is regular.
*''{{transl|ar|ALA|min}}'' &nbsp;'from'&nbsp; and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|‘an}}'' double the final ''n'' before ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-?}}''. (This should be interpreted as having an irregular stem with doubled ''n'', rather than unexpected use of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-n?}}''.  This is clear because in the modern spoken varieties, there are other enclitic pronouns beginning with a vowel, and the doubled-''n'' forms occur with them as well, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|minnak}}'' &nbsp;'from you'&nbsp; (masc. sg.), ''{{transl|ar|ALA|minnik}}'' &nbsp;'from you'&nbsp; (fem. sg.).)

=====Less formal pronominal forms=====
In a less formal Arabic, as in many spoken dialects, the endings ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-ka -ki -hu}}'' are pronounced as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-ak -ik -uh}}'', swallowing all short case endings.  Short case endings are often dropped even before consonant-initial endings, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kit?b-ka}}'' "your book" (all cases), ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bayt-ka}}'' "your house" (all cases), ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kalb-ka}}'' "your dog" (all cases).  When this produces a difficult cluster, either the second consonant is [[syllabic consonant|vocalized]], to the extent possible (e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ism-ka}}'' "your name", with syllabic ''m'' similar to English "bottom"), or an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowel is inserted (e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|isim-ka}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ismi-ka}}'', depending on the behavior of the speaker's native variety).

===Demonstratives===
There are two [[demonstrative]]s ('''????? ???????''' ''{{transl|ar|ALA|asm?’ al-ish?rah}}''), near-[[deixis|deictic]] ('this') and far-deictic ('that'):

|-
!<small>accusative/genitive</small>
|  ''{{transl|ar|ALA|taynika}}'' ????
|-
|}

The dual forms are only used in very formal Arabic.

Some of the demonstratives ({{transl|ar|ALA|h?dh?, h?dhihi, h?dh?ni, h?dhayni, h?t?ni, h?tayni, h?’ul?’i, dh?lika}}, and {{transl|ar|ALA|ul?’ika}} should be pronounced with a long "{{transl|ar|ALA|?}}", although the unvocalised script is not written with alif (?). Instead of an alif, they have the diacritic ?? "dagger alif" (??? ?????? ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif khanjar?yah}}''), which doesn't exist on Arabic keyboards and is seldom written, even in vocalised Arabic.

Qur'anic Arabic has another demonstrative, normally followed by a noun in a genitive construct and meaning &nbsp;'owner of':
{| class="wikitable"

Note that the demonstrative and relative pronouns were originally built on this word.  ''{{transl|ar|ALA|h?dh?}}'', for example, was originally composed from the prefix ''{{transl|ar|ALA|h?-}}'' &nbsp;'this'&nbsp; and the masculine accusative singular ''{{transl|ar|ALA|dh?}}''; similarly, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|dh?lika}}'' was composed from ''{{transl|ar|ALA|dh?}}'', an infixed syllable ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-li-}}'', and the [[clitic]] suffix ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-ka}}'' &nbsp;'you'.  These combinations had not yet become completely fixed in Qur'anic Arabic and other combinations sometimes occurred, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|dh?ka}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|dh?likum}}''.  Similarly, the relative pronoun ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alladh?}}'' was originally composed based on genitive singular ''{{transl|ar|ALA|dh?}}'', and the old Arabic grammarians noted the existence of a separate nominative plural form ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alladh?na}}'' in the speech of the [[Banu Hothail|Hudhayl]] tribe in Qur'anic times.

This word also shows up in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], e.g. masculine ?? ''zeh'' (cf. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|dh?}}''), feminine ??? ''zot'' (cf. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|dh?t-}}''), plural ??? ''eleh'' (cf. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ul?}}'').

===Relative pronoun===
The [[relative pronoun]] is conjugated as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|+Relative pronoun ("who, that, which")
!  colspan=2|Gender
!  Singular
!  Dual
!  Plural
|-
!  rowspan=2|Masculine
!<small>nominative</small>
|  rowspan=2|''{{transl|ar|ALA|alladh?}}'' ?????'' ''
|  ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alladh?ni}}'' ???????'' ''
|  rowspan=2|''{{transl|ar|ALA|alladh?n(a)}}'' ??????'' ''
|-
!<small>accusative/genitive</small>
|  ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alladhayni}}'' ??????'' ''
|-
! rowspan=2|Feminine
!<small>nominative</small>
|  rowspan=2|''{{transl|ar|ALA|allat?}}'' ?????'' ''
|  ''{{transl|ar|ALA|allat?ni}}'' ???????'' ''
|  rowspan=2|''{{transl|ar|ALA|all?t?}}'' ??????'' ''
|-
!<small>accusative/genitive</small>
|  ''{{transl|ar|ALA|allatayni}}'' ??????'' ''
|-
|}

Note that the relative pronoun agrees in gender, number and case, with the noun it modifies—as opposed to the situation in other inflected languages such as [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]], where the gender and number agreement is with the modified noun, but the case marking follows the usage of the relative pronoun in the embedded clause (as in formal English "the man <u>who</u> saw me" vs. "the man <u>whom</u> I saw").

When the relative pronoun serves a function other than the subject of the embedded clause, a [[resumptive pronoun]] is required: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-rajul alladh? tatakallamtu ma‘a-<u>hu</u>}}'', literally &nbsp;'the man who I spoke with him'.

The relative pronoun is normally omitted entirely when an indefinite noun is modified by a relative clause: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|rajul<sup>un</sup> tatakallamtu ma‘a-hu}}'' &nbsp;'a man that I spoke with'; literally &nbsp;'a man I spoke with him'.

===Colloquial varieties===
The above system is mostly unchanged in the colloquial varieties, other than the loss of the dual forms and (for most varieties) of the feminine plural.  Some of the more notable changes:
*The third-person ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-hi, -him}}'' variants disappear.  On the other hand, the first person ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-n?/-?/-ya}}'' variation is preserved exactly (including the different circumstances in which these variants are used), and new variants appear for many forms.  For example, in [[Egyptian Arabic]], the second person feminine singular appears either as ''{{transl|ar|-ik}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|-ki}}'' depending on various factors (e.g. the phonology of the preceding word); likewise, the third person masculine singular appears variously as ''{{transl|ar|-u}}'', ''{{transl|ar|-hu}}'', or ''{{transl|ar|-}}'' (no ending, but stress is moved onto the preceding vowel, which is lengthened).
*In many varieties, the [[indirect object]] forms, which appear in Classical Arabic as separate words (e.g. ''{{transl|ar|l?}}'' "to me", ''{{transl|ar|lahu}}'' &nbsp;'to him'), become fused onto the verb, following a direct object.  These same varieties generally develop a [[circumfix]] {{IPA|/ma-...-?(i)/}} for negation (from Classical ''{{transl|ar|ALA|m? ... shay’}}'' &nbsp;'not ... a thing', composed of two separate words).  This can lead to complicated [[agglutinative]] constructs, such as [[Egyptian Arabic]] {{IPA|/ma-katab-ha-?li?-?/}}  &nbsp;'he didn't write it (fem.) to me'. (Egyptian Arabic in particular has many variant pronominal affixes used in different circumstances, and very intricate [[morphophonemic]] rules leading to a large number of complex alternations, depending on the particular affixes involved, the way they are put together, and whether the preceding verb ends in a vowel, a single consonant, or two consonants.)
*Other varieties instead use a separate Classical pseudo-pronoun ''{{transl|ar|ALA|?y?-}}'' for direct objects (but in [[Hijazi Arabic]] the resulting construct fuses with a preceding verb).
*Affixation of dual and sound plural nouns has largely vanished.  Instead, all varieties possess a separate preposition with the meaning of "of", which replaces certain uses of the [[construct state|construct]] genitive (to varying degrees, depending on the particular variety).  In [[Moroccan Arabic]], the word is ''dyal'' (also ''d-'' before a noun), e.g. ''l-kitab dyal-i'' "my book", since the construct-state genitive is mostly unproductive.  [[Egyptian Arabic]] has ''bit?‘&nbsp;'', which agrees in gender and number with the preceding noun (feminine ''bit?‘it/bita‘t'', plural ''bit?‘&nbsp;''). In Egyptian Arabic, the construct-state genitive is still productive, hence either ''kit?b-i'' or ''il-kit?b bit?‘-i'' can be used for "my book", but only ''il-mu‘allim?n bit?‘-i'' "my teachers".
*The declined relative pronoun has vanished.  In its place is an indeclinable particle, usually ''illi'' or similar.
*Various forms of the demonstrative pronouns occur, usually shorter than the Classical forms.  For example, Moroccan Arabic uses ''ha l-'' "this", ''dak l-/dik l-/duk l-'' "that" (masculine/feminine/plural).  Egyptian Arabic is unusual in that the demonstrative follows the noun, e.g. ''il-kit?b da'' "this book", ''il-bint<sup>i</sup> di'' "this girl".
*Some of the independent pronouns have slightly different forms compared with their Classical forms.  For example, usually forms similar to ''inta, inti'' "you (masc./fem. sg.)" occur in place of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|anta, anti}}'', and ''(n)i?na'' "we" occurs in place of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|na?nu}}''.

==Numerals==

===Cardinal numerals===
Numbers behave in a quite complicated fashion. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w??id-}}'' &nbsp;'one'&nbsp; and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ithn?n-}}'' &nbsp;'two'&nbsp; are adjectives, following the noun and agreeing with it. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|thal?that-}}'' &nbsp;'three'&nbsp; through ''{{transl|ar|ALA|‘asharat-}}'' &nbsp;'ten'&nbsp; require a following noun in the genitive plural, but disagree with the noun in gender, while taking the case required by the surrounding syntax. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a?ada ‘asharah}}'' &nbsp;'eleven'&nbsp; through ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tis‘ata ‘asharah}}'' &nbsp;'nineteen'&nbsp; require a following noun in the accusative singular, agree with the noun in gender, and are invariable for case, except for ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ithn? ‘asharah/ithnay ‘ashara}}'' &nbsp;'twelve'.

The formal system of cardinal numerals, as used in Classical Arabic, is extremely complex.  The system of rules is presented below.  In reality, however, this system is never used: Large numbers are always written as numerals rather than spelled out, and are pronounced using a simplified system, even in formal contexts.

Example:
:Formal: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alf?ni wa-tis‘u mi’atin wa-thnat? ‘ashratan sanatan}}'' &nbsp;'2,912 years'
:Formal: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ba‘da alfayni wa-tis‘i mi’atin wa-thnatay ‘ashratan sanatan}}'' &nbsp;'after 2,912 years'
:Spoken: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|(ba‘da) alfayn wa-tis‘ m?ya wa-ithna‘shar sana(tan)}}'' &nbsp;'(after) 2,912 years'

Cardinal numerals ('''??????? ????????''' ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-a‘d?d al-a?l?yah}}'') from 0-10. Zero is ''?ifr'', from which the words "[[cipher]]" and "[[0 (number)|zero]]" are ultimately derived.
*0 ? ''{{transl|ar|ALA|?ifr?(un)}}'' (????)
*1 ? ''{{transl|ar|w??id(un)}}'' (?????)
*2 ? ''{{transl|ar|?ithn?n(i)}}'' (??????)
*3 ? ''{{transl|ar|thal?tha(tun)}}'' (??????)
*4 ? ''{{transl|ar|arba‘a(tun)}}'' (??????)
*5 ? ''{{transl|ar|khamsa(tun)}}'' (?????)
*6 ? ''{{transl|ar|sitta(tun)}}'' (?????)
*7 ? ''{{transl|ar|sab‘a(tun)}}'' (?????)
*8 ? ''{{transl|ar|tham?niya(tun)}}'' (???????)
*9 ? ''{{transl|ar|tis‘a(tun)}}'' (?????)
*10 ?? ''{{transl|ar|‘ashara(tun)}}'' (?????)

The endings in brackets are dropped in less formal Arabic and in pausa. Note that '''?''' ({{transl|ar|ALA|t?’ marb??ah}}) is pronounced as simple /a/ in these cases. There are cases when {{transl|ar|ALA|-t}} in '''?''' must be pronounced, but not the rest of the ending.

????? ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ithn?n(i)}}'' is changed to ????? ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ithnayn(i)}}'' in oblique cases. This form is also commonly used in a less formal Arabic in the nominative case.

The numerals 1 and 2 are adjectives. Thus they follow the noun and agree with gender.

Numerals 3–10 have a peculiar rule of agreement known as polarity: A feminine referrer agrees with a numeral in masculine gender and vice versa,  e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|thal?thu fatay?tin}} ''(????? ??????)'' '' &nbsp;'three girls'.  The noun counted takes indefinite genitive plural (as the attribute in a genitive construct).

Numerals 11 and 13–19 are indeclinable for case, perpetually in the accusative. Numbers 11 and 12 show gender agreement in the ones, and 13-19 show polarity in the ones. Number 12 also shows case agreement, reminiscent of the dual. The gender of ??? in numbers 11-19 agrees with the counted noun (unlike the standalone numeral 10 which shows polarity). The counted noun takes indefinite accusative singular.

Unitary numbers from 20 on (i.e. 20, 30, ... 90, 100, 1000, 1000000, etc.) behave entirely as nouns, showing the case required by the surrounding syntax, no gender agreement, and a following noun in a fixed case. 20 through 90 require their noun to be in the accusative singular; 100 and up require the genitive singular. The unitary numbers themselves decline in various fashions:
*''{{transl|ar|ALA|‘ishr?na}}'' &nbsp;'20'&nbsp; through ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tis‘?na}}'' &nbsp;'90'&nbsp; decline as masculine plural nouns
*''{{transl|ar|ALA|mi’at- / m?’at-}}'' &nbsp;'100'&nbsp; (??? or ????) declines as a feminine singular noun
*''{{transl|ar|ALA|alf-}}'' &nbsp;'1,000'&nbsp; (???) declines as a masculine singular noun

The numbers 20-99 are expressed with the units preceding the tens.  There is agreement in gender with the numerals 1 and 2, and polarity for numerals 3–9.  The whole construct is followed by the accusative singular indefinite.
*20 ''{{transl|ar|‘ishr?na}}'' (?????) (plural of 10)
*21 ''{{transl|ar|w??idun wa-‘ishr?na}}'' (???? ??????)
*22 ''{{transl|ar|ithn?ni wa-‘ishr?na}}'' (????? ??????)
*23 ''{{transl|ar|thal?thatu wa-‘ishr?na}}'' (????? ??????)
*30  ''{{transl|ar|thal?th?na}}'' (??????)
*40  ''{{transl|ar|arba‘?na}}'' (??????)

''{{transl|ar|ALA|mi’at-}}'' &nbsp;'100'&nbsp; and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alf-}}'' &nbsp;'1,000'&nbsp; can themselves be modified by numbers (to form numbers such as 200 or 5,000) and will be declined appropriately. For example, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mi’at?ni}}'' &nbsp;'200'&nbsp; and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alf?ni}}'' &nbsp;'2,000'&nbsp; with dual endings; ''{{transl|ar|ALA|thal?thatu ?l?fin}}'' &nbsp;'3,000'&nbsp; with ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alf}}'' in the plural genitive, but ''{{transl|ar|ALA|thal?thu mi’atin}}'' &nbsp;'300'&nbsp; since ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mi’at-}}'' appears to have no plural.

In compound numbers, the number formed with the last two digits dictates the declension of the associated noun, e.g. 212, 312, and 54,312 would all behave like 12.

Large compound numbers can have, e.g.:

*''{{transl|ar|ALA|alfun wa-tis‘u mi’atin wa-tis‘u sin?na}}'' &nbsp;'1,909 years'&nbsp;
*''{{transl|ar|ALA|ba‘da alfin wa-tis‘i mi’atin wa-tis‘i sin?na}}'' &nbsp;'after 1,909 years'&nbsp;
*''{{transl|ar|ALA|arba‘atun wa-tis‘?na alfan wa-tham?n? mi’atin wa-thal?thun wa-sitt?na sanatan}}'' &nbsp;'94,863 years'&nbsp;
*''{{transl|ar|ALA|ba‘da arba‘atin wa-tis‘?na alfan wa-tham?n? mi’atin wa-thal?thin wa-sitt?na sanatan}}'' &nbsp;'after 94,863 years'&nbsp;
*''{{transl|ar|ALA|i?n? ‘ašara alfan wa-mi’at?ni wa-thnat?ni wa-‘ishr?na sanatan}}'' &nbsp;'12,222 years'&nbsp;
*''{{transl|ar|ALA|ba‘da ithnay ‘ashara alfan wa-mi’atayni wa-thnatayni wa-‘ishr?na sanatan}}'' 'after 12,222 years'
*''{{transl|ar|ALA|ithn? ‘ashara alfan wa-mi’at?ni wa-sanat?ni}}'' &nbsp;'12,202 years'&nbsp;
*''{{transl|ar|ALA|ba‘da ithnay ‘ashara alfan wa-mi’atayni wa-sanatayni}}'' &nbsp;'after 12,202 years'&nbsp;

Note also the special construction when the final number created with the last two digits is 01 or 02:
*''{{transl|ar|alfu laylatin wa-laylatun}}'' &nbsp;'1,001 nights'&nbsp; ??? ???? ?????
*''{{transl|ar|mi’atu kutubin wa-kit?b?ni}}'' &nbsp;'102 books'&nbsp; ???? ??? ???????

'''Fractions''' of a whole smaller than "half" are expressed by the structure ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fi‘l}}'' (???), pl. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|af‘?l}}'' (?????).
*half ''{{transl|ar|ni?fun}}'' (???)
*one-third ''{{transl|ar|thulthun}}'' (???)
*two-thirds ''{{transl|ar|thulth?ni}}'' (?????)
*one-fourth ''{{transl|ar|rub‘un}}'' (???)
*three-fourths ''{{transl|ar|thal?thatu arb?‘in}}'' (????? ?????)
*etc.

===Ordinal numerals===
Ordinal numerals  ('''??????? ?????????''' ''{{transl|ar|al-a‘d?d al-tart?b?yah}}'')  higher than "second" are formed using the structure ''{{transl|ar|f?‘ilun}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|f?‘ilatun}}'':
*m. ??? ''{{transl|ar|awwalu}}'', f. ???? ''{{transl|ar|ALA|?lá}}'' &nbsp;'first'&nbsp;
*m. ???? ''{{transl|ar|ALA|th?nin}}'' (definite form: ?????? ''{{transl|ar|al-th?n?}}''), f. ????? ''{{transl|ar|ALA|th?niyatun}}'' &nbsp;'second'&nbsp;
*m. ???? ''{{transl|ar|th?lithun}}'', f. ????? ''{{transl|ar|th?lithatun}}'' &nbsp;'third'&nbsp;
*m. ???? ''{{transl|ar|r?bi‘un}}'', f. ????? ''{{transl|ar|r?bi‘atun}}'' &nbsp;'fourth'&nbsp;
*m. ???? ''{{transl|ar|kh?misun}}'', f. ????? ''{{transl|ar|kh?misatun}}'' &nbsp;'fifth'&nbsp;
*m. ???? ''{{transl|ar|s?disun}}'', f. ????? ''{{transl|ar|s?disatun}}'' &nbsp;'sixth'&nbsp;
*m. ???? ''{{transl|ar|s?bi‘un}}'', f. ????? ''{{transl|ar|s?bi‘atun}}'' &nbsp;'seventh'&nbsp;
*m. ???? ''{{transl|ar|th?minun}}'', f. ????? ''{{transl|ar|th?minatun}}'' &nbsp;'eighth'&nbsp;
*m. ???? ''{{transl|ar|t?si‘un}}'', f. ????? ''{{transl|ar|t?si‘atun}}'' &nbsp;'ninth'&nbsp;
*m. ???? ''{{transl|ar|‘?shirun}}'', f. ????? ''{{transl|ar|‘?shiratun}}'' &nbsp;'tenth'&nbsp;
etc.

They are adjectives, hence there is agreement in gender with the noun, not polarity as with the cardinal numbers.  Note that "sixth" uses a different, older root than the number six.

==Verbs==

{{main|Arabic verbs}}
[[File:Arabic Verb Chart.png|right|200px|thumb|Arabic Verb Chart]]
Arabic verbs (??? fi‘l), like the verbs in other Semitic languages, are extremely complex. Verbs in Arabic are based on a root made up of three or four consonants (called a triliteral or quadriliteral root, respectively). The set of consonants communicates the basic meaning of a verb, e.g. k-t-b &nbsp;'write', q-r-’&nbsp; 'read', &nbsp;’-k-l &nbsp;'eat'. Changes to the vowels in between the consonants, along with prefixes or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as tense, person and number, in addition to changes in the meaning of the verb that embody grammatical concepts such as mood (e.g. indicative, subjunctive, imperative), voice (active or passive), and forms such as causative, intensive, or reflexive.

Since Arabic lacks an auxiliary verb "to have", constructions using li-, ‘inda, and ma‘a with the pronominal suffixes are used to describe possession. For example: 
???? ??? (‘indahu bayt) - literally: With him (is) a house. ?  He has a house.

==Prepositions==
{{Expand section|1=table (w/common meanings)|date=March 2014}}
There are two types of prepositions, based on whether they arise from  the [[Semitic root|triconsonantal roots system]] or not. There are ten 'true prepositions' (???? ????? {{transl|ar|ALA|?ur?f al-jarr}}) that do not stem from the triconsonantal roots:
??? ({{transl|ar|ALA|bi-}}), ??? ({{transl|ar|ALA|li-}}) and ??? ({{transl|ar|ALA|ka-}}), ?? ({{transl|ar|ALA|f?}}), ???? ({{transl|ar|ALA|min}}), ???? ({{transl|ar|ALA|‘an}}), ?????? ({{transl|ar|ALA|'il?}}), ???? ({{transl|ar|ALA|‘al?}}), ????? ({{transl|ar|ALA|?att?}}), and ?????? ({{transl|ar|ALA|mundhu}}) where the three first prepositions are prefixes to nouns and pronouns. These true prepositions cannot have prepositions preceding them, in contrast to the derived triliteral prepositions. True prepositions can also be used with certain verbs to convey a particular meaning. For example, ''to discuss'' and ''to search for'' share the same main verb (?????? {{transl|ar|ALA|ba?atha}}), but are succeeded by the prepositions ???? ({{transl|ar|ALA|‘an}}) and ?? ({{transl|ar|ALA|f?}}) respectively.

The prepositions arising from the triliteral root system are called 'adverbs of place and time' (???? ???? ????? ???? {{transl|ar|ALA|?ur?f mak?n wa-?ur?f zam?n}}) and work very much in the same way as the 'true' prepositions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ryding|first=Karin C.|title=A reference grammar of Modern Standard Arabic|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521777711|edition=6th printing|page=366}}</ref>

The noun following a preposition takes the [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Genitive case|genitive case]], or if the preceding word is a pronoun, its pronoun suffix (the enclitic pronouns above). However, prepositions can take whole clauses as their object if succeeded by 'an or 'anna, in which case the subject of the clause is in nominative.

Although the prepositions for physical relationships can be mapped coherently, abstract relationships do not, as is common in many languages like English. Furthermore, there is large variety of meanings attached to prepositions and their usage in [[Varieties of Arabic|colloquial varieties]].

==Syntax==

===Genitive construction (i??fah)===
<!-- "Arabic name" links to this section's title -->
A noun may be defined more closely by a subsequent noun in the genitive (????? {{transl|ar|ALA|i??fah}}, literally &nbsp;'addition'). The relation is hierarchical; the first term (?????? ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-mu??f}}'' &nbsp;'the thing added') governs the second term (?????? ???? ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-mu??f ilayhi}}'' &nbsp;'the thing added to'). E. g. ??? ??? ''{{transl|ar|baytu rajulin}}'' &nbsp;'the house of a man', &nbsp;'a man's house'. The construction as a whole represents a nominal phrase, the state of which is inherited from the state of the second term. The first term must be in the "construct state;" i.e., it carry neither the definite article nor the tanw?n. Genitive constructions of multiple terms are possible. In such case, all but the final term take the [[construct state]], and all but the first member take the [[genitive case]].

This construction is typical for a Semitic language. In many cases the two members become a fixed coined phrase, the {{transl|ar|ALA|i??fah}} being used as the equivalent of a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] noun used in some Indo-European languages (which does not exist in Arabic). ??? ?????? ''{{transl|ar|ALA|baytu al-?alabati}}'' thus may mean either &nbsp;'house of the (certain, known) students'&nbsp; or &nbsp;'the student hostel'.

Note: '''?''' ({{transl|ar|ALA|t?’ marb??ah}}) of the first term must always have a pronounced {{transl|ar|ALA|-t}} (after /a/) when spoken.

===Word order===
Classical Arabic tends to prefer the word order VSO (verb before subject) rather than SVO (subject before verb).  However, the word order is fairly flexible, since words are tagged by case endings. Subject pronouns are normally omitted except for emphasis or when using a participle as a verb (participles are not marked for person).  Auxiliary verbs precede main verbs, and prepositions precede their objects.

Adjectives follow the noun they are modifying, and agree with the noun in case, gender, number, and state: For example, ??? ????? "{{transl|ar|bintun jam?latun}}" &nbsp;'a beautiful girl'&nbsp; but ????? ??????? "{{transl|ar|al-bintu al-jam?latu}}" &nbsp;'the beautiful girl'. (Compare ????? ????? "{{transl|ar|al-bintu jam?latun}}" &nbsp;'the girl is beautiful'.) Elative adjectives, however, precede their modifying noun, do not agree with it, and require that the noun be in the genitive case (see below).

Note that case endings are dropped in [[pausa]] forms, in colloquial Arabic and in less formal registers of [[Modern Standard Arabic|MSA]] ("Formal Spoken Arabic").

===''inna''===
The subject of a sentence can be topicalized and emphasized by moving it to the beginning of the sentence and preceding it with the word ?? ''{{transl|ar|ALA|inna}}'' &nbsp;'indeed'.  Examples are ??? ??? ???? "{{transl|ar|ALA|innaka anta jam?lun}}" &nbsp;'You are beautiful indeed'&nbsp; or ?? ?????? ????? "{{transl|ar|ALA|inna al-sam?’a zarq?’u}}" &nbsp;'The sky is blue indeed'. (In older translations, "{{transl|ar|ALA|inna}}" was rendered as "verily".)

"{{transl|ar|ALA|Inna}}," along with its "sister" terms ?? "{{transl|ar|ALA|anna}}" ('that', as in "I think that ..."), "{{transl|ar|ALA|inna}}" ('that' after ???/???? ''{{transl|ar|ALA|q?la/yaq?lu}}'' &nbsp;'say'), ???? "{{transl|ar|ALA|(wa-)l?kin(na)}}" &nbsp;'but'&nbsp; and ??? "{{transl|ar|ALA|ka-anna}}" &nbsp;'as if'&nbsp; require that they be immediately followed by a noun in the accusative case, or an attached pronominal suffix.

===Other===
Object pronouns are [[clitic]]s and are attached to the verb; e.g., ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ar?-h?}}'' &nbsp;'I see her'.  Possessive pronouns are likewise attached to the noun they modify; e.g., "{{transl|ar|ALA|kit?bu-hu}}" &nbsp;'his book'.  The definite article "{{transl|ar|ALA|al-}}" is a clitic, as are the prepositions "{{transl|ar|ALA|li-}}" &nbsp;'to'&nbsp; and "{{transl|ar|ALA|bi-}}" &nbsp;'in, with'&nbsp; and the conjunctions "{{transl|ar|ALA|ka-}}" &nbsp;'as'&nbsp; and "{{transl|ar|ALA|fa-}}" &nbsp;'then, so'.

==Reform==
An overhaul of the systematic categorization of Arabic grammar was first suggested by the medieval philosopher [[Al-Jahiz|al-J??i?]], though it was not until two hundred years later when [[Ibn Ma???]] wrote his ''Refutation of the Grammarians'' that concrete suggestions regarding word order and [[Governance (linguistics)|linguistic governance]] were made.<ref>Shawqi Daif, ''Introduction to Ibn Mada's Refutation of the Grammarians'' (Cairo, 1947), p. 48.</ref> In the modern era, Egyptian litterateur [[Shawqi Daif]] renewed the call for a reform of Arabic grammar, advocating a sentence structure based on a subject and predicate.<ref>[http://acc.teachmideast.org/texts.php?module_id=1&reading_id=35&print=1 "The Emergency of Modern Standard Arabic,"] by [[Kees Versteegh]].

WARN  - 2014-11-30 14:42:45.123; org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.SolrWriter; Error creating document : SolrInputDocument(fields: [contents='''Forward compatibility''' is the ability of a design to gracefully accept [[Input/output|input]] intended for later [[versioning|versions]] of itself. The concept can be applied to entire systems, electrical [[User interface|interface]]s, [[telecommunication]] [[Signal (electronics)|signals]], data communication [[Communications protocol|protocols]], [[file format]]s, and [[computer]] [[programming language]]s. A [[Technical standard|standard]] supports forward compatibility if older [[product (business)|product]] versions can receive, read, view, play or execute the new standard gracefully, perhaps without supporting all new features.

The applicability of a forward compatible system with new versions requires not only the respecting of the older version by the designers of the newer version but additionally some [[Consensus|agreement]] on future design features with the [[Product lifecycle management|design freeze]] of current versions.
The introduction of a forward compatible technology implies that old devices partly can understand data generated by new devices.<ref name=Tulach>[http://books.google.com/books?id=DXYZZVlWOAkC&pg=PA233&dq=forward+compatibility+TV&hl=sv Practical API Design: Confessions of a Java Framework Architect], by [[Jaroslav Tulach]], Apress 2008, ISBN 1-4302-0973-9, ISBN 978-1-4302-0973-7, page 233</ref>

Although the concepts of forward compatibility and [[extensibility]] are similar, they are not the same. A forward compatible design can accept data from a future version of itself and pick out the "known" part of the data. An example is a text-only word processor ignoring picture data from a future version. An extensible design is one that can be upgraded to fully handle the new data in the newer input format. An example is a text-only word processor that can be upgraded to handle picture data.

A forward compatible system is expected to "[[Graceful exit|gracefully]]" handle input which is intended for a newer version, by ignoring the unknowns and selecting the known subset of the data that the system is capable of handling.

Forward compatibility is harder to achieve than [[backward compatibility]] because a system needs to cope gracefully with an unknown future [[File format|data format]] or requests for unknown future features. Backward compatibility does not have this issue because it accepts a known data format.

==Examples==

===Telecommunication standards===

The introduction of FM stereo transmission, or color television, allowed forward compatibility, since monophonic FM radio receivers and black-and-white TV sets still could receive a signal from a new transmitter.<ref name=Tulach/> It also allowed backward compatibility since new receivers could receive monophonic or black-and-white signals generated by old transmitters.

===Video gaming===
*The [[Game Boy]] system was forward compatible with most games created for the [[Game Boy Color]]. (Black colored cartridges could be played on either system, however clear-colored cartridges could only be played on the Game Boy Color.) {{Citation-needed|date=May 2014}}<!-- Is the hardware forward compatible?  Seems like some games made backward compatible. -->
*The [[Neo Geo Pocket]] was also forward compatible with games for the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]]. (Color games would only display in monochrome when played on a Neo Geo Pocket.)
*The [[Leapster]] is able to play [[Leapster L-Max]] games.<ref>http://leapfrog.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1432</ref>
*The [[Leapster L-Max]] is able to play [[Leapster2]] games.<ref>http://leapfrog.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1433</ref>
*The [[PlayStation 3]] can be played with a [[DualShock#DualShock 4|DualShock 4]] controller.<ref>http://www.ign.com/wikis/playstation-4/DualShock_4_Compatible_PlayStation_3_Games</ref>

===Systems architecture===
Many [[application software]] [[systems]] are designed with a robust and self-sufficient [[systems architecture]] so that they can operate adequately even when input for a more advanced version is entered.{{Clarify|date=April 2009|reason=this sounds like extensibility}}

In all cases, when the application system accepts the input data or operating system is not as expected, it will produce an [[output (computing)|output]] that will identify the problem accurately for the user.{{Clarify|date=April 2009}}

===Document formats===
An example of forward compatibility is with a word processor. Assume that Version 1 of a word processor only allows text, and no graphics. It saves files with only information about the text typed, and the font, color, and size of the text. Let's say that the program adds the mark [VERSION1 END] to denote the end of the file. However, next year Version 2 is released that accepts graphics. However, the new word processor saves all of the text at the beginning of the file, puts the [VERSION1 END] mark, and then stores the picture data next, and puts a [VERSION2 END] mark after the picture data. The Version 1 word processor would still be able to read the text data up to the [VERSION1 END] mark, but would ignore the picture data afterward. When Version 3 is released that allows videos in the word processor file, it would save in this format: text data [VERSION1 END], picture data [VERSION2 END], and video data [VERSION3 END].

====Adobe Reader / Adobe Acrobat====
Although the above file design allows forward compatibility, there are additional features that can be added to be more useful to the user. One would be if Version 1 of a program printed a message that the file was created with a newer version of the software, and that some data was not available. The Adobe Reader program generates a message notifying the user of a PDF file that it was created in a newer version of Adobe Acrobat, and some features will not be available.

====HTML====
[[HTML]] is designed to ignore all unknown tags, which makes most new features degrade gracefully in older browsers. One case where this did not work out of the box is JavaScript,  where the JavaScript code had to be included within comment blocks to prevent older browsers from displaying the JavaScript as text. {{Citation-needed|date=March 2013}}

====Microsoft Word====
Another useful feature is if Version 1 of a program offered to download a viewer or converter that allows the user to at least read files from newer versions of the program, even though the user may not be able to edit them. In the above word processor example, Version 1 would download updates from the internet that allows the user to see the pictures and videos in later versions of the word processor, even though the user cannot add, edit, or modify the multimedia data, due to that functionality not being in Version 1. An example of this functionality is Microsoft Word. When a document is created in Microsoft Word 2007 and opened in an earlier version (like Microsoft Word 2003), Microsoft Word 2003 tells the user it can download a converter to read files in the newer Microsoft Word 2007 format. This allows Microsoft Word 2003 to read data created by Microsoft Word 2007, even though the user cannot use Microsoft Word 2003 to build new data in the advanced format.

====PNG====
{{main|Portable Network Graphics}}
An example of forward compatibility is the [[Portable Network Graphics]] (PNG) format, which divides data into "[[Portable Network Graphics#"Chunks" within the file|chunks]]", and indicates whether these are "critical" or "ancillary", where ancillary chunks can be ignored by programs that do not understand them.

More subtly, it also indicates whether chunks are safe to copy by readers that do not recognize them – thus ensuring that data does not become out of sync.

The '''National Association of Underwater Instructors''' ('''NAUI''') is a non-profit 501(c)(6) association of [[Scuba diving|SCUBA]] instructors.<ref name="guidestar">{{cite web |url=http://www.guidestar.org/PartnerReport.aspx?Partner=networkforgood&ein=95-2572011 |title=GuideStar:NetWorkForGood-Organization Report |work=[[GuideStar]] |accessdate=8 March 2014}}</ref> It was officially [[CE mark|CE]] and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] certified in May 2007 in all three diver levels and both instructor levels.

==History==
NAUI was founded by [[Albert Tillman]] and Neal Hess in 1959. In August 1960, NAUI's first Instructor Certification Course was held at the Houston’s Shamrock Hilton Hotel with 72 candidates. The following year, in October 1961, NAUI was incorporated in the State of California as a non-profit educational organization. Al Tillman was the first President and Neal Hess, the Executive Secretary. Other original board members included John C. Jones of the Red Cross and Garry Howland of the United States Air Force. NAUI Worldwide is an international non-profit training agency.<ref name="SAHF">{{cite web |author=Tillman, Tom |title=The history of NAUI |publisher=Scuba America Historical Foundation |url=http://www.divinghistory.com/id17.html |accessdate=2009-05-23 }}</ref>

Captain [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]], the inventor of the [[Aqua-lung|aqualung]], was on the board of advisors of NAUI, as was [[Albert R. Behnke]], a pioneer of diving medicine.<ref name="SAHF" /> Actor [[Lloyd Bridges]] was the first honorary NAUI instructor member. He played [[frogman]] "Mike Nelson" in the American television series ''[[Sea Hunt]]'', which popularized scuba diving. [[Buster Crabbe]], the famous olympic swimmer and movie star, was a NAUI instructor. Other celebrities who are certified NAUI divers include [[Kevin Costner]], [[Lou Gossett Jr.]], and [[Cameron Diaz]]; [[Tiger Woods]] is a NAUI Divemaster member.

In 1974, NAUI began offering certifications in [[cave diving]].<ref name=Kendrick2009>{{cite journal |author=Kendrick, DF |title=Science of the National Association for Cave Diving (NACD): Water Quality, Hydrogeology, Biology and Psychology |journal=In: Pollock NW, ed.

Dauphin Island, AL: AAUS; 2009. |year=2009 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/10114 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}</ref>

Many of the [[List_of_undersea_explorers#First_Generation_Diving_Safety_Officers|first generation of diving safety officers]] of the top universities, colleges and institutes of technology in the [[United States]] were NAUI members and made significant contributions to NAUI's programs, including: Lee Somers [[University of Michigan]], James Stewart [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], Richard Bell [[University of California, Davis]], Henry Viex [[United States Military Academy]], Lloyd Austin [[University of California, Berkeley]], Mark Flahan [[California State University, San Diego]], Phillip Sharkey [[University of Rhode Island]], Ronnie D'Amico [[California State University, Long Beach]], Walt Hendricks, Sr. [[University of Puerto Rico]], Glen Egstrom [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and John Heine [[Moss Landing Marine Laboratories]].  These institutions, and others, belong to the [[American Academy of Underwater Sciences]] and, while their training programs greatly exceed minimum NAUI requirements, for the convenience of the participants in their [[scientific diving]] training programs, certifications are often arranged through NAUI. Many governmental agencies in the United States do the same, including the [[US Navy]], [[SEAL]]s, [[Army Special Forces]], and [[NASA]].<ref>http://www.naui.org/corp_alliances.aspx</ref>

==Courses==
NAUI was the first recreational training agency to sanction [[Nitrox]] training in 1992. It published standards for teaching technical diving in 1997, a practice that had been growing among NAUI members for several years. Training is provided ranging from Skin Diver through Instructor Course Director, with dozens of specialty courses. Thousands of member instructors, affiliated stores, resorts, and service centers are located in countries around the world.<ref name="NAUItrain">{{cite web |url=http://www.naui.org/training_progression.aspx |title=NAUI Training Progression |year=2008 |publisher=NAUI Worldwide |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref>

The '''American Legion''' is an [[organization]] of [[United States|U.S.]] [[war]] [[veterans]] formed in [[Paris]] on March 15-17, 1919, by [[Delegate|delegates]] from all [[military organization|units]] of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/19927/American-Legion American Legion] at ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''</ref>

==History==
===Background===
[[File:LC-DIG-ggbain-37582.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]], regarded as founding father of the American Legion.]]

The aftermath of two American wars in the second half of the 19th Century had seen the formation of several ex-soldiers' organizations. Following the [[American Civil War]] of 1861-65 former Union soldiers had established an organization called the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] (GAR), while their Southern brethren had joined together as the [[United Confederate Veterans]] (UCV) in the aftermath of hostilities.<ref name=James77>Marquis James, ''A History of the American Legion.'' New York: William Green, 1923; pg. 77.</ref> Both of these organizations had emerged as powerful political entities, with the GAR serving as a mainstay of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which controlled the Presidency from the Civil War through the Theodore Roosevelt administration for all but the two terms of office of [[Grover Cleveland]].<ref name=James77 /> In Southern politics the UCV maintained an even more dominant position as a bulwark of the conservative [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] which ruled there.<ref name=James77 />

Similarly, the conclusion of the short-lived [[Spanish-American War|Spanish-American conflict]] of 1898 had ushered in another ex-soldiers' organization, the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|American Veterans of Foreign Service]], today known as the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW).<ref name=Rumer9>Thomas A. Rumer, ''The American Legion: An Official History, 1919-1989.'' New York: M. Evans and Co., 1990; pg. 9.</ref>

With the termination of hostilities in [[World War I]] in November 1918, certain American officers who had been participants in the conflict began to think about the creation of a similar organization for the nearly two million men who had shipped out for European duty.<ref name=Rumer9 />

The need for an organization for former members of the [[Allied Expeditionary Forces]] (AEF) was pressing and immediate. With the war at an end, hundreds of thousands of impatient [[conscription|draftees]] found themselves trapped in France and pining for home, certain only that untold weeks or months lay ahead of them before their return would be logistically possible.<ref name=James14>James, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pg. 14.</ref> Morale plummeted.<ref name=James14 /> Cautionary voices were raised about an apparent correlation between disaffected and discharged troops and the [[Communism|Bolshevik]] uprisings taking place in [[Russian Revolution|Russia]], [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic|Finland]], [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|Germany]], and [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]].<ref name=James14 />

This situation was a particular matter of concern to Lt. Col. [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]], eldest son of the [[Theodore Roosevelt|26th President]]. One day in January 1919, Roosevelt had a discussion at General Headquarters with a mobilized National Guard officer named [[George A. White]], a former newspaper editor with the Portland ''[[The Oregonian|Oregonian]].''<ref name=James15>James, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pg. 15.</ref> After long discussion, Roosevelt suggested the establishment at once of a new servicemen's organization including all members of the AEF, as well as those soldiers who remained stateside as members of the [[U.S. Army|Army]], [[U.S. Navy|Navy]], and [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] during the war without having been shipped abroad.<ref name=James15 />

Roosevelt and White advocated ceaselessly for this proposal until ultimately they found sufficient support at headquarters to move forward with the plan. Orders were issued by Gen. [[John J. Pershing]] to a group of 20 non-career officers to report to [[YMCA]] headquarters in Paris on February 15, 1919.<ref name=James16>James, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pg. 16.</ref> The selection of these individuals was handled by Roosevelt.<ref name=James16 /> Joining them were a number of regular Army officers selected by Pershing himself.<ref name=Rumer13>Rumer, ''The American Legion,'' pg. 13.</ref>

The session of reserve and regular officers was given the task of providing a set of recommendations aimed at curbing the problem of declining morale.<ref name=James16 /> A series of proposals resulted from the three days of sessions, including elimination of restrictive regulations, organization of additional athletic events and recreational opportunities, and the expansion of leave time and entertainment programs.<ref>James, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pp. 16-17.</ref> At the end of the first day, the group retired to the Inter-Allied Officers Club, a converted home located across the street from the YMCA building,<ref name=Rumer13 /> where Lt. Col. Roosevelt unveiled his proposal for a new veterans' society for the first time.<ref>James, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pp. 17-18.</ref>

Most of those present were rapidly won to Roosevelt's plan.<ref name=James18>James, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pg. 18.</ref> The group decided to declare all of their actions provisional until a duly elected convention of delegates could be convened and made no effort to predetermine a program for the still-unnamed veterans organization.<ref name=James18 /> Instead they sought to expand their number through the convocation of a large preliminary meeting in Paris, to consist of an equal number of elected delegates from the ranks of enlisted men and the officer corps.<ref>James, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pp. 18-19.</ref>

A provisional executive committee of four people emerged from the February 15 "Roosevelt dinner": Roosevelt in the first place, who was to return to the United States and obtain his [[military discharge]] when able, and then to gather assistants and promote the idea of the new veterans' organization among demobilized troops there; George White, who was to travel France touring the camps of the AEF explaining the idea in person; Secretary of the group was veteran wartime administrator [[Eric Fisher Wood]], together with former [[Ohio]] [[United States Congress|Congressman]] [[Ralph D. Cole]], Wood was to establish a central office and to maintain contact by mail and telegram with the various combat divisions and headquarters staffs, as well as to publicize activities to the press.<ref>James, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pg. 20.</ref>

Preparations for a convention in Paris began apace. A convention call was prepared by Wood and "invitations" distributed to about 2,000 officers and enlisted men and publicized in the March 14, 1919 issue of ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]].''<ref>Rumer, ''The American Legion,'' pg. 15.</ref> The convention call expressed the desire to form "one permanent nation-wide organization...composed of all parties, all [[creed]]s, and all ranks who wish to perpetuate the relationships formed while in military service."<ref name=Rumer16>Rumer, ''The American Legion,'' pg. 16.</ref> In addition to the personal invitations distributed, the published announcement indicated that "any officer or enlisted man not invited who is in Paris at the time of the meeting is invited to be present and to have a voice in the meeting."<ref name=Rumer16 /> The conclave was slated to begin on March 15.

===The Paris Caucus (March 15–17, 1919)===
[[File:Paris Caucus-March1919.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The Paris Caucus of March 1919, first gathering of the American Legion.]]

Having immediately received a blizzard of acceptances to attend the opening of the "Liberty League Caucus," as he had begun to refer to it, Temporary Secretary Eric Fisher Wood began to search for use of a room of sufficient size to contain the gathering.<ref>Rumer, ''The American Legion,'' pp. 18-19.</ref> The Cirque de Paris had been retained, a large, multisided amphitheater sufficient to accommodate a crowd of about 2,000.<ref name=Rumer19>Rumer, ''The American Legion,'' pg. 19.</ref> Delegates began to assemble from all over France. The 10:00 am scheduled start was delayed due to various logistical problems, with a beginning finally made shortly after 2:45 pm.<ref name=Rumer21>Rumer, ''The American Legion,'' pg. 21.</ref>

As "Temporary Chairman" Teddy Roosevelt, Jr. had already departed for America, the session was gaveled to order by Eric Wood, who briefly recounted Roosevelt's idea and the story of the 20 AEF officers who had jointly helped to give the new organization form.<ref name=Rumer21 /> In his keynote opening remarks Wood recommended to the delegates of the so-called Paris Caucus that they do three things: first, set up an apparatus to conduct a formal founding conference in the United States sometime in the winter; second, the body should draft a tentative name for the organization; and finally, the body should compose a provisional constitution to be submitted to the founding convention for its acceptance or rejection.<ref>Rumer, ''The American Legion,'' pg. 23.</ref>

Convention rules were decided upon and four 15-member committees were chosen.<ref>Rumer, ''The American Legion,'' pg. 24.</ref>  The Committee on Name reported back that they had considered a dozen potential names, including Veterans of the Great War, Liberty League, American Comrades of the Great War, Legion of the Great War, and the American Legion, among others.<ref name=Rumer25>Rumer, ''The American Legion,'' pg. 25.</ref> This list was whittled down to five ranked choices for the consideration of the Caucus, with "The American Legion" the preferred option.<ref name=Rumer25 /> It was noted in passing during the course of debate on the topic that Teddy Roosevelt, Jr. had been responsible for an earlier organization called "The American Legion" in 1914, a "preparedness" society with a claimed membership of 35,000 which had been absorbed into the [[Council of National Defense]] in 1916.<ref>Rumer, ''The American Legion,'' pg. 28.</ref>

The Committee on Constitution reported with a report containing the draft of a Preamble for the organization, specifying organizational objectives.<ref name=Rumer25 /> This document stated that the group

<blockquote>"...desiring to perpetuate the principles of Justice, Freedom, and Democracy for which we have fought, to inculcate the duty and obligation of the citizen to the State; to preserve the history and incidents of our participation in the war; and to cement the ties of comradeship formed in service, do propose to found and establish an Association for the furtherance of the foregoing purposes."<ref name=Rumer26>Rumer, ''The American Legion,'' pg. 26.</ref></blockquote>

The majority report of the Committee on Convention recommended that 11 am on November 11, 1919 — one year to the hour after the termination of hostilities in World War I — be selected as the date and time for the convocation of a national convention.<ref name=Rumer26 /> No location was specified.<ref name=Rumer26 />

The Committee on Permanent Organization recommended an organization based upon territorial units rather than those based upon military organizations, governed by an Executive Committee of 50, with half of these coming from the officer corps and the other half coming from the ranks of enlisted men.<ref>Rumer, ''The American Legion,'' pp. 26-27.</ref>

===The St. Louis Caucus (May 8–10, 1919)===
[[File:Americanlegionweekly-220407.jpg|thumb|right|250px|This cover of the first official organ of the American Legion emphasizes the unemployment problem facing many ex-soldiers during the post-war recession.]]

The Paris Caucus in March was by its nature limited to soldiers of the AEF who remained in Europe; a parallel organizational meeting for those who had returned to the American preparatory to a formal organizational convention was deemed necessary. This was a conclave dominated by the presence of Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., who called the convention to order amidst mass [[chant]]ing akin to that of a [[United States presidential nominating convention|Presidential nominating convention]] — "We Want Ted-dy! We Want Ted-dy!"<ref>James, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pg. 44.</ref>

A minor crisis followed when Roosevelt twice declined nomination for permanent chairman of the session, to the consternation of many overwrought delegates, who sought to emphasize the symbolism of President Theodore Roosevelt's son maintaining the closest of connections with the organization.<ref>James, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pp. 45-46.</ref>

The work of the St. Louis Caucus was largely shaped by the fundamental decisions made by the earlier Paris Caucus. Its agenda was in addition carefully prepared by a 49-member "Advance Committee," which included at least one delegate from each fledgling state organization and which drew up a draft program for the organization in advance of the convention's opening.<ref>James, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pp. 47-48.</ref>

As time before the scheduled start of the convention was short, delegation to the assembly was highly irregular. On April 10, 1919, Temporary Secretary Eric Fisher Wood mailed a letter to the [[Governor]] of every state, informing them of the forthcoming gathering and making note of the non-partisan and patriotic nature of the League.<ref name=Pencak58>William Pencak, ''For God and Country: The American Legion, 1919-1941.'' Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1989; pg. 58.</ref> Follow-up cables by Roosevelt and Wood encouraged the organization of state conventions to select delegates.<ref name=Pencak58 /> This was, however, largely a failed formality, as states lacked sufficient time to organize themselves and properly elect delegates to St. Louis.<ref name=Pencak58 /> In practice, the fledgling organization's provisional Executive Committee decided to allow each state delegation twice as many votes at that state had in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and left it to each to determine how those votes were apportioned.<ref name=Pencak58 />

Participants at the St. Louis Caucus were enthusiastic although the session was not a productive one. Fully two days were invested choosing ceremonial officers and selecting Minneapolis as the site for the organization's formal Founding Convention in the fall.<ref name=Pencak59>Pencak, ''For God and Country,'' pg. 59.</ref> Over 1100 participants competed to gain the floor to speechify, leading one historian to describe the scene as a "melee" in which "disorder reigned supreme."<ref>The words are those of Dorothy R. Harper, "Hawaii — Department History," quoted in Pencak, ''For God and Country,'' pg. 59.</ref> Consequently, passage of the program by the gathering was largely a pro forma exercise, rushed through during the session's last day, with the actual decision-making process involving such matters as  the constitution and publications of the organization being done in committee at night.<ref name=Pencak59 />

The preamble of the constitution adopted in St. Louis<ref>Reprinted in George Seay Wheat, ''The Story of the American Legion: The Birth of the Legion.'' New York: G.P. Putnam Co., 1919; pg. 193.</ref> became one of the seminal statements of the Legion's orientation and objectives:

<blockquote>
"For God and Country we associate ourselves together for the following purposes:<br /><br />
"To uphold and defend the [[Constitution of the United States of America]]; to maintain [[law and order (politics)|law and order]]; to foster and perpetuate a [[Americanism (ideology)|100 Percent Americanism]]; to preserve the memories and incidents of our association in the Great War; to inculcate a sense of individual obligation to the community, state, and nation; to combat the autocracy of both the [[oligarchy|classes]] and the [[class struggle|masses]]; to make [[might makes right|right the master of might]]; to promote peace and good will on earth; to safeguard and transmit to prosperity the principles of [[justice]], [[political freedom|freedom]], and [[democracy]]; to consecrate and sanctify our comradeship by devotion to mutual helpfulness."</blockquote>

The St. Louis Caucus spent much of its time discussing resolutions: whether a stand should be taken on the [[League of Nations]], [[Prohibition]], or the implementation of [[universal military service]], whether posts composed of [[African-American|Negro]] soldiers should be established, and whether Secretary of War [[Newton D. Baker]] should be impeached for his apparent leniency towards [[conscientious objectors]] in the months after the war.<ref>Pencak, ''For God and Country,'' pp. 59-60.</ref>

A particularly hard line was taken towards the American radical movement, with one resolution passed on the final day calling on Congress to "pass a bill or immediately deporting every one of those [[Communist Party USA|Bolsheviks]] or [[Industrial Workers of the World]]."<ref name=Pencak60>Pencak, ''For God and Country,'' pg. 60.</ref> [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] was chosen for the site of the founding convention of the organization in November over the more centrally-located [[Chicago]] after much acrimonious debate about the perceived political transgressions of the Chicago city administration.

===Founding Convention (November 10–12, 1919)===
[[File:USA infantry Verdun WWI.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Hundreds of thousands of African-Americans were in segregated units in World War I, mostly assigned to non-combat duties. The early American Legion left the question of integration, the formation of [[racial segregation|segregated]] "Negro" posts, or exclusion of black soldiers from membership altogether up to the states and the posts themselves, often resulting in gross disparities of opportunity.<ref>Jones, ''A History of the American Legion, pg. 349.</ref>]]

The formal founding convention was held in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] from November 10 to 12, 1919. It was attended by 684 delegates from around the United States.<ref name=Jones44>Richard Seely Jones, ''A History of the American Legion.'' Indianapolis, IN: Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1946; pg. 44.</ref>

From the outset the American Legion maintained a strictly [[nonpartisan]] orientation towards electoral politics. The group wrote a specific prohibition of the endorsement of political candidates into its constitution,<ref>Quoted in Jones, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pg. 49.</ref> declaring:

<blockquote>
"...this organization shall be absolutely non-political and shall not be used for the dissemination of partisan principles or for the promotion of the candidacy of any person seeking public office or preferment; and no candidate for or incumbent of a salaried elective public office shall hold any office in the American Legion or in any branch or post thereof."</blockquote>

One semi-official historian of the organization has noted the way that this explicit refusal to affiliate with one or another [[political party]] had the paradoxical effect of rapidly building great political power for the organization, as [[politicians]] from both of the "old parties" competed for the favor of the Legion's massive and active membership.<ref>Jones, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pg. 45.</ref>

One of the gathering's primary accomplishment was the establishment of a permanent National Legislative Committee to advance the Legion's political objectives as its [[lobbyist|lobbying]] arm.<ref>Jones, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pg. 46.</ref> The first iteration of this official [[Washington, DC]]-based lobby for the Legion included only four members — two Republicans and two Democrats.<ref name=Jones47>Jones, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pg. 47.</ref> After 1920 the National Legislative Committee was expanded to consist of one member from each state, with additional effort made at the state level to exert pressure upon various [[state legislature]]s.<ref name=Jones47 />

Chief on the Legion's legislative agenda was a dramatic improvement of the level of compensation for soldiers who suffered [[permanent disability]] during the war. At the time of the end of World War I, American law stated that soldiers who suffered total disability were to receive only the base pay of a [[Private (rank)|Private]] — $30 per month.<ref name=Jones48>Jones, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pg. 48.</ref> The Legion concentrated its lobbying effort in 1919 on passage of legislation increasing payment for total disability suffered in the war to $80 a month — a sum roughly sufficient in dollars of the day to provide a [[living wage]].<ref name=Jones48 /> Those partially disabled by their wounds were to receive lesser payments.<ref name=Jones48 /> A flurry of lobbying by the Legion's National Legislative Committee in conjunction with cables sent to Congressional leaders by National Commander [[Franklin D'Olier]] helped achieve passage of this legislation by the end of 1919.<ref name=Jones48 />

The American Legion's chief base of support during its first years was among the officers corps of the [[Military reserve force|reserves]] and the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]].<ref>Jones, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pg. 85.</ref> The size of the regular army was comparatively small and its representation in the League in its earliest days was even more limited. Consequently, for nearly two decades the American Legion maintained a largely [[isolationism|isolationist]] perspective, best expressed in three resolutions passed by the Minneapolis founding convention:

<blockquote>
"1. That a large standing army is uneconomic and un-American. National safety with freedom from [[militarism]] is best assured by a national citizen army and navy based on the democratic principles of equality of obligation and opportunity for all.<br /><br />
"2. That we favor [[military education and training|universal military training]] and the administration of such a policy should be removed from the complete control of any exclusively military organization or caste.<br /><br />
"3. That we are strongly opposed to [[conscription|compulsory military service]] in time of peace."<ref name=Jones86>Jones, ''A History of the American Legion,'' pg. 86.</ref></blockquote>

Additional resolutions passed by the founding convention emphasized the need for military preparedness, albeit maintained through a citizens' army of reservists and National Guardsmen rather than through the costly and undemocratic structure of a vast standing army led by a professional military caste.<ref name=Jones86 /> This nationalist isolationism would remain in place until the very eve of American entry into the [[World War II|Second World War]].

===Centralia Massacre of 1919===
: ''See main article: [[Centralia Massacre (Washington)]].''
[[Image:Sock it hard.jpg|thumb|right|280px|In this political cartoon from the ''Portland Telegram'' a Legionnaire prepares to hit a ball labeled "Bolshevism" with a rifle butt labeled "100 per cent Americanism" beside a quote from Theodore Roosevelt: "Don't argue with the reds; go to bat with them and go to the bat strong!"]]

November 11, 1919, the first anniversary of [[Armistice Day]] and the occasion of the American Legion's formal launch at its Minneapolis Founding Convention, was also a historical moment of violence and controversy. On that day a parade of Legionnaires took place in the mill town of [[Centralia, Washington|Centralia]], located in Southwestern [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref name=Copeland50>Tom Copeland, ''The Centralia Tragedy of 1919: Elmer Smith and the Wobblies.'' Seattle, WA: University of Washington Press, 1993; pg. 40.</ref>

Plans were made by some of the marchers at the conclusion of their patriotic demonstration to storm and ransack the local hall maintained by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], a labor union which had been the target of multiple arrests, large trials, and various incidents of mob violence nationally during the months of American participation in World War I.<ref name=Copeland50 /> Plans for this less-than-spontaneous act of violence had made their way to the ears of the Wobblies, however, and 30 or 40 IWW members had been seen coming and going at their hall on the day of the march — some of whom were observed carrying guns.<ref name=Copeland50 />

At 2 pm the march began at the city park, led by a [[marching band]] playing "Over There."<ref name=Copeland51>Copeland, ''The Centralia Tragedy of 1919," pg. 51.</ref> Marchers included [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], members of the local [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks Lodge]], active-duty sailors and Marines, with about 80 members of the newly established Centralia and [[Chehalis, Washington|Chehalis]] American Legion posts bringing up the rear.<ref name=Copeland51 /> As the parade turned onto Tower Avenue and crossed Second Street, it passed IWW Hall on its left.<ref name=Copeland51 /> The parade stopped and Legionnaires surrounded the hall.<ref name=Copeland51 />

Parade Marshal Adrian Cormier rode up on horseback and, according to some witnesses, blew a whistle giving the signal to the Legionnaires to charge the IWW headquarters building.<ref name=Copeland51 /> A group of marchers rushed the hall, smashing the front plate glass window and attempting to kick in the door.<ref name=Copeland51 /> Just as the door gave way, shots were fired from within at the intruders.<ref name=Copeland51 /> This provided the signal to other armed IWW members, who were stationed across the street to set up a crossfire against potential invaders and they also began firing on the Legionnaires.<ref>Copeland, ''The Centralia Tragedy of 1919,'' pp. 51-52.</ref> In less than a minute the firing was over, with three AL members left dead or dying and others wounded.<ref name=Copeland52>Copeland, ''The Centralia Massacre of 1919,'' pg. 52.</ref>

Taken by surprise by the armed defense of IWW headquarters, many Legionnaires rushed home to arm themselves, while others broke into local hardware stores to steal guns and ammunition.<ref name=Copeland52 /> Now armed, a furious mob reassembled and charged the IWW Hall again, capturing six IWW members inside.<ref name=Copeland52 /> The mob proceeded to destroy the front porch of the hall and a large bonfire was built, upon which were torched the local Wobblies' official records, books, newspapers, and mattresses.<ref name=Copeland52 />

One local Wobbly named [[Wesley Everest]] escaped through a back door when he saw the mob approaching the hall.<ref name=Copeland52 /> He fled into nearby woods, exchanging gunshots with his pursuers.<ref name=Copeland52 /> One of those chasing the fleeing IWW man was hit in the chest several times with bullets and was killed, running the death count of Legionnaires to four.<ref name=Copeland52 /> Everest was taken alive, kicked and beaten, and a belt wrapped around his neck as he was dragged back to the town to be [[lynching|lynched]].<ref name=Copeland52 /> Local police intervened, however, and Everest was taken to jail, where he was thrown down on the concrete floor.<ref name=Copeland52 />

At 7:30 pm, on cue, all city lights in town went out for 15 minutes and Legionnaires stopped cars and forced them to turn out their headlights.<ref name=Copeland53>Copeland, ''The Centralia Tragedy of 1919,'' pg. 53.</ref> The Elks Hall gathering entered the jail without meeting resistance and took Wesley Everest, dragging him away to a waiting car but leaving other incarcerated Wobblies in jail cells unhindered.<ref>Copeland, ''The Centralia Tragedy,'' pp. 53-54.</ref> A procession of six cars drove west to a railroad bridge across the [[Chehalis River (Washington)|Chehalis River]].<ref name=Copeland54>Copeland, ''The Centralia Tragedy of 1919,'' pg. 54.</ref>

A rope was attached to Everest's neck and he was pushed off the bridge, but the lynching attempt was bungled and Everest's neck was not snapped by the fall.<ref name=Copeland54 /> Everest was hauled up again, a longer rope was substituted, and Everest was pushed off the bridge again.<ref name=Copeland54 /> The lynch mob then shined their car headlights on the hanging form of Everest and shot him for good measure.<ref name=Copeland54 />

Although a mob milled around the jail all night, terrorizing the occupants, no further acts of extra-legal retribution were taken.<ref name=Copeland54 />  Everest's body was cut down the next morning, falling into the riverbed below, where it remained all day.<ref name=Copeland55>Copeland, ''The Centralia Tragedy of 1919,'' pg. 55.</ref> As night fell Everest's body was hauled back to town, the rope still around his neck, where it was refused by local undertakers and left on the floor of the jail in sight of the prisoners all night.<ref name=Copeland55 /> No charges were ever filed in connection with the lynching.<ref name="Copeland, 1919, pg. 59">Copeland, ''The Centralia Tragedy of 1919,'' pg. 59.</ref>

Twelve IWW members were ultimately indicted by a grand jury for [[first degree murder]] in connection with the killing of the four Legionnaires and a local left wing lawyer was charged as an accessory to the crime.<ref name="Copeland, 1919, pg. 59"/> A January 1920 trial resulted in the conviction of six defendants on charges of [[second degree murder]].<ref>Copeland, ''The Centralia Tragedy of 1919,'' pp. 65, 82-83.</ref>

==Development==
The Site of Ferdinand Branstetter Post No. 1 of the American Legion is a vacant lot in Van Tassell, Wyoming where the first American Legion post in the United States was established in 1919. The post was named after Ferdinand Branstetter, a Van Tassell resident who died in World War I. The structure housing the post has since been demolished. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. In 1969, it was hoped that an interpretative sign would be put up, and also possibly that a restored post building would be constructed.
 
[http://warmonument.blogspot.com/2012/08/ferdinand-brandstetter-post-1-first.html An interpretative sign exists at the site, in 2009].

The first post of the American Legion, General John Joseph Pershing Post Number 1 in Washington, D.C., was organized on March 7, 1919, and obtained the first charter issued to any post of the Legion on May 19, 1919. The St. Louis caucus that same year decided that Legion posts should not be named after living persons, and the first post changed its name to George Washington Post 1. The post completed the constitution and made plans for a permanent organization. It set up temporary headquarters in [[New York City]] and began its relief, employment, and [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]] programs.

Congress granted the American Legion a national charter in September 1919.

===1920s===
[[File:Am Legion Crowd 1922 New Orleans Convention.jpg|thumb|320px|Crowd at American Legion Convention held in [[New Orleans]], 1922]]
The American Legion was very active in the 1920s. The organization was formally [[non-partisan]], endorsing candidates of no political party. Instead the group worked to the spread of the [[ideology]] of [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]] and acted as an [[lobbying]] organization on behalf of issues of importance to veterans, with particular emphasis on winning a "soldier's bonus" payment from the government and for the alleviation of the unemployment to which many soldiers returned.

The Legion also served a strong social function, building and buying "clubhouses" in communities across America at which its members could gather, reflect, network, and socialize.

In 1924, the Legion and other veterans organizations won their battle for additional compensation for World War I veterans with the passage of the [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act]]. Most payments were scheduled to be paid in 1945.<ref>American Red Cross, "World War Adjusted Compensation Act," updated: July 19, 1926, 363-74, [http://books.google.com/books?id=0WYXAAAAYAAJ& Available online"], accessed January 10, 2011</ref>

In 1923, American Legion Commander [[Alvin Owsley]] cited Italian Fascism as a model for defending the nation against the forces of the left.<ref>William Pencak, ''For God And Country: the American Legion, 1919-1941'' Northeastern University Press, 1989; pg. 21.</ref> Owsley said:

<blockquote>
If ever needed, the American Legion stands ready to protect our country's institutions and ideals as the Fascisti dealt with the destructionists who menaced Italy!...

The Legion invited Mussolini to speak at its convention as late as 1930.<ref name=campbell/>

The American Legion was instrumental in the creation of the [[U.S. Veterans' Bureau]], now known as the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]]. The Legion also created its own [[American Legion Baseball]] Program, hosting national tournaments annually from 1926.

Commander Travers D. Carmen awarded [[Charles Lindbergh]] its "Distinguished Service Medal," the medal's first recipient, on July 22, 1927.  American Legion national convention was held in Paris, France in September 1927. A major part of this was drum and bugle corps competition in which approximately 14,000 members took part.

===1930s  to 1950s===
The [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Michigan)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]] in [[Traverse City, Michigan]], was completed in 1930.<ref>[http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,1607,7-151-9620_11154_11188-28476--,00.html Information on the American Legion Memorial Bridge (Michigan Department of Transportation Web Site)]. The Traverse City city commission decided to purchase dedication plaques for $100 at the request of the American Legion in 1930.</ref>

The Sons of the American Legion formed at the American Legion's 14th National Convention in [[Portland, Oregon]], on September 12–15, 1932. Membership is limited to the male descendants of members of the American Legion, or deceased individuals who served in the armed forces of the United States during times specified by the American Legion.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In the spring of 1933, at the very beginning of his presidency, President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] sought to balance the federal budget by sharp reductions in veterans benefits, which constituted one quarter of the federal budget. The [[Economy Act]] of 1933 cut disability pensions and established strict new guidelines for proving disabilities. The American Legion generally supported the FDR administration and the Act, while the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] (VFW) was loudly opposed. After a VFW convention heard speeches denouncing FDR's programs, the American Legion invited Roosevelt to speak and he won the convention's support. Nevertheless, the Legion's stance was unpopular with its membership and membership plummeted in 1933 by 20% as 160,000 failed to renew their memberships. The VFW then campaigned for a "Bonus Bill" that would immediately pay World War I veterans what they were due in 1945 under the 1924 World War Adjusted Compensation Act. The Legion's failure to take a similar position allowed the much smaller, less prestigious VFW to rally support while accusing the Legion of ties to the FDR Administration and business interests.

In December 1933, retired General [[Smedley Butler]], a popular and colorful speaker, toured the country on behalf of the VFW, calling on veterans to organize politically to win their benefits.<ref>Stephen R. Ortiz, "The 'New Deal' for Veterans: The Economy Act, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Origins of the New Deal," ''Journal of Military History,'' vol. 70 (2006), 417-37</ref> Butler believed the American Legion was controlled by banking interests. On December 8, 1933, explaining why he believed veterans' interests were better served by the VFW than the American Legion, he said: "I said I have never known one leader of the American Legion who had never sold them out–and I mean it."<ref>''New York Times'': [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40F17FA3C5513738DDDA90994DA415B838FF1D3& "Butler for Bonus out of Wall Street," December 10, 1933], accessed January 10, 2011</ref>

In November 1934, Butler told the [[New York Post|New York ''Evening Post'']] and a congressional subcommittee that representatives of powerful industrial interests and the American Legion were trying to induce him to lead the Legion in a campaign to preserve the gold standard and to engineer a coup against President Roosevelt with Butler's aid in marshaling the support of veterans. Everyone implicated denied involvement and the press gave the story little credence.

Nevertheless, Butler's charges, elaborated by articles in the Communist newspaper ''New Masses'', gave birth to an enduring conspiracy theory, known as the [[Business Plot]], that powerful business interests in alliance with the Legion planned to overthrow the federal government.<ref>George Wolfskill, ''The Revolt of the Conservatives: A History of the American Liberty League, 1934-1940'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1962), 81-101. For an extended account of the conspiracy theory, see Jules Archer, ''The Plot to Seize the White House'' (NY: Hawthorn Books, 1973)</ref>

In 1935, the [[Premier Boys State|first Boys' State]] convened in [[Springfield, Illinois]]. The American Legion's first National High School Oratorical Contest was held in 1938.

In 1942, the Legion adopted the practice of the VFW to become a perpetual organization, rather than die off as its membership aged as that of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] was rapidly doing. The Legion's charter was changed to allow veterans of [[World War II]] to join. Throughout the 1940s, the American Legion was active in providing support for veterans and soldiers who fought in World War II. The American Legion wrote the original draft of the Veterans Readjustment Act, which became known as the [[G.I. Bill]]. The original draft is preserved at the Legion's National Headquarters.  The American Legion vigorously campaigned for the G.I. Bill, which was signed into law in June 1944.

The first [[Boys Nation]] program was held in 1946.

At the Legion's 1951 convention at Miami, Florida, it formally endorsed its "Back to God" movement.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=5kFF6a1viGcC&pg=PA954 |author=Sydney E.

In 1952, the American Legion asked for a congressional investigation into the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) to determine if it was a communist or communist front organization.<ref>William A. Donohue, ''The Politics of the American Civil Liberties Union'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 1985), 182</ref>

Veterans of the [[Korean War]] were approved for membership in the American Legion in 1950, and the American Legion Child Welfare Foundation was formed in 1954.

On May 30, 1969, the Cabin John Bridge, which carried the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]] (I-495) across the Potomac River northwest of [[Washington, D.C.]], was officially renamed to the "[[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]]" in a ceremony led by [[Lewis Blaine Hershey|Lt.

In 1976, an outbreak of [[bacteria]]l [[pneumonia]] occurred in a convention of the American Legion at [[The Bellevue Stratford Hotel]] in [[Philadelphia]]. This pneumonia killed 34 people at the convention and later became known as [[Legionellosis|Legionnaires' disease]] (''Legionellosis''). The bacterium that causes the illness was later named ''[[Legionella]]''.

After a 1989 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision, the American Legion launched and funded an unsuccessful campaign to win a constitutional amendment against [[Flag desecration|harming the flag]] of the United States. The Legion formed the  Citizens' Flag Honor Guard and it later became the [[Citizens Flag Alliance]].<ref>[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php? Citizens Flag Alliance]</ref>

In 1993, the Commonwealth of [[Massachusetts]] renamed a bridge in the city of [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]] to the "American Legion Memorial Bridge".<ref>[http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/actsResolves/1993/1993acts0091.pdf Archives, Library of the State of Massachusetts]  Retrieved June 11, 2007</ref>

Also in 1993, two members of [[Garden City, Michigan|Garden City]], [[Michigan]] American Legion Post 396 shared an idea that would bond motorcycle enthusiasts in the Legion from the idea of Chuck Dare and post commander Bill Kaledas, creating the American Legion Riders. Joined by 19 other founding members, the group soon found itself inundated with requests for information about the new group. As a source of information [http://www.americanlegionriders.net a website] was set up, and it continues to be a source of information worldwide.  By 2009, the American Legion Riders program had grown to over 1,000 chapters and 100,000 members in the United States and overseas.

In a letter to U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] in May 1999, the American Legion urged the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from [[Operation Allied Force]] in [[Yugoslavia]]. The National Executive Committee of The American Legion met and adopted a resolution unanimously that stated, in part, that they would only support military operations if "Guidelines be established for the mission, including a clear exit strategy" and "That there be support of the mission by the [[U.S. Congress]] and the American people."<ref>C-SPAN Video Library: [http://www.c-spanvideo.org/videoLibrary/clip.php?appid=596636896 "American Legion Urges Withdrawal of Troops from Yugoslavia," May 18, 1999], accessed December 30, 2010</ref>

In 2006, the Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, [[Steve Buyer]] (R-Ind.), announced that he planned to eliminate the annual congressional hearings for Veterans Service Organizations that was established by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. In response, National Commander of the American Legion Thomas L. Bock said, "I am extremely disappointed in Chairman Buyer's latest effort to ignore the Veterans Service Organizations. Eliminating annual hearings before a joint session of the Veterans Affairs Committees will lead to continued budgetary shortfalls for VA resulting in veterans being underserved."<ref>''Army Times'': [http://www.armytimes.com/legacy/new/1-292925-1865966.php Rick Maze, "Battle between Legion, Buyer Rages On," June 12, 2006], accessed December 30, 2010</ref>

==Programs==
At the state level, The American Legion is organized into "departments", which run annual civic training events for high school juniors called [[Boys State]].  Two members from each Boys State are selected for [[Boys Nation]]. The [[American Legion Auxiliary]] runs [[Girls State]] and [[Girls Nation]]. In addition to Boys State, The American Legion features numerous programs including American Legion Baseball, Scouting, Oratorical Contests, Junior Shooting Sports, Youth Alumni, Sons of The American Legion, The American Legion Riders, and Scholarships at every level of the organization.

==Organizational structure==
[[File:American Legion National Headquarters, Indianapolis Indiana.jpg|right|thumb|American Legion Headquarters in Indianapolis]]

===Posts===
The Post is the basic unit of the Legion and usually represents a small geographic area such as a single town or part of a county. There are roughly 14,900 posts in the United States. The Post is used for formal business such as meetings and a coordination point for community service projects. Often the Post will host community events such as bingo, Hunter breakfasts, holiday celebrations, and available to the community, churches in time of need. It is also not uncommon for the Post to contain a bar open during limited hours. A Post member is distinguished by a navy blue garrison cap with gold piping.

===Counties===
Each U.S. county comprises several Posts and oversees their operations, led by a County Council of elected officers. The County Commander performs annual inspections of the Posts within their jurisdiction and reports the findings to both the District and the Department level. A County Commander is distinguished by a navy blue garrison cap with white piping.

===Districts===
Each Department is divided into Divisions and/or Districts. Each District oversees several Posts, generally about 20, to help each smaller group have a larger voice. Divisions are even larger groups of about four or more Districts. The main purpose of these "larger" groups (Districts—Divisions) is to allow one or two delegates to represent an area at conferences, conventions, and other gatherings, where large numbers of Legionnaires may not be able to attend. A District Commander is distinguished by a navy blue garrison cap with a white crown and gold piping.

===Departments===
The Posts are grouped together into a state level organization known as a Department for the purposes of coordination and administration. There is a total of 55 Departments; one for each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, France, Mexico, and the Philippines. Canada was merged into Department of New York several years ago. The three Departments located overseas are intended to allow active duty military stationed and veterans living overseas to be actively involved with the American Legion similar to as if they were back in the States. The Department of France consists of 29 Posts located in 10 European counties, the Department of Mexico consists of 22 Posts located in Central America, and the Department of Philippines covers Asia and the Pacific Islands. A Department Officer or Department Executive Committee Representative is distinguished by a white garrison cap with gold piping.

===National headquarters===
The main American Legion Headquarters is located on the [[Indiana World War Memorial Plaza]] in Indianapolis. It is the primary office for the National Commander and also houses the historical archives, library, Membership, Internal Affairs, Public Relations, and the Magazine editorial offices.<ref>American Legion: [http://www.legion.org/offices "Office Locations], accessed December 30, 2010</ref> The Legion also owns a building in Washington D.C. that contains many of the operation offices such as Economics, Legislative, Veterans Affairs, Foreign Relations, National Security, and Media Relations, and etc. A National Officer or National Executive Committee Representative is distinguished by a red garrison cap with gold piping.

[[File:Jean-Jacques_Lebel_(2008).png|thumb|Portrait of Jean-Jacques Lebel, 2008]]
'''Jean-Jacques Lebel''' is a French artist, poet, poetry publisher, political activist and scholar born in Paris in 1936. He is known primarily for his work with [[Happening]]s, and as an [[art theory]] writer and art [[curator]]. He is the son of Robert Lebel, art critic and friend of [[Marcel Duchamp]].

==Life and work==
Lebel had his first exhibition in 1955 at Galleria Numero in [[Florence]], Italy. After a brief period of time with [[Surrealist]]s, Lebel exhibited in [[Milan]] and [[Paris]], and then went on to exhibit at various museums and galeries around the world. He has regularly collaborated with artist and writer Arnaud Labelle-Rojoux. 

Beginning in 1955, Lebel published a poetry journal called ''Front Unique'' and organized various nomadic poetry festivals, such as ''La Libre Expression'' (''Free Expression'') in 1964 and ''Polyphonix'' in 1979. In the 1960s, Lebel translated into French and published various work by [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Michael McClure]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]].

In 1960, Lebel oversaw and partook in the first European [[Happening]] ''L'enterrement de la Chose'' in [[Venice]]. For his performance there - called ''Happening Funeral Ceremony of the Anti-Process'' - Lebel invited the audience to attend a ceremony in formal dress. In a decorated room within a grand residence, a draped "cadaver" rested on a plinth which was then ritually stabbed by an "executioner" while a "service" was read consisting of extracts from the French décadent writer [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] and le [[Marquis de Sade]]. Then pall-bearers carried the coffin out into a gondola and the "body" - which was in fact a mechanical sculpture by [[Jean Tinguely]] - was ceremonially slid into the canal.<ref>[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]], 2009. p. 323</ref>

During the 1960s, Lebel closely followed the work of the avant-garde American theatre group [[The Living Theatre]]. He extensively interviewed the group's members and accompanied them during rehearsal, which would lead to the 1969 book ''Entretiens avec le Living Theatre.''

Lebel published the first critical essay in French on the Happening movements throughout the world, citing the 1920 ''Dada-Messe'' (First International [[Dada]] Fair) as the key precedent of the modern happening in Europe. After this, he produced over 70 Happenings, performances and actions on numerous continents, including ''Pour conjurer l'esprit de catastrophe'' (1962), ''Déchirex'' (1965) and ''120 minutes dédiées au divin marquis'' (1966). In 1967 he staged in [[Gassin]] at the ''Festival de la Libre Expression''  [[Pablo Picasso]]'s 1941 surrealist theatrical farce in six acts ''Le Désir attrapé par la queue'' (''Desire Caught by the Tail'').

In 1968, Lebel took part in the activities of ''[[Movement of 22 March|Mouvement du 22-mars]]'', followed by ''Noir et Rouge'', an [[anarchist]] group, and the [[Socialist]] splinter group ''Informations et Correspondences Ouvrières.'' Lebel also followed the philosophical teachings of [[Gilles Deleuze]] at Faculty de Vincennes at [[Paris 8 University]]. 1980 Lebel organized a ''Performance Festival'' at the ARC - [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]], amongst others with Harry de Kroon, Julien Blaine, Joel Hubaut and Barbara Heinisch. 

With [[François Pain]] he produced the 90 minute long ''Monument à Félix Guattari, le film'' and in 1994 he installed a large [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] entitled ''Monument à [[Félix Guattari]]'' in the Forum of the [[Centre Pompidou]].  

Since 2001 he has frequently exhibited his ''Manifestation Itinérante'' and his [[digital art]] [[morphing]] animation ''Reliquaire pour un culte de Vénus'' that is based on the concept of ''vénusté'' as put forward by [[Pierre Klossowski]].

In 2001, he was the guest curator at the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] of the [[erotic]] work of [[Pablo Picasso]] called ''Picasso Erotique'' and appeared on the [[Charlie Rose]] show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/2987 |title=Charie Rose Interview}}</ref> The exhibition traveled to the [[Museu Picasso]] in Barcelona and [[Galerie nationale du jeu de paume]] in Paris. A book entitled ''Picasso Erotique'' was produced by Prestel Publishing in 2001 as a result of the show. This book contains texts by Lebel, Pablo Picasso, Annie Le Brun, [[Pascal Quignard]], Patrick Roegiers and Malen Gual.

In 2009, [[La Maison Rouge]] in Paris presented all facets of Lebel's work (artist, exhibition curator, writer, performer, and art festival organizer) in an exhibition entitled ''Jean-Jacques Lebel, Soulvements.'' The exhibition was divided into the following themes: [[Happenings]], [[Insubordination]], [[Poetry]], [[Hallucination]], [[Eros]], [[Dada]], [[War]] and the [[Rhizome]] - and was illustrated with works of primitive art, works by anonymous artists and others such as [[Johann Heinrich Füssli]], [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]], [[Louise Michel]], [[Fourier]]{{dn|date=April 2013}}, [[Ravachol]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]], [[André Breton]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Victor Brauner]], [[Bernard Heidsieck]], [[Erró]], [[Antonio Saura]], and [[Peter Saul]]. Some three hundred works in all. The show curator was Jean de Loisy.<ref>[http://www.lamaisonrouge.org/fr/fiche.php?section=menu05&rubrique=9&fiche=113] La Maison Rouge</ref>

In 2013, Laure Adler produced an extensive radio interview with Lebel called ''L'iconoclaste Jean-Jacques Lebel'' (in 5 parts) that was broadcast on [[France Culture]].<ref>[http://www.franceculture.fr/emission-hors-champs-l-iconoclaste-jean-jacques-lebel-15-2013-02-18 ''L'iconoclaste Jean-Jacques Lebel'' on [[France Culture]]]</ref>

'''The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc''' (also known as '''RBS Group''') is a British banking and insurance [[holding company]], based in Edinburgh, Scotland. The group operates a wide variety of banking brands offering personal and business banking, private banking, insurance and [[corporate finance]] through its  offices located in Europe, North America and Asia. In the UK and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], its main subsidiary companies are [[The Royal Bank of Scotland]],<ref>The Scottish Gaelic name ({{lang-gd|Banca Rìoghail na h-Alba}}) is used by its [[retail banking]] branches in parts of Scotland, especially in signage and customer stationery.</ref>  [[National Westminster Bank]], [[Ulster Bank]], [[Drummonds Bank]], and [[Coutts & Co.|Coutts]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/member_royal_bank_of_scotland.php |title=The Royal Bank of Scotland |publisher=Scotbanks.org |date= |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref> The group issues [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|banknotes]] in Scotland and Northern Ireland and, as of 2014, The Royal Bank of Scotland is the only bank in the UK which is still printing the [[Pound sterling|£1]] notes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknote_denominations.php |title=Current Banknotes  |date= |publisher=Committee of Scottish Bankers |accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref>

Outside the UK, it owns [[Citizens Financial Group]], the 8th largest bank in the [[United States]], and from 2004 to 2009 it was the second largest shareholder in the [[Bank of China]], itself the world's fifth largest bank by market capitalisation in February 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://financialranks.com/?p=69 |title=World's largest banks |publisher=Financialranks.com |date=5 February 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref>

Before the 2008 collapse and the general [[Late-2000s financial crisis|financial crisis]], RBS Group was very briefly the largest bank in the world and for some time was the second largest bank in the UK and Europe (fifth in stock market value), and the fifth largest in the world by [[market capitalisation]]. Subsequently, with a slumping share price and major loss of confidence, the bank fell sharply in the rankings, although in 2009 it was briefly the world's largest company by both assets (£1.9 trillion) and liabilities (£1.8 trillion).<ref>[http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2009/01/19/51341/rbs-et-mon-droit-hm-deficits/ RBS et mon droit: HM deficits] ([[FT Alphaville]], accessed 20 January 2009)</ref> It received significant support from the UK government, which, as of September 2013, holds and manages an 81% stake through [[UK Financial Investments]] (UKFI),<ref>{{cite news |title=Lloyds advised to strengthen TSB balance sheet |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24056373 |newspaper=BBC News |date=11 September 2013 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref> although its voting rights are limited to 75% in order for the bank to retain its listing on the [[London Stock Exchange]].

The Group had a market capitalisation of approximately £20.4&nbsp;billion as of 4 March 2014, making it the 26th largest company on the [[London Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.stockchallenge.co.uk/ftse.php |title=FTSE All-Share Index Ranking| publisher=stockchallenge.co.uk| accessdate=4 March 2014}}</ref> In addition to its primary share listing on the LSE, the company is also listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].

==History==
{{For|the history of the Royal Bank of Scotland before the holding company|The Royal Bank of Scotland}}
By 1969, economic conditions were becoming more difficult for the banking sector. In response, the [[National Commercial Bank of Scotland]] merged with the Royal Bank of Scotland.<ref name=NCBS>{{Cite web |url=http://heritagearchives.rbs.com/wiki/National_Commercial_Bank_of_Scotland_Ltd%2C_Edinburgh%2C_1959-69 |title=National Commercial Bank of Scotland Ltd, Edinburgh, 1959–69 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work=RBS Heritage Online |publisher=The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc}}</ref> The resulting company had 662 branches. The merger resulted in a new [[holding company]], '''National and Commercial Banking Group Ltd.''' The English and Welsh branches were reorganised, until 1985, as [[Williams & Glyn's Bank]], while the Scottish branches all transferred to the Royal Bank name. The holding company was renamed The Royal Bank of Scotland Group in 1979.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://heritagearchives.rbs.com/wiki/The_Royal_Bank_of_Scotland_plc%2C_Edinburgh%2C_1727-date |title=The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, Edinburgh, 1727-date |accessdate=16 April 2010 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work=RBS Heritage Online |publisher=The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc}}</ref>

===Takeover bids===
[[File:Royal Bank of Scotland global locations.png|thumb|Royal Bank of Scotland Group footprints]]
During the late 1970s and early 1980s the Royal Bank was the subject of three separate takeover approaches. In 1979, [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]], which had previously built up a 16.4% stake in the Royal Bank, made a takeover approach for the remaining shares it did not own. The offer was rejected by the board of directors on the basis that it was detrimental to the bank's operations. However when the [[Standard Chartered Bank]] proposed a merger with the Royal Bank in 1980, the board responded favourably. Standard Chartered Bank was headquartered in London, although most of its operations were in the Far East, and the Royal Bank saw advantages in creating a truly international banking group. Approval was received from the [[Bank of England]], and the two banks agreed a merger plan that would have seen the Standard Chartered acquire the Royal Bank and keep the UK operations based in Edinburgh. However, the bid was scuppered by the [[Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]] (HSBC) which tabled a rival offer. The bid by HSBC was not backed by the Bank of England and was subsequently rejected by the Royal Bank's board. However the [[British government]] referred both bids to the [[Monopolies and Mergers Commission]]; both were subsequently rejected as being against the public interest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1982/150hongkong_shanghai_banking_corp_stand_chartered_bank_royal_bank_of__scotland_group_ltd.htm |title=The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Standard Chartered Bank Limited and The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Limited |publisher=Competition Commission |date=2 September 2004 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref>

The Bank did obtain an international partnership with [[Banco Santander|Banco Santander Central Hispano]] of Spain, each bank taking a 5% stake in the other. However this arrangement ended in 2005, when Banco Santander Central Hispano acquired UK bank [[Abbey National]]{{spaced ndash}}and both banks sold their respective shareholdings.

===International expansion===
The first international office of the bank was opened in New York in 1960. Subsequent international banks were opened in Chicago, Los Angeles, [[Houston]] and Hong Kong. In 1988 the bank acquired Citizens Financial Group, a bank based in [[Rhode Island]], United States. Since then, Citizens has acquired several other American banks and in 2004 acquired [[Charter One Bank]] to become the 8th largest bank in the United States.

The Royal Bank also opened offices in Europe and now has subsidiaries in: Austria, Switzerland, France, Italy, Germany, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, [[Romania]] and the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. In the Asia-Pacific region, the bank has offices in:  Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan and [[Singapore]].

On 27 February 2014 after reporting a 2013 loss of  £9bn the bank announced it would scale back its international presence. "Let me spell it out very clearly: the days when RBS sought to be the biggest bank in the world, those days are well and truly over," Chief Executive [[Ross McEwan]], who had been in charge of the bank for four months, said in unveiling plans to reduce costs by  £5bn over four years. "Our ambition is to be a bank for U.K. customers," he added.<ref name="RBStodownsize">{{cite news|title=RBS unveils plan to reduce global presence after posting big loss|url=http://www.scotlandnews.net/index.php/sid/220259295/scat/5ba58fd38447f467/ht/RBS-unveils-plan-to-reduce-global-presence-after-posting-big-loss|accessdate=2 March 2014|publisher=''Scotland News.Net}}</ref>

===National Westminster Bank===
The late 1990s saw a new wave of consolidation in the financial services sector. In 1997, RBS formed a [[joint venture]] to set up [[Tesco Bank]].<ref name="Sky" /><ref name="Butter" /> In 1999, the [[Bank of Scotland]] launched a hostile takeover bid for English rival NatWest. The Bank of Scotland intended to fund the deal by selling off many of the NatWest’s subsidiary companies, including Ulster Bank and Coutts. However, the Royal Bank subsequently tabled a counter-offer, sparking off the largest hostile takeover battle in UK corporate history. A key differentiation from the Bank of Scotland’s bid was the Royal Bank’s plan to retain all of NatWest’s subsidiaries. Although NatWest, one of the "[[Big Four (banks)|Big 4]]" English clearing banks, was significantly larger than either Scottish bank, it had a recent history of poor financial performance and plans to merge with insurance company [[Legal & General]] were not well received, prompting a 26% fall in share price.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/626198.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=NatWest takeover: a chronology | date=10 February 2000 | accessdate=10 April 2010}}</ref>

On 11 February 2000, The Royal Bank of Scotland was declared the winner in the takeover battle, becoming the second largest banking group in the UK after [[HSBC|HSBC Holdings]]. NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland became subsidiaries of the holding company; The Royal Bank of Scotland Group. NatWest as a distinct banking brand was retained, although many back office functions of the bank were merged with the Royal Bank's leading to over 18,000 job losses throughout the UK.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/639201.stm NatWest merger's mixed fortunes] BBC News, 2000</ref>

===Further expansion===
[[File:Royal Bank of Scotland. - geograph.org.uk - 26163.jpg|thumb|The new headquarters nearing completion in 2005]]
In 1967, RBS became the first Scottish bank to install an [[Automated Teller Machine]] (cashpoint) and by 1980 the service, known as [[Cashline]] had become the busiest ATM network in the world.  {{As of|2012}}, it was the largest privately owned ATM network in the UK and a member of the [[LINK (UK)|LINK ATM]] network. In 1997, RBS was the first bank in the world to make its ATMs available to all cardholders. The word ''Cashline'', in Scotland at least, has become a generic term for an ATM.

In August 2005, the bank expanded into China, acquiring a 10% stake in the Bank of China for £1.7&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4162170.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=RBS leads $3.1bn China investment | date=18 August 2005 | accessdate=10 April 2010}}</ref>

A new international headquarters was built at [[Gogarburn]] on the outskirts of Edinburgh, and was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2005/09/14110145|title=New RBS headquarters|publisher=Scottish Government|date=14 September 2005|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref>

The Group was part of a consortium with Belgian bank [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis]] and Spanish bank [[Banco Santander]] that acquired Dutch bank [[ABN AMRO]] a on 10 October 2007. Rivals speculated that RBS had overpaid for the Dutch bank<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/oct/07/money1 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Barclays boss: RBS overpaid for ABN Amro | first=Ruth | last=Sunderland | date=8 October 2007 | accessdate=10 April 2010}}</ref> although the bank pointed out that of the £49bn paid for ABN AMRO, RBS's share was only £10bn (equivalent to £167 per citizen of the UK).<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityam.com/index.php?news=8833 |title=Does RBS’s acquisition of ABN AMRO really do what it says on the tin? |publisher=Cityam.com |date= |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref>

[[Coutts]] Bank's international businesses were renamed RBS Coutts on 1 January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4c8f95ac-0171-11e1-b177-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2NqAMHsr0|title=Coutts to drop RBS brand|date=30 October 2011|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref>

=== 2008–2009 financial crisis ===
{{main|2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package|2009 United Kingdom bank rescue package}}
After previous denials following press coverage,<ref name="autogenerated1" /> on 22 April 2008 RBS announced a [[rights issue]] which aimed to raise £12bn in new capital to offset a [[writedown]] of £5.9bn resulting from credit market positions and to shore up its reserves following the purchase of ABN AMRO. This was, at the time, the largest rights issue in British corporate history.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/BUSINESS/05/15/rbs.rights.issue.ap/index.html |publisher=CNN |title=RBS rights issue | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

The bank also announced that it would review the possibility of divesting some of its subsidiaries to raise further funds, notably its insurance divisions [[Direct Line]] and [[Churchill Insurance|Churchill]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7359940.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=RBS sets out £12bn rights issue | date=22 April 2008 | accessdate=10 April 2010}}</ref> However, as of September 2013, Churchill remains part of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group and Direct Line was eventually floated in 2013.

On 13 October 2008, in a move aimed at recapitalising the bank, it was announced that the British Government would take a stake of up to 58% in the Group. The aim was to "make available new tier 1 capital to UK banks and building societies to strengthen their resources permitting them to restructure their finances, while maintaining their support for the real economy, through the recapitalisation scheme which has been made available to eligible institutions".<ref>{{Cite press release | title = Treasury statement on financial support to the banking industry | publisher=[[HM Treasury]] | date = 13 October 2008 | url = http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_105_08.htm | accessdate =14 October 2008}}</ref>  A rights issue to existing shareholders having failed to secure more than minimal take-up, the government subsequently found itself owning more than 57% of the bank's equity share capital.

The [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] would inject £37 billion ($64 billion, €47 billion, equivalent to £617 per citizen of the UK) of new capital into Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, [[Lloyds TSB]] and [[HBOS]] plc, to avert financial sector collapse. The government stressed, however, that it was not "standard public ownership" and that the banks would return to private investors "at the right time".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7666695.stm |title=Brown: We'll be rock of stability |publisher=BBC News |date=13 October 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Jones |first=Sarah |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&sid=aCMY6HCQ_Tjc&refer=ukU.K |title=bloomberg.com, Stocks Rebound After Government Bank Bailout; Lloyds Gains |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=13 October 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref>

[[Alistair Darling]], the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], stated that UK taxpayers would benefit from the government's rescue plan, as it will have some control over RBS in exchange for £5 billion in preference shares and underwriting the issuance of a further £15 billion in ordinary shares. If shareholder take-up of the share issue was 0%, then total government ownership in RBS would be 58%; and, if shareholder take-up was 100%, then total government ownership in RBS would be 0%.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Hélène Mulholland |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/13/alistairdarling-economy |title=Darling: UK taxpayer will benefit from banks rescue |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 13 October 2008|accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref> Less than 56&nbsp;million new shares were taken up by investors, or 0.24pc of the total offered by RBS in October 2008.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/3532604/RBS-now-58pc-owned-by-UK-government.html RBS now 58% owned by UK Government] Telegraph, 28 November 2008</ref>

As a consequence of this rescue, the Chief Executive of the group [[Fred Goodwin]] offered his [[resignation]] and it was duly accepted. Chairman [[Tom McKillop|Sir Tom McKillop]] confirmed that he would stand down from that role when his contract expired in March 2009. Goodwin was replaced by Stephen Hester, previously the Chief Executive of [[British Land]], who commenced at the Royal Bank of Scotland in November 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-business/article-23572572-details/It%E2%80%99s+a+good+time+for+Hester+to+quit+property+for+RBS/article.do |title=It is a good time for Hester to quit property for RBS |publisher=Thisislondon.co.uk |date=14 October 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref>

On 19 January 2009, the British Government announced a further injection of funds into the UK banking system in an attempt to restart personal and business lending. This would involve the creation of a state-backed insurance scheme which would allow banks to insure against existing loans going into default, in an attempt to restore the banks' confidence.<ref>[http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7838347.stm UK banking plan faces criticism] BBC News, 19 January 2009</ref>

At the same time the government announced its intention to convert the preference shares in RBS that it had acquired in October 2008 to ordinary shares. This would remove the 12% coupon payment (£600m p.a) on the shares but would increase the state's holding in the bank from 58% to 70%.<ref name=loss>[http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7836882.stm RBS shares plunge on loss] BBC News, 19 January 2009</ref>

On the same day RBS released a [[trading statement]] in which it expected to post full-year trading losses (before [[writedown]]s) of between £7bn and £8bn. The group also announced writedowns on [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwills]] (primarily related to the [[takeover]] of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] bank [[ABN-AMRO]]) of around £20bn. The combined total of £28bn would be the biggest ever annual loss in UK corporate history (the actual figure was £24.1bn). As a result the group's share price fell over 66% in one day to 10.9p per share, from a 52-week high of 354p per share, itself a drop of 97%.<ref name=loss/> Some commentators called this the [[Blue Monday Crash 2009|Blue Monday Crash]].

===Mid-2008 onwards===
In June 2008 RBS sold the subsidiary [[Angel Trains]] for £3.6bn as part of an assets sale to raise cash.<ref>{{cite news |title=RBS sells off rail stock business |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7452205.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=13 June 2008 |accessdate=20 September 2013}}</ref>

RBS' contractual commitment to retain the 4.26% [[Bank of China]] (BoC) stake ended on 31 December 2008, and the shares were sold on 14 January 2009. Exchange rate fluctuations meant that RBS made no profit on the deal. The [[Newspapers in Scotland|Scottish press]] suggested two reasons for the move: the need for a bank mainly owned by [[HM Treasury]] to focus scarce [[Financial capital|capital]] on British markets, and the growth possibility of RBS's own China operations.<ref name="een1">{{Cite journal | title=RBS confirms sale of £1.6bn China stake| journal=Edinburgh Evening News| year=2009| volume=January| issue=14| url=http://business.scotsman.com/bankinginsurance/RBS-confirms-sale-of-16bn.4873405.jp}}</ref><ref name="scotsman">{{Cite journal | author=Martin Flanagan| title=RBS sells Bank of China stake in a clear sign that retrenchment rules| journal=The Scotsman| year=2009| volume=January| issue=14| url=http://business.scotsman.com/bankinginsurance/RBS-sells-Bank-of-China.4872360.jp}}</ref> However, Chinese sources noted that BoC had been unhappy with RBS' continued expansion of [[Mainland China|mainland]] operations rivalling BoC in the highly profitable [[wealth management]] sector.

In March 2009, RBS announced the closure of its [[tax avoidance]] department, which had helped it avoid £500m of tax by channelling billions of pounds through [[securitization|securitised]] assets in [[tax haven]]s such as the [[Cayman Islands]]. The closure was partly due to a lack of funds to continue the measures, and partly due to the 84% taxpayer stake in the bank.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/mar/13/rbs-tax-avoidance RBS avoided £500m of tax in global deals] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 13 March 2009</ref>

Also in March 2009, RBS revealed that its traders had been involved in the purchase and sale of sub-prime securities under the supervision of [[Fred Goodwin]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Winnett |first=Robert |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/recession/5025115/RBS-traders-hid-toxic-debt.html |title=RBS traders hid toxic debt |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=20 March 2009 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref>

In September 2009, RBS and NatWest announced dramatic cuts in their overdraft fees including the unpaid item fee (from £38 to £5), the card misuse fee (from £35 to £15) and the monthly maintenance charge for going overdrawn without consent (from £28 to £20).<ref name="Guardian">Jones, Rupert.

In November 2009, RBS announced plans to cut 3,700 jobs in addition to 16,000 already planned, while the government increased its stake in the company from 70% to 84%.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Jill Treanor |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/nov/02/rbs-slash-costs-cuts-jobs |title=RBS axes 3,700 jobs as taxpayer stake hits 84% |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 2 November 2009|accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref>

In December 2009, the RBS board revolted against the main shareholder, the British government. They threatened to resign unless they were permitted to pay bonuses of £1.5bn to staff in its investment arm.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8392147.stm |title=RBS board could quit if government limits staff bonuses |publisher=BBC News |date=3 December 2009 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref> The warning was very heavily criticised because it came in the wake of a £850bn bailout of the banking sector.

On 29 March 2010, [[GE Capital]] acquired Royal Bank of Scotland’s factoring business in Germany. GE Capital signed an agreement with the Royal Bank of Scotland plc (RBS) to acquire 100% of RBS Factoring GmbH, RBS’s factoring and invoice financing business in Germany, for an undisclosed amount. The transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including regulatory approval.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.co.uk/portal/site/uk/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20100329005696&newsLang=en |title=GE Capital Acquired Royal Bank of Scotland’s Factoring Business in Germany |publisher=Businesswire.co.uk |date=29 March 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref>

More than 100 senior bank executives at the Royal Bank of Scotland were paid more than £1 million in late 2010 and total bonus payouts reached nearly £1 billion – even though the bailed-out bank reported losses of £1.1 billion for 2010. Unions were baffled that any bankers were getting bonuses, considering the bank is owned by the taxpayer. The 2010 figure was an improvement on the loss of £3.6 billion in 2009 and the record-breaking £24bn loss in 2008. The bonuses for staff in 2010 topped £950 million. The CEO Stephen Hester got £8 million in payments for the year.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/feb/24/rbs-bankers-bonuses-despite-loss

In January 2012, there was press controversy about Hester's bonus—Hester was offered share options with a total value of £963,000 that would be held in long-term plans, and only paid out if he met strict and tough targets. If he failed to do this, it would be clawed-back. The Treasury permitted the payment because they feared the resignation of Hester and much of the board if the payment was vetoed by the government as the majority shareholder.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16752392 Treasury feared Hester and board would quit] BBC 26 January 2012</ref> After a large amount of criticism<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jan/27/david-cameron-stephen-hester-bonus?newsfeed=true Stephen Hester bonus puts David Cameron under pressure] Guardian, 27 January 2012</ref><ref name=waive>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9046377/Sir-Philip-Hampton-waives-1.4m-share-award.html Sir Philip Hampton waives £1.4m share award] The Telegraph, 28 January 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/28/rbs-idUSWLA205920120128 RBS chairman waives share-based bonus] Reuters, 28 January 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2092614/David-Cameron-failed-Borgen-test-Hesters-bonus.html?ito=feeds-newsxml David Cameron failed Borgen Test on Hester's Bonus] Daily Mail, 30 January 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.metro.co.uk/news/888045-ed-miliband-david-cameron-must-block-stephen-hesters-bonus Ed Miliband must block Hester's Bonus] Metro, 22 January 2012</ref> in the press, news emerged of Chairman Sir Philip Hampton turning down his own bonus of £1.4 million several weeks before the controversy.<ref name=waive/> Hester, who had been on holiday in Switzerland at the time, turned down his own bonus shortly after.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jan/30/rbs-stephen-hester-bonus-reaction RBS boss Stephen Hester waives bonus: reaction] The Guardian, 30 January 2012</ref>

In June 2012 a [[2012 RBS computer system problems|failure of an upgrade to payment processing software]] meant that a substantial proportion of customers could not transfer money to or from their accounts.

==Divestment==
{{further|Williams & Glyn}}
As a condition of the British Government purchasing an 81% shareholding in the group, the [[European Commission]] ruled that the group sell a portion of its business, as the purchase was categorised as state aid.

==Controversies==

===Media commentary and criticism===
During Goodwin's tenure as CEO he attracted some criticism for lavish spending, including on the construction of a £350m headquarters in Edinburgh opened by the Queen in 2005<ref>''[[The Scotsman]]'', 14 September 2005, [http://business.scotsman.com/royalbankofscotland/Queen-opens-350m-bank-HQ.2661126.jp Queen opens £350m bank HQ]</ref> and $500m headquarters in the US begun in 2006,<ref name=slate011208>''Slate'', 1 December 2008 [http://www.slate.com/id/2205753/ Who's the World's Worst Banker?]</ref> and the use of a [[Dassault Falcon 900]] jet owned by [[leasing]] subsidiary Lombard for occasional corporate travel.<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 6 April 2004, [http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article1056391.ece Banking star brought down to earth over jet-set perk]</ref> Revelations that RBS had spent £200m on celebrity endorsements also went down badly.<ref>''[[Daily Mail]]'', 15 February 2009, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1145771/RBS-slammed-reckless-spending-200million-celebrity-figureheads.html RBS slammed as 'reckless' after spending £200million on celebrity figureheads]</ref>

His image was not enhanced by the news that emerged in questioning by the [[Treasury Select Committee]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 10 February 2009, that Goodwin has no technical bank training, and has no formal banking qualifications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.2488353.0.Exchiefs_of_Royal_Bank_of_Scotland_and_HBOS_admitted_to_having_no_formal_banking_qualifications.php |title=Exchiefs of Royal Bank of Scotland And HBOS Admitted To Having No Formal Banking Qualifications (from The Herald ) |publisher=Theherald.co.uk |date= |accessdate=27 February 2009}}</ref>

===Fossil fuel financing===
RBS was challenged over its financing of oil and coal mining by charities such as [[Platform (art group)|Platform London]] and [[Friends of the Earth]]. In 2007, RBS was promoting itself as "The Oil & Gas Bank", although the website www.oilandgasbank.com was later taken down.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dirty Money: Corporate Greenwash & RBS coal finance|url=http://platformlondon.org/dm.pdf|work=Dirty Money: Corporate Greenwash & RBS coal finance|publisher=Platform|accessdate=13 February 2014|format=PDF|date=March 2011}}</ref> A Platform London report criticised the bank's lending to oil and gas companies, estimating that the carbon emissions embedded within RBS' project finance reached 36.9 million tonnes in 2005, comparable to Scotland's carbon emissions.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Oil & Gas Bank|url=http://carbonweb.org/documents/Oil_&_Gas_Bank.pdf|work=The Oil & Gas Bank|publisher=Platform|accessdate=13 December 2013|format=PDF|date=March 2007}}</ref>

RBS provides the financial means for companies to build [[coal-fired power station]]s and dig new coal mines at sites throughout the world. RBS helped to provide an estimated £8 billion from 2006 to 2008 to energy corporation [[E.ON]] and other coal-utilising companies.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Terry Macalister |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/aug/11/banking.ethicalbusiness |title=Climate change: High street banks face consumer boycott over investment in coal projects |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 11 August 2008|accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref> In 2012, 2.8% of RBS' total lending was provided to the power, oil and gas sectors combined.

===Huntingdon Life Sciences===
In 2000 and 2001, the bank was the target of threats of violence{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} over its provision of banking facilities for the animal testing company [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]]. The action resulted in RBS withdrawing the company's overdraft facility, requiring the company to obtain alternative funding within a tight deadline.<ref>[http://www.veggies.org.uk/news/e001111a.htm Animal Rights news in the UK |  Animal testing lab faces ruin as bank cancels overdraft]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4120748,00.html|work=The Observer |location=UK |title=Inside the labs where lives hang heavy in the balance|date=21 January 2001|accessdate=27 April 2008  | first=Martin | last=Bright}}</ref>

'''Nadia Younes''' (June 13, 1946 - August 19, 2003) was an [[Egypt]]ian national who spent her entire career, for over 33 years, in the [[United Nations]] (UN) and the [[World Health Organization]], rising to high-level posts in a variety of areas.  

She was born in Cairo, Egypt, and earned a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] degree in [[political science]] and [[international relations]] from [[New York University]], and a Bachelor of Arts degree in [[English literature]] from [[Cairo University]]. She spoke [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] fluently. 

==Career in the United Nations==
Nadia Younes joined the United Nations in 1970. From 1974, she worked with the Department of Public Information in various capacities, initially as a press officer in both the English and French Sections. Later assignments included Information Officer for the World Conference of the Decade for Women; Information Office, Planning, Programme and Evaluation Unit; and Spokeswoman for the President of the Forty-Second Session of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]].

Younes served as Deputy Spokeswoman for the [[Secretary-General]] from March 1988 until January 1993, when she was appointed Director of the United Nations Information Centre in [[Rome]]. She subsequently moved back to [[New York]] to assume the post of Director of the Media Division in the Department of Public Information.

She worked as United Nations Chief of Protocol from 1998. From July 1999 to January 2001, she worked in the field mission in [[Kosovo]] ([[UNMIK]]) where she was in charge of the information and communication office in the Cabinet of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, [[Bernard Kouchner]]. Following her assignment in Kosovo, Younes returned to New York and resumed her functions as Chief of Protocol.

In August 2002, Younes was appointed as WHO’s Executive Director in charge of External Relations and Governing Bodies. Her position included responsibility for relations with WHO’s Member States, resource mobilization and WHO’s governing bodies.

In May 2003, she was seconded by WHO to act as Chief of Staff for the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General to Iraq, [[Sérgio Vieira de Mello]], in [[Baghdad]]. Younes died from wounds sustained in the [[Canal Hotel bombing]] on August 19, 2003, along with de Mello and 21 other members of his office staff.

*WHO's official tribute to her reads in part "...''WHO mourns the loss of one of its most respected, effective and charismatic officials''".  The [[Reuters]] news agency referred to her as "''witty''" and "''with a sharp sense of humor''".

*She was buried in Cairo, Egypt.

The '''Burlington Northern Railroad''' {{reporting mark|BN}} was a [[United States]]-based [[railroad]] company formed from a [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] of four major U.S. railroads. Burlington Northern operated between 1970 and 1996.

Its historical lineage begins in the earliest days of railroading with the chartering in 1848 of the [[Chicago and Aurora Railroad]], a direct ancestor line of the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]], which lends Burlington to the names of various merger-produced successors.

Burlington Northern purchased the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] on December 31, 1996 to form the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (later renamed [[BNSF Railway]]), which was owned by the [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation]]. That corporation was purchased by [[Berkshire Hathaway]] in 2009<ref>http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091103/ap_on_bi_ge/us_berkshire_burlington_northern</ref> which is controlled by investor [[Warren Buffett]].

==History==
The Burlington Northern Railroad was the product of a March 2, 1970, merger that involved four major railroads: the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], [[Northern Pacific Railway]], [[Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway]] and the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] as well as a few small jointly owned subsidiaries owned by the four. The merged railroad was initially going to be called Great Northern Pacific & Burlington Lines.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=David P.|date=August 1968|title=American Quarterly: In Brief|journal=Modern Railways|publisher=Ian Allan Ltd.|location=Shepperton, Middlesex|volume=XXIV|issue=239|pages=409}}</ref>

Although the four railroads shared common ownership (including the headquarters building in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]) from the days of the [[James J. Hill]] era, the four railroads previously had unsuccessfully attempted four mergers to unify the Hill Lines: 1896, 1901, 1927 and 1955. Surprisingly the merger was finally approved in 1970 even though a challenge occurred in the [[Supreme Court]], which reversed the result of the 1904 [[Northern Securities Co. v. United States|Northern Securities]] ruling.

To further expand the Burlington Northern railroad, a single track was constructed in 1972 into the [[Powder River Basin]] to serve various coal mines. On November 21, 1980, the [[St. Louis - San Francisco Railway]] was acquired, giving the railroad trackage as far south into [[Florida]]. By 1981 however, the holding company of the railroad, '''Burlington Northern, Inc.''' relocated headquarters from [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] to [[Seattle, Washington]] and spun off all non-rail operations to [[Burlington Resources]] in 1988.

In 1971 BN/C&S/FW&D carried 64116 million revenue ton-miles of freight; in 1979 the total was 135004 million.<ref>Moody's Transportation Manual 1981</ref> Most of the increase was Powder River coal from Wyoming, a fount of traffic unprecedented in United States railroad history, and one which BN had to itself until 1984. 

The Burlington Northern, along with handling freight trains, briefly operated inter-city passenger trains. The BN had begun operation just a matter of weeks before the end of service of the ''[[California Zephyr]]'', which had been operated by the CB&Q, in conjunction with the [[Denver & Rio Grande Western]] and [[Western Pacific Railroad|Western Pacific]] railroads, and continued to operate the ''[[North Coast Limited]]'', ''[[Empire Builder]]'' and ''[[Denver Zephyr]]'' until [[Amtrak]] took over intercity passenger service in May of 1971, thus becoming the last "new" Class I railroad to operate its own passenger trains. The BN also operated a [[BNSF Railway (Metra)|commuter line]] inherited from the CB&Q from [[Chicago Union Station]] to the western suburb of [[Aurora, Illinois]]. 

On September 22, 1995, the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] merged with the Burlington Northern to create the [[BNSF Railway|Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway]]. However the merger was not official until December 31, 1996, when the a common dispatching system was established, Santa Fe's non-union dispatchers were unionized and the implementation of Santa Fe's train identification codes systemwide.<ref name=railnews-mar97>{{cite journal|title=Burlington Northern & Sante Fe: Merger| date=March 1997|magazine=[[Pacific RailNews|RailNews]]|publisher=[[Pentrex]]|page=87|url=http://www.trainlife.com/magazines/pages/237/17557/march-1997-page-87|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}</ref> On January 24, 2005, the railroad shortened its name to BNSF Railway.<ref name=SEC-10K>{{cite web|title=Form 10-K: Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2007| date=February 15, 2008|publisher=[[Securities and Exchange Commission]] |  url=http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2008%2f02%2f15%2f0000934612-08-000012.html#FIS_BUSINESS | accessdate=March 24, 2012}}</ref>

==Route==
[[Image:BNSF Scenic Subdivision, from Carkeek Park overpass.jpg|thumb|left|Main line heading north out of Seattle, Washington along the shore of [[Puget Sound]]]]
The Burlington Northern traversed the most northerly routes of any railroad in the western United States. These routes started at [[Chicago, Illinois]] and ran west-northwest to [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]]. From here the routes continued northwest through [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul, Minnesota]] to [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]]. From Grand Forks the routes ran west through [[North Dakota]], [[Montana]], and [[Idaho]] to [[Spokane, Washington]]. The former GN routed through North Dakota/Northern Montana, crossing the continental divide at [[Marias Pass]], while the former NP line routed through the southern part of Montana (which was spun off to [[Montana Rail Link]] in 1987), crossing the continental divide at [[Mullan Pass|Mullan]] and [[Homestake Pass]]es. At Spokane the routes split into three. The former Great Northern route ran west to [[Wenatchee, Washington]], crossed under the [[Cascade Range]] at New [[Cascade Tunnel]] on [[Stevens Pass]], and descended to the [[Puget Sound]] region through [[Everett, Washington]]. The former Northern Pacific turned southwest towards the Tri-Cities, then northwest to [[Yakima, Washington]], and crossed under the Cascade Range at Stampede Tunnel, descending to the Green River Valley at [[Auburn, Washington]] where it connected with existing NP lines from [[British Columbia]] to [[Portland, Oregon]]. The Spokane, Portland and Seattle ran southwest to the [[Tri-Cities, Washington|Tri-Cities]] then followed the north bank of the [[Columbia River]] to [[Vancouver, Washington]].

With the acquisition of the St. Louis – San Francisco Railway the route was extended into the [[South Central United States|South Central]] and [[Southeastern United States]].

''Transport Statistics'' shows BN operated 23609 miles of line and 34691 miles of track at the end of 1970;<ref>Not including 692 route-miles operated by C&S, 1201 FW&D, 186 Oregon Electric, 152 Oregon Trunk, 19 Walla Walla Valley and 2 MA&CR.</ref> it shows 4547 SLSF miles of line not including QA&P and AT&N. At the end of 1981 BN showed 27374 miles of line and 40041 miles of track.<ref>Not including 678 route-miles C&S and 1181 miles FW&D.</ref>

==Equipment Colors and Painting==
[[Image:BN 510 EMD NW2.jpg|thumb|left|[[EMD NW2|NW2]] 510 at [[Aurora, Illinois]]]]
The livery of the Burlington Northern traces its history to [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]]. [[EMD GP40]] #629 was painted in a green, black and white scheme that introduced the BN's lettering and logo. The green color was later known as ''Cascade Green'' due to the reflections of pine trees and nature along various routes the trains of the CB&Q traveled. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

As the final approval of the merger was approaching the [[Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway]] purchased 6 [[EMD GP38]]s in February 1970 that were delivered in the Burlington Northern paint scheme.

By the 1980s the locomotives and rolling stock had an unfortunate habit of camouflaging into the scenery and causing accidents at railroad crossings. In late 1984 the BN commenced the High Visibility study which applied orange and black nose stripes and orange along the cab face on one locomotive followed by two new orders of locomotives: [[EMD SD40-2]], [[EMD GP50]], and [[EMD SD60]] respectively. By 1987 the study did not show vast improvement of the locomotive's visibility and was dropped.<ref>[http://www.fobnr.org/motivepower/tigerstripe.htm]</ref>

In 1989 the BN reactivated its High Visibility study, trying more white paint on the nose and cab face. The first unit, GATX Rebuild [[EMD GP40]] #3079 emerged in April 1989<ref>[http://archive.trainpix.com/BN/EMDRBLD/GP40G/INDEX.HTM]</ref> with a white cab face, end-sill stripes, and a large BN logo applied on the nose; dubbed ''White Face'' this scheme proved to be a success with only a minor change occurring in 1991 with the application of a two-inch wide separator stripe.<ref>[http://www.fobnr.org/motivepower/whiteface.htm]</ref>

In October 1990 BN departed from its Cascade Green, black and white scheme on its business car and locomotive fleet. Adopting Grinstein Green (an altered version of Brunswick Green/British Racing Green and named after the president of Burlington Northern, Gerald Grinstein), Cream, and Alizarin Red. This scheme was applied to [[EMD F9|EMD F9A-2]] #BN-1, EMD F9B-2 #BN-2, and [[EMD E9|EMD E9A-2]] #BN-3, of the locomotive fleet and the business car fleet. In November 1993, brand new [[EMD SD70MAC]] #9401 received the Executive colors, making a departure from the standard Cascade Green, White & Black scheme. This trend continued only on the EMD SD70MAC's 
until BNSF #9837.<ref>[http://www.fobnr.org/motivepower/executive.htm]</ref>

==Preserved equipment==
Burlington Northern 1 and 2, formerly Northern Pacific Railway 6700A and 7002C, EMD F9s, were built in 1954 and later rebuilt by BN for special train service. They are currently owned by the [[Illinois Railway Museum]] and are on display in [[Union, Illinois]].

==Environmental record==
A Burlington Northern tie treating plant was responsible for the [[Burlington Northern (Brainerd/Baxter)]] [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Superfund]] site, located between the cities of [[Brainerd, Minnesota|Brainerd]] and [[Baxter, Minnesota|Baxter]] in [[Crow Wing County]], [[Minnesota]].<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/region5/superfund/npl/minnesota/MND000686196.html "Burlington Northern (Brainerd/Baxter) Fact Sheet"], ''EPA'', 07/13/12</ref> The tie treating plant operated on the property between 1907 and 1985 and treated railroad ties with [[creosote]] and fuel oil.  Wastewater generated from the wood-treating process was sent to two shallow, unlined ponds. This created a [[sludge]] which [[contaminated]] both the underlying soils and the [[groundwater]] with [[creosote]] and [[polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs).

'''Tracy Ann Austin Holt''' (born December 12, 1962, in [[Palos Verdes]], California) is a former [[List of WTA number 1 ranked players|World No. 1]] professional [[tennis]] player from the United States and holds three [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles, winning the women's singles title at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in 1979 and 1981, and the mixed doubles title at [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] in 1980.  Additionally, she won the [[WTA Tour Championships]]  in 1980 and the 1981 year end [[Toyota Championships]], both in singles, before a series of injuries cut her career short. Since 1979, she has held the record as youngest ever US Open female singles champion and is the youngest inductee of all time in the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]]. Austin won singles titles on all playing surfaces: clay (both red clay and green clay), indoor carpet, grass, and hard courts.

==Playing style==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2014}}
Austin possessed a solid baseline game with a strong forehand and reliable two-fisted backhand. She struck the ball deep, with substantial pace (given the wooden racquet era of her prime), and with pinpoint accuracy, hitting on or near the lines. Often this aspect of her game has overshadowed her solid net game which resulted in a [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] [[mixed doubles (tennis)|mixed doubles]] title with her brother John. Austin's first serve was a mid-paced high percentage shot that functioned well on all playing surfaces, and although her second serve has been described as lacking penetration, she rarely double faulted.

==Career==

===1979 to 1980===
Austin defeated 35-year-old [[Billie Jean King]] in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in 1979 before losing to [[Martina Navrátilová]] in straight sets in the semifinals. Austin then became the youngest ever US Open champion, aged 16 years and 9 months, defeating Navratilova in the semifinal and winning the championship match against [[Chris Evert]], who was bidding to win the title for the fifth consecutive year. Earlier that year, Austin had ended Evert's 125-match winning streak on [[clay court|clay]] by beating her in three sets in a semifinal of the [[Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Italian Open]]. The Associated Press named her female athlete of the year for 1979.

Austin lost in the semifinals of both Grand Slam tournaments she played in 1980. [[Evonne Goolagong Cawley]], seeded fourth and the eventual champion, defeated Austin at Wimbledon. As the top seed and defending champion at the US Open, Austin was expected to extend her five-match winning streak against third-ranked Evert. Austin raced to a 4–0 lead in the first set before Evert won 18 of the final 20 games to take the match. Evert went on to beat [[Hana Mandlíková]] in the final, thus securing for herself the year-ending World No. 1 ranking. Austin was ranked the World No. 1 singles player at times during 1980, partly because she captured the two sponsors' tour-ending events, defeating Navrátilová to win the [[WTA Tour Championships|Avon Championships]] in March and [[Andrea Jaeger]] to capture the Colgate Series Championships in January 1981. In 1980, Austin won the Wimbledon [[mixed doubles (tennis)|mixed doubles]] title with her brother [[John Austin (tennis)|John]], becoming the first brother and sister team ever to win a Grand Slam title together.

===1981 to 1983===
During the first four months of 1981, Austin played only two events because of chronic injuries. On [[grass court|grass]], she won the tournament in [[International Women's Open|Eastbourne, United Kingdom]] without losing a set before [[Pam Shriver]] beat her in a Wimbledon quarterfinal. Austin then won 26 consecutive matches and four consecutive tournaments. She defeated Shriver in the final of the tournament in [[:fr:Classic de San Diego|San Diego]] and, three weeks later, she beat both Navrátilová and Evert in straight sets to win the [[Rogers Cup (tennis)|Canadian Open]] in Toronto, it is fair to mention that Evert was under a death threat in the final. As the third-seeded player at the US Open, Austin defeated fourth-seeded Navrátilová in the final Navrátilová, however, ended Austin's winning streak in the final of the [[US Indoors|U.S. Indoor Championships]]. In Europe during the autumn, Austin lost to [[Sue Barker]] in the quarterfinals of the tournament in [[Brighton International|Brighton, United Kingdom]], but recovered the following week to defeat Navrátilová in the final of the tournament in [[Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Stuttgart, West Germany]]. At the final Grand Slam tournament of the year, Austin was seeded second but lost to sixth-seeded Shriver in the Australian Open quarterfinals. The 1981 year-ending [[:fr:Tournoi du New Jersey|Toyota Series Championships]] featured two matches against Evert and one against Navrátilová. Evert won her round robin match with Austin, before Austin demolished Evert in a baseline slugfest in their semifinal.  Austin then won the tournament with a three-set defeat of Navrátilová. The Associated Press named her female athlete for the second time in 1981.

Austin was the first opponent of [[Steffi Graf]] when the German made her professional debut at the [[Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]] in [[Stuttgart]] in 1982. Austin defeated the 13-year-old Graf.

Back injuries and recurring [[sciatica]] then began to impair Austin's effectiveness and sidelined her for long stretches. King, seeded twelfth, upset third-seeded Austin in the 1982 Wimbledon quarterfinals. Several weeks later, however, Austin won her 30th and final top-level singles title in San Diego. Austin had a good showing at the 1982 season-ending Toyota Series Championships where she defeated Jaeger, the World No. 3, in straight sets to reach the semifinals. However, she was unable to repeat 1981's victory over Evert, who crushed her in the semifinals (a reversal of the 1981 result where Austin dominated). In 1983 she was a finalist at the Family Circle Cup losing to Navrátilová in three sets.  She also reached the quarterfinals of the French Open.  But by the end of 1983, before her 21st birthday, Austin was essentially finished as a top ten player.

===1988 to 1989===
Austin began her first comeback on the tour in 1988, when she played in seven doubles tournaments, and in 1989, when she played in one doubles and two singles tournaments. A highlight of this comeback included a semifinal showing in the 1988 [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] [[Mixed doubles (tennis)|Mixed Doubles]] with partner Ken Flach.<ref name = ITF_profile>{{cite web|last=Statistics|title=Tracy Austin|url=http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/players/player/profile.aspx?PlayerID=20002127|publisher=International Tennis Federation|accessdate=03/09/2013}}</ref>   This comeback was ended by a near-fatal motor vehicle accident on August 3, 1989.

===1992===
In 1992, Austin became the youngest person to be inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]], at the age of 29.

===1993 to 1994===
She attempted a second comeback in 1993 and 1994 but was not particularly successful.  In 1993, Austin upset Renee Stubbs and [[Katerina Maleeva]] at the [[BNP Paribas Open|Evert Cup]] in [[Indian Wells, California]] where she reached the round of 16. At the WTA Manhattan Beach event she upset both [[Gigi Fernandez]] and [[Elena Likhovtseva]] before losing to Gabriela Sabatini in the round of 16.  The wins over Maleeva, Fernandez, and Likhovtseva began a buzz that Austin might become at least a top twenty player again.  However, in 1994, her results were not as promising and at the [[BNP Paribas Open|Evert Cup]] in [[Indian Wells, California]], Austin lost in the second round in straight sets to [[Steffi Graf]], and Austin soon retired in June 1994.<ref name = ITF_profile />

==Family life and work as a tennis commentator==
Tracy's older sister, Pam, and her older brother, [[Jeff Austin (tennis)|Jeff]], were also professional tennis players, as were brothers Doug and [[John Austin (tennis)|John]]. She is the sister-in-law of fitness author [[Denise Austin]]. She is married to Scott Holt and is the mother of three sons, Sean, Brandon, and Dylan.

As a child, Tracy lived next door to Air Force Colonel Keith Lindell, who was responsible for the training of the original seven [[Project Mercury]] astronauts.

Since retiring as a player, Austin has worked as a commentator for [[NBC]] and the [[USA Network]] for the French Open and the US Open. She worked for the [[Seven Network]], who broadcast the Australian Open and usually participates in the [[BBC]]'s Wimbledon coverage. She began working for [[Tennis Channel]] in 2010 and joined their US Open team and later their [[Australian Open]] team in 2012. Austin has also worked for Canadian television for their coverage of the [[Rogers Cup (tennis)|Rogers Cup]] since 2004.

[[File:Skoda 03 T roof.jpg|thumb|Mechanism for regenerative brake on the roof of a [[Škoda Astra]] tram]]
[[File:S stock northwood.JPG|thumb|The [[S Stock|S7/8 Stock]] on the [[London Underground]] can return 20% of its energy usage to the network]]

A '''regenerative brake''' is an [[energy recovery]] mechanism which slows a vehicle or object down by converting its [[kinetic energy]] into another form, which can be either used immediately or stored until needed. This contrasts with conventional braking systems, where the excess kinetic energy is converted to heat by friction in the [[brake lining]]s and therefore wasted.

== General ==
The most common form of regenerative brake involves using an [[electric motor]] as an electric generator. In electric [[rail transport|railway]]s the generated electricity is fed back into the [[railway electrification system|supply system]]. In [[battery electric vehicle|battery electric]] and [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid electric]] vehicles, the energy is stored chemically in a [[battery (electricity)|battery]], electrically in a bank of [[capacitor]]s, or mechanically in a rotating [[flywheel energy storage|flywheel]]. [[Hydraulic hybrid]] vehicles use hydraulic motors to store energy in form of [[compressed air energy storage|compressed air]].

=== Limitations ===
Traditional [[friction]]-based braking must be used in conjunction with mechanical regenerative braking for the following reasons:

* The regenerative braking effect drops off at lower speeds; therefore the friction brake is still required in order to bring the vehicle to a complete halt. Physical locking of the rotor is also required to prevent vehicles from rolling down hills.
* The friction brake is a necessary back-up in the event of failure of the regenerative brake.
* Most road vehicles with regenerative braking only have power on some wheels (as in a [[two-wheel drive]] car) and regenerative braking power only applies to such wheels because they are the only wheels linked to the drive motor, so in order to provide controlled braking under difficult conditions (such as in wet roads) friction based braking is necessary on the other wheels.
* The amount of electrical energy capable of dissipation is limited by either the capacity of the supply system to absorb this energy or on the state of charge of the battery or capacitors. Effective regenerative braking can only occur if the battery or capacitors are not fully charged. For this reason, it is normal to also incorporate dynamic braking to absorb the excess energy.
* Under emergency braking it is desirable that the braking force exerted be the maximum allowed by the friction between the wheels and the surface without slipping, over the entire speed range from the vehicle's maximum speed down to zero. The maximum force available for acceleration is typically much less than this except in the case of extreme high-performance vehicles. Therefore, the power required to be dissipated by the braking system under emergency braking conditions may be many times the maximum power which is delivered under acceleration. Traction motors sized to handle the drive power may not be able to cope with the extra load and the battery may not be able to accept charge at a sufficiently high rate. Friction braking is required to dissipate the surplus energy in order to allow an acceptable emergency braking performance.

For these reasons there is typically the need to control the regenerative braking and match the friction and regenerative braking to produce the desired total braking effect. The GM [[General Motors EV1|EV-1]] was the first commercial car to do this. Engineers Abraham Farag and Loren Majersik were issued two patents for this ''[[brake-by-wire]]'' technology.<ref>GM patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=VzshAAAAEBAJ&dq=5775467 5775467] – ''Floating electromagnetic brake system''.</ref><ref>GM patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=_A0kAAAAEBAJ&dq=5603217 5603217] – ''Compliant master cylinder''.</ref>

Additionally, early applications commonly suffered from a serious safety hazard. In many early electric vehicles with regenerative braking, the same controller positions were used to apply power and to apply the regenerative brake, with the functions being swapped by a separate switch. This led to a number of serious accidents when drivers accidentally accelerated when intending to brake, such as the [[runaway train]] accident in [[Wädenswil, Switzerland]] in 1948, which killed twenty-one people.

== Conversion to electric energy: the motor as a generator ==
Vehicles driven by [[electric motor]]s use the motor as a [[Electrical generator|generator]] when using regenerative braking: it is operated as a generator during braking and its output is supplied to an electrical load; the transfer of energy to the load provides the braking effect.

Regenerative braking is used on hybrid gas/electric [[automobile]]s to recoup some of the energy lost during stopping. This energy is saved in a storage battery and used later to power the motor whenever the car is in electric mode.

Early examples of this system were the [[front-wheel drive]] conversions of horse-drawn [[cabriolet (carriage)|cabs]] by Louis Antoine Krieger (1868–1951). The Krieger electric [[landaulet]] had a drive motor in each front wheel with a second set of parallel windings ([[bifilar coil]]) for regenerative braking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shorpy.com/node/5734%23comment-58487|author=Dave|title=Horseless Carriage: 1906|publisher=Shorpy|date=16 March 2009|accessdate=14 August 2010}}</ref> In England, the Raworth system of "regenerative control" was introduced by tramway operators in the early 1900s, since it offered them economic and operational benefits as explained by A.

Slowing down the speed of the cars or keeping it in hand on descending gradients, the motors worked as generators and braked the vehicles. The tram cars also had wheel brakes and track slipper brakes which could stop the tram should the electric braking systems fail. In several cases the tram car motors were shunt wound instead of series wound, and the systems on the Crystal Palace line utilized series-parallel controllers.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}<ref>{{cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=fjApAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=%22raworth+system%22 |title=Transport World The Tramway and Railway World |volume=XX |date=July–December 1906 |page=20 |publisher=Carriers Publishing |accessdate=11 March 2014}}</ref> Following a serious accident at Rawtenstall, an embargo was placed on this form of traction in 1911. Twenty years later, the regenerative braking system was reintroduced.<ref name="Jno"/>

Regenerative braking has been in extensive use on railways for many decades. The Baku-Tbilisi-Batumi railway ([[Transcaucasus Railway]] or Georgian railway) started utilizing regenerative braking in the early 1930s. This was especially effective on the steep and dangerous [[Surami Pass]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=91987&start=645|author=Bigpanzer|title=Susrami Type Locomotoive at Surami Pass|publisher=Shorpy|date=30 April 2006|accessdate=31 January 2011}}</ref> In Scandinavia the Kiruna to Narvik railway carries iron ore from the mines in [[Kiruna]] in the north of [[Sweden]] down to the port of [[Narvik]] in [[Norway]] to this day. The rail cars are full of thousands of tons of [[iron ore]] on the way down to Narvik, and these trains generate large amounts of electricity by their regenerative braking. From [[Riksgränsen]] on the national border to the Port of Narvik, the trains use only a fifth of the power they regenerate. The regenerated energy is sufficient to power the empty trains back up to the national border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iore|title=Iore|date=30 January 2011|accessdate=31 January 2011}}</ref> Any excess energy from the railway is pumped into the power grid to supply homes and businesses in the region, and the railway is a net generator of electricity.

The [[Energy Regeneration Brake]] was developed in 1967 for the [[American Motors|AMC]] [[Amitron]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.retrothing.com/2008/09/1968-amcs-amazi.html |last=Grahame |first=James |title=1968: AMC's Amazing Amitron Electric Car |publisher=Retro Thing: Vintage Gadgets and Technology |date=22 September 2008 |accessdate=11 March 2014}}</ref> This was a completely [[Battery electric vehicle|battery]] powered urban [[concept car]] whose batteries were recharged by regenerative braking, thus increasing the range of the automobile.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899945,00.html |title=Next: the Voltswagon? |journal=Time |date=22 December 1967 |accessdate=11 March 2014}}</ref>

Many modern hybrid and electric vehicles use this technique to extend the range of the battery pack. The regenerative braking in vehicles became a feature, with emergence of AC drive train technology, developed by Miro Zoric. Examples include the [[General Motors EV1]], [[Toyota Prius]], [[Honda Insight]], the [[Vectrix]] electric maxi-scooter, the [[Tesla Roadster]], the [[Tesla Model S]], the [[Nissan Leaf]], the [[Mahindra Reva]], the [[Chevrolet Volt]], the [[Fiat 500e]], and the [[Ford C-Max]].

=== Electric railway vehicle operation ===
During braking, the [[traction motor]] connections are altered to turn them into electrical generators. The motor fields are connected across the main traction generator (MG) and the motor armatures are connected across the load. The MG now excites the motor fields. The rolling locomotive or multiple unit wheels turn the motor armatures, and the motors act as generators, either sending the generated current through onboard resistors ([[dynamic braking]]) or back into the supply (regenerative braking). Compared to electro-pneumatic friction brakes, braking with the traction motors can be regulated faster improving the performance of [[wheel slide protection]].

For a given direction of travel, current flow through the motor armatures during braking will be opposite to that during motoring. Therefore, the motor exerts [[torque]] in a direction that is opposite from the rolling direction.

Braking effort is proportional to the product of the magnetic strength of the field windings, multiplied by that of the armature windings.

Savings of 17% are claimed for [[Virgin Trains]] [[British Rail Class 390|Pendolinos]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Regenerative braking boosts green credentials |url = http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/regenerative-braking-boosts-green-credentials.html |publisher=Railway Gazette International |date=2 July 2007 |accessdate=11 March 2014}}</ref> There is also less wear on friction braking components. The [[Delhi Metro]] saved around 90,000 tons of [[carbon dioxide]] ({{chem|CO|2}}) from being released into the atmosphere by regenerating 112,500 megawatt hours of electricity through the use of regenerative braking systems between 2004 and 2007. It is expected that the Delhi Metro will save over 100,000 tons of {{chem|CO|2}} from being emitted per year once its phase II is complete through the use of regenerative braking.<ref>{{cite news |title=Delhi Metro prevents 90,000 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> | url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Earth/Delhi-Metro-Cuts-90000-tons-of-CO2/articleshow/4176147.cms|publisher=India Times|date=23 February 2009|accessdate=14 August 2010|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

Another form of regenerative braking is used on some parts of the [[London Underground]], which is achieved by having small slopes leading up and down from stations. The train is slowed by the climb, and then leaves down a slope, so kinetic energy is converted to [[Gravitational potential|gravitational potential energy]] in the station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonreconnections.com/2011/milestones-reached-on-the-jubilee-and-victoria-lines/ |title=Milestones Reached on the Jubilee and Victoria Lines |publisher=London Reconnections |date=2 August 2011 |accessdate=11 March 2014}}</ref> This is normally found on the deep tunnel sections of the network and not generally above ground or on the [[Tunnel#Cut-and-cover |cut and cover]] sections of the Metropolitan and District Lines.

Electricity generated by regenerative braking may be fed back into the traction power supply; either offset against other electrical demand on the network at that instant, used for [[head end power]] loads, or stored in [[Kinetic Traction Systems|lineside storage systems]] for later use.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/flywheel-firm-launches.html |date=20 January 2011 |publisher=Railway Gazette |title=Flywheel firm launches |accessdate=11 March 2014}}</ref>

=== Comparison of dynamic and regenerative brakes ===
Dynamic brakes ("rheostatic brakes" in the UK), unlike regenerative brakes, dissipate the electric energy as heat by passing the current through large banks of variable [[resistor]]s. Vehicles that use dynamic brakes include [[forklift truck|forklift]]s, [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] [[locomotive]]s, and [[tram|streetcar]]s. This heat can be used to warm the vehicle interior, or dissipated externally by large [[radiator]]-like cowls to house the resistor banks.

The main disadvantage of regenerative brakes when compared with dynamic brakes is the need to closely match the generated current with the supply characteristics and increased maintenance cost of the lines. With DC supplies, this requires that the voltage be closely controlled. The AC power supply and frequency converter pioneer Miro Zoric and his first AC power electronics have also enabled this to be possible with AC supplies. The supply frequency must also be matched (this mainly applies to locomotives where an AC supply is [[rectifier|rectified]] for DC motors).

In areas where there exists a constant need for power unrelated to moving the vehicle such as electric train heat or [[air conditioning]], this load requirement can be utilized as a sink for the recovered energy via modern [[Variable-frequency drive|AC traction system]]s. This method has become popular with North American passenger railroads where Head End Power loads are typically in the area of 500&nbsp;kW year round. Using HEP loads in this way has prompted recent electric locomotive designs such as the [[ALP-46]] and [[ACS-64]] to eliminate the use of dynamic brake resistor grids and also eliminates any need for any external power infrastructure to accommodate power recovery allowing self-powered vehicles to employ regenerative braking as well.

A small number of [[steep grade railway]]s have used [[three-phase|3-phase]] power supplies and 3-phase [[induction motor]]s. This results in a near constant speed for all trains as the motors rotate with the supply frequency both when motoring and braking.

== Conversion to mechanical energy ==

=== Kinetic energy recovery systems ===
{{main|Kinetic energy recovery system}}
Kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS) were used for the motor sport [[Formula One]]'s [[2009 Formula One season|2009 season]], and are under development for road vehicles. KERS was abandoned for the 2010 Formula One season, but re-introduced for the 2011 season. As of the 2013 season, all 11 teams have used KERS with Marussia starting use for the 2013 season.<ref name="3teams">{{cite web|url=http://www.autoevolution.com/news/team-lotus-virgin-hrt-f1-to-start-2011-without-kers-30389.html |title=Team Lotus, Virgin, HRT F1 to Start 2011 Without KERS |publisher=Autoevolution |date=28 January 2011 |accessdate=1 June 2011 }}</ref> One of the main reasons that not all cars use KERS is because it raises the car's center of gravity, and reduces the amount of [[ballast weight|ballast]] that is available to balance the car so that it is more predictable when turning.<ref>BBC TV commentary on German Grand Prix 2009</ref> FIA rules also limit the exploitation of the system. The concept of transferring the vehicle’s kinetic energy using [[flywheel energy storage]] was postulated by physicist [[Richard Feynman]] in the 1950s{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} and is exemplified in such systems as the [[Zytek]], Flybrid,<ref>{{cite web|author=Flybrid Systems LLP |url=http://www.flybridsystems.com/Technology.html |title=Flybrid Systems |publisher=Flybrid Systems |date=10 September 2010 |accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref> Torotrak<ref>[http://www.torotrak.com/IVT/works/ Torotrak]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xtrac.com/pdfs/Torotrak_Xtrac_CVT.pdf |title=Torotrak, Xtrac & CVT pdf |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref> and Xtrac used in F1. [[Differential (mechanical device)|Differential]] based systems also exist such as the Cambridge Passenger/Commercial Vehicle Kinetic Energy Recovery System (CPC-KERS).<ref>{{cite web|author=BHR Technology. |url=http://www.bhr-technology.com/CPC-KERS.pps |title=Cpc-Kers |publisher=Bhr-technology.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref>

Xtrac and Flybrid are both licensees of Torotrak's technologies, which employ a small and sophisticated ancillary gearbox incorporating a [[continuously variable transmission]] (CVT). The CPC-KERS is similar as it also forms part of the driveline assembly. However, the whole mechanism including the flywheel sits entirely in the vehicle’s hub (looking like a drum brake). In the CPC-KERS, a differential replaces the CVT and transfers torque between the [[flywheel]], drive wheel and road wheel.

===== History =====
[[File:Flybrid Systems Kinetic Energy Recovery System.jpg|thumb|right|A Flybrid Systems kinetic energy recovery system]]

The first of these systems to be revealed was the Flybrid. This system weighs 24&nbsp;kg and has an energy capacity of 400 kJ after allowing for internal losses. A maximum power boost of 60&nbsp;kW (81.6 PS, 80.4 HP) for 6.67 seconds is available. The 240&nbsp;mm diameter flywheel weighs 5.0&nbsp;kg and revolves at up to 64,500 rpm. Maximum torque is 18&nbsp;Nm (13.3 ftlbs). The system occupies a volume of 13 litres.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Two minor incidents have been reported during testing of KERS systems in {{F1|2008}}. The first occurred when the [[Red Bull Racing]] team tested their KERS battery for the first time in July: it malfunctioned and caused a fire scare that led to the team's factory being evacuated.<ref>{{cite news| title = KERS failure caused Red Bull fire scare | publisher =autosport.com| url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/69199| date =17 July 2008| accessdate = 22 July 2008}}</ref> The second was less than a week later when a [[BMW in Formula One|BMW Sauber]] mechanic was given an electric shock when he touched [[Christian Klien]]'s KERS-equipped car during a test at the [[Circuito de Jerez|Jerez]] circuit.<ref>{{cite news| title =BMW mechanic escapes KERS scare | publisher =autosport.com| url =http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/69391| date =22 July 2008| accessdate =22 July 2008}}</ref>

With the introduction of KERS in the 2009 season, only four teams used it at some point in the season: [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], [[Renault F1|Renault]], [[BMW in Formula One|BMW]], and [[McLaren]]. Eventually, during the season, Renault and BMW stopped using the system. [[McLaren|Vodafone McLaren Mercedes]] became the first team to win a F1 GP using a KERS equipped car when [[Lewis Hamilton]] won the Hungarian Grand Prix on 26 July 2009. Their second KERS equipped car finished fifth. At the following race, Lewis Hamilton became the first driver to take pole position with a KERS car, his team mate, [[Heikki Kovalainen]] qualifying second. This was also the first instance of an all KERS front row. On 30 August 2009, [[Kimi Räikkönen]] won the Belgian Grand Prix with his KERS equipped Ferrari. It was the first time that KERS contributed directly to a race victory, with second placed [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] claiming "Actually, I was quicker than Kimi. He only took me because of KERS at the beginning".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8229449.stm|title=Raikkonen wins exciting Spa duel|publisher=BBC|date=30 August 2009|accessdate=30 August 2009|first=Chris|last=Whyatt}}</ref>

Although KERS was still legal in F1 in the 2010 season, all the teams had agreed not to use it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/8763.html |title=Formula 1 - The Official F1 Website |publisher=Formula1.com |date= |accessdate=14 August 2010}}</ref> New rules for the 2011 F1 season which raised the minimum weight limit of the car and driver by 20&nbsp;kg to 640&nbsp;kg,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2010/12/11603.html |title=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2010/12/11603.html |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=4 December 2010}}</ref> along with the FOTA teams agreeing to the use of KERS devices once more, meant that KERS returned for the 2011 season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8756430.stm|title=Changes made to F1l|publisher=BBC|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=23 June 2010|first=Andrew|last=Benson}}</ref> This is still optional as it was in the 2009 season; in the 2011 season 3 teams elected not to use it.<ref name="3teams"/> For the 2012 season, only Marussia and HRT raced without KERS, and by 2013, with the withdrawal of HRT, all 11 teams on the grid were running KERS. 

For the 2014 season, the power storage of the KERS (now called MGU-K) units increased from 60&nbsp;kW to 120&nbsp;kW. This was to balance the sport's move from 2.4 litre V8 engines to 1.6 litre V6 engines.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/formula_one/13878359.stm |title=Formula 1 delays introduction of ‘green’ engines until 2014 |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date= 29 June 2011|accessdate=27 June 2011}}</ref>

==Thermodynamics==

===KERS Flywheel===
The energy of a flywheel can be described by this general energy equation, assuming the flywheel is the system:
:<math> E_{in}-E_{out}= \Delta E_{system}</math>

Where:
:*<math>E_{in}</math> is the energy into the flywheel.
:*<math>E_{out}</math> is the energy out of the flywheel.
:*<math>\Delta E_{system}</math> is the change in energy of the flywheel.

An assumption is made that during braking there is no change in the potential energy, enthalpy of the flywheel, pressure or volume of the flywheel, so only kinetic energy will be considered. As the car is braking, no energy is dispersed by the flywheel, and the only energy into the flywheel is the initial kinetic energy of the car. The equation can be simplified to:
:<math>\frac{mv^2} {2} = \Delta E_{fly}</math>

Where:
:*<math>m</math> is the mass of the car.
:*<math>v</math> is the initial velocity of the car just before braking.

The flywheel collects a percentage of the initial kinetic energy of the car, and this percentage can be represented by <math>\eta_{fly}</math>. The flywheel stores the energy as rotational kinetic energy. Because the energy is kept as kinetic energy and not transformed into another type of energy this process is efficient. The flywheel can only store so much energy, however, and this is limited by its maximum amount of rotational kinetic energy. This is determined based upon the inertia of the flywheel and its angular velocity. As the car sits idle, little rotational kinetic energy is lost over time so the initial amount of energy in the flywheel can be assumed to equal the final amount of energy distributed by the flywheel. The amount of kinetic energy distributed by the flywheel is therefore: 
:<math>KE_{fly}=\frac{\eta_{fly} mv^2} {2} </math>

===Regenerative brakes===
Regenerative braking has a similar energy equation to the equation for the mechanical flywheel. Regenerative braking is a two-step process involving the motor/generator and the battery. The initial kinetic energy is transformed into electrical energy by the generator and is then converted into chemical energy by the battery. This process is less efficient than the flywheel. The efficiency of the generator can be represented by:
:<math> \eta_{gen}=\frac{W_{out}}{W_{in}}</math>

Where:
:*<math>W_{in}</math> is the work into the generator.
:*<math>W_{out}</math> is the work produced by the generator.

The only work into the generator is the initial kinetic energy of the car and the only work produced by the generator is the electrical energy. Rearranging this equation to solve for the power produced by the generator gives this equation:
:<math>P_{gen}= \frac{\eta_{gen} mv^2}{2 \Delta t} </math>

Where:
:*<math>\Delta t</math> is the amount of time the car brakes.
:*<math>m</math> is the mass of the car.
:*<math>v</math> is the initial velocity of the car just before braking.

The efficiency of the battery can be described as:
:<math> \eta_{batt}=\frac{P_{out}} {P_{in}} </math>

Where:
:*<math>P_{in}=P_{gen}</math>
:*<math>P_{out}=\frac{W_{out}}{\Delta t}</math>
The work out of the battery represents the amount of energy produced by the regenerative brakes. This can be represented by:
: <math> E_{out}=\frac{\eta_{batt} \eta_{gen} mv^2}{2}</math>

[[File:ImperialCrownOfIndia2.jpg|thumb|230px|The Imperial Crown of India]]

The '''Imperial Crown of India''' was the [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] of three British sovereigns as [[Emperor of India|Emperors of India]] during the final decades of the [[British Raj|Indian Empire]].  The crown is housed with, but is not part of, the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]].

==History==
The crown was created for [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], in his position as Emperor of India, to wear at the [[Delhi Durbar]] of 1911. The need for the new crown lay in the tradition that the British [[crown jewels]] do not leave the [[United Kingdom]].

King George and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] travelled to Delhi for the [[durbar (court)|Durbar]] ceremonies, at which they were proclaimed as Emperor and Empress of India to the princes of India. George and Mary were not crowned as emperor and empress during the ceremonies because the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Randall Davidson]], did not think it suitable for a [[Christian]] religious service to take place in a country where the people were predominantly [[Hindu]] or [[Muslim]]. Also because, theoretically, the monarch's coronation in the United Kingdom suffices as a coronation for all his or her realms and territories simultaneously. Instead, George simply wore the crown as he entered the arena where the durbar took place, and the durbar was styled as an announcement of the coronation which had already taken place.

The Crown Jewellers, [[Garrard & Co]], created the crown at a cost of £60,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|60000|1911|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=0}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}} It weighs 34.05 ounces (0.97&nbsp;kg) and is set with [[emerald]]s, [[ruby|rubies]], [[sapphire]]s, 6,100 [[diamond]]s, and one large fine ruby. The weight of the crown led King George to complain after the durbar that his head hurt.<ref name=Londononline1>[http://www.londononline.co.uk/monarchy/Imperial_Crown_of_India London Online - Imperial Crown of India]</ref> The crown has not been worn since by any British sovereign.

==Design==
Similar to other British crowns, the Imperial Crown of India consists of a circlet topped by four [[cross pattée|crosses pattée]] and four [[fleur-de-lis|fleurs-de-lis]]. However, the arches on top, which join at a typical [[Monde (crown)|monde]] and cross, point upwards in an Asiatic manner instead of curving downward as do other British crowns.

It is also the only crown of a British sovereign with eight [[Half-arch (crown)|half-arches]], in the style of Continental European crowns, departing from the British tradition of crowns having four half-arches.  This difference is emblematic of the distinction between the crown of an [[emperor]] or empress and that of a king or queen. It may be viewed in the [[Jewel House]] at the [[Tower of London]], alongside the British Crown Jewels.

[[File:El cóndor pasa.jpg|thumb|right|[[busking|Street band]] from [[Peru]] performing [[El Cóndor Pasa (song)|El Cóndor Pasa]] in [[Tokyo]]]]

'''Andean music''' is a group of styles of music from the [[Andes]] region in South America.

Original chants and melodies come from the general area inhabited by [[Quechua people|Quechua]]s, [[Aymara people|Aymara]]s and other peoples who lived roughly in the area of the  [[Inca Empire]] prior to European contact. This early music then was fused with Spanish music elements. It includes folklore music of parts of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]]. Andean music is popular to different degrees across Latin America, having its core public in rural areas and among indigenous  populations. The [[Nueva Canción]] movement of the 70s revived the genre across Latin America and brought it to places where it was unknown or forgotten.

==Instruments==
[[Image:Zampoña.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Siku (panpipe)|panflute]] is among the most emblematic instruments of Andean music.]]

The [[panpipes]] group include the [[Siku (panpipe)|sikú]] (or zampoña) and antara. These are ancient indigenous instruments that vary in size, tuning and style. Instruments in this group are constructed from aquatic reeds found in many lakes in the Andean Region of South America. The sikú has two rows of canes and are tuned in either pentatonic or diatonic scales. Some modern single-rowed panpipes modeled after the native Antara are capable of playing full scales, while traditional Sikús are played using two rows of canes wrapped together. It is still commonplace for two performers to share a [[melody]] while playing the larger style of sikú called the [[Siku (instrument)|toyo]]. This style of voicing interspersed notes between two musicians is called playing in [[hocket]] and is still in use today in many of the [[huaynos]] traditional songs and contemporary Andean music.

[[Quena]]s (notched-end [[flute]]s) remain popular and are traditionally made out of the same aquatic canes as the Sikús, although [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] pipe is sometimes used due to its resistance to heat, cold and humidity. Generally, quenas only are played during the dry season, with vertical flutes, either [[pinkillo]]s or [[Tarka (flute)|tarka]]s, being played during the wet season. Tarkas are constructed from local Andean hard wood sources. [[Marching band]]s dominated by [[drum]]s and panpipes are commonplace today and are used to celebrate weddings, carnivals and other holidays.

==Modern history==
The twentieth century saw drastic changes in Andean society and culture. Bolivia, for example, saw a [[nationalism|nationalistic]] revolution in 1952, leading to increased rights and social awareness for natives. The new government established a [[folklore]] department in the Bolivian Ministry of Education and [[radio station]]s began [[broadcasting]] in Aymara and Quechua.<!-- What has this got to do with Andean music ? please add context by linking to the main topic-->

By 1965, an influential group called [[Los Jairas]] formed in [[La Paz]], Bolivia; the quartet fused native sounds into forms suitable for urban Europeans and the [[middle class]]. One member of Los Jairas, [[Gilbert Favre]] (a Swiss-French [[flautist]]) had previously been an acquaintance of the Parras ([[Ángel Parra|Ángel]], [[Isabel Parra|Isabel]], and their mother [[Violeta Parra|Violeta]]) in Paris. The Parras eventually began promoting indigenous music in [[Santiago, Chile]].

The late 1960s released native groups such as Ruphay, [[Grupo Aymara]], and the emblematic [[Quechua people|quechua]] singer, [[Luzmila Carpio]]. Later Chilean groups such as [[Inti-Illimani]] and [[Los Curacas]] took the fusion work of Los Jairas and the Parras to invent [[nueva canción]], which returned to Bolivia in the 1980s in the form of [[canto nuevo]] artists such as [[Emma Junaro]] and [[Matilde Casazola]].

The 1970s was a decade in which Andean music saw its biggest growth. Different groups sprang out of the different villages throughout the [[Andes]] Region. Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia, Colombia and Argentina.

Many musicians made their way to the big cities forming different bands and groups. One of the most legendary was [[Los Kjarkas]], from [[Bolivia]]. Singing and composing songs that became huge hits in Bolivia and would later become Andean standards.

They would later take Andean music to the rest of the world.

==Genres and relationships to other musical styles==
*[[Carnavalito]]
*[[Diablada]] - Originated in [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]], [[Bolivia]] as sort of music typically associated with the diablada dance and its festivals.
*[[Tinku]] - Originated in [[Potosí|Potosi]], [[Bolivia]] from the ritual of violent sacrifice to the mother earth to ensure the best look, good fortune and the prosperity of the next seasons crops.
*[[San Juanito (music style)|San Juanito]] - Originated in [[Ecuador]].
*[[Huayno]] - Originated in [[Viceroyalty of Peru|colonial Peru]] as a combination of traditional rural folk music and popular urban dance music.  High-pitched vocals are accompanied by a variety of instruments, including [[quena]] (flute), [[harp]], [[Siku (panpipe)|siku]] (panpipe), [[accordion]], [[saxophone]], [[charango]], [[lute]], [[violin]], [[guitar]], and [[mandolin]]. Some elements of huayño originate in the music of the pre-[[Christopher Columbus|Columbian]] Andes, especially on the territory of former [[Inca Empire]]. Huayno utilizes a distinctive rhythm in which the first beat is stressed and followed by two short beats.
*[[Afro-Bolivian Saya]]
*[[Peruvian cumbia|Chicha]] - Originated in Peru the late 80s as a fusion of cumbia and huayno music.

===Cumbia===
Originally from the [[Caribbean]] coast of Colombia, [[cumbia]] became a hit in Peru and through much of Latin America. It was then adapted to a "Peruvian" version called "Chicha" that has become a popular style in the Andean region, specially among in the lower socioeconomic strata of the society including Quechua and [[Aymara people|Aymara]] populations. Several Andean music genres have also borrowed elements originally introduced by the Peruvian "cumbia" such as [[electric bass]] guitars, electronic [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] and little from the original cumbia rhythm.

===Nueva canción===
Andean music has served as a major source of inspiration for the neo-folkloric [[Nueva canción]] movement that begun in the 60s, Nueva canción musicians both interpreted old songs and created new pieces that are now considered andean music. Some Nueva canción musicians such as [[Los Jaivas]] would fuse Andean music with [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] and [[progressive rock]].

===Rock en Español===
While the [[rock en Español]] wave of the 80s and 90s largely rejected Nueva canción and folklore in favor of [[hard rock]], [[pop rock]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[alternative rock]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] sounds some elements of Andean music has been featured in [[rock en Español]] songs such as ''[[Cuando pase el temblor]]'' by [[Soda Stereo]] and ''Lamento boliviano'' by [[Los Enanitos Verdes]].

[[File:Anti-conscription parade at Victoria Square.jpg|thumb|300px|An anti-conscription parade in Montreal on May 17, 1917]]
The '''Conscription Crisis of 1917''' ''(French: '''Crise de la conscription de 1917''')'' was a political and military crisis in [[Canada]] during [[World War I]]. It was mainly caused by disagreement on whether men should be conscripted to fight in WWI. It also brought out many issues regarding French - English Relations and also brought around many revolutionary acts.

==Background==
{{main|Military history of Canada during World War I}}
Canada entered World War I on 4 August 1914.<ref name="Bumstead">The Peoples of Canada, “A Post-Confederation History”, J.M. Bumstead</ref>  Colonel [[Sam Hughes]] was the Canadian Minister of Militia and on 10 August he was permitted to create a militia of 25,000 men.<ref name="Bumstead" />  Before the end of August 1914 Hughes had already created a training camp at [[Valcartier, Quebec]], which was capable of housing 32,000 men.<ref name="Bumstead" /> The first contingent of 31,200 Canadians, dubbed "Canada's Answer", arrived in Britain on October 14 for continued training.<ref name="Bumstead" /> Hughes moved with incredible speed to create Canadian battalions which allowed Canadian troops to be kept together as units for the first time.<ref name="Bumstead" />

Relatively few [[francophone]]s volunteered. The experience of the first contingent suggested that they could expect nothing but ill treatment as French-speaking [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]] in English-speaking battalions filled with what they perceived as mostly [[Protestant]] men and officers, unable to communicate with them and imbued with the spirit underlying [[Regulation 17]]. Young French Canadians seeking to serve, chose, instead, the few traditional "French" regiments of the Canadian militia, such as ''[[Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal]]'', where barracks life was in French and only the command language was in English. They had to be turned away, because the Minister of Militia and his subordinates were obstinate in their refusal to mobilize these traditionally French regiments or to create new ones. However, the government continued to raise its expectations for volunteers, aiming for 150,000 men by 1915. English Canadians did not believe that French Canada was providing a fair share to the war effort.  Sam Hughes, in June 1917, informed the [[House of Commons (Canada)|House of Commons]] that of the 432,000 Canadian volunteers fewer than 5% came from French Canada, which made up 28% of the Canadian population at that time.<ref name="Bumstead" />  There have been many reasons proposed for the lack of volunteers from Quebec; however, many prominent Canadian historians suggest that the Ontario government's move to disallow French language instruction in Regulation 17 as the main reason.<ref name="Bumstead" />

Political pressure in Quebec, along with some public rallies, demanded the creation of French-speaking units to fight a war that was viewed as being right and necessary by many Quebecers, despite Regulation 17 in Ontario and the resistance in Quebec of those such as [[Henri Bourassa]]. Indeed, Montreal's ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' editorialized that Quebec should create a contingent to fight as part of the French Army. When the government relented, the first new unit was the [[22nd (French Canadian) Battalion, CEF]]. While a few other French-speaking units were also allowed to be created, mostly by Reserve officers, they were all disbanded to provide replacements for the 22nd, which suffered close to 4,000 wounded and killed in the course of the war.

As the war dragged on, soldiers and politicians soon realized there would be no quick end. Eventually, people learned of the trench conditions and number of casualties in Europe, and men stopped volunteering. There were over 300,000 recruits by 1916, but [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Borden]] had promised 500,000 by the end of that year, despite the fact that Canada's population was only 8 million at the time.

==Conscription Crisis 1917==
After the [[Battle of the Somme]], Canada was in desperate need to replenish its supply of soldiers; however, there were very few volunteers to replace them. The recruiting effort in Quebec had failed, and Canada turned to its only unused option: [[conscription]].

Almost all French Canadians opposed conscription: they felt that they had no particular loyalty to either Britain or [[France]]. Led by [[Henri Bourassa]], they felt their only loyalty was to Canada. English Canadians generally supported the war effort as they felt stronger ties to the British Empire.<ref name="Bumstead" />  The Conscription Crisis of 1917 caused a considerable rift along ethnic lines between Anglophones and [[Francophones]].<ref name="Bumstead" />

After visiting Britain for a meeting of First Ministers in May 1917, Borden announced that he would introduce the [[Military Service Act (Canada)|Military Service Act]] On August 29, 1917. The Act was passed: allowing the government to conscript men across the country if the Prime Minister felt that it was necessary.

==The election of 1917==
To solidify support for conscription in the [[Canadian federal election, 1917|1917 election]], Borden extended the vote through the [[Military Voters Act]] to overseas soldiers, who were in favour of conscription to replace their depleted forces (women serving as nurses were also given the right to vote). For Borden, these votes had another advantage, as they could be distributed in any riding, regardless of the soldier's regular place of residence. With the [[Wartime Elections Act]], women who had close male relatives serving overseas were also granted the right to vote in this election, as they appeared to be more patriotic and more worthy of a public voice.  On the other hand, [[conscientious objector]]s and recent immigrants from "enemy countries" were denied the right to vote.  In the election, Borden was opposed not only by Bourassa, but also by [[Liberal Party (Canada)|Liberal Party]] leader [[Wilfrid Laurier]], though he had been abandoned by much of his party. Laurier had opposed conscription from the beginning of the war, arguing that an intense campaign for volunteers would produce enough troops. He privately felt that if he joined the coalition government, Quebec would fall under what he perceived as a dangerous nationalism of Bourassa, which might ultimately lead to Quebec leaving the [[Canadian confederation]].

Borden's [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist Party]] won the election with 153 seats; Laurier's Liberals secured 82 seats, 62 from Quebec.

==Conscription in practice==
After the Military Service Act was passed in 1917 tensions ran high throughout Canada. Not all Canadians were as enthusiastic about joining the war effort as the first Canadian volunteers had been. In fact many people objected to the idea of war completely. The conscientious objectors or unwilling soldiers sought exemption from combat. Instead, many joined the non-combatant corps, where they took on other roles. Their duties consisted of cleaning and other labour. They did not carry weapons but were expected to dress in uniform, and they practised regular army discipline. Often the conscientious objector was abused, deemed a coward, and stripped of  basic rights.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bishop|first=Elaine|title=Conscientious Objector|url=http://mcccanada.ca/peace/co/history}}</ref> In the British House of Commons a resolution for the disenfranchisement of conscientious objectors was defeated by 141 to 71. Lord Hugh Cecil, who was a well-known churchman and statesman, said that he was “entirely out of sympathy for conscientious objectors, but he could not force them to do what they thought was wrong or punish them for refusing to do something they thought was wrong.”<ref>{{cite news|title=Patriotism and Partizanship|url=http://micromedia.pagesofthepast.ca/PageView.asp|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=September 14, 1917}}</ref>

However, the government was making an effort to be sympathetic toward those who refused to take part in military service. Many communities set up local tribunals. If a man refused to serve he was put in front of a panel of two judges: one appointed by a board of selection named by Parliament, and the other by the senior county judge. The man was to plead his case, and if the panel was not convinced, the man asking for exemption was allowed to appeal.<ref>{{cite news|title=Borden Tells of Need for Reinforcements|url=http://micromedia.pagesofthepast.ca/PageView.asp|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=June 12, 1917}}</ref> If the judges found that it was best if the person stayed at home, then he was not sent overseas. Many Canadians were unhappy with the conscientious objectors' choice to refuse combat. Many people believed that if people were not willing to give service against the enemy, then the only choice for them was between civil or military prisons.<ref>{{cite news|title=Opinions/ Editorials|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=June 26, 1917}}</ref>

Conscription posed a difficult question for the government. Conscription was unprecedented, and the problem proved to be that the government did not know who was best suited to become a soldier, a toolmaker or a farmer. The issue of manpower and ensuring that the proper men were being relocated to the most appropriate roles overseas was an issue that lasted the duration of the war.<ref>{{cite book|last=Granatstein|first=J.L|title=Canada and the First World War:Essays in Honour of Robert Craig Brown|year=2005|publisher=UTP Press|location=Toronto}}</ref>

==Imperialism and nationalism==
Despite the fact that 35 000 French-Canadians served overseas throughout the war, the conscription question resulted in French-Canadians feeling more isolated than ever from the rest of Canada. They never fully supported the war effort, which resulted in the Federal government expressing deep concern over French-Canada’s nationalist and anti-war stance.<ref>Martin F. Auger, “On the Brink of Civil War: The Canadian Government and the Suppression of the 1918 Quebec Easter Riots,”Canadian Historical Review 89/4 (December  2008): 504</ref> For the first time in Canada’s brief fifty-year history, there were substantial arguments being made in favor of revoking the Constitutional Act of 1867.<ref>Martin F. Auger, “On the Brink of Civil War: The Canadian Government and the Suppression of the 1918 Quebec Easter Riots,”Canadian Historical Review 89/4 (December, 2008): 540</ref> The nation was divided between English-speaking imperialists who supported the overseas war effort and French-speaking nationalists who believed that conscription was a second attempt to impose the Conquest, therefore it needed to be resisted at all costs. The Federal Conservatives had stated on numerous occasions that conscription would not be imposed.<ref>J.L. Granastein and J.M. Hitsman, Broken Promises: A History of Conscription in Canada (Toronto: Oxford University Press), 60-61</ref> However, upon his return from London in May 1917, Borden met with his cabinet and announced that he would be imposing conscription. While in London, Borden had received a lot of pressure to send more troops in order to fully support the allied forces. He was convinced that Canada’s war effort was weak and only conscription could make it respectable.<ref>J.L. Granastein and J.M. Hitsman, Broken Promises: A History of Conscription in Canada (Toronto: Oxford University Press), 60</ref> All of his English-speaking ministers supported the idea however his two French-Canadian ministers were hesitant. They fully understood the negative reactions that French-Canadians would have.<ref>J.L. Granastein and J.M. Hitsman, Broken Promises: A History of Conscription in Canada (Toronto: Oxford University Press), 63-64</ref> The French-Canadian nationalists who opposed conscription viewed it as neither necessary nor successful. They argued that it caused an avoidable rift between English and French-Canada.<ref>A.M. Williams, Conscription 1917 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1969), 1</ref> The debate surrounding conscription would be one that would have a significant impact on both Federal and provincial politics for many years following World War I.

==Quebec Easter riots and the end of the war==
On January 1, 1918, the Unionist government began to enforce the [[Military Service Act (Canada)|Military Service Act]]. The act caused 404,385 men to be liable for military service, from which 385,510 sought exemption, The [[Military Service Act (Canada)|Military Service Act]] was vague and offered many exemptions, and almost all of these men were able to avoid service, even if they had supported conscription. The most violent opposition occurred in Quebec, where anti-war attitudes drawn from [[French-Canadian nationalism]] sparked a weekend of rioting between March 28 and April 1, 1918. The disturbances began on the Thursday when [[Dominion Police]] detained a French-Canadian man who had failed to present his draft exemption papers. Despite the man’s release, an angry mob of nearly 200 soon descended upon the St. Roch District Police Station where the man had been held. By the following Good Friday evening, an estimated 15,000{{dubious|date=October 2010}} rioters had sacked the conscription registration office as well as two pro-conscription newspapers within Quebec City.<ref name="Auger">Auger, Martin F. "On the Brink of Civil War: The Canadian Government and the Suppression of the 1918 Quebec Easter Riots" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 89/4 (2008), pp 9, 15-17, 83</ref>

This escalation of violence along with rumours of an alleged province-wide uprising prompted Quebec City Mayor [[Henri Edgar Lavigueur]] to contact Ottawa and request reinforcements. Alarmed by the two days of rioting, the Borden Government invoked the War Measures Act of 1914, which gave the federal government the power to directly oversee the maintenance of law and order in Quebec City.<ref name="Auger"/> By the following morning, 780 federal soldiers had been deployed in the city, with an additional 1,000 en route from Ontario and 3,000 from western provinces. Despite their imminent arrival, protracted violence continued into the night of March 30, leading in to a precarious Sunday.<ref name="Auger"/> The final and bloodiest conflict happened Easter Monday, when crowds once again organized against the military presence in the city, which by then had grown to 1,200 soldiers – all of which came from Ontario. Once armed rioters began to fire on troops from concealed positions, the soldiers were ordered to fire on the crowds, immediately causing them to disperse. Though the actual number of civilian casualties is debated, official reports from that day name five men killed by gunfire. Dozens more were injured. Among the soldiers are 32 recorded injuries that day, with no deaths. Monday, April 1, marked the end of the Easter Riots, which totaled over 150 casualties and $300,000 in damage.<ref name="Auger"/>

The Easter Riots represent one of the most violent disturbances in Canadian history. This stemmed from pre-existing currents in French-Canadian nationalism, which became exacerbated during war time and ultimately erupted over conscription. Curiously, the event itself is rarely studied as anything other than a footnote to the larger political debate around conscription at the time. However, the severity and swiftness of Ottawa’s response serves to demonstrate their determination to impose conscription and prevent a national crisis. Moreover, the military crackdown which lasted in Quebec until the end of the war resulted in an increase in state power in the wake of growing French-Canadian nationalism.<ref name="Auger"/>

By the spring of 1918, the government had amended the act so that there were no exemptions, which left many English Canadians opposed as well. Even without exemptions, only about 125,000 men were ever conscripted, and only 25,000 of these were sent to the front. Fortunately for Borden, the war ended within a few months, but the issue left Canadians divided and distrustful of their government. In 1920, Borden retired, and his successor, [[Arthur Meighen]], was defeated in the [[Canadian federal election, 1921|1921 election]]. Conservatives were virtually shut out of Quebec for the next 50 years.

'''Henry Hale Bliss''' (June 13, 1830 &ndash; September 14, 1899) was the first person killed by a [[motor vehicle accident]] in the United States, and the first known in the Americas.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dimeo-Ediger |first=Winona |editor1-first=Chris |editor1-last=Johns |date=September 2009 |title=Saved By the Belt |journal=National Geographic |volume=216 |issue=3 |publisher=National Geographic Society |issn=00279358}}</ref> On September 13, 1899 he was disembarking from a [[streetcar]] at [[74th Street (Manhattan)|West 74th Street]] and [[Central Park West]] in [[New York City]], when an electric-powered [[taxicab]] (Automobile No. 43) struck him and crushed his head and chest. He died from his injuries the next morning.

Arthur Smith, the driver of the taxicab, was arrested and charged with [[manslaughter]] but was acquitted on the grounds that it was unintentional. The passenger, Dr. David Edson, was the son of former New York City mayor [[Franklin Edson]].

A plaque was dedicated at the site on September 13, 1999, to commemorate the centenary of this event. It reads:

{{cquote|Here at West 74th Street and Central Park West, Henry H. Bliss dismounted from a streetcar and was struck and knocked unconscious by an automobile on the evening of September 13, 1899. When Mr. Bliss, a New York [[real estate]] man, died the next morning from his injuries, he became the first recorded motor vehicle fatality in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. This sign was erected to remember Mr. Bliss on the centennial of his untimely death and to promote safety on our streets and highways.}}

The ceremony was attended by his great-granddaughter, who placed roses on the place where Bliss was struck.

Bliss's death is often stated to have been the first recorded vehicle-related fatality in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. However, the Western Hemisphere actually includes all land of the hemisphere west of [[Greenwich]], and there were two earlier such deaths. [[Mary Ward (scientist)|Mary Ward]] was killed by a steam-powered car in [[Ireland]] during 1869, and [[Bridget Driscoll]] was a pedestrian, killed by a car on the grounds of the Crystal Palace, Sydenham during 1896 (Sydenham is just west of the [[Prime Meridian]]).

{{Culture of Ecuador}}
The '''music of Ecuador ''' has a long history. Pasillo is a genre of indigenous Latin music. It is extremely popular in Ecuador, where it is the "national genre of music." Pasillo as a genre is also present in the highland regions of Colombia and to a lesser extent, Panama and Venezuela.

Today, it has incorporated more European features of classical dance, such as waltz. As it spread during the Gran Chaco period, pasillo also absorbed the individual characteristics of isolated villages. This gives it an eclectic feel; however, the style, tone, and tempo of the music differ in each village.

In its waltz, pasillo alters the classically European dance form to accompany guitar, mandolin, and other string instruments.

The [[pacific]] coast of Ecuador is known for the [[Amor Fino]], a popular type of song, as well as a variety of dance music.

[[Pasillo]], [[Pasacalle]], and Yarabi are popular styles of folksong. Pasillos are played with [[guitar]] and [[rondin]], the latter being similar to a [[flute]], and is usually downtempo; it is descended from the [[waltz]]. Pasacalle is a form of [[dance music]], while the sentimental Yarabi is probably the most popular form in Ecuador.

==Central Ecuador==
The instrument of the indigenous communities of the Ecuadorian highlands is largely the [[flute]]. Guitar and brass bands are also found throughout the area.

==Andean music (La Sierra)==
The mountainous, Andean region of Ecuador, the Sierra, is home to a style of music called [[Sanjuanito]]. The music of the [[Otavalo]] people is well known worldwide. A small [[panpipe]] called the ''[http://www.wayanay.com/instruments.html rondador]'' is the most distinctive instrument, but ensembles are typically groups of [[wind instrument]]s, [[guitar]] trios, or [[brass band]]s. Folk rhythms include ''cachullapi'', ''yumbo'', and danzante
Musicians like [[Huayanay]] have helped to popularize Andean-Ecuadoran music.

== Música costeña ("Music of the Coast") ==
People from the Coast of Ecuador, or ''Costeños'', listen to music of Afro-Ecuadorian or Afro-Caribbean descent such as [[Salsa music|Salsa]], [[Merengue music|Merengue]], and [[Mapalé]]. All the cities on the coast of Ecuador, such as [[Guayaquil]] and [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]], listen to this type of music.

== Afro ecuadorian music ==
[[Afro-Ecuadorians|Afro-Ecuadorian]] music is mainly of two types. ''Marimba'' music comes from Esmeraldas, and gets its name from the prominent use of ''[[marimba]]''s, along with drums and other instruments specific to this region such as the ''bombo'', the ''cununo'' and the ''wasa''. Sometimes this music is played in religious ceremonies, as well as in celebrations and parties. It features call and response chanting along with the music. Some of the rhythms associated with it are ''currulao'', ''bambuco'' and ''andarele''.

On the other hand, in the Chota Valley there is ''[[bomba (Ecuador)|bomba]]'' music. This music is very different from ''marimba'', having a more prominent Spanish, ''mestizo'' and indigenous influence. It can vary from mid tempo to a very fast rhythm. It is usually played with guitars, as well as the main local instrument called ''bomba'', which is a drum, along with a ''guiro'', and sometimes ''bombos'' and ''bongos''. A variation of it played by ''la banda mocha'', groups who play ''bomba'' with a ''bombo'', ''guiro'' and plant leaves to give melody.

Religious practice among afro-Ecuadorians is usually Roman Catholic. There is no significant African cult, although Catholic worship is distinctive in Esmeraldas, and sometimes is done with ''marimba'' music.

==Folk instruments==
*[[cunuca]]: a [[percussion instrument]] similar to a [[conga drum]]
*[[bombos]]
*[[conuno]]
*[[pinkillu]]: a wind instrument similar to a wooden recorder. Native to the [[Quichua]] people in the [[Napo]] province

==Music institutions==
The [[Fundación de Desarrollo Social Afroecuatoriano]] (AZUCAR) has existed since 1993, and offers a variety of workshops for all ages in music and dance, as well as handicrafts and other topics. More information can be found on their website [http://www.goecuador.com/mp3/azucar.html here].

===Music festivals===
Ecuador has many annual festivals, with nearly every village celebrating a [[Roman Catholic Saint]].  The [http://www.galapagos-islands-tourguide.com/ecuador-music.html annual festival in August] held in [[San Antonio de Pichincha]] is particularly well known, as is the independent music festival Quito Fest.

'''Stade''' ({{IPA-de|??ta?d?}}) is a city in [[Lower Saxony]], Germany and part of the [[Hamburg Metropolitan Region]] (''Metropolregion Hamburg''). It is the seat of the [[Stade (district)|district]] named after it. The city was first mentioned in a document from 994.

It includes the urban districts of [[Bützfleth]], [[Stade-Hagen|Hagen]], [[Haddorf]] and [[Wiepenkathen]] which have a district council ("Ortsrat") of their own with some autonomous decision making rights.

Stade is located on the lower [[Elbe]] river ([[Niederelbe|Lower Elbe]]) and the [[German Timber-Frame Road]].

==History==
The first human settlers came to the Stade area in 30,000 BC.

Since 1180 Stade belonged to the [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen]]. In early 1208 King [[Valdemar II of Denmark]] and his troops conquered Stade. In August Valdemar II's cousin being in enmity with the king, the then Prince-Archbishop [[Valdemar of Denmark (bishop)|Valdemar]] reconquered the city only to lose it soon after again to Valdemar II.<ref>Adolf Hofmeister, "Der Kampf um das Erbe des Stader Grafen zwischen den Welfen und der Bremer Kirche (1144–1236)", In: ''Geschichte des Landes zwischen Elbe und Weser'': 3 vols., Hans-Eckhard Dannenberg and Heinz-Joachim Schulze (eds.) on behalf of the Landschaftsverband der ehemaligen Herzogtümer Bremen und Verden, Stade: Landschaftsverband der ehem. Herzogtümer Bremen und Verden, 1995 and 2008, (Schriftenreihe des Landschaftsverbandes der ehem. Herzogtümer Bremen und Verden; No. 7), vol. II: Mittelalter (1995), pp. 105–157, here p. 123. ISBN 978-3-9801919-8-2</ref> In 1209 Emperor [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]] persuaded his ally Valdemar II to withdraw into the north of the Elbe, and the deposed Prince-Archbishop Valdemar took Stade.

On 2 May 1209 Otto IV granted important [[town privileges]] ("Stadtrecht") to Stade. Otto IV confirmed the [[bourgeoisie|burgher]]s to be personally free and recognised them constituting a political entity of their own law, the ''burgenses and optimi cives'' of Stade.<ref>Jürgen Bohmbach, "Der werdende Territorialstaat der Erzbischöfe von Bremen (1236–1511): III. Die Städte im Erzstift Bremen", In: ''Geschichte des Landes zwischen Elbe und Weser'': 3 vols., Hans-Eckhard Dannenberg and Heinz-Joachim Schulze (eds.) on behalf of the Landschaftsverband der ehemaligen Herzogtümer Bremen und Verden, Stade: Landschaftsverband der ehem. Herzogtümer Bremen und Verden, 1995 and 2008, (Schriftenreihe des Landschaftsverbandes der ehem. Herzogtümer Bremen und Verden; No. 7), vol. II: Mittelalter (1995), pp. 241–262, here p. 249. ISBN 978-3-9801919-8-2</ref>  Property within the municipal boundaries could not be subjected to feudal overlordship and was to be freely inherited without feudal claims to reversion. Fair juridical procedures were constituted and maximal fines fixed. Otto IV obliged himself to prevent burghers from being taken as hostages and to liberate captured burghers.

After Otto IV had changed his mind and reinvested Prince-Archbishop Valdemar with the [[Episcopal see|See]] in 1211, Valdemar II recaptured Stade. In 1213 Otto's elder brother [[Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine]], reconquered Stade for the Prince-Archbishop. In 1215 Henry repelled another Danish attack on Stade. In the winter of 1216 Valdemar II and his Danish troops, unable to take the city of Stade, ravaged the County of Stade. From then on Stade remained a part of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen.

In medieval times (from the 13th century to the late 17th century), Stade was a prominent member of the [[Hanseatic League]], but was later eclipsed by [[Hamburg]]. In 1611 the city signed a contract with [[Sephardim|Sephardic]] Jews, allowing the foundation of a community. In 1613 [[John Frederick, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp|John Frederick]], Administrator of the Prince-Archbishopric, followed by settling [[Ashkenazim|Ashkenazic]] Jews in the city, but during the turmoil of Catholic conquest and Lutheran reconquest the last archival traces of Jews date from 1630. In 1648, by the [[Treaty of Westphalia]], the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen underwent a constitutional transformation from a [[prince-bishopric]] into a monarchy, the ''Duchy of Bremen''. The duchy and the neighboured ''Principality of Verden'', colloquially referred to as [[Bremen-Verden]], were granted by the ''Treaty of Westphalia'' as an appanage to the Swedish crown. Stade, already under Swedish occupation since 1645, was a part of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] province of Bremen-Verden-Wildeshausen from 1645 to 1712, and some of the buildings built by the Swedes are still in use today. 

=== Swedish fortress ===
[[File:Stade-1640-Merian.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Stade around 1640]]
Stade's heyday lasted until the [[Thirty Years' War]]. In 1628 [[Johann t’Serclaes von Tilly|Tilly]] conquered the town; shortly thereafter, [[Sweden]] took possession of it until 1636. After a period of Danish occupation, Sweden finally recaptured it in 1643 and was also officially granted possession of it, together with the [[Archbishopric of Bremen]], in the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Two-thirds of the town were razed in the great town fire on 26&nbsp;May 1659. The town was rebuilt again to the same plan.

From 1675 to 1676, in the [[Swedish-Brandenburg War]], Swedish Stade was conquered during a [[Bremen-Verden Campaign|campaign]] by Denmark and several states of the Holy Roman Empire and remained in allied hands until the end of that war in 1679. Stade, as the headquarters of the Swedish Stadhalter, was besieged from early April 1676 to 13 Aug 1676. In the wake of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679)|Treaty of Saint Germain]] in 1679, Stade was once again awarded to Sweden.

The Elbe customs station near Stade, in Brunshausen at the mouth of the Schwinge, played special role in trading on the River Elbe from the period of the archbishopric. In 1663, the Swedes stationed an Elbe customs frigate (''Elbzollfregatte'') as a permanent patrol ship. This arrangement continued to exist under various rulers until 1850 and the customs station on the Schwinge fieldworks itself existed until 1865.<ref name="Graewe">Richard Graewe: ''Die zweihundertjährige Geschichte der Elb-Zoll-Fregatte zu Brunshausen und ihrer Kommandanten 1650–1850.'' Selbstverlag des Stader Geschichts- und Heimatvereins, Stade 1963</ref>

<!-- [[File:Friedensvertrag 1719 Stockholm.png|thumb|Copy of the final page of the [[preliminary peace]] of Stockholm between Hanover-Great Britain and Sweden from 19 November 1719]] -->
Swedish sovereignty ended in 1712. [[Denmark|Danish troops]] besieged the town in the [[Great Northern War]] and shelled it from 29&nbsp;August to 7&nbsp;September 1712 that destroyed 152 houses, a quarter of the built-up area.

During the Swedish times Stade was the capital of the province.

=== Danish rule ===
In 1712 Denmark conquered Stade and the whole of Bremen-Verden. Stade remained Bremen-Verden's capital also after the Danes ceded it to the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Electorate of Brunswick and Lunenburg (Hanover)]] in 1715. When in 1823 Bremen-Verden was replaced by new administrative forms, Stade continued to be the capital of the [[Stade (region)|Stade region]].

In 1355 and in 1712, Stade suffered from the [[Black Death|plague]] epidemic, which killed at least 30–40% of the city's population.

On 26 May 1659 a huge fire destroyed 60% of the city.
=== Early modern and modern period ===
In 1757 following the [[Invasion of Hanover (1757)|French Invasion of Hanover]], the [[Army of Observation]] under the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]] and the [[Privy Council of Hanover]] (government) took shelter in Stade. Cumberland prepared to defend the town before agreeing the [[Convention of Klosterzeven]] which brought about a temporary [[armistice]].

By the end of the 17th century Ashkenazi Jews reappeared in Stade. In 1842 the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] granted equal rights to Jews and promoted to build up Jewish congregations and a regional superstructure ([[Rabbi|rabbinate]]) within a nationwide scope. The Jews in Stade regarded this a progress and a burden alike, because prior they hadn't employed any rabbi and religion teacher due to the implied financial burden. In 1845 – according to the new law – a land-rabbinate, under [[rabbi#The role of the rabbi in the last 200 years|Land-Rabbi]] [[Joseph Heilbut]], was established in the city, serving 16 Jewish congregations, which were founded over the years in the whole Stade Region, with altogether 1,250 Jews in 1864 (highest number ever reached). The local authorities now requested, that the Jewish congregations establish synagogues and Jewish education for the pupils. In 1849 Stade's synagogue opened, but had to close due to financial restrictions in 1908. And a teacher for [[Judaism|Jewish religion]] and Hebrew was employed (after 1890 Stade's community couldn't afford a teacher any more). From 1903 on the Jewish community of Stade was granted public subsidies to continue functioning. The Stade Region stayed a Jewish diaspora, and from 1860 on Stade's land-rabbinate was never staffed again, but served alternately by one of the other three Hanoverian land-rabbinates. Labour migration and emigration<ref>About a third of the Jews emigrated in the 19th century to the USA. Cf. Jürgen Bohmbach, ''Sie lebten mit uns: Juden im Landkreis Stade vom 18. bis zum 20. Jahrhundert'', Stade: city of Stade, 2001, (Veröffentlichungen aus dem Stadtarchiv Stade; vol. 21), p. 4.</ref> to urban centres outside the Stade Region and Jewish demography rather lead to a reduction of the number of Jews in the ''Stade Region'' (786 in 1913, 716 in 1928).<ref>Albert Marx, ''Geschichte der Juden in Niedersachsen'', Hanover: Fackelträger-Verlag, 1995, p. 144 and Jürgen Bohmbach, ''Sie lebten mit uns: Juden im Landkreis Stade vom 18. bis zum 20. Jahrhundert'', Stade: city of Stade, 2001, (Veröffentlichungen aus dem Stadtarchiv Stade; vol. 21), p. 4.</ref> However, most of the remaining Jews were deported during the Nazi reign. During World War II, Stade remained completely untouched by allied bombings.

[[File:Südostansicht AKW Stade 1.jpg|thumb|Stade nuclear power plant (offline) in 2006]]

In past decades, Stade has economically benefited significantly from the presence of chemical and aerospace industry at the [[Elbe]] river, most notably [[Dow Chemical]] and [[Airbus]]. Also by the Elbe at Stade is the decommissioned [[Stade Nuclear Power Plant]], which was connected to the power grid from 1972 to 2003. By the time the plant was brought offline, it was Germany's second oldest reactor. Following Germany's 2002 decision to phase out nuclear power generation, Stade was the first German plant to be affected; it was closed down permanently on 14 November 2003. The process of dismantling the facility is supposed to be completed by 2015. Close to the former nuclear plant there is an inactive oil-fired power station, the [[Schilling Power Station]].

==Notable places==

The old city of Stade houses a number of notable architectural monuments. Among them the [[St. Cosmae et Damiani (Stade)|St. Cosmae et Damiani Lutheran Church]], the Wilhadi Lutheran Church, the historic town hall, the ''Schwedenspeicher'' and the ''Zeughaus''.

Near Stade there are the gigantic pylons of [[Elbe Crossing 1]] and [[Elbe Crossing 2]]. The pylons of Elbe Crossing 2 are the tallest in Europe and the sixth-tallest in the world.

==Transportation==
In late 2007, the metropolitan rail line ([[S-Bahn]]) S3 of the ''[[Hamburger Verkehrsverbund]]'' (Hamburg Transport Association) was extended from Hamburg to Stade. Trains depart [[Stade station]] every 20 minutes (at peak times) and reach central Hamburg in less than an hour. The new transit connection is expected to increase the city's attractiveness for commuters as well as businesses, although the absence of a service after midnight remains a bone of contention for many town residents.

The clinic was established with the goal of becoming everything the word "asylum" once meant: a shelter, a place of refuge, a sanctuary. Still in operation today, La Borde has been a defining model in the field of [[institutional psychotherapy]]. It is an innovative psychiatric clinic where patients are liberated to actively participate in running the facility.

==Founder==

The clinic was founded by [[Jean Oury]]. A young [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] who gained invaluable experience in experimental therapy at the famous [[Saint-Alban Psychiatric Hospital]], the result of a World War II preponderance on the advancement of the movement of [[institutional psychotherapy]]. He was influenced by innovative therapists such as [[Paul Balvet]], [[Lucien Bonnafé]], the philosopher [[Georges Canguilhem]], and the poet [[Paul Éluard]].

==History==


The psychiatric practice of Oury's clinic would be ever-searching in its analysis of the relations between the "patients" and the "psychotherapists". It borrowed the idea of Hermann Simon that it is necessary to look after the establishment and to look after each patient, while returning initiative and responsibility to them by developing situations in which they can work and express their creativity. From [[François Tosquelles]], Paul Bavet, [[Andre Chaurand]] and Lucien Bonnafé the clinic also took the lead in the development of a new practice of the psychiatry, in which "care, research and formation" are integrated in a collective step.

Since the mid-50s [[Félix Guattari]] became a fixture at La Borde, revolutionizing its practice and organization and producing alongside Oury a large body of theoretical work on the practice and theory of [[schizoanalysis]], set in practice at La Borde, and popularized in his 1972 collaboration with the philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]], ''[[Anti-Œdipus]]''.<ref>See Guattari (1984) and Deleuze and Guattari (1972).</ref>

Among the many distinctive aspects of La Borde is the annual summer tradition in which the "boarders" and staff work together to perform a play, choosing from among the world's greatest classical works. [[Nicolas Philibert]], the documentary film-maker best known in the English-speaking world for his ''[[To Be and to Have|Être et avoir]]'', made a documentary set at La Borde entitled ''Every Little Thing'' ([[French language|French]] ''[[:fr:La Moindre des choses:|La Moindre des choses]]''). The film was released in 1997 and follows the patients and staff staging their production of ''Operette'' by [[Witold Gombrowicz]].<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0119689|title=Every Little Thing}}</ref>

In addition to providing an extended range, ''-yllion'' also dodges the [[long and short scales|long and short scale]] ambiguity of -illion.

Knuth's digit grouping is [[Scientific notation|exponential]] instead of linear; each division doubles the number of digits handled, whereas the familiar system only adds three or six more.  His system is basically the same as one of the ancient and now-unused [[Chinese numerals|Chinese numeral systems]], in which units stand for 10<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>8</sup>, 10<sup>16</sup>, 10<sup>32</sup>, ..., 10<sup>2<sup>''n''</sup></sup>, and so on.

In Knuth's ''-yllion'' proposal:
*1 to 999 have their usual names.
*1000 to 9999 are divided before the 2nd-last digit and named "''[[Placeholder name|foo]]'' hundred ''bar''." (e.g. 1234 is "twelve hundred thirty-four"; 7623 is "seventy-six hundred twenty-three")
*10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;?&nbsp;1 are divided before the 4th-last digit and named "''foo'' [[myriad]] ''bar''". Knuth also introduces at this level a grouping symbol (comma) for the numeral. So, 382,1902 is "three hundred eighty-two myriad nineteen hundred two."
*10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;?&nbsp;1 are divided before the 8th-last digit and named "''foo'' myllion ''bar''", and a semicolon separates the digits. So 1,0002;0003,0004 is "one myriad two myllion, three myriad four."
*10<sup>16</sup> to 10<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;?&nbsp;1 are divided before the 16th-last digit and named "''foo'' byllion ''bar''", and a colon separates the digits. So 12:0003,0004;0506,7089 is "twelve byllion, three myriad four myllion, five hundred six myriad seventy hundred eighty-nine."
*etc.
Each new number name is the square of the previous one — therefore, each new name covers twice as many digits. Knuth continues borrowing the traditional names changing "illion" to "yllion" on each one. 
Abstractly, then, "one <var>n</var>-yllion" is <math>10^{2^{n+2}}</math>. "One trigintyllion" (<math>10^{2^{32}}</math>) would have nearly forty-three myllion (4300 million) digits (by contrast, a conventional "[[trigintillion]]" has merely 94 digits &mdash; not even a hundred, let alone a hundred million, and still 7 digits short of a googol).

WARN  - 2014-11-30 14:42:45.408; org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.SolrWriter; Error creating document : SolrInputDocument(fields: [contents='''Schizoanalysis''' (''schizo-'' from  Greek ''skhizein'' meaning 'to split') is a concept created by philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] and psychoanalyst [[Félix Guattari]] and first expounded in their book ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972). Its formulation was continued in their follow-up work, ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]''. Schizoanalysis acquires many different definitions during the course of its development in their collaborative work and individually in the work of Guattari.

In ''Chaosmosis'', Guattari explains that "rather than moving in the direction of reductionist modifications which simplify the complex," schizoanalysis "will work towards its complexification, its processual enrichment, towards the consistency of its virtual lines of bifurcation and [[differentiation (sociology)|differentiation]], in short towards its ontological [[heterogeneity]]."<ref>Guattari (1992, 61).</ref>

==Evolution of the idea==
Schizoanalysis was developed over a long period of time as a response to the perceived shortcomings in the basic premises of psychoanalytic practice. Guattari was directly confronted with such problems in the work of [[Sigmund Freud]]—namely, the use of the [[Oedipus Complex]] as a starting point for the analysis, and the authoritarian role of the psychoanalyst in relationship to the patient. Guattari was interested in a practice that could derive from given systems of enunciation and preexisting subjective structures new "assemblages [''agencements''] of enunciation" capable of forging new coordinates of analysis and to bring into existence unforeseen propositions and representations.

By the time of "Five Propositions on Psychoanalysis" (1973),<ref>Gilles Deleuze, Desert Islands and Other Texts, 1953–1974, MIT Press, 2004 (pp. 274--280), originally published in "Relazione di Gilles Deleuze" and discussions in Armando Verdiglione, ed., ''Psicanalisi e Politica; Atti del Convegno di studi tenuto a Milano l'8—9 Maggio 1973''. Milan: Feltrinelli, 1973, pp. 7-11, 17-21, 37-40, 44-45, 169-172. Abridged and edited</ref> Deleuze said "we no longer want to talk about schizoanalysis, because that would amount to protecting a particular type of escape, schizophrenic escape."

==Components==
Schizoanalysis can be represented by four circular components that bud and form [[rhizome (metaphor)|rhizomes]]:<ref>Deleuze and Guattari (1980, 160-2).</ref>

# The generative component: the study of concrete mixed [[semiotics]]; their mixtures and variations. Making a tracing of the mixed semiotics.
# The transformational component: the study of pure semiotics; their transformations-translations and the creation of new semiotics. Making the transformational map of the regimes, with their possibilities for translation and creation, for budding along the lines of the tracings.
# The diagrammatic component: the study of abstract machines, from the standpoint of semiotically unformed matters in relation to physically unformed matters. Making the diagram of the abstract machines that are in play in each case, either as potentialities or as effective emergences.
# The machinic component: the study of the assemblages that effectuate abstract machines, simultaneously semiotizing matters of expression and physicalizing matters of content. Outlining the program of the assemblages that distribute everything and bring a circulation of movement with alternatives, jumps, and mutations.

Schizoanalysis is also analysis of "non human sex" on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].<ref>Deleuze and Guattari, [[Anti-Oedipus]] (1972, 351-352 and 381).</ref>

# Anywhere the microscopic [[transsexuality]], which makes women contain man, and man woman, being able to enter each other, in relation to the [[desiring production]] that turns away the statistical order of sex. Making love is not act by one, even two sexes, but an act of a hundred thousand. The schizo-analysis is the veritable analysis of the n sexes in a subject, beyond the anthropomorphic representation that the society imposes this subject with and which it represents its own sexuality. The schizo-analystic desired slogan of the revolution would be all to their own sexes.

Zalta (ed.)</ref> Paternalism can also imply that the behaviour is against or regardless of the will of a person, or also that the behaviour expresses an attitude of superiority.<ref>Shiffrin, Seana. 2000. Paternalism, Unconscionability Doctrine, and Accommodation. ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'' 29(3): 205-250.</ref> 

The word paternalism is from the Latin ''pater'' for father, though paternalism should be distinguished from [[patriarchy]]. Some, such as J.S. Mill, think paternalism to be appropriate towards children: "It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this doctrine is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties. We are not speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood." <ref>Mill, J.S. [1859]/(1991) ‘On Liberty’, published in Gray, John (ed), ''John Stuart Mill: On Liberty and Other Essays'', Oxford: Oxford University Press</ref> Paternalism towards adults is sometimes thought to treat them as if they were children.<ref>Feinberg, Joel. 1986. Harm to Self. Oxford: Oxford University Press. P. 4</ref>

Examples of paternalism include laws requiring the use of motorcycle helmets, a parent forbidding their children to engage in dangerous activities, and a psychiatrist confiscating sharp objects from someone who is suicidally depressed.

==Soft and hard paternalism==
The terms soft and hard are used in two quite different senses in this context. Philosophers, following [[Joel Feinberg|Joel Feinberg's]] influential book ''Harm to Self'' (1986), usually use "soft paternalism" for paternalism towards a person whose action or choice is insufficiently voluntary to be genuinely his or hers. Hard paternalism in this usage means paternalism towards a person whose action or choice is sufficiently voluntary to be genuinely his or hers. Soft paternalism in this usage may also refer to interference with a person aimed to establish whether or not his or her action or choice is sufficiently voluntary. In contrast, economists and lawyers usually use "soft paternalism" for mild paternalism, that is paternalism that is not coercive, or not very "heavy-handed". For example, [[libertarian paternalism]] is soft paternalism in this sense. Hard paternalism in this usage is coercive paternalism.

==Opponents of paternalism==
{{See also|Social engineering (political science)|Nanny state}}

In his [[Two Treatises of Government]], [[John Locke]] argues (against [[Robert Filmer]]) that political and paternal power cannot be identified. [[John Stuart Mill]] opposes state paternalism on the grounds that individuals know their own good better than the state does, that the moral equality of persons demands respect for others' liberty, and that paternalism disrupts the development of an independent character. In ''On Liberty'' he writes:

:the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise, or even right.<ref>Mill, J.S. [1859]/(1991) ‘On Liberty’, published in Gray, John (ed), ''John Stuart Mill: On Liberty and Other Essays'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.14</ref>
:
Contemporary opponents of paternalism often appeal to the ideal of personal [[autonomy]].

The '''Army National Guard''' ('''ARNG'''), in conjunction with the [[Air National Guard]], are the primary United States federal and state military reserve force.  They are simultaneously part of two different organizations, the National Guard of the Several States, Territories and the District of Columbia (also referred to as the Militia of the United States), and the [[National Guard of the United States]].  The Army National Guard is divided into subordinate units stationed in each of the 50 states, three territories and the District of Columbia, and operates under their respective governors.<ref name="Call up">[http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/guardandreserve/a/reservecallup.htm Military Reserves Federal Call Up Authority]</ref>

==Activation==
The Army National Guard as currently authorized and organized operates under [[Title 10 of the United States Code]] when under federal control, and [[Title 32 of the United States Code]] and applicable state laws when under state control.

The Army National Guard may be called up for active duty by the state or territorial governors to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes, as well as [[civil disorder]].<ref name="Call up"/>

The [[District of Columbia Army National Guard]] is a federal militia, controlled by the [[President of the United States]] with authority delegated to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], and through him to the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]].<ref>National Archives and Records Administration, [http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/11485.html Executive Order 11485—Supervision and control of the National Guard of the District of Columbia], October 1, 1969</ref>

The [[President of the United States|President]] may also call up members and units of the Army National Guard, in its status as the militia of the several states, to repel invasion, suppress rebellion, or enforce federal laws.<ref>[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/usc_sec_10_00012406----000-.html 10 USC 12406.

The Army National Guard of the United States is one of two organizations administered by the [[National Guard Bureau]], the other being the [[Air National Guard]] of the United States.  The Director of the Army National Guard is the head of the organization, and reports to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau.

Because the Army National Guard is both the militia of the several states and a federal reserve component of the Army, neither the Chief of the National Guard Bureau nor the Director of the Army National Guard "commands" it.  This function is performed in each state or territory by the [[State Adjutant General]], and in the District of Columbia by the Commanding General of the [[District of Columbia National Guard]] when a unit is in its militia status.  The Chief of the National Guard Bureau and the Director of the Army National Guard serve as the channel of communications between the Department of the Army and the Army National Guard in each state and territory, and administer federal programs, policies, and resources for the National Guard.<ref>Cornell University, legal Information Institute, [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/10503 10 USC § 10503 – Functions of National Guard Bureau: Charter], accessed June 20, 2013</ref>

The General Court required that all able-bodied men between ages 16 and 60, except judges and clergy members, be considered members of the colony's militia, which was organized as the North, South, and East Regiments.

===Early action===
[[File:FairfieldSwampFight.png|150px|left|thumb|18th century depiction of militia at the 1637 battle known as the [[Fairfield Swamp Fight|Great Swamp Fight]].]]

The militia of the Bay Colony, combined with militias from [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] and [[Saybrook Colony|Saybrook]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] allies from the [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] and [[Mohegan people|Mohegan]] tribes fought the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of [[Southern New England]] in the [[Pequot War]] (1634–1638).  This war resulted in hundreds of deaths, hundreds of Native Americans sold into slavery or scattered throughout North America, and the destruction of the Pequots as a group.<ref>Faren R.

The militias of the Southern New England colonies fought Native Americans again in [[King Philip’s War]] from 1675 to 1676.  This conflict led to the decisive defeat of the Narragansets, further straining relationships between Native Americans and white Europeans, but enabling continued white settlement of New England.<ref>Stanley Sandler, editor, [http://books.google.com/books?id=L_xxOM85bD8C&pg=PA912&dq=massachusetts+militia+%22king+philip's+war%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4Bi3UbGiBInO9ASNnYAQ&ved=0CGIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22king%20philip's%20war%22&f=false Ground Warfare: An International Encyclopedia, H-Q], 2002, pages 464–465</ref>

The American colonists maintained their militias in the late 1600s and 1700s, preferring the militia to a standing army as the result of English experience with a standing army when [[Oliver Cromwell]] established a military dictatorship during the [[First English Civil War|English Civil War]].  In addition, the colonists had little interest in paying the taxes to maintain permanent garrisons of British troops.<ref>James A.

The militias were also an early experiment in democracy, with company grade officers often elected by their men, and the higher officers appointed by colonial governors or legislatures.  The colonies did not exert centralized control over the militias or coordinate their efforts.

When tensions escalated between the [[British empire#First British Empire .281583.E2.80.931783.29|British government]] and the American colonists in the 1760s and 1770s, many citizens began organizing, equipping and training private militia units, in order to have bodies of troops that were outside the control of the royal governors.<ref>Lynn Hunt, Thomas R.

Militia members served throughout the Revolution, often near their homes, and frequently for short periods.  Militia units served in combat, as well as carrying out guard duty for prisoners, garrisoning of forts, and local patrols.<ref>Edward Ayres, Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation, [http://www.historyisfun.org/militia-in-the-Revolutionary-war.htm The Role of the Militia During the Revolutionary War], accessed June 12, 2013</ref><ref>Michael D.

Perhaps the most important role played by the militia was off the battlefield, by affecting the course of the political debate.  Militia with Patriot sympathies was well established, particularly in the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]] colonies, causing the [[British Army#Early British Empire|British Army]] to concentrate their forces into larger, more defensible garrisons.  With the countryside in the hands of the Patriot militia, neutrals or [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] gradually either fled to British garrisons (and from there, often to [[Canada]]) or became more accepting of the Patriot goal of independence from [[Great Britain]].<ref>Bulliet, Crossley, Headrick, Hirsch, Johnson, Northrup, editors, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZeKrnoUTQOoC&pg=PA645&dq=american+revolution+patriot+militias+control+countryside&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mhDDUd2wPI7l4AOsn4DoAw&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=american%20revolution%20patriot%20militias%20control%20countryside&f=false The Earth and its Peoples A Global History], Volume II, 2008, page 645</ref><ref>Robert Bothwell, [http://books.google.com/books?id=jyIF8KOWbVQC&pg=PA31&dq=american+revolution+loyalists+fled+british+garrisons+canada&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YhHDUczKIa-24AO57YDoDA&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=american%20revolution%20loyalists%20fled%20british%20garrisons%20canada&f=false A Traveller's History of Canada], 2001, page 31</ref><ref>Stanley J.

===Post Revolutionary War===
During the period of the [[Articles of Confederation]], the weak federal government reduced the [[Continental Army]] to a handful of officers and soldiers.  The Articles of Confederation required each state to maintain a militia, and allowed the [[Congress of the Confederation|Confederation Congress]] to form a standing army only with the consent of nine of the thirteen states.  Such consent was not forthcoming in an era when the population still harbored a distrust of a standing army, so Congress largely left the defense of the new nation to the state militias.<ref>Keith L. Dougherty, [http://books.google.com/books?id=z4pv3243BZcC&pg=PA31&dq=%22articles+of+confederation%22+army+nine+of+thirteen+states&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Iia3UZGUC4XU9gTlu4CIBw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22articles%20of%20confederation%22%20army%20nine%20of%20thirteen%20states&f=false Collective Action Under the Articles of Confederation], 2006, page 31</ref>

===Constitutional Convention===
During the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] delegates argued for a powerful federal government, including federal control of the militia.  Federalists anticipated using the military to defend the country if it were attacked, and to enforce federal laws when required.<ref>Gordon S. Wood, [http://books.google.com/books?id=AWI8fmyhN5IC&pg=PA111&dq=%22constitutional+convention%22+federalists+standing+army&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lya3UbDHGIvc9QSF24CQAg&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22constitutional%20convention%22%20federalists%20standing%20army&f=false Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789–1815], 2009, page 111</ref>

[[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]] advocated limited federal government, and wanted continued state control over the militias.  Anti-Federalists based their arguments on three points.  First, the militia could be available to the federal government to resist foreign invasions. Second, the militia served as a police force in each state, enabling it to maintain order and respect for the law.  Third, once the new federal government replaced the one under the Articles of Confederation, the militia would be the last defense of the states in the event that a standing army raised by the federal government was employed against the states.<ref>Jack P. Greene, J. R. Pole, editors, [http://books.google.com/books?id=xK1NuzpAcH8C&pg=PA386&dq=%22constitutional+convention%22+anti-federalists+standing+army&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7Se3UYrnIpHI9gSz9oCwBQ&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22constitutional%20convention%22%20anti-federalists%20standing%20army&f=false  A Companion to the American Revolution], 2008, pages 385–386</ref>

The compromise agreed to by both sides satisfied Anti-Federalists because there was no standing Army, and the militias remained the responsibility of the states, especially the appointment of officers.  It satisfied the Federalists because it provided that the militia could be federalized when circumstances required it.<ref>Christopher Patrick Gibson, [http://books.google.com/books?id=sXat2yg9KooC&pg=PA90&dq=federalist+anti-federalist+compromise+militia+army&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Viy3UeTOKI6e9QTbkIGABg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=federalist%20anti-federalist%20compromise%20militia%20army&f=false Securing the State: Reforming the National Security Decisionmaking Process], 2008, page 90</ref>

===Militia Acts of 1792===
[[File:WhiskeyRebellion.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Washington reviews regular Army and militia troops at Ft. Cumberland, Maryland before marching to suppress Whiskey Rebellion]]
 
The compromise between Federalists and Anti-federalists proved short-lived.  In 1791 [[Arthur St. Clair]] suffered a major defeat in the [[St. Clair's Defeat|Battle of the Wabash]] while fighting [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] in the [[Northwest Territory]].  In response, Congress authorized the expansion of the Army, and allowed for the President to call up the state militias on his own authority if circumstances required it when Congress was not in session.<ref>Spencer C. Tucker, [http://books.google.com/books?id=TO2mx314ST0C&pg=PA412&dq=militia+acts+of+1792+st.+clair's+defeat&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ni63UciyD47o8wTF1oCwDA&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=militia%20acts%20of%201792%20st.%20clair's%20defeat&f=false Almanac of American Military History], 2012, page 412</ref>

The First [[Militia Acts of 1792|Militia Act of 1792]] allowed the President to call up the militias in the event of a foreign invasion, in response to attacks by American Indians, and when required for the enforcement of federal law.<ref>Robert W. Coakley, [http://books.google.com/books?id=SMmJsJLKmvoC&pg=PA22&dq=first+militia+act+of+1792+president+call+militia&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sC63UdqqL5Pw8ASP24DoAg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=first%20militia%20act%20of%201792%20president%20call%20militia&f=false The Role of Federal Military Forces in Domestic Disorders, 1789–1878], 1996, pages 19–20</ref>

The Second Militia Act of 1792 formalized the organization and training requirements of the state militias.  It mandated that the militia consisted of every "free able-bodied white male citizen" between ages 18 and 45, organized as members of a local unit. (A later change expanded eligibility to all men between 18 and 54, regardless of race.)  Some occupations were exempt, including [[stagecoach]] drivers and [[ferry]] operators, who would be expected to support the militia by facilitating the transport of soldiers, supplies and equipment in the event of a mobilization.  There were also religious exemptions for [[Quakers]] and other denominations that advocated nonviolence.<ref>Carl Benn, Daniel Marston, Fred Anderson, [http://books.google.com/books?id=fLfiYpwQY4gC&pg=PA187&dq=second+militia+act+of+1792+ages+18+45&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Uy-3UauBGIfe8ATHm4DYCw&ved=0CEwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=second%20militia%20act%20of%201792%20ages%2018%2045&f=false Liberty Or Death: Wars That Forged a Nation], 2006, pages 187–188</ref><ref>South Carolina Historical Society, [http://books.google.com/books?ei=1S-3UcLwG4_89gS-hoCgAg&id=RboaAQAAMAAJ&dq=second+militia+act+of+1792+exemptions&q=exemptions South Carolina Historical Magazine], Volumes 68–69, 1967, page 27</ref>

Militia units were required to report for training twice a year, usually in early summer (after Spring planting) and late Fall (after the autumn harvest but before snow fell).  Militia members were required to outfit themselves and report for training or mobilization with a musket or rifle, bayonet, flints, cartridge box, bullets or musket balls, haversack or knapsack, and powder horn and gunpowder.<ref>Carl Edward Skeen, [http://books.google.com/books?id=aDHBSYXazMcC&pg=PA135&dq=militia+acts+of+1792&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gS23UcSaH47M9gTviIC4DQ&ved=0CDMQ6AEwATge#v=onepage&q=militia%20acts%20of%201792&f=false 1816: America Rising], 2003, page 135</ref>

State legislatures were authorized to organize local units into divisions, regiments and subordinate commands, and federalized militia members were made subject to court martial proceedings for disobeying orders and other offenses.<ref>South Carolina State Legislature, [http://books.google.com/books?id=kz4fSAk2nvIC&pg=PA35&dq=militia+act+of+1792+legislatures+organize+divisions+regiments+militia&hl=en&sa=X&ei=azC3UdCjJYKC9QTsoIG4BA&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=militia%20act%20of%201792%20legislatures%20organize%20divisions%20regiments%20militia&f=false The Militia System of South Carolina], 1838, pages 35 to 40</ref>

Part of this reorganization included removing state governors as commanders with military rank (Captain General), and the creation of the [[state Adjutant General]].  The Adjutant General reported directly to the governor and served as commander of the state militia.<ref>Michael D. Doubler, [http://books.google.com/books?id=pNHbw5H07P4C&pg=PA49&dq=militia+creation+position+state+%22adjutant+general%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=THK3UaXaBtWp4APaj4HwCg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=militia%20creation%20position%20state%20%22adjutant%20general%22&f=false The National Guard and Reserve: A Reference Handbook], 2008, page 21</ref>  States were slow to respond, and some did not begin appointing Adjutants General until after the War of 1812.

President George Washington used the authority of the Second Act in 1794 to call up the militia in response to the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].  He did so shortly before that provision of the Second Act was about to expire.  Recognizing that the authority might be needed again in the future, Congress responded by passing the Militia Act of 1795, which made permanent the President's ability to call up the militia on his own authority if Congress was not in session.<ref>James C.

The use of the militia in the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] made clear that at that point, militias were not well organized, effectively trained, or capably led.

{{Main|War of 1812}}

At the start of the [[War of 1812]] the regular army totaled less than 12,000 soldiers.  Congress authorized expanding the army to 35,000, but recruiting was only moderately successful because of poor pay and a lack of trained leaders.<ref>David Stephen Heidler, Jeanne T. Heidler, [http://books.google.com/books?id=qSeq9DABuAUC&pg=PA45&dq=army+war+1812+12,000&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EHO3UfzMHu-34AOBiYDACQ&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=army%20war%201812%2012%2C000&f=false  The War of 1812], 2002, page 45</ref>  In addition, war with England was less popular in some areas of the country than others, which made it difficult to convince men to enlist.  For example, in [[Vermont]] residents saw little need to fight the British in the dominion of Canada, which was a profitable trading partner.<ref>David Stephen Heidler, Jeanne T. Heidler, editors, [http://books.google.com/books?id=_c09EJgek50C&pg=PA535&dq=vermont+oppose+%22war+of+1812%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cnO3UdWQELGz4AOtvoCoCw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=vermont%20oppose%20%22war%20of%201812%22&f=false  Encyclopedia of the War of 1812], 2004, pages 534–535</ref>

Both regular and hastily organized militias took part in battles throughout the war, with mixed results.  For example, the militia fled during the [[Battle of Bladensburg]], giving rise to the description of the event as the "Bladensburg races."<ref>Jeremy Black, [http://books.google.com/books?id=PxqYlkRbMOQC&pg=PA116&dq=militia+bladensburg+races+%22war+of+1812%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r3W3Ud-xGavC4APPmIGoBA&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=militia%20bladensburg%20races%20%22war%20of%201812%22&f=false War in the Modern World Since 1815], 2003, page 116</ref>  On the other hand, less than three weeks later the Maryland militia won a strategic victory at the [[Battle of North Point]].<ref>Michael D.

In some cases militia members objected to serving outside their home states, arguing that since they were responsible to their state governors and not the federal government, they were not required to serve in other states or take part in invasions.<ref>Diane Smolinski, Henry Smolinski, [http://books.google.com/books?id=dMHQWn4ef4EC&pg=PA13&dq=militia+refuse+participate+invasion+%22war+of+1812%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=I3S3UfaBOK384AP4soHIDw&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=militia%20&f=false  Battles of the War of 1812], 2003, page 13</ref>  Also, some state governors attempted to prevent their militias from being federalized, since they did not support the war.<ref>David Stephen Heidler, Jeanne T. Heidler, editors, [http://books.google.com/books?id=_c09EJgek50C&pg=PA349&dq=governors+prevent+militia+mobilize+war+1812&hl=en&sa=X&ei=xGQXUq-SEJW44APc_4D4Cw&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=governors%20prevent%20militia%20mobilize%20war%201812&f=false Encyclopedia of the War of 1812], 2004, page 349</ref>  (The 1827 decision in the case of Martin v. Mott determined that governors could not interfere with the president's authority to call upon the militia to execute federal law, suppress insurrection and repel invasion.  Jacob Mott, a New York militia member, refused [[James Madison]]'s order to mobilize and refused to pay the fine levied by a subsequent court-martial.  Martin, a [[United States Marshal]], then seized Mott's property.  Mott sued to recover his property and won in state court.  Martin then took the case to the [[United States Supreme Court]] and prevailed.)<ref>Kermit L. Hall, James W. Ely, Joel B. Grossman

One result of the uneven performance of the militia, the lingering uncertainty over the willingness of militia troops to fight for causes that were unpopular locally, and the unresolved question of state versus federal control of the militia, was that the federal government was wary of attempting to federalize the militia during future conflicts.

===Post War of 1812===
[[File:Kent Il Kellogg's Grove3.JPG|125px|left|thumb|Graves of militia members who died at [[Kellogg's Grove]] during the Black Hawk War.]]
In the wake of the War of 1812, the federal government attempted to standardize training and laws governing call up and mobilization for militia organizations throughout the United States.

These efforts to reenergize the militia lapsed as the result of the long period of relative peace that followed the War of 1812.  (The [[Era of Good Feelings]].)   The number of occupations exempt from membership increased, and annual muster days became more picnic and parade than military formation.  These factors, coupled with a lack of military leaders with training and experience, led to a gradual decline of the militia.<ref>Carl Edward Skeen, [http://books.google.com/books?id=bBFn7PAjjokC&pg=PA175&lpg=PA175&dq=militia+decline+%22war+of+1812%22&source=bl&ots=pOH9KircmS&sig=189XBAObJupwCJJlSIJpdbeDRkM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=d3G3UZjCHsW64AP8iIHYAg&ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA# Citizen Soldiers in the War of 1812], 1999, page 178</ref>

Despite this decline, the militia was still called to action on occasion, including the [[Black Hawk War]] of 1832.<ref>James Lewis, Ph.D., Northern Illinois University, Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project, [http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/blackhawk/page2a.html The Black Hawk War of 1832], 2000</ref>

===Origin of the term “National Guard”===
[[File:Lafayette and the Naming of the National Guard.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Lafayette and the Naming of the National Guard, New York City, July 14, 1825.  National Guard Heritage Series painting by Ken Riley.]]The first use of the term “National Guard” by American militia units dates from [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette's]] 1824–1825 tour of the United States.  The 2nd Battalion of the 11th New York Artillery – which later became New York’s famed [[7th New York Militia|7th Regiment]] – was one the units that welcomed Lafayette to New York City, and it adopted the title "National Guard" in honor of Lafayette's service as commander of the [[National Guard (France)|Garde Nationale de Paris]] during the [[French Revolution]].  During a review of militia units Lafayette took note of the term, and as it grew in popularity it was adopted by many militia units in the years that followed.<ref>Potter's American Monthly, [http://books.google.com/books?id=n839hSdO2_AC&pg=PA468&dq=origin+term+national+guard+lafayette&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mmsXUvM2rrXgA5yhgbAL&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=origin%20term%20national%20guard%20lafayette&f=false The Seventh Regiment, National Guard], Volume 3, October 1874, pages 467–468</ref>

===Mexican-American War===
[[File:Chapultepec1.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Artist rendition of Battle Chapultepec.  Militia veteran and volunteer officer Truman B. Ransom died in attack while commanding his regiment.]]
{{Main|Mexican-American War}}

In the United States in the mid-1840s, war with [[Mexico]] had the support of [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and their allies in the north, who were anxious to annex [[Texas]] and gain states that would permit [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], while [[Union (American Civil War)|Northern]] [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] and anti-slavery Democrats generally opposed the war because they did not support the extension of slavery.<ref>Peter P.

The regular Army did not consider militia members to be reliable, and the issue of whether militia units could be employed outside the United States had not been resolved.  As a result, Congress expanded the Army by authorizing the creation of ten regiments and the recruiting of 50,000 "volunteers"—individuals who were not in the regular Army and were not militia members subject to state control.<ref>Spencer C.

===American Civil War===
[[File:Alonzo Jackman.jpg|120px|right|thumb|[[Alonzo Jackman]], [[Vermont]] and [[New Hampshire]] drillmaster commanded militia on [[Canada–United States border|Vermont border]] after [[St. Albans Raid|Confederate Raid]] on [[St. Albans (town), Vermont|St. Albans]].]]

Both the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] made use of their militias during the [[American Civil War]].

President Lincoln [[President Lincoln's 75,000 Volunteers|summoned 75,000 militia]] on April 15, 1861 to suppress the insurrection, a call which was limited by law to 90 days and which was rejected by several slaveholding states which had not seceded.  In May 1861, Lincoln put out a call for more militia as well as volunteers who would be willing to serve for three years.  The Union's July 1861 advance on Manassas, which resulted in defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] was due in large part to the fast-approaching expiration of the initial 90-day militia call-up—the Lincoln administration and Union Army leaders wanted to employ them before they mustered out.  The resulting Union loss occurred at the hands of a Confederate force which was also principally composed of militia.<ref>Andrew Cunningham McLaughlin, Albert Bushnell Hart, editors, [http://books.google.com/books?id=OiE6AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA440&dq=lincoln+summon+75,000+militia&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BHYXUoqDOMeo4APOi4GgCA&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=lincoln%20summon%2075%2C000%20militia&f=false Cyclopedia of American Government], Volume 2, 1914, page 440</ref><ref>John George Nicolay, [http://books.google.com/books?id=j6OFiUdCIK8C&pg=PA272&dq=militia+term+expire+first+bull+run&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fXYXUqjwKdej4AP5i4DACg&ved=0CFwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=militia%20term%20expire%20first%20bull%20run&f=false A Short Life of Abraham Lincoln], Volume 1, 2008, pages 272–273</ref><ref>William Corby, [http://books.google.com/books?id=kXgfAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA18&dq=militia+term+expire+first+bull+run&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fXYXUqjwKdej4AP5i4DACg&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=militia%20term%20expire%20first%20bull%20run&f=false Memoirs of Chaplain Life], 1893, pages 17–18</ref><ref>Bill Fawcett, [http://books.google.com/books?id=d5HbAUSePGwC&pg=PA19&dq=militia+confederate+first+bull+run&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hHcXUsHBIc_D4APGtYC4Dw&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=militia%20confederate%20first%20bull%20run&f=false How to Lose the Civil War: Military Mistakes of the War Between the States], 2011, page 19</ref>

The Union used a version of the Mexican-American War-era volunteer system to expand the size of the [[Union Army]] while avoiding the restrictions on how long the militia could be employed.  Many militia units were enlisted en masse, and many individuals who enlisted or received commissions in the Union Army were militia veterans.<ref>Duane E.

In the [[Spanish-American War]], the U.S. government again used the volunteer concept to expand the Army without directly addressing the question of when militia could be federalized.  As had happened previously, there were militia units that volunteered and were enlisted en masse, as well as individual militia members who joined volunteer units.  Examples of the units that volunteered as a group include the [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|69th New York Infantry]] and the [[71st Infantry Regiment (New York)|71st New York Infantry]].<ref>New York Adjutant General, [http://books.google.com/books?id=v68-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA655&dq=%22national+guard%22+%22spanish-american+war%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2-i5UfuXMdWl4APzvoCACg&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw# New York in the Spanish-American War 1898], 1900, Volume 3, page 1</ref><ref>New York State Military Museum, [http://dmna.ny.gov/historic/reghist/spanAm/infantry/71stInf/71stInfMain.htm 71st Regiment Infantry, New York Volunteers, Spanish-American War], 2011</ref>

===The Dick Act===
[[File:Senator Charles Dick of Ohio, 1858-1945 (cropped).jpg|120px|left|thumb|Charles Dick, sponsor of Militia Act of 1903.]]
{{Main|Militia Act of 1903}}

The official founding of the modern Army National Guard is often credited to passage of the [[Militia Act of 1903]], which established a pattern that would continue throughout the 20th century of providing increasing federal resources and wartime relevance of the militia in return for increasing federal controls over their arming, organization and training.  Also called the Dick Act, for sponsor [[Charles W. F. Dick]], The 1903 law updated the Militia Act of 1792, though it left unresolved the key question of how to compel service of the militia outside the borders of the United States, which did not fall under the Constitutionally permitted uses of the militia "to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrection and repel invasions."<ref>Janice E. McKenney, [http://books.google.com/books?id=xfGGwoL-E4wC&pg=PA105&dq=militia+act+of+1903+charles+dick&hl=en&sa=X&ei=kGW3UbnVH_Wl4AO71IC4Bw&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=militia%20act%20of%201903%20charles%20dick&f=false The organizational history of field artillery 1775–2003], 2007, page 105</ref>

This fundamental restriction on the use of the militia had been an unresolved dilemma for military planners since the War of 1812.  This uncertainty led the federal government to bypass the state militias in favor of creating volunteer armies, as was done for the Mexican-American War, the Union Army of the American Civil War, and the U.S. forces raised for the Spanish-American War – though in each of these cases, the volunteer forces raised came largely from already existing militia companies.  While the Dick Act did not compel the militia to serve overseas, the expectation was that the increase in federal funding and training would spur increased volunteerism by militia members in the event of a war.

The Dick Act provided that states which wished to receive federal funding for their militia units had to organize their units according to standards dictated by the regular Army, and that National Guard members would have to meet the same training, education and readiness standards as their regular Army counterparts.  In exchange, the federal government provided states with funding and equipment to enable militia reorganization and modernization, as well as training by regular Army officers should a governor request it.  The Dick Act required that all members of National Guard units attend 24 four-hour drill periods during the course of each year (which were not paid for by the federal government) as well as 5 days of training at summer encampments (for which the federal government provided pay at the same rate as for soldiers in the regular Army).<ref>Jerold E.

===National Defense Act of 1916===
Passed as part of the [[Preparedness Movement]] during and after the Villa expedition and before U.S. entry into [[World War I]], the 1916 law named the state militias as the Army's primary reserve.  The law also created a mechanism for involuntary mobilization of the National Guard for service outside the borders of the U.S. by stating that members of the militia would be drafted en masse into the Army in the event of an emergency, thus severing their tie to the states and the restrictions placed on usage of state militia.  Officers and men were also required to swear an oath to serve both state and federal authorities.  In addition, the law made mandatory the use of the term "National Guard" to describe the organized militia, and provided funding to pay members for attending drill.  The act also increased the number of weekend or weeknight drills from 24 to 48 per year, and increased the annual training period from five days to 15.  Federal funding of all aspects of the National Guard expanded dramatically as a result of this legislation, with the federal government taking over all arming, equipping and training expenses associated with the Guard, sharing only administrative and armory costs with the states.  Prior to 1916, the states in aggregate spent more on the militia than the federal government.  Since 1916, federal expenditures have far outpaced those of the states.<ref>Barry M.

The 1916 Act also reorganized the Division of Militia Affairs within the Army as the Militia Bureau, removing it from the General Staff and elevating it to a position directly under the Secretary of War.

===National Defense Act of 1933===
The National Defense Act of 1933 provided that the National Guard is considered a component of the Army at all times.  Beginning with this law, each National Guard member has two military statuses—a member of the National Guard of his or her state, or a member of the [[National Guard of the United States]] when ordered into active duty.  This enhanced the 1916 Act's mobilization provisions, making it possible to deploy National Guard units and individual members directly for overseas service in the event of a war, without having to draft them first.<ref>Jeffrey A.

In August 1940, the National Guard was ordered to federal service for 12 months in anticipation of U.S, entry into [[World War II]].  More than 400,000 National Guardsmen were called up as parts of divisions or in non-divisional units, immediately doubling the size of the Army.  18 Army divisions, 80 separate regiments, and 29 Army Air Force flying squadrons were mobilized from National Guard organizations beginning in September 1940.<ref>John B.

The [[National Security Act of 1947]] created the position of [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] and the [[United States Department of Defense]].  In addition it replaced the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] with the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]].

The fielding of the Air National Guard also caused the creation of two new positions within the National Guard Bureau, the Director of the Army National Guard and Director of the Air National Guard, who each reported to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau.<ref>W.A.R.

By the end of the war, approximately 700 Army National Guard units had been mobilized, as had thousands of individual volunteers and soldiers involuntarily called to active duty because they had critical skills.  Approximately 139,000 Army Guardsmen served during this conflict.<ref>New Jersey National Guard, [http://www.state.nj.us/military/korea/factsheets.pdf Fact sheet, Korean War], page 1, accessed June 13, 2013</ref>

In 1959 it was decided to realign National Guard and Army Reserve divisions under the [[Pentomic]] structures. A controversy immediately surfaced over the required number of divisions. Secretary of Defense [[Neil H. McElroy]] decided on 27 National Guard formations. By September 1959 the twenty-one infantry and six armored divisions in the Guard had reorganized. Non-divisional regimental combat teams were eliminated and replaced with separate combined arms brigades. Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Arizona organized the [[29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States)|29th]], [[92nd Infantry Brigade (United States)|92nd]] and [[158th Infantry Regiment (United States)|258th]] Infantry Brigades.

In the 1962-63 [[Reorganization Objective Army Division]] reorganization, the 34th, 35th, [[43rd Infantry Division (United States)|43rd]], and [[51st Infantry Division (United States)|51st]] Infantry Divisions, multi-state National Guard formations, dropped out of the force.<ref>Maneuver and Firepower, 312, 314.</ref> They were in part replaced by the [[67th Infantry Brigade (United States)|67th]] (Nebraska and Iowa), 69th (Kansas and Missouri), 86th (Vermont and Connecticut), and 53rd (Florida and South Carolina) Infantry Brigades. Each brigade fielded five maneuver battalions or squadrons. The following year, to increase flexibility, the 53rd and 86th Infantry Brigades were converted to armored brigades, and the 67th Infantry Brigade was reorganized as mechanized infantry. The 53rd and 67th retained their five maneuver elements, but the 86th lost one battalion.

===Post Vietnam War===
[[File:GEN Creighton W Abrams.JPG|115px|left|thumb|Creighton Abrams proposed "Abrams Doctrine."]]
The Army's experience with not having fully used the National Guard during the Vietnam War led to the creation of the 1973 [[Total force policy#History|Total Force Policy]].  With the Vietnam War draft having been ended in favor of an all volunteer military, the Total Force Policy required all active and reserve military organizations to be treated as a single integrated force.  Following the experience of fighting in Vietnam without widespread popular support, the TFP was designed to involve the American public in military actions by mobilizing the National Guard from its thousands of locations throughout the United States.<ref>Richard Winship Stewart, editor, [http://books.google.com/books?id=hFhXTptp55sC&pg=PA375&dq=total+force+policy+1973&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7Ai6UeveIZO69gSwxoH4CQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=total%20force%20policy%201973&f=false American Military History: The United States Army in a Global Era, 1917–2003], 2005, pages 376–377</ref>

In 1974 the "Abrams Doctrine" further expanded the TFP.  [[Creighton Abrams]], who had become commander of [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] in 1968, became [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] in 1972.  Having seen the effects of President Johnson's decision to use the draft rather than calling on the National Guard and Reserve in large numbers, Abrams stated that the U.S. should never again go to war without calling up the Guard and Reserve.<ref>John T. Correll, [http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2011/February%202011/0211force.aspx Origins of the Total Force], Air Force Magazine, February, 2011</ref>

===Late 20th century===
[[File:Gun 1, Battery A, 2-142nd Field Artillery, Operation Desert Storm.jpg|115px|right|thumb|2–142nd Field Artillery (Arkansas), Desert Storm, 1991.]]
For much of the final decades of the twentieth century, National Guard personnel typically served "[[One weekend a month, two weeks a year]]", with a portion working for the Guard in a full-time capacity as members of the [[Active Guard Reserve]] (AGR) or as dual status [[United States federal civil service|federal technicians]].  (Dual status technicians are traditional National Guard members who are federal civilian employees during the regular work week, and work in uniform.)

As part of the [[Reagan Era]] defense build up, the National Guard began to transform from a strategic reserve to an operational one.  This included modernization of equipment and weapons, more intensive training during drill and annual training periods, and increased overseas training opportunities.<ref>Associated Press, Waycross Journal-Herald, [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FFNaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jUwNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3878,3359302&dq=national-guard+new+equipment&hl=en Georgia Guard Given Modern Battle Tanks], July 29, 1982</ref><ref>Milwaukee Journal, [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bm0aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_ikEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3915,370420&dq=national-guard+modernize&hl=en Aspin Proposes Changes to Strengthen Reserves], March 1, 1984</ref><ref>United Press International, The Bryan Times, [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W7lPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nlEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4985,7552847&dq=national-guard+modernize&hl=en National Guard Has Outmoded Equipment], March 23, 1985</ref><ref>Norman Black, Associated Press, Lakeland Ledger, [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xvAvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=A_wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2572,61350&dq=national-guard+modernize&hl=en Regular Army Still Not Quite Ready to Accept New Guard as its Equal], October 16, 1988</ref>

In the late 1980s several state governors unsuccessfully challenged the authority of the President to federalize the National Guard in their states without their consent.  [[Governor of Minnesota|Governor]] [[Rudy Perpich]] and others objected to the National Guard bring deployed to [[Central America]] during the political debate over whether the United States should be involved in the attempted overthrow of the [[Sandanista#Sandinista rule .281979.E2.80.931990.29|Sandanista government]] of [[Nicaragua]].<ref>Paul Glickman, Christian Science Monitor, [http://www.csmonitor.com/1987/0209/aguard-f.html President's New Control Over National Guard is Challenged], February 9, 1987</ref><ref>David Evans, Chicago Tribune, [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-12/news/9002170920_1_montgomery-amendment-guard-members-minnesota-national-guard Supreme Court Confirms U.S. Control Over Guard], June 12, 1990</ref>

In the first major test of the Total Force Policy, several Army National Guard units were activated for the 1991 [[Gulf War]], mostly combat support and combat service support organizations.  Though there was controversy over the Army's decision not to deploy the "roundout brigades" of three divisions (the [[48th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States)|48th Infantry Brigade]], [[155th Brigade Combat Team (United States)|155th Armored Brigade]], and [[256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States)|256th Infantry Brigade]]) once they completed their mobilization training,<ref>Associated Press, Reading Eagle, [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bSEyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uOUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3207,4196984&dq=national-guard+brigades+256th+155th+48th&hl=en Mobilizing Delays Assailed], March 8, 1991</ref> other Army National Guard units were activated, served in Southwest Asia, and performed well.

Father '''Louis Hennepin''', [[O.F.M.]] baptized '''Antoine''', (12 May 1626&nbsp;– [[Circa|c.]] 1705) was a [[Catholic priest]] and [[missionary]] of the [[Franciscan]] [[Recollets|Recollect order]] (French: ''Récollets'') and an [[explorer]] of the interior of [[North America]].

Hennepin was born in [[Ath]] in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (now in the province of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]], [[Belgium]]).  In 1659 [[Béthune]], the town where he lived, was captured by the army of [[Louis XIV of France]].
[[Image:Father Hennepin at the Falls of St. Anthony.jpg|thumb|left|Painting by [[Douglas Volk]], of Father Louis Hennepin discovering [[Saint Anthony Falls]].]] 

At the request of Louis XIV the Récollets sent four missionaries to [[New France]] in May 1675, including Hennepin, accompanied by [[René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle]]. In 1678, Hennepin was ordered by his provincial superior to accompany La Salle on an expedition to explore the western part of New France. Hennepin was 39 when he departed in 1679 with La Salle from [[Quebec City]] to construct the 45-ton barque [[Le Griffon]], sail through the [[Great Lakes]], and explore the unknown West. 

Hennepin was with La Salle at the construction of ''Fort Crevecouer'' (near present-day [[Peoria, Illinois]]) in January, 1680. In February, La Salle sent Hennepin and two others as an advance party to search for the [[Mississippi River]]. The party followed the Illinois River to its junction with the Mississippi. Shortly thereafter, Hennepin was captured by a [[Sioux]] war party and carried off for a time into what is now the state of [[Minnesota]].<ref>Shea, John Gilmary.

New York: John G Shea, 1880</ref> In September, Hennepin and the others were given canoes and allowed to leave, eventually returning to Quebec. Hennepin returned to France and was never allowed by his order to return to [[North America]].<ref>[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hennepin_louis_2E.html Dictionary of Canadian Biography]</ref>

Local historians credit the Franciscan Récollect friar as the first European to step ashore at the site of present-day [[Hannibal, Missouri]].<ref>National Geographic Magazine, July-1956, Vol CX-Number 1, pg 135-136</ref>

Two great [[waterfall]]s were brought to the world's attention by Louis Hennepin: [[Niagara Falls]], with the most voluminous flow of any in North America, and the [[Saint Anthony Falls]] in what is now [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], the only waterfall on the [[Mississippi River]]. In 1683, he published a book about Niagara Falls called ''A New Discovery''.

[[File:Guillaume-du-Vair.jpg|right|thumb|Guillaume du Vair]]
'''Guillaume du Vair''' (7 March 1556 &ndash; 3 August 1621) was a French author and lawyer.

He was born in Paris. After taking [[holy orders#Roman Catholicism|holy orders]], he exercised only legal functions for most of his career.  However, from 1617 till his death he was [[Bishop of Lisieux]]. His reputation is that of a lawyer, a [[wikt:statesman|statesman]] and a man of letters. In 1584, he became counsellor of the ''[[parlement]]'' of Paris, and as deputy for Paris to the Estates of the League he pronounced his most famous politico-legal discourse, an argument nominally for the [[Salic law]], but in reality directed against the alienation of the crown of France to the Spanish [[infanta]], which was advocated by the extreme Leaguers. King [[Henry IV of France]] acknowledged his services by entrusting him with a special commission as magistrate at [[Marseille]], and made him master of requests.

In 1595, Vair published his treatise ''De l'éloquence française et des raisons pour quoi elle est demeurée si basse'', in which he criticizes the orators of his day, adding examples from the speeches of ancient orators, in translations which reproduce the spirit of the originals. He was sent to England in 1596 with the [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, vicomte de Turenne, duc de Bouillon|marshal de Bouillon]] to negotiate a league against Spain; in 1599 he became first president of the ''parlement'' of [[Provence]] ([[Aix-en-Provence]]); and in 1603 was appointed to the [[see of Marseille]], which he soon resigned in order to resume the presidency. In 1616 he received the highest promotion open to a French lawyer and became [[keeper of the seals]]. He died at Tonneins ([[Lot-et-Garonne]]).

Both as speaker and writer he was highly regarded. Like other political lawyers of the time, Du Vair studied philosophy. The most famous of his treatises are ''La Philosophie morale des Stoiques'', translated into English (1664) by [[Charles Cotton]]; ''De la constance et consolation ès calamités publiques'', which was composed during the [[siege of Paris (1590)|siege of Paris]] in 1589, and applied the [[stoicism|Stoic doctrine]] to present misfortunes; and ''La Sainte Philosophie'', in which religion and philosophy are intimately connected.

[[Pierre Charron]] drew freely on these and other works of Du Vair. [[Ferdinand Brunetière]] points out the analogy of Du Vair's position with that afterwards developed by [[Blaise Pascal]], and sees in him the ancestor of [[Jansenism]]. Du Vair had a great indirect influence on the development of style in French, for in the south of France he made the acquaintance of [[François de Malherbe]], who conceived a great admiration for Du Vair's writings. The reformer of French poetry learned much from the treatise ''De l'éloquence française'', to which the counsels of his friend were no doubt added.

Du Vair died at [[Tonneins]], and his works were published in folio at Paris in 1641.

'''Kulintang''' is a modern term for an ancient instrumental form of music composed on a row of small, horizontally laid [[gong]]s that function melodically, accompanied by larger, suspended gongs and [[drum]]s. As part of the larger [[gong-chime]] culture of [[Southeast Asia]], kulintang music ensembles have been playing for many centuries in regions of the Eastern [[Malay Archipelago]]—the Southern [[Philippines]], Eastern [[Indonesia]], [[East Malaysia|Eastern Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and [[Timor]],<ref name=Amin >{{cite web

}}</ref> although this article has a focus on the Philippine Kulintang traditions of the [[Maranao]] and [[Maguindanao]] peoples in particular. Kulintang evolved from a simple native signaling tradition, and developed into its present form with the incorporation of knobbed gongs from [[Sundanese people|Sunda]].<ref name=Cadar3/> Its importance stems from its association with the indigenous cultures that inhabited these islands prior to the influences of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] or [[Western world|the West]], making Kulintang the most developed tradition of Southeast Asian archaic [[gong-chime]] ensembles.

Technically, ''kulintang'' is the [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanao]], [[Ternate]] and Timor term for the [[idiophone]] of metal gong kettles which are laid horizontally upon a rack to create an entire kulintang set.<ref name=Benitez>Benitez, Kristina. The Maguindanaon Kulintang: Musical Innovation, Transformation and the Concept of Binalig. Ann Harbor, MI: University of Michigan, 2005.</ref> It is played by striking the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters. Due to its use across a wide variety groups and languages, the ''kulintang'' is also called ''kolintang'' by the [[Maranao]] and those in [[Sulawesi]], ''kulintangan'', ''gulintangan'' by those in [[Sabah]] and the [[Sulu Archipelago]] and ''totobuang'' by those in central [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].<ref name=Cadar1>Cadar, Usopay H.. "The Role of Kolintang Music in Maranao Society." ''Asian Music'' Vol. 27, No. 2. (Spring - Summer, 1996), pp. 80-103.</ref>

By the twentieth century, the term ''kulintang'' had also come to denote an entire Maguindanao ensemble of five to six instruments.<ref name=Cadar2>Cadar, Usopay Hamdag. "Maranao Kolintang Music and Its Journey in America." ''Asian Music'' 27(1996): 131-146.</ref> Traditionally the Maguindanao term for the entire ensemble is ''basalen'' or ''palabunibunyan'', the latter term meaning “an ensemble of loud instruments” or “music-making” or in this case “music-making using a kulintang.”<ref name=Aga2>{{cite web

[[Image:Gong and Chime Culture Map.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Map of kulintang music in [[Southeast Asia]].]]

Kulintang belongs to the larger unit/stratum of “knobbed gong-chime culture” prevalent in [[Southeast Asia]]. It is considered one of the region’s three major gong ensembles, alongside the [[gamelan]] of western Indonesia and [[piphat]] of [[Thailand]], [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]], which use gongs and not [[wind instrument|wind]] or [[string instrument|string]] instruments to carry the melodic part of the ensemble. Like the other two, kulintang music is primarily [[orchestral]] with several rhythmic parts orderly stacked one upon another. It is also based upon the [[pentatonic scale]]. However, kulintang music differs in many aspects from [[gamelan]] music, primarily in the way the latter constructs melodies within a framework of skeletal tones and prescribed time interval of entry for each instruments. The framework of kulintang music is more flexible and time intervals are nonexistent, allowing for such things as improvisations to be more prevalent.<ref name=Maceda2/>

Because kulintang-like ensembles extended over various groups with various languages, the term used for the horizontal set of gongs varied widely. Along with it begin called kulintang, it is also called kolintang, kolintan, kulintangan,<ref name=Sutton>Sutton, R. Anderson. "Reviewed Work: Sama de Sitangkai by Alan Martenot and Jose Maceda."

[[Image:Kulintang 04.jpg|thumb|right|The different sized brass kulintang gongs.]]
[[Image:Kulintang 10.jpg|thumb|right|The light beaters used to strike the gong bosses.]]

The gongs weigh roughly from two pounds to three pounds each, and have dimensions of 6 to 10&nbsp;inches for their diameters and 3 to 5&nbsp;inches for their height.<ref name=Kalanduyan1/> Traditionally they were made from [[bronze]] but due to the disruption and loss of trade routes between the islands of Borneo and Mindanao during World War II, resulting in loss of access to necessary metal ores, and the subsequent post-war use of scrap metal, [[brass]] gongs with shorter decaying tones are now commonplace.

The kulintang frame is known as an "antangan" by the Maguindanao (which means to “arrange”) and "langkonga" by the Maranao. The frame can be crude, made from simple bamboo/wooden poles, or it can be highly decorated and rich with traditional [[okir|okil/okir]] [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] or arabesque designs.  The frame is a necessary part of the instrument, and functions as a resonator.

It is considered [[taboo]] to step or cross over the antangan while the kulintang gongs are placed on it.<ref name=Spark>{{cite web

[[Image:Kulintang 05.jpg|thumb|right|Those in the Sulu Archipelago play the kulintang on the floor.]]

===Technique===
The kulintang is played by striking the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters. When playing the kulintang, the Maguindanao and Maranao would always sit on chairs while for the Tausug/Suluk and other groups that who play the kulintangan, they would commonly sit on the floor.<ref name=Muzium>An Introduction to the Traditional Musical Instruments of Sabah. Kota Kinabalu: Sabah State Muzium, 1992.</ref> Modern techniques include twirling the beaters, juggling them in midair, changing the arrangement of the gongs either before or while playing, crossings hands during play or adding very rapid fire strokes all in an effort to show off a player’s grace and virtuosity.<ref name=Cadar1/>

===Casting===
Kulintang gongs are made using the [[cire perdue|cire perdue method]], a lost-wax process used for casting the individual gongs.<ref name=Garfias>Cadar, Usopay H., and Robert Garfias. "Some Principles of Formal Variation in the Kolintang Music of the Maranao." Asian Music Vol. 27, No. 2. (Spring - Summer, 1996), pp. 105-122.</ref> The first phase is the creation of wax molds of the gongs. In the past, before the availability of standardized wax sheets made specifically for foundry use, the molds were made out of either [[beeswax]] (talo) or [[Paraffin wax|candle wax]] (kandila).<ref name=Cadar3/> The wax mold is covered with a special mixture of finely powdered coal/mud, which is applied on the wax surface using a brush. The layers are then left to dry under the sun, after which the entire mold is heated in a furnace to melt away the wax and hardening the coal/mud mixture, leaving behind a hollowed shell.<ref name=Maceda2/> With this hardened mold, molten bronze is poured down the mold’s mouth cavity, cooled to a certain degree, then the coal/mud is broken apart, revealing a new gong. The gong is then refined, cleaned, and properly identified by the panday (blacksmith).<ref name=Benitez/> Finally, the finished product is refined using the tongkol process, tuning the gongs either by hammering the boss from the inside to slightly raise its pitch, or by hammering the boss from the outside to lower the pitch.<ref name=Maceda2/> The correct tuning is found by ear, with players striking a sequence of gongs, looking for a melodic contour they are familiar with.<ref name=Trimillos>{{cite web

[[Image:Kulintang 02.jpg|thumb|right|Tongkol process using a hammer to tune the gongs.]]

===Tuning===
Unlike westernized instrumentation, there is no set tuning for kulintang sets throughout the Philippines.<ref name=Schramm>Schramm, Adelaida Reyes. "Music from the Tausug of Sulu: Moslems of the Southern Philippines." Asian Music 2(1971):</ref> Great variation exist between each set due to differences in make, size and shape, alloy used giving each kulintang set a unique pitch level, intervals and timbre.<ref name=Maceda1>Maceda, Jose M.. The Music of Maguindanao in the Philippines. Ann Arbor: University Microfilms, 1963.</ref> Though the tuning varies greatly, there does exist some uniformity to contour when same melody heard on different kulintang sets.<ref name=Garfias/> This common counter results in similar interval relationships of more or less equidistant steps between each of the gongs.<ref name=Kiefer>Kiefer, Thomas M.. Music from the Tausug of Sulu: Moslem of the Southern Philippines. New York: Anthology Record and Tape Corporation, 1970.</ref> This tuning system, not based upon equal temperament or upon a system of standard pitches but on a similar/certain pattern of large and small intervals, could also be found among the gamelan orchestras of western Indonesia.<ref name=Trimillos/> In fact, though the Maguindanao, Maranao and Tausug artists technically have no concept of scale (because emphasis placed on the concept of “rhythmic modes”), the [[Pelog]] and [[Slendro]] scales of [[Java]] were found to be most satisfactory to their own varying [[pentatonic scale|pentatonic]]/[[heptatonic scale|heptatonic]] scales.

[[Image:Kuilintang notation.jpg|thumb|left|Example of kulintang cipher notation.]]

===Notation system===
Because this music was catered for by [[Wikt:acephalous|acephalous]] societies, kulintang repertory was unfettered by an indigenous [[musical notation|notation system]].<ref name=Trimillos/> Compositions were passed down orally from generation to generation negating the need for notation for the pieces.<ref name=Philip>{{cite web

===Feminine instrument===
The kulintang is traditionally considered a women’s instrument by many groups: the Maguindanao, Maranao, Tausug/Suluk, Samal, Badjao/Sama, Iranun, Kadazan, Murut, Bidayuh and Iban.<ref name=Evans>Evans, Ivor H.. Among Primitive Peoples in Borneo. London: Seeley, Service & Co., 1922.</ref> Traditionally, the playing of the kulintang was associated with graceful, slow, frail and relaxed movements that showed elegance and decorum common among females.<ref name=Otto/> Nowadays, with both women and men playing all five instruments, the kulintang seen strictly as a woman’s instrument has waned, and in fact today, the most well known players of the kulintang happen to be men.<ref name=Gaerlan>Gaerlan, Barbara. Philippine Muslim Kulintang: Music of Modernization. 1991.</ref>

[[Image:Kulintang 06.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A kulintang ensemble performance in Daly City, California.]]

==Performance==
The main purpose for kulintang music in the community is to function as social entertainment at a nonprofessional, folk level.<ref name=Otto/> This music is unique in that it is considered a public music in the sense everyone is allowed to participate.<ref name=Cadar2/> Not only do the players play, but audience members are also expected to participate.<ref name=Kalanduyan1/> These performances are important in that they bring people in the community and adjacent regions together, helping unify communities that otherwise may not have interacted with one another. Traditionally, when performers play kulintang music, their participation is voluntary.<ref name=Cadar1/> Musicians see performances as an opportunity to receive recognition, prestige and respect from the community and nothing more.<ref name=Gaerlan/>

Generally, performances can be classified as either formal ones or informal. During formal performances adherents follow a traditional set of rules that would govern playing and it usually involved people from outside the home. Informal performances are quite the opposite. The strict rules that normally govern play are often ignored and the performers are usually between people well acquainted with one another, usually close family members.<ref name=Cadar1/> These performances usually were times when amateurs practiced on the instruments, young boys and girls gathered the instruments, substituting the kulintang with the [[saronay]] and inubab.<ref name=Benitez/> Ensembles didn’t necessary have to have five instruments like formal performances: they could be composed of only four instruments (three [[gandingan]] gongs, a kulintang, an [[agung]], and a [[dabakan]]), three instruments (a kulintang, a dabakan, and either an agung or three gandingan gongs) or simply just one instrument (kulintang solo).<ref name=Maceda2/>

==Social functions==
[[Image:Kulintang 09.jpg|thumb|400px|right|A kulintang ensemble being used for purpose of entertainment.]]
Kulintang music generally could be found as the social entertainment at a host of different occasions. It is used during large [[feasts]], festive/harvest gatherings, for entertainment of visiting friends and relatives, and at [[parades]].<ref name=Frame/> Kulintang music also accompanies ceremonies marking significant life events, such as [[weddings]] and returnees from the [[Hajj]].<ref name=Muzium/> Kulintang music also plays a significant role during state functions, used during official celebrations, entertaining of foreign dignitaries and important visitors of distant lands, court ceremonies of either the [[sultanate]] or village chieftains, [[enthronement|enthroning]]/[[coronations]] of a new leader and the transferral of a [[sultanate]] from one family to another.<ref name=Kartomi1/>

[[Image:Kulintang 07.jpg|thumb|left|A kulintang ensemble accompanying a healing ritual dance.]]

Kulintang music is prohibited from being played inside [[mosques]]<ref name=Gaerlan/> and during Islamic rites/observances/holidays, such as the fasting month ([[Ramadhan]]), where playing is only allowed at night during the time when people are allowed to eat.<ref name=Cadar1/> It is also prohibited during the mourning period of the death of important person, during [[funerals]], and during the peak times of the planting and harvest season.<ref name=Matusky2>Matusky, Patricia. "An Introduction to the Major Instruments and Forms of Traditional Malay Music." Asian Music Vol 16. No. 2. (Spring-Summer 1985), pp. 121-182.</ref>

[[Image:Gandingan 06.jpg|thumb|right|The [[gandingan]] is normally chosen for playing ''apad'' renditions]]

===Other uses===
Kulintang instrument has uses other than public performances. It also is used to accompany healing ceremonies/rituals (pagipat)/animistic religious ceremonies. Though this practice has died out among the Maranao due to its non-[[Islamic]] nature, some areas in [[Mindanao]], [[Sabah]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] still practice this ancient tradition.<ref name=Cadar1/>

Kulintang music can be used for communicating long distance messages from one village or longhouse to another.<ref name=Matusky2/> Called [[Gandingan#Communication|''apad'']], these renditions mimic the normal speaking tones of the [[Maguindanao language]], creating a specific message or, through the use of double entendre, a social commentary understood by nearly any adult native Maguindanao speaker.<ref name=Danny2>{{cite web

}}</ref> However, ''apad'' is falling into disuse because times have changed, and the necessity of its use for long-distance communication purposes has faded away.  ''Anun'' as a music without a message, is used instead to express sentiments and feelings, and has come more and more into use due to its compatibility with the musical elaborations and idiosyncratic styles of the times.<ref name=Benitez/>

[[Image:Agung 11.jpg|thumb|left|An agung contestant performing on the [[agung]] using two balus.]]

Kulintang music was also crucial in relation to courtships<ref name=Goddio>Goddio, Franck. Lost at Sea: The strange route of the Lena Shoal junk. London: Periplus, 2002.</ref> due to the very nature of Islamic custom, which did not allow for unmarried men and women to intermingle.<ref name=Philip/> Traditionally, unmarried daughters were kept in a special chamber in the attic called a lamin, off-limit to visitors and suitors.<ref name=Cadar1/> It was only when she was allowed to play during kulintang performances that suitors were allowed to view her. Because of this, kulintang music was rare socially approved vehicles for interaction among the sexes.<ref name=Gaerlan/>

Musical contest, particularly among the Maguindanao, have become a unique feature of these kulintang performances.<ref name=Benitez/> They occur at almost all the formal occasions mentioned above, particularly weddings.<ref name=Kalanduyan1/> What has made the Maguindanao stand out from the other groups is that they practice solo gong contest – with individual players showcasing their skill on the various ensemble instruments – the agung, gandingan and the kulintang – as opposed to only group contest, where performers from one town and another town are pitted against each other.<ref name=Gaerlan/>

==Compositions==

===Rhythmic modes===
Kulintang music has no set compositions due to its concept of rhythmic modes.<ref name=Amin/> A rhythmic mode (or designation or genre or pattern) is defined as a musical unit that binds together the entire five instrument ensemble.<ref name=Otto/> By adding together the various rhythms of each instrument, one could create music and by changing one of the rhythms, one could create different music.<ref name=Amin/> This is the basis of the rhythmic mode.

===Improvisation===
The kulintang player’s ability to improvise within the parameters of a rhythmic mode is a must.<ref name=Trimillos/> As with gamelan orchestras, each kulintang mode has a kind of theme the kulintang player “dresses up” by variations of ornamentation, manipulating segments by inserting repetitions, extensions, insertions, suspensions, variations and transpositions. This occurs at the discretion of the kulintang player.<ref name=Otto/> Therefore, the kulintang player functions not only as the one carrying the melody, but also as the conductor of the entire ensemble. She determines the length of each rendition and could change the rhythm at anytime, speeding up or slowing down, accord to her personal taste and the composition she plays.<ref name=Terada>Terada, Yoshitaka. "Variational and Improvisational Techniques of Gandingan Playing in the Maguindanaon Kulintang Ensemble." Asian Music XXVII.2 (1996): 53-79.</ref>

This emphasis on improvisation was essential due traditional role of the music as entertainment for the entire community.<ref name=Posner>Posner, Karen L. "A Preliminary Analysis of Style in Maguindanoan Kulintang Music." Asian Music XXVII.2 (1996): 19–32.</ref> Listeners in the audience expected players to surprise and astound them by playing in their own unique style, and by incorporating improvisation to make newer versions of the piece.<ref name=Cadar1/> If a player simply imitated a preceding player, playing patterns without any improvisation, the audience members would believe she/he to be repetitious and mundane.<ref name=Scholz>Scholz, Scott. "The Supportive Instruments of the Maguindanaon Kulintang Music." Asian Music XXVII.2 (1996): 33–52.</ref> This also explains why set performance pieces for musical productions are different in some respect—young men/women would be practicing before an event, therefore rarely relying on improvisations.<ref name=Gaerlan/>

Though allowing such a variety of rhythms would lead to an innumerable amount of patterns, generally one could categorize these rhythmic modes on the basis on various criteria such as the number of beats in a recurring musical phrase, differences in the melodic and rhythmic groups with the musical phrase, differences in the rhythmic emphasis, and differences in the opening formulas and cadential patterns.<ref name=Benitez/> For the Maguindanao, three to five typical genres can be distinguished:<ref name=Otto/> Duyug, Sinulog, Tidtu, Binalig and Tagonggo.<ref name=Posner/> The Maranao on the other hand have only three typical genres—Kapromayas/Romayas, Kapagonor/Onor, and Katitik Pandai/Kapaginandang.<ref name=Garfias/>

These general genres could be further grouped among each other into styles/subcategories/stylistic modifiers,<ref name=Benitez/> which are differentiated from one another based on instrumentation, playing techniques, function and the average age and gender of the musicians as well.<ref name=Terada/> Generally, these styles are differentiated by what is considered traditional or “old,” and more contemporary or “new.”

Old styles are considered slow, well-pronounced and dignified like the Maguindanao’s kamamatuan and the Maranao’s andung.<ref name=Maceda1/> Genres classified under this style have moderate tempos, are rhythmically oriented, balanced, lack many improvisations and are usually played by the older folks and are therefore always played first, to give due respect to the older generation.<ref name=Terada/>

New styles such as the Maguindanao’s kagungudan and the Maranao’s bago, are considered fast, rhythmic and showy.<ref name=Aga2/> Generally genres under this classification have faster tempos with an emphasis on power and speed, are highly rhythmic and pulsating, and are highly improvised with musicians employing different rhythmic/melodic formulae not used with old patterns.<ref name=Maceda2/> “Young” musicians, specifically young men, gravitate toward this style because of its emphasis on virtuosity and one’s individualism.<ref name=Terada/> Generally played after all kamamatuan pieces have been played to give younger musicians the opportunity to participate.<ref name=Kalanduyan1/>
Tagunggo not classified under one of these styles, being more ritualistic than recreational in nature.<ref name=Aga/> Tagunggo is a rhythmic mode often used to accompany trance and dance rituals such as [[sagayan]].<ref name=Scholz/> During the playing of these pieces, a ritual specialist would dance in rhythm with the music calling on the help of ancestral spirits (tunong).<ref name=Benitez/>

===Sulu-type kulintangan compositions===
Sulu-type compositions on the kulintangan are found among the [[Taus?g people|Tausug]], [[Samal people|Samal]], [[Yakan]], [[Bajau|Sama]]/[[Badjao]], [[Iranun]] and [[Kadazan-Dusun]]. Though there exist no identifiable rhythmic or melodic differences between patterns with names such as the Maguindanao, each group has their own music compositions. For instance, the Tausug have three identifiable compositions—Kuriri, Sinug, and Lubak-Lubak—the Yakan have two—Tini-id and Kuriri—and the Dusun have three—Ayas, Kudidi and Tidung. Though these melodies vary even within groups like the Maguindanao and Maranao, one theme which characterizes the Sulu-type is the exchange of short melodic phrases between the kulintangan and the Agungs, where both instruments imitate and duplicate each other's rhythms very quickly. This is clearly seen in the Tausug Sinug and Yakan Tini-id and Kuriri compositions where this sort of jousting becomes a game of skill and virtuoso playing.<ref name=Maceda2/>

===Composition titles===
The kulintang repertoire has no fixed labels because the music itself is not considered a fixed entity. Due to the fact it is [[oral tradition|orally transmitted]], the repertoire itself is considered something always in a state of flux due to two primary reasons. First, standardized titles weren’t considered a priority. Though to the musicians themselves the melodies would sound similar, the labels they would place on a particular rhythmic mode or style could vary even from household to household within that same village. For the musicians, the emphasis is on the excitement and pleasure of playing the music without much regard to what the piece was referred to as. Secondly, because musicians improvised their pieces regularly, modes and styles were continually revised and changed as they were passed on to a newer generation of musicians, making the pieces and therefore the labels attached to them relevant only during a certain frame of time.

Such issues made attempts to codify the compositions in a uniform manner impossible.<ref name=Otto/> An example of this could be found among the Maguindanao where the word binalig is used by contemporary musicians as a name for one of the rhythmic modes associated with kangungudan but it has also been used as a term designating a “new” style.<ref name=Combes>Combes, Francisco. Historia de las Isles de Mindanao in the Philippine Islands. Clevaland: Clark, 1903.</ref> Another example concerns the discrepancy among “old” and “new” genres. With “new pieces” continuously proliferating even up till now, pieces only created decades ago are now considered “old” even though this is considered a tradition spanning many centuries.<ref name=Otto/> These differences could sometimes make discussing this repertoire and the modes and styles within it a bit confounding.

[[Image:Kulintang 11.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kulintang]]

==History==
Kulintang music is considered an ancient tradition that predates the influences of [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], and [[Western world|the West]]. In the Philippines, it represents the highest form of gong music attained by [[Filipino people|Filipinos]]<ref name=Benitez/> and in [[North Maluku]], it is said to have existed for centuries.<ref name=Kartomi1/>

As ancient as this music is, there has never been substantial data recorded regarding the kulintang’s origins.<ref name=Cadar3/> The earliest historical accounts of instruments resembling those of the present day kulintang are in the writings of various European explorers from the 16th century who would have seen such instruments used in passing.<ref name=Blair>Blair, Emma, and James Robertson. The Philippine Islands. Cleveland: The Arthur K. Clark Co, 1903.</ref><ref name=Forrest>[[Thomas Forrest (navigator)|Forrest, Thomas]]. ''A Voyage to New Guinea and the Moluccas: 1774-1776''. Kuala Lumpur: Oxford University Press, 1969.</ref><ref name=Vives>Vives, E.D.. The Rio Grande of Mindanao. 2. Cagayan de Oro: Xavier University, 1995.</ref>

Because of limited data concerning gong music prior to European exploration, theories abound as to when the prototypes of what is now the present day kulintang came to be. One theory suggest that the bronze gong had an ancient history in Southeast Asia, arriving in the [[Malay archipelago]] two or even three thousand years ago, making its way to the Philippines from China in the 3rd century AD.<ref name=Sachs>Sachs, Curt. The History of Musical Instruments. New York: W.W. Norton & Co., Inc, 1940.</ref> Another theory lays doubt to the former claim, suggesting the kulintang could not have existed prior to the 15th century due to the belief [[Javanese people|Javanese]] gong tradition, which is what the kulintang was believed to be derived from, developed only by the 15th century.<ref name=Skog>Skog, Inge. "North Borneo Gongs and the Javanese Gamelan." Ethnomusicology Research Digest 4(1993): 55-102.</ref>

Though different theories abound as to the exact centuries the kulintang was finally realized, there is a consensus that kulintang music developed from a foreign musical tradition which was borrowed and adapted to the indigenous music tradition already present in the area.<ref name=Maceda2/> It’s likely the earliest gongs used among the indigenous populace had no recreational value but were simply used for making signals and sending messages.<ref name=Frame/>

Kulintang music likely evolved from this simple signaling tradition, transitioning into a period consisting of one player, one-gong type ensembles (like those found among the [[Ifugao]] of [[Luzon]] or [[Hilltribes of Mindanao#Tiruray|Tiruray]] of [[Mindanao]]), developing into a multi-gong, multiplayer ensemble with the incorporation of concepts originating from [[Sundanese people|Sunda]] and finally transforming into the present day kulintang ensemble, with the addition of the [[dabakan|d’bakan]], [[babendil|babndir]] and musical concepts of Islam via Islam traders.

===Origin of the gong===

[[Image:Map of migration of the kulintang gong.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Two proposed routes for the migration of the kulintang gong to [[Mindanao]]]]

The kulintang gong itself is believed to be have been one of those foreign musical elements incorporated into kulintang music, derived from the [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] kolenang due to its striking similarities.<ref name=Cadar3/> Along with the fact that they play important roles in their respectively ensembles, both the kulintang and kolenang show striking homogeneity in tapered rims (as opposed to pronouncedly tapered Javanese [[bonang]] and non-tapered Laotian khong vong gongs). Even the word kulintang is believed to be just an altered form of the [[Sundanese word]] kolenang.<ref name=Kunst>Kunst, Jaap. Music in Java. 2. Netherlands: The Hague, 1949.</ref>

It was these similarities that lead theorists to conclude that the kulintang was originally imported to the Philippines during the migration of the kolenang through the Malay Archipelago. Based on the etymology, two routes have been proposed as the route for the kulintang to Mindanao: One from Sunda, through [[Banjermasin]], [[Brunei]] and the [[Sulu Archipelago]], a route where the word “kulintangan” is commonly used for the horizontal row of gongs; The other from Sunda, thru, [[Timor]], [[Sulawesi]], [[Moluccas]] and [[Mindanao]] where the word kolintang/kulintang is commonly seen.<ref name=Cadar3/>

===Future===
The tradition of kulintang music has been waning throughout the Eastern Malay Archipelago, and has become extinct in some places. Sets of five bronze gong-chimes and a gong making up the totobuang ensembles of [[Buru]] island in Central Maluku have also come to disuse.<ref name=Kartomi1/> Kolintang sets of bossed kettle gongs were once played in [[Gorontalo (province)|Gorontalo]], [[North Sulawesi]] long ago but that has all but disappeared, replaced by what locals are presently familiar with—a slab-key instrument known as a kolintang.<ref name=Amin/>

The extent of past kulintang tradition in the Philippines, particularly in the Northern and Central islands of [[Luzon]] and the [[Visayas]], will never be fully known due to the harsh realities of three hundred years of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]].<ref name=Philip2>Mercurio, Philip Dominguez. Expedition into ETHS 545: Music of the Southern Philippines." Manila Bulletin USA: Kababayan Ed. [South San Francisco] 13 OCT 2005, natl. ed.: 8.</ref>  The fact that there are areas which were able to keep kulintang tradition alive during European colonization has caused some observers to aptly term this music “the music of resistance.”

Today, the existence of kulintang music is threatened by the influence of [[globalization]], and the introduction of Western and foreign ideals into the region.<ref name=Philip2/> Younger generations would rather listen to American music, or bike in the streets with other children than spend time practicing and imitating on the traditional instruments of their parents.<ref name=Benitez/>

However, Philippine kulintang music has had a revival of sorts due to the work of Philippine-born, U.S.-educated musicians/ethnomusicologists Master Danongan "Danny" Kalanduyan and Usopay Cadar, as well as their predecessor Professor [[José Maceda]].<ref name=Philip2/> Through the work of Professor [[Robert Garfias]], both Cadar and Kalanduyan began teaching and performing traditional kulintang music in the [[United States]] during the late 20th century; quite unexpectedly, the music became a bridge between contemporary [[Filipino American|Filipino American culture]] and ancient Philippine tribal traditions.<ref name=Spark/>

Both Kalanduyan and Cadar have been impressed that so many people lacking Maguindanaon or Maranao background, and some who are not even Filipino, have become dedicated students and supporters of their cultural heritage.<ref name=Cadar2/> An additional surprise came after a decade-long series of American-based kulintang students traveled to Mindanao to perform, sparking a kulintang renaissance in the Philippines. The knowledge of outsiders playing traditional kulintang has encouraged the younger generation of musicians in the Philippines, both in Mindanao and in [[Taguig]], [[Metro Manila]].<ref name=Philip2/> Enthusiastic appreciation by foreigners has given life to a dying tradition, and the music has become a unifying force in the Philippine diaspora.<ref name=Spark/>  For the first time in history, kulintang music is now formally taught to music students at several universities located throughout Metro Manila.

==Composition of various ensembles==

The makeup of kulintang ensembles throughout the region varies between the various cultural groups. Generally, they consist of five to six instruments dominated of course by a melody-playing gong row that functions as a lead/central melodic instrument for the entire ensemble.<ref name=Maranao>The Maranao Man.

{{refimprove|date=October 2014}}

'''Ecosophy''' and '''ecophilosophy''' are [[neologism]]s formed by contracting the phrase '''ecological philosophy'''.

Confusion as to the meaning (suggesting that such a meaning should be singular and exact) of ecosophy is primarily the consequence of it being used to designate different and often contradictory (though conceptually related) concepts by the [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] father of [[deep ecology]], [[Arne Næss]], and French [[post-Marxist]] philosopher and psychoanalyst [[Félix Guattari]].

==Næss's definition ==
While a professor at [[University of Oslo]] in 1972, Arne Næss, introduced the terms "[[deep ecology]] movement" and "ecosophy" into environmental literature.  Naess based his article on a talk he gave in [[Bucharest]] in 1972 at the Third World Future Research Conference. As Drengson notes in ''Ecophilosophy, Ecosophy and the Deep Ecology Movement: An Overview'', "In his talk Næss discussed the longer-range background of the ecology movement and its connection with respect for Nature and the inherent worth of other beings."  Naess's view of humans as an integral part of a "total-field image<ref>Næss, Arne. (1972): Shallow and the Deep. Oslo: Inquiry.</ref>" of Nature contrasts with the alternative (and more anthropocentric) construction of ecosophy outlined by Guattari.

The term ecological [[wisdom]], synonymous with ecosophy, was introduced by Næss in 1973.  The concept has become one of the foundations of the [[deep ecology]] movement. All expressions of values by [[Green Parties]] list '''ecological wisdom''' as a key value&mdash;it was one of the original [[Four Pillars of the Green Party]] and is often considered the most basic value of these parties. It is also often associated with [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[religion]] and [[culture|cultural]] practices. In its political context, it is necessarily not as easily defined as [[ecological health]] or scientific [[ecology]] concepts.

Naess defined ecosophy in the following way:

{{quote|By an ecosophy I mean a philosophy of ecological harmony or equilibrium. A philosophy as a kind of sofia (or) wisdom, is openly normative, it contains both norms, rules, postulates, value priority announcements and hypotheses concerning the state of affairs in our universe. Wisdom is policy wisdom, prescription, not only scientific description and prediction. The details of an ecosophy will show many variations due to significant differences concerning not only the 'facts' of pollution, resources, population, etc. but also value priorities.|A. Drengson and Y. Inoue, 1995, page 8}}

==Félix Guattari==
Ecosophy also refers to a field of practice introduced by [[psychoanalyst]], [[poststructuralist]] philosopher and political activist [[Félix Guattari]]. In part Guattari's use of the term demarcates what he observes as the necessity for the proponents of social liberation whose struggles in the 20th century were dominated by the paradigm of social revolution and [[Marxism]] to embed their arguments within an ecological framework which understands the interconnections of social and environmental spheres.

Guattari holds that traditional environmentalist perspectives obscure the complexity of the relationship between humans and their natural environment through its maintenance of the dualistic separation of human (cultural) and nonhuman (natural) systems; he envisions ecosophy as a new field with a [[monistic]] and pluralistic approach to such study. Ecology in the Guattarian sense then, is a study of complex phenomena, including human subjectivity, the environment, and social relations, all of which are intimately interconnected. Despite this emphasis on interconnection, throughout his individual writings and more famous collaborations with [[Gilles Deleuze]], Guattari has resisted calls for holism, preferring to emphasize heterogeneity and difference, synthesizing assemblages and [[multiplicities]] in order to trace [[rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomatic]] structures rather than creating unified and holistic structures.

{{quote|Without modifications to the social and material environment, there can be no change in mentalities. Here, we are in the presence of a circle that leads me to postulate the necessity of founding an "ecosophy" that would link environmental ecology to social ecology and to mental ecology.|Guattari 1996: 264}}

Guattari's concept of the three interacting and interdependent ecologies of mind, society, and environment stems from the outline of the three ecologies presented in ''[[Steps to an Ecology of Mind]]'', a collection of writings by cyberneticist [[Gregory Bateson]].

'''Ferdinand Brunetière''' (19 July 1849 – 9 December 1906) was a [[France|French]] writer and [[critic]].

==Personal and public life==

===Early years===
Brunetière was born in [[Toulon]], [[Var (department)|Var]], [[Provence]]. After school at [[Marseille]], he studied in [[Paris]] at the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]]. Desiring a teaching career, he entered for examination at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], but failed, and the outbreak of war in 1870 prevented him trying again. He turned to private tuition and literary criticism. After the publication of successful articles in the ''Revue Bleue'', he became connected with the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'', first as contributor, then as secretary and sub-editor, and finally, in 1893, as principal editor.

===Career===
In 1886 Brunetière was appointed professor of French language and literature at the École Normale, a singular honour for one who had not passed through the academic mill; and later he presided with distinction over various conferences at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and elsewhere. He was decorated with the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1887, and became a member of the [[Académie française]] in 1893.

The published works of Brunetière consist largely of reprinted papers and lectures. They include six series of ''Etudes critiques'' (1880&ndash;1898) on French history and literature; ''Le Roman naturaliste'' (1883); ''Histoire et Littérature'', three series (1884&ndash;1886); ''Questions de critique'' (1888; second series, 1890). The first volume of ''L'Evolution de genres dans l'histoire de la littérature'', lectures in which a formal classification, founded on [[Darwinism]], is applied to the phenomena of literature, appeared in 1890; and his later works include a series of studies (2 vols, 1894) on the evolution of French lyrical poetry during the 10th century, a history of French classic literature begun in 1904, a monograph on [[Honoré de Balzac]] (1906), and various pamphlets of a polemical nature dealing with questions of education, science and religion. Among these may be mentioned ''Discours académiques'' (1901), ''Discours de combat'' (1900, 1903), ''L'Action sociale du Christianisme'' (1904), ''Sur les chemins de la croyance'' (1905).

===Personal life===
Before 1895 Brunetière was widely known as an a rationalist, [[freethought|freethinking]] scholar. That year, however, he published an article, "Après une visite au Vatican," in which he argued that science was incapable of providing a convincing social morality and that faith alone could achieve that result.<ref>[[Jennifer Michael Hecht]]. ''The End of the Soul: Scientific Modernity, Atheism and Anthropology in France'', New York: Columbia University Press, 2003, pp. 172&ndash;176. ISBN 978-0-231-12846-9</ref> Shortly afterwards, he converted to [[Roman Catholicism]]. As a Catholic, Brunetière was orthodox and his political sympathies were conservative. He possessed vast erudition and unflinching courage. He was never afraid to diverge from the established critical view. The most honest, if not the most impartial, of magisterial writers, he had a hatred of the unreal, and a contempt for the trivial; nobody was more merciless towards the pretentious. On the other hand, his intolerance, his sledge-hammer methods of attack and a certain dry pedantry alienated the sympathies of many who recognized his remarkable intellect.

The '''United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia''' (''Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia'', or '''AUC''', in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is a Colombian para-military and drug trafficking group which was an active belligerent in the [[Colombian conflict (1964–present)|Colombian armed conflict]] during the period from 1997 to 2006. The AUC was responsible for attacks against the [[FARC]] and [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] rebel groups as well as numerous attacks against civilians beginning in 1997 with the [[Mapiripán Massacre]].<ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/>

The bulk of the AUC's blocs demobilized by early 2006 and its former top leadership was extradited to the U.S. in 2008. However, local successors such as the [[Black Eagles]] continue to exist and death threats have been made using its name. On May 8, 2008, employees of a community radio station (Sarare FM Stereo) received a message stating: "For the wellbeing of you and your loved ones, do not meddle in subjects that do not concern the radio station. AUC, Arauca".  A few days later the letters AUC were daubed on the front of their office. This threat was made due to their participation in a public meeting attended by members of a Congressional Human Rights Commission on the 27 September 2007.  Here, members of the public denounced [[human rights]] abuses committed in [[Arauca Department]] by different parties to the armed conflict, including the AUC.<ref>[http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AMR23/023/2008/en]</ref>

The AUC's main enemies were the [[leftist]] insurgency groups [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC) and the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|National Liberation Army]] (''Ejército de Liberación Nacional'', ELN). The AUC was designated as a [[terrorism|terrorist]] organization by many countries and organizations, including the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and the [[European Union]].<ref>[http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2006/82738.htm Chapter 6 - Terrorist Organizations<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The U.S. State Department added the AUC to the list in 2001, condemning it for [[wiktionary:massacre|massacres]], [[torture]], and other [[human rights]] abuses against civilians.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

According to the [[Colombian National Police]], in the first ten months of 2000 the AUC conducted 804 [[assassination]]s, 203 [[kidnapping]]s, and 75 massacres with 507 victims. The AUC claims the victims were mostly [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]s or sympathizers. Combat tactics consist of conventional and guerrilla operations against main force insurgent units. AUC clashes with military and police units gradually increased, although the group has traditionally been friendly with government security forces. 
 
A February 2005 report by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] reported that, during 2004, "the AUC was responsible for 342 cases of violations of the cessation of hostilities.  These include the presumed reincorporation of demobilized persons into its ranks, massacres, forced displacements, selective and systematic [[homicide]]s, kidnappings, [[rape]], [[Forced disappearance|disappearances]], threats, [[intimidation]] and [[looting]]s. These actions took place in 11 departments and targeted the civilian population, in many cases [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous communities]]."<ref name = "unhcr1">[http://www.hchr.org.co/documentoseinformes/informes/altocomisionado/informes.php3?cod=8&cat=11 Report on the situation of human rights in Colombia] UNHCR 28 February 2005 (English and Spanish)</ref>

Under the leadership of [[Salvatore Mancuso]], son of [[Italy|Italian]] [[immigrant]]s, the AUC maintained close links with the [[Calabria]]n [['Ndrangheta]] concerning [[drug traffic|cocaine trafficking]].<ref>[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/418741.html Tiene Italia indicios sobre presencia de cárteles mexicanos en Europa], ''[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]'', 15 April 2007 {{es icon}}</ref>

{{See also|Doe v. Chiquita Brands International}}

In March 2007, the international fruit [[corporation]], [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]], admitted to having paid the AUC from 1997 to 2004 US$1.7 million in order to protect its workers and operations, in [[Urabá]] and [[Santa Marta]], of which at least US$825,000 came after the AUC was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the US State Department in 2001. These payments were often made through a group belonging to the [[Convivir]] network, a government-sponsored program of rural security cooperatives.<ref>[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB217/index.htm DOCUMENTS IMPLICATE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT IN CHIQUITA TERROR SCANDAL], [[National Security Archive]] Electronic Briefing Book No. 217</ref> The payments were arranged during a 1997 meeting between [[Carlos Castaño Gil|Carlos Castaño]] with officials from [[Banadex]], a subsidiary of Chiquita.<ref name=Evans>Michael Evans, [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070416/evans 'Para-politics' Goes Bananas], ''[[The Nation]]'', 4 April 2007 {{en icon}}</ref> Chiquita subsequently made a [[plea bargain]] with the [[United States Department of Justice]], and agreed to pay a $25 million fine.<ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2007/March/07_nsd_161.html Chiquita Brands International Pleads Guilty to Making Payments to a Designated Terrorist Organization And Agrees to Pay $25 Million Fine], United States Department of Justice, 19 March 2007 {{en icon}}</ref> Colombia's attorney general, [[Mario Iguarán]], also opened a case on Chiquita.

Later, Attorney General Iguarán contradicted himself by claiming the extraditions could not be completed since the implicated persons had not been "identified and charged." Specifically, Iguarán asserted  "there are indeed some Chiquita Brands directors, but we are not able to ask for them in extradition, rather we have to have some information contained in the agreement reached with the U.S. court that includes a confidentiality agreement."

==2003–2004: Initial negotiation efforts== <!-- This section is linked from [[Álvaro Uribe]] -->
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}
After a [[ceasefire]] was declared (which in practice has been publicly admitted by the AUC and the government to be partial, resulting in a reduction but not the cessation of killings), the government of President [[Álvaro Uribe]] began talks with the group with the aim to eventually dismantle the organization and reintegrate its members to society. The stated deadline for completing the demobilization process was originally December 2005, but was later extended into February 2006. Between 2003 and February 2, 2006, about 17,000 of the AUC's 20,000 fighters  surrendered their weapons. [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0602020195feb02,1,5857923.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed&ctrack=1&cset=true] This is more than double the figure originally estimated by the government before negotiations began.

A draft law was presented to the public which offered to pardon the members of any illegal armed group (which would legally include both guerrillas and paramilitaries, (i.e. members of both left- and right-wing groups) that declared a ceasefire and entered talks with the government, in return for, mainly, their verified [[demobilization]], concentration within a specific geographic area and the symbolic [[Reparation (legal)|reparation]] of the offenses committed against the victims of their actions. After much discussion and controversy over it, a further revised draft was distributed to the media and political circles. This new project was not officially submitted for approval by  [[Colombian Congress|Congress]] and further public discussion on the matter continued.

The bill, among other details, called for the creation of a three to five member [[Truth Tribunal]] which would study each case brought before it (at the request of the president), after the groups/individuals sign an agreement to respect international humanitarian laws and accept the authority of the Tribunal, in exchange for a minimum sentence of five to ten years (part of it could possibly be served outside jail) for those guilty of the most serious crimes, the confession of the crimes which were committed in connection with the activities of the illegal armed group, and the completion of concrete acts of reparation towards the victims.

If the Tribunal were to deny the benefits to anyone, there would be no possibility of reconsideration. However, the president would be able to veto individuals who did receive a favorable sentence. This new draft version of the law would have been in effect only until 31 December 2006.

[[Human Rights Watch]] spokesman [[José Miguel Vivanco]] publicly stated, during one of the final audiences which were created to discuss aspects of the original bill (of which he remained highly critical), that the new proposition seemed to be considerably more in line with international standards, at first glance, but that more needed to be done in order to fully resolve the issue.

[[Salvatore Mancuso]], one of the AUC's main commanders, publicly expressed that he was against both any potential [[extradition]] of either himself or his "comrades in arms" to the USA and refused "spending any day in jail".

Also, there have been internal conflicts within the illegal organization, as other AUC leaders have mutually accused each other of being tainted with [[narcotrafficking]] and their troops have even met in combat. These different, regionalistic and sometimes warring factions within the AUC, make successfully concluding any peace initiative a considerably difficult task.

In mid-May 2004, the talks appeared to move forward as the government agreed to grant the AUC leaders and 400 of their bodyguards a 142 square mile (368&nbsp;km²) safe haven in [[Santa Fe de Ralito]], [[Córdoba Department|Córdoba]], where, under OAS verification, further discussions will be held, for a (renewable) trial period of 6 months. As long the AUC leaders remain in this area, they will not be subject to [[arrest warrant]]s. 
That condition and most of remaining legal framework invoked was previously implemented for the much larger [[San Vicente del Caguán]] area that former president [[Andrés Pastrana]] granted the FARC guerrillas as safe haven during the 1998-2002 peace process, but there are differences:

* the local, state and police authorities will not leave the zone, so [[Colombian law]]s will still be fully applicable within its limits
* the paramilitary leaders will require special permission to leave and re-enter the zone, and government prosecutors will be allowed to operate inside it in order to investigate criminal offenses.

==Disappearance and death of Carlos Castaño==
{{Update|date=August 2010}}
Paramilitary leader [[Carlos Mauricio García]] alias "Doble Cero" ("Double Zero") or "Rodrigo", who since the 1980s had been a close associate of Castaño within the AUC, was found dead on 30 May 2004. He had strongly objected to what he considered an improperly close relationship between the AUC and drug traffickers, and was also opposed to the group's talks with the government. "Double Zero" had fallen into disgrace in recent years, leading to the formation of his own independent "[[Bloque Metro]]" ("Metro Bloc"), which operated in the [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] area until it was exterminated by rival paramilitary commanders from the AUC mainstream.

Separately, in events which remain clouded and confusing, former AUC supreme leader [[Carlos Castaño Gil|Carlos Castaño]], who had become relatively isolated from the organization, apparently suffered an attempt on his life on 16 April 2004, presumably at the hands of either his own bodyguards, those of rival paramilitary troops, or perhaps even other entities altogether. Acting AUC commanders claim to believe that there was an accidental exchange of gunfire between his bodyguards and a separate group of paramilitary fighters, but that he may still be alive and possibly in hiding.

Other independent sources within the group and among its dissident factions claim that he and his men were captured and tortured before being executed and then buried by order of other AUC top leaders (perhaps his own brother [[Vicente Castaño]] and/or [[Diego Fernando Murillo]]), who have become increasingly close to narcotraffickers and their trade. Investigators found a makeshift grave and an unidentified body (yet apparently not Castaño's) near the supposed area of the events. Those same sources allege that the bodies of Castaño and his other companions were dug up and taken to other locations before the investigators could arrive.

It has been speculated in the Colombian and international press that this could be a potential blow to the peace process, as Castaño seemed to become relatively critical of the increasing association with narcotraffickers in recent years and more willing to compromise with the Colombian state, and thus the remaining AUC commanders (such as Mancuso and "[[Don Berna]]") would potentially maintain a much less open negotiating position in the ongoing talks with the Uribe government.

The death of AUC co-founder Carlos Castaño remained unexplained for two years, and was subject of wild and rampant speculation. One of the more exotic rumours (dating to 1 June 2004), stated that unidentified diplomatic sources told the [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] agency that Castaño had been spirited away to [[Israel]], via [[Panama]], with U.S. assistance. No specific reasoning or details regarding this claim were produced. The [[Federal government of the United States|governments of the United States]], [[Government of Colombia|Colombia]], and [[Government of Israel|Israel]] denied these allegations.

Details about Castaño's possible fate began to emerge in 2006. The [[Cali]]-based ''[[Nuevo Diario Occidente]]'' reported that an assassin hired by Vicente Castaño confessed to the police that he had killed Castaño in 2004. This assassin's confessions allowed Colombian authorities to locate Castaño's body in August 2006, and [[DNA test]]s confirmed its identity in September that year.

==Possible paramilitary activities in Venezuela==
In early May 2004, [[Venezuela]]n authorities arrested at least 100 individuals that they accused of being Colombian paramilitaries and of scheming, together with part of the Venezuelan opposition, to begin a series of scheduled attacks against heavily fortified military targets within [[Caracas]], aiming at the overthrow of President [[Hugo Chávez]].

The AUC officially denied that they had anything to do with them.  President Uribe congratulated the Venezuelan president for the capture and pledged to cooperate with the investigation, while President Chávez himself declared that, as far as he was concerned, he did not believe that Uribe had anything to with the operation, for which he blamed "elements" within "the oligarchies of [[Miami]] and [[Bogotá]]", also implicating individual high-ranking U.S. and Colombian military officers, who have denied such involvement.

[[Vice-president]] [[Francisco Santos Calderón]] added that he hoped that the Venezuelan government would pursue with equal zeal those FARC and ELN guerrillas who would also be present in Venezuela. The Venezuelan opposition dismissed the whole event as a "setup", claiming that Chávez intended to interfere with the potential approval of a [[Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004|referendum]] which sought to remove him from power.

{{See also|Putative Venezuelan coup attempt of 2004}}

==Late 2004: Demobilizations==
In November 2004, the [[Colombian Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] approved the extradition to the United States of top paramilitary leaders [[Salvatore Mancuso]] and [[Carlos Castaño Gil|Carlos Castaño]], together with that of the guerrilla commander [[Simón Trinidad]], the only one of the men to be in state custody (Castaño's extradition was approved because the court considered that the matter of his death was not yet clear).

The court ruled that the three US [[extradition]] requests, all for charges of drug trafficking and [[money laundering]], respected current Colombian legal procedures and therefore they could now proceed, once the president gave his approval.<ref name = "bbc4040567">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4040567.stm BBC Court clears Colombia extradition] Thursday, 25 November 2004</ref>

It has been speculated in the Colombian press that the government would possibly approve the extradition of Salvatore Mancuso, but would delay it for the duration of the peace talks that he and his organization are conducting with the state. Mancuso himself has declared that he will continue to participate in the process despite the Supreme Court's ruling. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

In early December and late November, there have been new events in the peace negotiations with the AUC. First, several hundred men of the [[Bloque Bananero]] (loosely translated, the Banana Producers' Bloc) turned in their weapons and demobilized in order to be reintegrated into civilian life. This group operated in the Uraba region of northern Antioquia, where the AUC had dislodged the FARC and gained total control in the mid- to late nineties. However, the AUC remain in the area with the presence of other divisions in order to maintain the peace and prevent the FARC from returning.

A few weeks later, the [[Catatumbo Bloc]] also demobilized. This was a milestone in Colombian history, for, with its 1425 mercenaries, the Catatumbo Bloc was one of the most important AUC groups. With them Salvatore Mancuso, the AUC's military leader, turned himself in. A few days later, the government announced that it would not make Mancuso's extradition effective as long as he avoided criminal activities and fulfilled his commitments to the peace process.

Both of these massive demobilizations of AUC groups are an apparent improvement over the first one in 2003 in [[Medellín]] because on this occasion important leaders turned themselves in and the weapons presented were assault rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and rockets, rather than the [[homemade shotgun]]s and old, malfunctioning revolvers that were turned in the first demobilization. The AUC was supposed to have demobilized completely by 2006 but successor organizations continued to operate.

==2005: Legal framework and controversy==
Many Colombian and international observers are skeptical about the demobilization's prospects and see multiple causes for criticism. A concern shared by a high number of critics, both inside and outside the country, is that the demobilization process, if it does not provide a legal framework that contemplates the proper doses of truth, reparation and justice, could allow those who have committed human rights violations to possibly enjoy an undue degree of impunity for their crimes. A different kind of concern is held by a few of the supporters of the demobilization process, some of which believe that, without a certain degree of acceptance from the paramilitaries themselves, any unillateral attempts at reducing impunity could stay in writing and not be practically effective.

A smaller number of the critics have also expressed their fear that the current administration could integrate the AUC into its civilian defence militias or other military structures. 
Military and government spokesmen have stated multiple times that there is no intention to integrate the AUC into the state's legal security apparatus. While no reports of that occurring have been put forward yet, there have been signs of some individual paramilitaries expressing an interest in wanting to join (or form) [[private security companies]] in areas that formerly were under their influence and control, in order to prevent possible guerrilla inroads.

The debate on the subject of potential [[impunity]] has had a high profile in both the international and Colombian media, with critical views being expressed in ''[[Chicago Tribune]] ''and ''[[New York Times]] ''editorials, in addition to many Colombian outlets. The main argument of several editorials has been that the international community should not help fund the demobilization process until the necessary legal framework to minimize impunity is in place. This position was also echoed by representatives of the international community in a February 2005 donors' conference in Cartagena.

After many public and private discussions through mid-to-late 2004, in early 2005, a number of  congressmen, including Senator [[Rafael Pardo]] and [[Gina Parody]] (traditionally holding pro-government positions) and [[Wilson Borja]] (a former leftwing labor leader who survived a paramilitary assassination attempt back in 2000) among others, independently presented a multiparty draft bill that, according to several observers such as Colombian and international [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s (including Human Rights Watch), indicates a substantial improvement (compared to the government's previous initiatives) in meeting the necessary conditions of adequately dismantling paramilitarism and reducing impunity. Among these sectors, there is a semblance of a broad consensus in support of this bill.<ref name = "cipo000031">[http://www.ciponline.org/colombia/blog/archives/000031.htm www.ciponline.org - Plan Colombia and Beyond] December 07, 2004 (English)</ref><ref name = "hrwcolomb10032">[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/18/colomb10032.htm Colombia: Demobilization Scheme Ensures Injustice] hrw.org January 18, 2005 (English)</ref>

Congressional discussion on the subject was set to begin on February 15, 2005, but suffered several delays. The Colombian government's own official draft had apparently gradually incorporated several of the provisions in the Pardo, Parody and Borja proposal, but a number of disagreements remained, which would be the source for further debate on the subject. Other congressmen, including supporters of the government, also begun to present their own draft projects.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

On February 23, the top AUC leaders published an online document on their webpage which stated {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} that that they will not submit to a legal framework that, in their own words, would force them to suffer through an undue humiliation that their leftwing guerrilla foes would not contemplate for themselves. They also declared that they are in favor of laws that will allow their fighters to return to civilian and productive lives in a fair, peaceful and equitable manner. In the absence of such conditions, they claimed that the consequence would be the end of the negotiations and their preferring to face the prospect of continuing "war and death". A government communique answered that the AUC should not put pressure on Congress, the media or the Executive on the matter of the legal framework, and that they would have five days to leave the Ralito zone if they chose to quit the talks. The AUC later  reduced the tone of its earlier remarks.<ref name = "caracol">[http://www.caracol.com.co/noticias/155976.asp Caracol Radio] February 23, 2005 (Spanish)</ref>

On April 11, an AUC spokesman repeated their claims that the current proposal for amnesty was too harsh primarily because it still allowed extradition for drug charges.<ref name = "bbc4429727">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4429727.stm Colombia fighters reject amnesty] BBC April 11, 2005</ref>

==Mass extradition to the U.S.==
In the early morning of May 13, 2008, thirteen high-profile paramilitary leaders were taken from their jail cells in a surprise action by the government. According to Interior Minister [[Carlos Holguín]] they have been refusing to comply to the country's Peace and Justice Law and were therefore extradited to the United States. Amongst them are Salvatore Mancuso, Don Berna, [[Jorge 40]], [[Cuco Vanoy]] and [[Diego Ruiz Arroyave]] (cousin of assassinated paramilitary leades [[Miguel Arroyave]]).<ref>{{cite news

The [[National Movement of State Crimes]], a coalition of several victim organizations that have suffered from state or paramilitary violence, has asked "to return the paramilitary chiefs to the Colombian authorities so they may be processed by the ordinary justice system and not under the framework of the [[Law of Justice and Peace]], since this framework benefits the victimizers and not the victims, since they have not told all of the truth, have not made comprehensive reparations to the victims, and have not dismantled their criminal structures." <ref name = "ccajar">[http://www.colectivodeabogados.org/article.php3?id_article=1340#nb4 Extradition Cut Short] ‘’CCAJAR’’ May 27, 2008</ref>

The Office in Colombia of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] stated that "[...] according to Colombian law, the reasons claimed by the President of the Republic to proceed with the previously-suspended extraditions are also grounds for their removal from the application of the ‘Law of Justice and Peace’ and for the loss of the benefits established therein".<ref name = "ccajar"/>

The [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] stated that this "affects the Colombian State’s obligation to guarantee victims’ rights to truth, justice, and reparations for the crimes committed by the paramilitary groups. The extradition impedes the investigation and prosecution of such grave crimes through the avenues established by the Justice and Peace Law in Colombia and through the Colombian justice system’s regular criminal procedures. It also closes the door to the possibility that victims can participate directly in the search for truth about crimes committed during the conflict, and limits access to reparations for damages that were caused. This action also interferes with efforts to determine links between agents of the State and these paramilitary leaders." <ref name = "ccajar"/>

After his extradition to the United States, paramilitary leader [[Salvatore Mancuso]] has continued to testify via satellite as part of the Justice and Peace process. On November 18, 2008, ''[[Revista Semana]]'' reported on Mancuso's declarations about the 1997 [[El Aro massacre]], in which he stated that the AUC had received logistical help from the national military and police.<ref>{{cite news

'''Pierre Charron''' (1541 &ndash; 16 November 1603) was a [[France|French]] 16th-century Catholic theologian and [[philosopher]], and a disciple and contemporary of [[Michel Montaigne]].

==Biography==
[[File:Pierre Charron.jpg|thumb|right|Pierre Charron's obituary]]
Pierre Charron was born in [[Paris]], one of the twenty-five children of a bookseller.  After studying [[law]] at [[Orléans]] and [[Bourges]] he practiced as an advocate, for a few years.<ref>[http://www.archive.org/stream/newschaffherzog29haucgoog#page/n40/mode/2up ''Schaff-Herzog'' article]</ref> He then entered the church and soon became a popular priest, rising to become a canon.

He moved to the southwest of France, invited by [[Arnaud de Pontac]], [[Bishop of Bazas]].<ref name = Annales>http://www.archive.org/stream/annalesdumidi3132univuoft#page/102/mode/2up</ref> He was appointed priest in ordinary to [[Marguerite de Valois]], wife of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV of Navarre]]. In about 1588, Charron decided to become a monk, but being rejected by both the [[Carthusian]]s and the [[Celestines]], he returned to his old profession. He delivered a course of sermons at [[Angers]], and in the next year moved to [[Bordeaux]], where he formed a famous friendship with [[Michel de Montaigne]].  On Montaigne's death, in 1592, Charron was requested in the will to bear the Montaigne arms.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pierre Charron}}</ref>

From 1594, he used his own name; he spent from 1594 to 1600 under the protection of [[Antoine Hérbrard de Saint-Sulpice]],<ref name = Annales/> [[Bishop of Cahors]], who appointed him grand vicar and theological canon. His first book led to his being chosen deputy to the [[general assembly of the clergy]], for which he became chief secretary.

Charron retired to [[Condom, Gers|Condom]] in 1600; he died suddenly of a stroke; his works were then receiving attention.<ref name=Popkin/><ref name=Gale>[http://www.answers.com/topic/pierre-charron ''Gale Dictionary of Philosophy'']</ref>

==Works==
Charron first published his works anonymously. Later he wrote under the name of "Benoit Vaillant, Advocate of the Holy Faith." While Charron's reading of Montaigne is now considered dogmatic and indeed something of a distortion, it was important in its time and during the 17th century as a whole.<ref>http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/montaigne/</ref>

===''Les Trois Vérités''===
In 1594, he published a long work, ''[[Les Trois Vérités]],'' in which Charron sought to prove that there is a [[God]] and a true religion, that the true religion is [[Christian]]ity, and that the true church is [[Roman Catholicism]]. It was a response to the [[Protestant]] work ''Le Traité de l'Eglise,'' by [[Philippe de Mornay]]. In the second edition (1595), there is an elaborate reply to criticisms of the third ''Vérité'' by a Protestant writer. ''Les Trois Vérités'' ran through several editions.

===''Discours chretiens''===
Then followed, in 1600, ''[[Discours chretiens]],'' a book of sermons with a similar tone, half of which is about the [[Eucharist]] {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.

===''De la sagesse''===
[[File:De la sagesse - 1607.jpg|thumb|250px|left|De la sagesse : trois livres / par Pierre Charron. – 3me ed. rev. et augm.– Paris : David Deuceur Libraire Iuré, 1607.]]
In 1601, Charron published in [[Bordeaux]] his third work, ''[[De la sagesse]],'' a system of [[moral philosophy]] that develops ideas of [[Montaigne]].<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-39748-3 | page = 315 | editors = Charles B. Schmitt, Quentin Skinner (eds.) | last1 = Kraye | first1 = Jill | title = The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy | chapter = Moral Philosophy | year = 1990}}</ref> Charron also connected Montaigne's [[scepticism]] with the anti-rational strand in Christianity.<ref name=Popkin>[[Richard Popkin]], ''The History of Scepticism from Erasmus to Spinoza'' (1979), p. 56-7.</ref>  It received the support of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] and of magistrate [[Pierre Jeannin]]. A second revised edition appeared in 1603, supported by [[Claude Dormy]], the second [[Bishop of Boulogne]].<ref name=Popkin/>

''De la sagesse'' also was attacked, in particular by the [[Jesuit]] [[François Garasse]] (1585–1631), who described Charron as an [[atheist]].
[[File:De la Sagesse (Of Wisdom).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Pierre Charron; "Of Wisdom" London: Printed for Nathaniel Ranew and Jonathan Robinson, 1670]]
A summary and defence of the book, written shortly before his death, appeared in 1606. In 1604, Charron's friend [[Michel de la Roche]] prefixed a "Life" to an edition of ''De la sagesse,'' which depicts Charron as an amiable man of good character. His complete works, with this contribution by de la Roche, were published in 1635. An abridgment of the ''Sagesse'' is given in [[Wilhelm Gottlieb Tennemann]]'s ''Philosophie'', vol. ix. An edition with notes by A. Duval appeared in 1820. It was translated into English as ''Of Wisdome'' (1612) by [[Samson Lennard]];<ref>''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Lennard, Samson (d 1633), genealogist and translator, by [[Thompson Cooper]]. Published 1892.</ref> and again by [[George Stanhope]] (1697).<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Stanhope, George}}</ref> 

==Views==
;Influences
Apart from the major influence of Montaigne, Charron took from [[Raymond of Sabunde]] (Sibiuda).<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O_FrVmnY8EMC&pg=PA247&lpg=PA247&dq=%22Les+Trois+V%C3%A9rit%C3%A9s%22+Charron&source=bl&ots=GzKnVA6oP9&sig=xmrUxxH2agJfF6bLH5z7Qf0NpBE&hl=en&ei=DDHBTc62Asms8QONxOS8BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&q=%22Les%20Trois%20V%C3%A9rit%C3%A9s%22%20Charron&f=false Emmanuel Faye, ''Philosophie et perfection de l'homme: de la Renaissance à Descartes'']</ref> Another influence was [[neostoicism]], as handled by [[Justus Lipsius]].<ref>http://www.iep.utm.edu/neostoic/</ref>

;Psychology
According to Charron, the [[soul]], located in the [[Ventricular system|ventricles]] of the [[brain]], is affected by the temperament of the individual; the dry temperament produces acute intelligence; the moist, memory; the hot, imagination. Dividing the intelligent soul into these three faculties, he writes the branches of science corresponding with each. On the nature of the soul, he quotes opinions. The belief in its [[immortality of the soul|immortality]], he says, is the most universal of beliefs, but the most feebly supported by reason. As to a human's power of attaining truth, he declares that none of our faculties enable us to distinguish truth from error. In comparing humans with animals, Charron insists that there are no breaks in nature. Though inferior in some respects, in others, animals are superior. Namely, humanity's essential qualities are vanity, weakness, inconstancy, and presumption.

;Theology
Charron writes that all religions teach that God is to be appeased by prayers, presents, vows, but especially, and, most irrationally, by human suffering {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. Each religion is said by its devotees to have commenced by [[divine inspiration]]. A human is a [[Christian]], [[Jew]], or [[Muslim]], before he or she knows that they are persons. Furthermore, he writes that one religion is built upon another.

While Charron declares religion to be "strange to common sense," the practical result at which he arrives is that one is not to sit in judgment on his or her faith, but to be "simple and obedient," and to submit to public authority{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. He writes that this is one rule of wisdom with regard to religion. Another equally important is to avoid [[superstition]], which he defines as the belief that God is like a hard judge who, eager to find fault, narrowly examines our slightest act, that he is vengeful and hard to appease, and that, therefore, he must be flattered and won over by pain and sacrifice.

Charron states that true [[piety]], which is the first of duties, is the knowledge of God and of one's self; the latter knowledge being necessary to the former. The belief that what God sends is all good, and that all the bad is from ourselves is the abasing of humanity and the exalting of God. It leads to spiritual worship, for external ceremony is merely for our advantage, not for his glory.

;Politics
Charron is a founder of modern [[secularism]]. He declares the sovereign to be the source of law, and asserts that popular freedom is dangerous.

[[File:Wilhelm Gottlieb Tennemann (1761-1819).jpg|thumb|Wilhelm Gottlieb Tennemann (1761–1819).]]
'''Wilhelm Gottlieb Tennemann''' (7 December 1761 – 30 September 1819) was a [[Germany|German]] [[historian]] of [[philosophy]].

He was born and educated at [[Erfurt]]. In 1788, he became a lecturer on the [[history of philosophy]] at the [[University of Jena]]. Ten years later he became a professor at the same university, where he remained till 1804. His great work is an eleven-volume history of philosophy (''Geschichte der Philosophie''), which he began at Jena and finished at the [[University of Marburg]], where he was professor of philosophy from 1804 till his death. He was one of the numerous German philosophers who accepted the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] theory as a revelation.

In 1812 he published a shorter history of philosophy (''Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophie für den akademischen Unterricht''), which was translated into English in 1832 under the title ''Manual of the History of Philosophy''.

He died at [[Marburg]].

'''Fernand Oury''' (18 January 1920 &ndash; 19 February 1997) was a [[pedagogue]] and creator of modern [[France|French]] [[school]]ing. He recommended and practiced a "school of the people" methodology, in which children are no longer the passive ones "taught", but the people with a whole share in managing their training and the everyday life of their classes.{{huh|date=December 2011}}  Elements of this methodology were pupils' councils, school funds, and individualized curricula.

==Background==
As a teacher in 1950, Oury reacted to the what he saw as the deplorable state of the French educational system: "overloaded classes", "colossal school sizes", and "absurd regulations". Along with fellow educator [[Célestin Freinet]], he worked with school leadership to reform organizational practice within urban schools. By 1958, following on the initiatives of Institutional [[Psychotherapy]] led by his brother [[Jean Oury]], [[François Tosquelles]], and [[Lucien Bonnafe]], Fernand Oury founded the discipline of [[institutional pedagogy]], the object of which would be the progressive analysis of liberating means of [[education]]. Perhaps the most well-known name in the field of institutional pedagogy, Oury maintained an open relationship with respect to defining the scope and practice of teaching. 

By 1966, Oury and psychoanalyst [[Aïda Vasquez]], along with the Groupe Techniques Éducatives (GET) begin to work out the practical and theoretical instruments institutional pedogagy would develop as a practice. This was accomplished primarily through the elaboration of [[monograph]]s. The practice of publishing articles of analysis, case-studies and critiques also began to be encouraged. 

In 1978, Oury and others established CEPI, the Collective of Teams of Institutional Pedagogy (French ''Le Collectif des Équipes de Pédagogie Institutionnelle''), and the MPI, Association for the Support of Institutional Pedogagy (''Association Maintenant la Pédagogie Institutionnelle''), both still in existence. Their primary tasks are the publication and dissemination of institutional pedagogic literature, reports, analyses and case-studies, the promotion and activism in favour of progressive pedagogic practices, and the education of teachers, social workers and others in Institutional Pedagogic practices.

===Pillars of institutional pedagogy===
Oury's framework of [[wiktionary:Analysis|analysis]] initially consisted of three pillars of consideration (1964):

#[[Materialism|Materialist]]: the equipment, the techniques of organisation and initiating activities, consideration of concrete situations, and concrete relations. 
#[[Sociology|Sociological]]: consideration of the class, groups and grouping of groups and classes and effects; intercommunications and phenomena within groups that overdetermine behaviour and evolutions of the students. 
#[[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytic]]: to quote Oury "acknowledged or disclaimed, the unconscious is in the class and it speak... It is better to understand that to be subjected it."

'''Biochemists''' are scientists trained in [[biochemistry]]. Typical biochemists study chemical processes and chemical transformations in living organisms, other biochemists study DNAs, proteins and cell parts. The word "biochemist" is a [[portmanteau]] of "biological chemist". 

Biochemists also research how certain chemical reactions happen in cells and tissues and observe and record the effects of products as in food additives and medicines. The main function of a biochemist is to focus on improving the qualities of lives.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biochemist: Profile and Recommended Education for a Career in Biochemistry|url=http://education-portal.com/articles/Biochemist_Profile_and_Recommended_Education_for_a_Career_in_Biochemistry.html|publisher=Education Portal|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref>

Biochemist researchers focus on planning and conducting research experiments, mainly for developing new products, updating existing products and analyzing said products. It is also the responsibility of a biochemist to present their research findings and create grant proposals to obtain funds for future research.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biochemist|url=http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/science-engineering-careers/BioChem_biochemist_c001.shtml#onthejob|publisher=Science Buddies|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref>

Biochemists study aspects of the immune system, the expressions of genes, isolating, analyzing, and synthesizing different products, mutations that lead to cancers, and manage laboratory teams and monitor laboratory work. Biochemists also have to have the capabilities of designing and building laboratory equipment and devise new methods of producing correct results for products.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biochemistry & Biophysicists|url=http://www.myplan.com/careers/biochemists-and-biophysicists/summary-19-1021.00.html|publisher=My Plan|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref>

The most common industry role is the development of biochemical products and processes. Identifying substances' chemical and physical properties in biological systems is of great importance, and can be carried out by doing various types of analysis. Biochemists must also prepare technical reports after collecting, analyzing and summarizing the information and trends found.

In biochemistry, researchers often break down complicated biological systems into their component parts. They study the effects of foods, drugs, allergens and other substances on living tissues; they research molecular biology, the study of life at the molecular level and the study of genes and gene expression; and they study chemical reactions in metabolism, growth, reproduction, and heredity, and apply techniques drawn from biotechnology and genetic engineering to help them in their research. About 75% work in either basic or applied research; those in applied research take basic research and employ it for the benefit of medicine, agriculture, veterinary science, environmental science, and manufacturing. Each of these fields allows specialization; for example, clinical biochemists can work in hospital laboratories to understand and treat diseases, and industrial biochemists can be involved in analytical research work, such as checking the purity of food and beverages.

Biochemists in the field of agriculture research the interactions between herbicides with plants. They examine the relationships of compounds, determining their ability to inhibit growth, and evaluate the toxicological effects surrounding life.

Biochemists also prepare pharmaceutical compounds for commercial distribution.

==Training==
Some of the job skills and abilities that one needs to attain to be successful in this field of work are that you need to be successful in science, mathematics, reading comprehension, writing, and critical thinking.  These skills are critical because of experimental techniques that are used and because you must have to convey orally and written the trends found in your research.

Biochemists also need to understand inductive reasoning to take different concept and information to make develop theories, conclusions and finding a correlation between events that have no relation.  With this biochemist must understand deductive reasoning as well. This means taking general information and piecing it together to arrive to a logical conclusion.

A degree in biochemistry or a related science such as [[chemistry]] is the minimum requirement for any work in this field. This is sufficient for a position as a technical assistant in industry or in academic settings. A Ph.D. (or equivalent) is generally required to pursue or direct independent research. To advance further in commercial environments, one may need to acquire skills in [[management]].

Biochemists must pass a qualifying exam or a preliminary exam to continue their studies when receiving a Ph. D. in biochemistry. (Biochemistry Training Programs and Requirements)

Biochemistry requires an understanding of [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[inorganic chemistry]]. All types of chemistry are required, with emphasis on biochemistry, organic chemistry and [[physical chemistry]]. Basic classes in [[biology]], including [[microbiology]], [[molecular biology]], [[molecular genetics]], [[cell biology]], and [[genomics]], are focused on. Some instruction in experimental techniques and quantification is also part of most curricula.

In the private industries for businesses, it is imperative to possess strong business management skills as well as communication skills. Biochemists must also be familiar with regulatory rules and management techniques.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biochemistry Training Programs and Requirements|url=http://education-portal.com/biochemistry_training.html|publisher=Education Portal|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref>

==Employment==
Biochemists are typically employed in the [[life sciences]], where they work in the [[pharmaceutical]] or [[biotechnology]] industry in a research role. They are also employed in academic institutes, where in addition to pursuing their research they may also be involved with teaching undergraduates, training graduate students, and collaborating with post-doctoral fellows.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that jobs in the biochemist, combined with the statistics of biophysicists, field would increase by 31% between 2004 and 2014 because of the demand in medical research and development of new drugs and products, and the preservation of the environment.

Because of a biochemists' background in both biology and chemistry, they may also be employed in the medical, industrial, governmental, and environmental fields. Slightly more than half of the biological scientists are employed by the Federal State and local governments. The field of medicine includes [[nutrition]], [[genetics]], [[biophysics]], and [[pharmacology]]; industry includes beverage and food technology, [[toxicology]], and [[vaccine]] production; while the governmental and environmental fields includes [[forensic science]], [[wildlife management]], [[marine biology]], and [[viticulture]].

The average income of a biochemist was $68,950 in May 2004. The National Association of Colleges and Employers reports that the beginning salary offers in July 2005 averaged $31,258 a year for bachelor's degree recipients in biological and life sciences. The Federal Government in 2005 reported the average salaries in different fields associated with biochemistry and being a biochemist.  General biological scientists in nonsupervisory, supervisory, and managerial positions earned an average salary of $69,908; microbiologists, $80,798; ecologists, $72,021; physiologists, $93,208; geneticists, $85,170; zoologists, $101,601; and botanists, $62,207

The '''Oregon Museum of Science and Industry''' ('''OMSI''', {{IPAc-en|?|?|m|z|i?}} {{respell|OM|zee}}) is a science and technology [[museum]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], United States.  It contains three auditoriums, including a large-screen theatre, planetarium, and exhibition halls with a variety of hands-on permanent exhibits focused on natural sciences, industry, and technology.  Transient exhibits span a wider range of disciplines.

==History==
Beginning in 1903, odd artifacts were displayed in hallways and alcoves in Portland City Hall arranged by Colonel L. L. Hawkins.
When the collection was evicted in 1936, about 12,000 artifacts were stored throughout the city.<ref name="OE">{{cite web

[[File:Old OMSI complex in Washington Park in 1994.jpg|thumb|left|OMSI at its 1958–1992 location, with [[planetarium]] building in front]]
On November 5, 1944, the Oregon Museum Foundation was founded with the mission of establishing an Oregon Museum of History, Science, and Industry. It displayed its first collection of natural history objects at the [[Portland Hotel]].  Subsequent small exhibits occurred around town to generate interest and donations.  In 1949, a house at 908 NE Hassalo was donated to establish the museum. Within a year, the Pacific Northwest's first public [[planetarium]] opened in a dome on the front lawn.<ref name="OE"/>

By 1955, OMSI's annual attendance had grown to 25,000. The need for expansion led to volunteers building a new site at [[Washington Park (Portland, Oregon)|Washington Park]], completing the original goal of a hands-on museum. (That building is now occupied by the [[Portland Children's Museum]].)  This opened to the public on August 3, 1958,<ref name="OE"/><ref name=oreg1958aug4>"Opening of Science and Industry Museum Draws 4,000".

''The Sunday Oregonian'', June 8, 1958, p. 16.</ref> A planetarium was again included.<ref name=oreg1958aug4/> The new building at the southwest corner of what was then Hoyt Park<ref name=oreg1958june8/> (now part of Washington Park) was located adjacent to the then-new site of the [[Oregon Zoo|Portland Zoo]] (now the Oregon Zoo), which began a one-year phased move in the same month as the new OMSI opened.<ref name=oreg1958june9>"Many See Zoo, Train". ''The Oregonian'', June 9, 1958, p. 15.</ref> The two attractions remained neighbors, sharing a parking lot, until 1992.  The planetarium at the Washington Park site was originally a 90-seat<ref name=oreg1958jun13>"Space Film At OMSI". ''The Oregonian'', June 13, 1958, p. 35.</ref> facility housed in a "temporary" dome, but in 1967 it was replaced by a larger, 142-seat facility in a distinctive [[dodecahedron]] (12-sided) building equipped with a new projector.<ref name=oreg1967dec15>"New OMSI Planetarium Offers Story Of Stars". ''The Oregonian'', December 15, 1967, p. 41.</ref>

===1992 move===
[[File:OMSI.jpg|thumb|OMSI viewed from the [[Willamette River]]]]
By the mid-1980s, 600,000 people per year were visiting the building, which was designed for only 100,000. Expansion at the Washington Park site was deemed infeasible, and in 1986 it was announced that the museum would move to a new location on the east bank of the [[Willamette River]], where a much larger building would be constructed.<ref name="OE"/>  Property that included the historic [[Portland General Electric Company Station "L" Group|Station L power plant]] was donated by [[Portland General Electric]], and building construction was paid for by a fundraising campaign.  In 1992, OMSI opened at the new site,<ref name="OE"/> which continues to be the current location.  The construction integrated the existing PGE turbine building and included the creation of a 330-seat [[IMAX#IMAX Dome / OMNIMAX|OMNIMAX theater]]. The facility also includes a 200-seat planetarium with Digistar 3 technology.

===21st century===
In 2004 the Turbine Hall was closed from September through November for renovations in which the Discovery Space and Technology Lab changed places and a new Inventors Ballroom was added. Also added were a small stage area for public exhibit demonstrations and a bridge connecting a new metal staircase with the mezzanine exhibits.

The museum started planning for an expansion of the facility in 2006.<ref name="on hold">{{cite news | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2010/03/expansion_plans_for_portlands.html | title=Expansion, development plans for Portland's OMSI, nearby land put on hold | last=Beaven | first=Steve | date=March 22, 2010 | newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> In 2008, OMSI began finalizing the plans for the expansion, which was estimated to cost about $500&nbsp;million and would double the size of the museum.<ref name="big expansion">{{cite news | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2008/11/omsi_invites_ideas_for_big_exp.html | title=OMSI invites ideas for big expansion | last=Ereline | first=Ann | date=November 15, 2008 | newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> They began working to secure the funds for the expansion the next year, but decided to hold off on the plans in 2010 after the poor economy had made it difficult to try and raise funds for the project.<ref name="on hold"/><ref name="big expansion"/>

==Exhibits and attractions==
OMSI has five different specialized exhibit halls, a planetarium, and a submarine exhibit.

===USS ''Blueback''===
[[Image:USS Blueback SS 581 - Portland OR.jpg|thumb|right|The {{USS|Blueback|SS-581|6}} [[submarine]] at rest on the [[Willamette River]] in front of OMSI. The [[Marquam Bridge|Marquam]] and [[Hawthorne Bridge|Hawthorne]] bridges are in the background.]]
The {{USS|Blueback|SS-581}} was purchased by OMSI in February 1994. This [[submarine]] appeared in the 1990 film ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' before being towed to its present location, a pier adjacent to the museum.<ref>[http://www.omsi.edu/visit/submarine/ USS Blueback Submarine]</ref>  It was opened to the public on May 15, 1994, and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in September 2008.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2008/10/omsi_submarine_listed_on_natio.html | title=OMSI submarine listed on National Register | last=Green | first=Susan | date=October 14, 2008 | newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20081010.HTM | title=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 9/29/08 through 10/03/08 | date=October 10, 2008 | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> The propeller is a National Submarine Memorial located outside of the main museum area, beside the [[Eastbank Esplanade]]. The submarine is available for daily guided tours and summer camps.

===Featured Exhibit Hall===
The Featured Exhibit Hall is used for temporary exhibits created by OMSI or brought in from museums around the world.  Past exhibits have included "Grossology" (Winter–Spring 2001), "Giants of the Gobi" (1997), "A T-rex named Sue" (September 2001&nbsp;– January 2002), and "CSI, The Experience" (May–September, 2009).  [[Gunther von Hagens]]' ''[[Body Worlds|Body Worlds 3]]'', opened on June 7, 2007, and closed on October 7, 2007.  By late September 2007, 300,000 people had seen ''Body Worlds 3'', setting the record as OMSI's most visited traveling exhibit.<ref>[http://www.oregonlive.com/science/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/science/1190764510124220.xml&coll=7/ Body Worlds 3 sets OMSI attendance record]</ref>

===Turbine Hall===
[[File:OMSI Turbine Hall 2 - Portland, Oregon.JPG|thumb|Turbine Hall]]
The Turbine Hall is named for the large retired [[steam turbine]] from its days as a PGE power plant. It features exhibits about engineering, physics, chemistry, and space travel. The Turbine Hall has two floors. On the main floor are the large exhibits and ''enrichment areas.'' On the mezzanine there are smaller exhibits that emphasize properties of physics. In 2013, the physics exhibits in the mezzanine were replaced by a revolving National Geographic Photography Exhibit.

The Innovation Station includes hands-on exhibits related to technology and invention. Laboratories for physics, chemistry, technology, and laser [[holography]] are connected to the Turbine Hall.

The Chemistry Lab is the first hands-on wet [[chemistry]] [[laboratory]] in the nation. There are six stations that allow visitors to learn about chemical interactions by participating in experiments that share a common theme. Themes rotate weekly and include the chemistry of toys, the nature of matter, [[biochemistry]], environmental chemistry, industrial chemistry, chemical reactions, everyday chemistry, and crime scene chemistry. Chemical reaction demonstrations are given daily and are often related to the weekly theme.

Physics Lab exhibits include a [[Van de Graaff generator]] (a static electricity generator), motion detectors, electrical circuits, [[Morse code]], magnets, computers that simulate basic properties of physics, and musical instruments.

The Laser/Holography Lab, which is open for approximately one hour every day, presents 30-minute demonstrations constructing a hologram.

The Vernier Technology Lab investigates the impact of technology on society. Rotating interactive exhibits allow visitors to investigate technologies such as robots and computers, security technology, [[biomedical]] technology, [[communication]]s technology, and household technology. Visitors can also use a wide variety of educational software on internet-connected computers.

===Life Sciences Hall===
The Life Sciences Hall, on the second floor of the museum, offers exhibits about biology. These include a collection of preserved fetuses at nearly every stage of development, from a few weeks after conception to full-term, and the exhibit Amazing Feats of Aging, which is concerned with the biology of aging. One of the features of this exhibit is the Age Machine, a computer program that allows visitors to capture, and then "age" a picture of themselves.<ref>[http://www.omsi.edu/visit/life/aging/exhibit.cfm/ Amazing Feats of Aging]</ref> The Life Sciences Hall also contains the Life Science Laboratory and the Earth Science Hall.

The Life Sciences Laboratory houses a wide variety of live animals, such as rats, walking sticks, chameleons, [[Madagascar Hissing Cockroach]]es, other mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and insects.  Volunteers and staff members demonstrate and lead a variety of a group activities such as owl pellet dissections and exploration of the differences between male and female skulls and pelvises.

===Earth Science Hall===
The Earth Science Hall, located on the second floor, features geology-oriented exhibits and two specialized laboratories. The Watershed Laboratory gives visitors an experience in constructing an erosion cycle out of a river physical model. Visitors can learn about the life cycle of [[salmon]] and investigate microscopic organisms from local waterways through a videomicroscope. Visitors to the Paleontology Laboratory watch staff members and volunteers excavating fossils, such as dinosaur bones.

===Science Playground===
[[File:OMSI science playground - Portland, Oregon.JPG|thumb|The Science Playground on the second level]]
The Science Playground, the early childhood education area on the second floor of the museum, is designed for families with newborn to six-year-old children. The area is fully enclosed and designed to keep children visible and secure, while giving them freedom to explore at will. Its purpose is to give children the opportunity to develop interactive scientific learning through play. It contains a variety of experimental stations intended to encourage natural curiosity including a stimulating infant area, a giant sandbox, a water area, a reading area, and physical science exhibits. The area is staffed by trained specialists in early childhood education. There is also a Parent Resource Corner with reference materials on topics ranging from the developing brain to behavior intervention techniques.

The Animal Secrets exhibit encourages children and parents to explore the hidden habitats and lives of forest animals. Visitors can crawl through the roots of a discovery tree, look for animals in a cave and a chipmunk den, play in a woodland stream, and be a naturalist for a day. Animal Secrets features English and Spanish text panels.

The Discovery Laboratory offers rotating experiments and activities such as exploring Flubber or ice cube painting. Themed Discovery Drawers encourage parents to teach their own children about the contents.  OMSI is a member of [[Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network]], and participates in NanoDays.

===Planetarium===
Computer-aided astronomy and laser light shows are performed daily in the Harry C. Kendall Planetarium (previously the M. J. Murdock Sky Theater).

==Auditoriums==
[[File:OMSI OMNIMAX exterior - Portland, Oregon.JPG|thumb|Exterior of the former OMNIMAX theater, which closed in 2013 for conversion to a flat-screen theater]]
OMSI contains both an ultra-large-screen theater (which replaced an OMNIMAX theater in 2013) and a large auditorium with a stage where annual events such as science fairs occur. Science fairs that take place in the main auditorium include OHSU's Brain Awareness, Safety Safari, and the Reptile and Amphibian Show. The auditorium is also used for private events.

==Educational outreach==
OMSI operates the largest science museum outreach program in the country.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The museum offers presentations in schools, summer science camp programs for individuals, and outdoor school programs for school groups on the [[Oregon Coast]], in the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] and in the [[John Day Fossil Beds National Monument]]. OMSI is a frequent site for [[field trip]]s, primarily for grades K-12, from all over the region.

==Funding and volunteer support==
OMSI is a non-profit organization and is funded by admissions, member contributions, public, and private donations, community agencies, federal grants, and fundraising events. The largest OMSI fundraising event each year is the OMSI Gala:  a black tie party in May where visitors gather to show support for science education.<ref>[http://www.omsi.edu/gala OMSI Gala]</ref>

Although it is staffed with full and part-time employees, much of the museum is dependent on volunteers who perform many of the same duties as staff members such as greeting visitors, customer service, and performing exhibit demonstrations. The volunteers include high school and college students as well as other community members. Volunteers serve in a wide range of areas within the museum both on-stage and off. After 50 hours of service, all volunteers receive a free, one-year museum membership.

Rising Stars, OMSI's youth volunteer program, takes place both during the summer and during the school year. As a part of the program, participants attend weekly classes focusing on developing communication and customer service skills and practice these skills by performing demonstrations on the museum floor. Participants also develop an original science demonstration for presentation to the public at the end of each session.<ref>[http://www.omsi.edu/risingstars  Youth Volunteer Program]</ref>

'''Henry Thomas Buckle''' (24 November 1821 – 29 May 1862) was an English [[historian]], author of an unfinished ''History of Civilization'' and a very strong amateur [[chess]] player.

==Early life and education==
Buckle was born the son of Thomas Henry Buckle, a wealthy [[London]] [[merchant]] and shipowner, he was born at [[Lee, London|Lee]] in [[Kent]]. His delicate health prevented him obtaining much formal education; he never attended university and was little at school. However, he received a high degree of education privately, and the love of reading he felt as a child was given many outlets. He first gained distinction as a chess player, being known, before he was twenty, as one of the best in the world. In matchplay he defeated [[Lionel Kieseritzky|Kieseritsky]] and [[Johann Löwenthal|Loewenthal]].<ref name=chessgames>{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessplayer?pid=10323|title=Henry Thomas Buckle|work=chessgames.com|accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> After his father's death in January 1840, he inherited an ample fortune and a large library, and travelled with his mother on the continent (1840–1844). He had by then resolved to direct all his reading and to devote all his energies to the preparation of some great historical work. Over the next seventeen years, he is said to have spent ten hours a day on it.

==Career==
At first, Buckle planned a history of the [[Middle Ages]], but by 1851 he had decided in favour of a history of [[civilization]]. The next six years were occupied in writing, altering and revising the first volume, which appeared in June 1857. It made its author a literary and social [[celebrity]]. On 19 March 1858 he delivered a public [[lecture]] at the [[Royal Institution]] (the only one he ever gave) on the ''Influence of Women on the Progress of Knowledge'',<ref>[http://www.public.coe.edu/~theller/soj/u-rel/buckle.html Text of the lecture]</ref> which was published in ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' for April 1858, and reprinted in the first volume of his ''Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works''.

{{wikisource|Buckle as a Chess Player}}
On 1 April 1859, his mother died. It was under the immediate impression of his loss that he concluded a review he was writing of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''Essay on Liberty'' with an argument for immortality, based on the yearning of the affections to regain communion with the beloved dead—on the impossibility of standing up and living, if we believed the separation were final. The review appeared in ''Fraser's Magazine'', and is to be found also in the ''Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works'' (1872).

The second volume of Buckle's history was published in May 1861. In October,<ref>{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|year=1863|publisher=D. Appleton & Company|location=New York|page=201|url=http://archive.org/stream/1862appletonsan02newyuoft#page/n208/mode/1up}}</ref> he left England to travel for the sake of his health. He spent the winter of 1861-62 in [[Egypt]], from which he went over the deserts of [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and of [[Edom]] to [[Syria]], reaching [[Jerusalem]] on 19 April 1862. After eleven days he set out for Europe by way of [[Beirut]], but at [[Nazareth]] he developed [[typhoid fever]], and later died at [[Damascus]].

===''History of Civilization in England''===
Buckle's fame rests mainly on his ''History of Civilization in England''. It is a gigantic unfinished introduction, of which the plan was, first to state the general principles of the author's method and the general laws that govern the course of human progress—and secondly, to exemplify these principles and laws through the histories of certain nations characterized by prominent and peculiar features—[[Spain]] and [[Scotland]], the [[United States]] and [[Germany]].  The completed work was to have extended to 14 volumes; its chief ideas are:
#That, owing partly to the want of ability in historians, and partly to the complexity of social phenomena, extremely little had as yet been done towards discovering the principles that govern the character and destiny of nations, or, in other words, towards establishing a science of history
#That, while the theological dogma of predestination is a barren hypothesis beyond the province of knowledge, and the metaphysical dogma of free will rests on an erroneous belief in the infallibility of consciousness, it is proved by science, and especially by statistics, that human actions are governed by laws as fixed and regular as those that rule in the physical world
#That climate, soil, food, and the aspects of nature are the primary causes of intellectual progress,--the first three indirectly, through determining the accumulation and distribution of wealth, and the last by directly influencing the accumulation and distribution of thought, the imagination being stimulated and the understanding subdued when the phenomena of the external world are sublime and terrible, the understanding being emboldened and the imagination curbed when they are small and feeble
#That the great division between European and non-European civilization turns on the fact that in Europe man is stronger than nature, and that elsewhere nature is stronger than man, the consequence of which is that in Europe alone has man subdued nature to his service
#That the advance of European civilization is characterized by a continually diminishing influence of physical laws, and a continually increasing influence of mental laws
#That the mental laws that regulate the progress of society cannot be discovered by the metaphysical method, that is, by the introspective study of the individual mind, but only by such a comprehensive survey of facts as enable us to eliminate disturbances, that is, by the method of averages
#That human progress has been due, not to moral agencies, which are stationary, and which balance one another in such a manner that their influence is unfelt over any long period, but to intellectual activity, which has been constantly varying and advancing: "The actions of individuals are greatly affected by their moral feelings and passions; but these being antagonistic to the passions and feelings of other individuals, are balanced by them, so that their effect is, in the great average of human affairs, nowhere to be seen, and the total actions of mankind, considered as a whole, are left to be regulated by the total knowledge of which mankind is possessed"
#That individual efforts are insignificant in the great mass of human affairs, and that great men, although they exist, and must "at present" be looked upon as disturbing forces, are merely the creatures of the age to which they belong
#That religion, literature and government are, at the best, the products and not the causes of civilization
#That the progress of civilization varies directly as "scepticism," the disposition to doubt and to investigate, and inversely as "credulity" or "the protective spirit," a disposition to maintain, without examination, established beliefs and practices.

Buckle is remembered for treating history as an exact science, which is why many of his ideas have passed into the common literary stock, and have been more precisely elaborated by later writers on sociology and history because of his careful scientific analyses. Nevertheless, his work is not free from one-sided views and generalisations resting on insufficient data.

A '''racing video game''' is a genre of [[video game]]s, either in the [[First person (video games)|first-person]] or [[virtual camera system|third-person perspective]], in which the player partakes in a [[racing|racing competition]] with any type of land, air, or sea [[vehicle]]s. They may be based on anything from real-world racing leagues to entirely fantastical settings. In general, they can be distributed along a spectrum anywhere between hardcore [[simulation video game|simulations]], and simpler [[arcade game|arcade]] racing games. Racing games may also fall under the category of [[sports game]]s.

== History ==

===1970s===
In 1973, [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]]'s ''[[Space Race (video game)|Space Race]]'' was a space-themed [[arcade game]] where players controlled spaceships that race against opposing ships, while avoiding comets and meteors. It was a competitive [[Multiplayer|two-player]] game controlled using a two-way joystick, and was presented in [[black and white]] graphics.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=9681|name=Space Race}}</ref> The same year, [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] released a similar space-themed racing game ''Astro Race'', which used an early four-way [[joystick]].<ref>{{KLOV game|id=6949|name=Astro Race}}</ref>

The following year, Taito released ''[[Tomohiro Nishikado#Speed Race|Speed Race]]'', an early driving racing game designed by [[Tomohiro Nishikado]] (of ''[[Space Invaders]]'' fame).<ref name="Kohler-16">Chris Kohler (2005), ''Power-up: how Japanese video games gave the world an extra life'', p. 16, [[BradyGames]], ISBN 978-0-7440-0424-3</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=May 6, 2009|title=Interview: 'Space Invaders' creator Tomohiro Nishikado|work=[[USA Today]]|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2009/05/66479041/1|accessdate=2011-03-22}}</ref>  The game's most important innovation was its introduction of [[scrolling]] graphics, specifically [[Overhead perspective|overhead]] vertical scrolling,<ref name="Barton-197">Bill Loguidice & Matt Barton (2009), ''Vintage games: an insider look at the history of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the most influential games of all time'', p. 197, [[Focal Press]], ISBN 978-0-240-81146-8</ref> with the course width becoming wider or narrower as the player's car moves up the road, while the player races against other [[Artificial intelligence|rival cars]], more of which appear as the [[Score (game)|score]] increases. It also featured an early [[racing wheel]] [[Game controller|controller]] interface with an [[Throttle|accelerator]], [[gear shift]], [[speedometer]] and [[tachometer]]. It could be played in either single-player or alternating two-player, where each player attempts to beat the other's score.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=9709|name=Speed Race}}</ref> The game was re-branded as ''Wheels'' by [[Midway Games]] for released in the United States and was influential on later racing games.<ref name="Barton-197" /> That same year, [[Atari]] released another early car driving game in the arcades, ''[[Gran Trak 10]]'', which presented an overhead single-screen view of the track in low resolution [[white on black]] graphics, on which the player races against the clock around a track to accumulate points; while challenging, it was not competition racing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=463 |title=Gran Trak 10 |accessdate=2012-07-09 |date=2012-07-09 |publisher=The Arcade Flyer Archive}}</ref>

[[File:Fonz 1976 sega arcade.PNG|150px|thumb|''[[Fonz (arcade)|Fonz]]'' (1976)]]

In 1976, Taito released ''[[List of Taito games|Crashing Race]]'', a simultaneous two-player competitive car racing game where each player must try to crash as many computer-controlled cars as possible to score points, and the player with the most points wins.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=7422|name=Crashing Race}}</ref> [[Sega]]'s ''Road Race'', released in February 1976,<ref>http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=road-race&page=detail&id=14493</ref> introduced a three-dimensional, [[Third person (video games)|third-person]]  roadside scene of the race, displaying a constantly changing forward-scrolling S-shaped road with two obstacle race cars moving along the road that the player must avoid crashing while racing against the clock.<ref>{{KLOV game|12733|Road Race}}</ref>  That same year, [[Sega]] released ''[[Fonz (arcade)|Moto-Cross]]'', an early black-and-white [[motorbike]] racing game, based on the [[motocross]] competition, that also used an early three-dimensional, third-person perspective.<ref name=Moto-Cross>{{KLOV game|12812|Moto-Cross}}</ref> Also known as '''''Man T.T.''''' (released August 1976),<ref>http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=man-t.t.&page=detail&id=26084</ref> Sega re-branded the game as ''[[Fonz (arcade)|Fonz]]'', as a tie-in for the popular [[sitcom]], ''[[Happy Days]]''.<ref name=Fonz>{{KLOV game|id=12812|name=Fonz}}</ref> The game displayed a constantly changing forward-scrolling road and the player's bike in a third-person perspective where objects nearer to the player are larger than those nearer to the horizon, and the aim was to steer the vehicle across the road, racing against the clock, while avoiding any on-coming motorcycles or driving off the road.<ref name=Moto-Cross/><ref name=Fonz/> The game also introduced the use of [[haptic feedback]], which caused the [[motorcycle handlebar]]s to vibrate during a collision with another vehicle.<ref>Mark J. P. Wolf (2008), ''The video game explosion: a history from PONG to Playstation and beyond'', p. 39, [[ABC-CLIO]], ISBN 978-0-313-33868-7</ref> In October 1976, Atari's ''[[Night Driver]]'' presented a [[First person (video games)|first-person]] view,<ref>http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=night-driver-upright-model&page=detail&id=26054</ref> displaying a series of posts by the edge of the road, though there was no view of the road or the player's car and the graphics were still low resolution white on black, and like ''Gran Trek 10'', gameplay was a race against the clock.

In 1977, Micronetics released ''Night Racer'', a first-person car racing game similar to ''Night Driver'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcadeflyers.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=731 |title=Night Racer |accessdate=2012-07-09 |date=2012-07-09 |publisher=The Arcade Flyer Archive}}</ref> while Sega released ''Twin Course T.T.'', an early simultaneous competitive two-player motorbike racing game.<ref>{{KLOV game|12829|Twin Course T.T.}}</ref> ''[[List of Taito games|Road Champion]]'', released by Taito in 1978, was an overhead-view timed car racing game where players try to race ahead of the opposing cars and cross the finish line first to become the winner.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=9334|name=Road Champion}}</ref> In 1979, [[Sega]]'s ''[[Head On (arcade game)|Head On]]'' was a racing game that played like a [[List of maze chase games|maze chase]] game and is thus considered a precursor to the 1980 hit ''[[Pac-Man]]''.<ref>[http://www.the-nextlevel.com/feature/forgotten-gems-of-the-maze-chase-genre/ Forgotten Gems of the Maze Chase Genre], The Next Level</ref> ''[[Monaco GP (arcade game)|Monaco GP]]'', released by Sega in 1979,<ref name="system16">[http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=683&page=1#3112 System16 Hardware: DISCRETE LOGIC HARDWARE]</ref> improved upon previous overhead-view racing games with a vertically scrolling view and color graphics. Another notable video game from the 1970s was ''The Driver'', a racing-[[action game]] released by Kasco (Kansai Seiki Seisakusho Co.) that used [[16 mm film]] to project [[Full motion video based game|full motion video]] on screen, though its gameplay had limited interaction, requiring the player to match their [[Racing wheel|steering wheel]], gas pedal and brakes with movements shown on screen, much like the [[Quick time event|sequences]] in later [[laserdisc video game]]s.<ref>{{KLOV game|10569|The Driver}}</ref>

===1980s===
In 1980, [[Namco]]'s overhead-view driving game ''[[Rally-X]]'' was the first game to feature [[Video game music|background music]],<ref>[http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-2 Gaming's Most Important Evolutions (Page 2)], [[GamesRadar]]</ref> and allowed [[scrolling]] in multiple directions, both vertical and [[Side-scrolling video game|horizontal]], and it was possible to pull the screen quickly in either direction.<ref>[http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-3 Gaming's Most Important Evolutions (Page 3)], [[GamesRadar]]</ref> It also featured an early example of a [[Mini-map|radar]], to show the [[Rallying|rally]] car's location on the map.<ref>{{KLOV game|9259|Rally-X}}</ref> ''[[Alpine Ski]]'', released by Taito in 1981, was an early [[Winter sport|winter]] [[sports game]], a vertical-scrolling racing game that involved maneuvering a [[Skiing|skier]] through a [[downhill]] ski course, a [[Slalom skiing|slalom]] racing course, and a [[ski jumping]] competition.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=6871|name=Alpine Ski}}</ref> ''[[Turbo (video game)|Turbo]]'', released by [[Sega]] in 1981, was the first racing game to feature a [[Third person (video games)|third-person perspective]], rear view format.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=10216|name=Turbo}}</ref> It was also the first racing game to use [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] [[2.5D#Scaling along the Z axis|scaling]] with full-color graphics.<ref>[http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p1.html IGN Presents the History of SEGA], [[IGN]]</ref> ''[[Bump 'n' Jump]]'', released by [[Data East]] in 1982, was a vertical-scrolling driving game where the player's car jumps or bumps enemy cars for points, while bonuses were awarded for completing levels without hitting any cars.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=7234|name=Bump 'n' Jump}}</ref>

The most influential racing game was released in 1982: ''[[Pole Position]]'', developed by Namco and published by Atari in North America. It was the first game to be based on a real racing circuit, and the first to feature a qualifying lap, where the player needs to complete a [[time trial]] before they can compete in [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] races. While not the first third-person racing game (it was predated by Sega's ''Turbo''), ''Pole Position'' established the conventions of the genre and its success inspired numerous imitators.<ref>{{citation|title=Vintage Games: An Insider Look at the History of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the Most Influential Games of All Time|first=Bill|last=Loguidice|first2=Matt|last2=Barton|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|year=2009|isbn=0-240-81146-1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M_bFdsP9L7oC|pages=195–6|ref=vintage_log}}</ref>

''[[Pole Position II]]'' was released in 1983 and featured improvements, such as giving the player the choice of different race courses as well as more colourful landscapes lined with advertising bill-boards.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=9064|name=Pole Position II}}</ref> ''[[TX-1]]'', developed by [[Tatsumi (company)|Tatsumi]] in 1983, TX-1
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=5911 |title=TX-1 |accessdate=2012-07-09 |date=2012-07-09 |publisher=The Arcade Flyer Archive}}</ref> was licensed to Namco,<ref name=TX-1/> who in turn licensed it to Atari in America,<ref name=TX-1/> thus the game is considered a successor to ''Pole Position II''.<ref name=TX-1/> ''TX-1'', however, placed a greater emphasis on realism, with details such as forcing players to brake or downshift the gear during corners to avoid the risk of losing control, and let go of the accelerator when going into a skid in order to regain control of the steering. It was also the first car driving game to use [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] technology, which caused the steering wheel to vibrate, and the game also featured a unique three-screen arcade display for a more [[2.5D|three-dimensional]] perspective of the track. It also introduced [[nonlinear gameplay]] by allowing players to choose which path to drive through after each checkpoint, eventually leading to one of eight possible [[Multiple endings|final destinations]].<ref name=TX-1>{{KLOV game|id=10004|name=TX-1}}</ref>

''[[List of Taito games|Change Lanes]]'', released by Taito in 1983, was a third-person racer where the player's car had fuel that reduces while driving, thus the driver must pick-up fuel cells to get a refuel at each checkpoint, while crashing into cars or obstacles would slow down the car and further reduce its fuel. If the fuel runs out, the game would end.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=7314|name=Change Lanes}}</ref> That same year, [[Kaneko]] produced ''Roller Aces'', an early [[roller skating]] racer played from a third-person perspective,<ref>{{KLOV game|id=7314|name=Fighting Roller}}</ref> while [[Irem]] released ''[[MotoRace USA]]'', an early partially third-person [[#Motorcycle racing games|motorbike racer]],<ref>{{KLOV game|id=10185|name=Traverse USA}}</ref> where the player travels across the US and refuels at various cities along the way, while avoiding crashes that can cause a substantial loss of fuel, causing the game to end if the fuel is depleted.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=8758|name=MotoRace USA}}</ref> An early attempt at creating a home driving simulator was [[Takara Tomy|Tomy]]'s ''Turnin' Turbo Dashboard'', also released in 1983. It was the first home video game to feature a racing wheel controller.<ref>[http://www.pcpro.co.uk/features/361591/the-top-ten-retro-gaming-secrets/2 The top ten retro gaming secrets: Steering wheel controllers are older than you think], [[CNET.com]]</ref>

In 1984, several early racing [[laserdisc video game]]s were released, including Sega's ''GP World''<ref>{{KLOV game|id=7874|name=GP World}}</ref> and Taito's ''Laser Grand Prix''<ref>{{KLOV game|id=8383|name=Laser Grand Prix}}</ref> which featured live-action footage, [[Aruze|Universal]]'s ''Top Gear'' featuring 3D animated race car driving,<ref>{{KLOV game|id=Top Gear|name=GP World}}</ref> and Taito's ''[[List of Taito games|Cosmos Circuit]]'', featuring animated futuristic racing.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=7410|name=Cosmos Circuit}}</ref> Taito also released ''[[List of Taito games|Kick Start]]'', a fully third-person motorbike racing game,<ref>{{KLOV game|id=8301|name=Kick Start}}</ref> and ''[[List of Taito games|Buggy Challenge]]'', an early [[dirt track racing]] game featuring a [[Dune buggy|buggy]].<ref>{{KLOV game|id=7230|name=Buggy Challenge}}</ref> Other early dirt racing games from that year were [[dirt bike]] games: [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Excitebike]]''<ref>{{KLOV game|id=7725|name=Excitebike}}</ref> and [[SNK]]'s [[motocross]] game ''[[List of SNK games#1984|Jumping Cross]]'',<ref>{{KLOV game|id=12730|name=Jumping Cross}}</ref> both played from a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling view]]. SNK also released ''[[List of SNK games|Gladiator 1984]]'', an early [[horse racing]] game,<ref>{{KLOV game|id=7951|name=Gladiator 1984}}</ref> and ''[[List of SNK games|Mad Crasher]]'', an early [[#Futuristic racing games|futuristic racing game]], where the player drives a futuristic motorbike along diagonal-scrolling futuristic roads suspended in mid-air, while leaping across gaps, shooting other cars, and getting bonuses and power-ups.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=8483|name=Mad Crasher}}</ref> Another racing game that involved [[Shooter game|shooting]] that year was [[Nichibutsu]]'s ''[[Seicross]]'', where the player rides a motorcycle-like craft, bumps other riders, collects power modules and shoots blue coins.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=9481|name=Seicross}}</ref> Other notable arcade releases that year include [[Konami]]'s ''[[Road Fighter]]'', a vertical-scrolling racer where the aim is to drive fast, pass cars and avoid accidents for maximum points, while reaching check points before running out of fuel;<ref>{{KLOV game|id=9335|name=Road Fighter}}</ref> and [[Irem]]'s ''[[The Battle-Road]]'', an early [[Open world|open-ended]] [[Vehicular combat game|vehicle combat]] racing game that featured branching paths and up to 32 possible routes.<ref>{{KLOV game|7055|Battle-Road, The}}</ref> Another unique take on the genre that year was ''[[Plazma Line]]'', a [[first-person (video games)|first-person]] space racing game that is considered the first [[PC game|computer game]] with [[3D computer graphics|3D polygon]] graphics. The objective of the game is to race through [[outer space]] in a first-person view while avoiding obstacles (rendered in 3D polygons) along the way. It also featured an [[automap]] radar to keep track of the player's position.<ref name="ohfm_plazma">{{cite web|title=Plazma Line|url=http://retropc.net/fm-7/museum/softhouse/tecnosoft/330602600.html|work=[[:jp:Oh!FM|Oh!FM]]|accessdate=1 September 2012|archiveurl=http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fretropc.net%2Ffm-7%2Fmuseum%2Fsofthouse%2Ftecnosoft%2F330602600.html|archivedate=1 September 2012}}</ref>

Racing games in general tend to drift toward the arcade side of reality, mainly due to hardware limitations, especially in the 1980s and 1990s. It is, however, untrue to say that there were no games considered simulations in their time. In 1984, [[Geoff Crammond]], who later developed the ''Grandprix'' series (Known collectively as GPX to its fanbase), produced what is considered the first attempt at a racing simulator on a home system, ''[[REVS (computer game)|REVS]]'', released for the BBC Microcomputer. The game offered an unofficial (and hence with no official team or driver names associated with the series) recreation of British Formula 3. The hardware capabilities limited the depth of the simulation and restricted it (initially) to one track, but it offered a semi-realistic driving experience with more detail than most other racing games at the time.<ref name="gamespot1">{{cite web|title=The History of Papyrus Racing - Page 2|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6103365/p-2.html|publisher=[[Gamespot]]|accessdate=2008-04-07}}</ref>

In 1985, Sega released ''[[Hang-On]]'', a popular Grand Prix style rear-view motorbike racer,<ref name=Hang-On>{{KLOV game|id=8068|name=Hang On}}</ref> considered the first [[Motion controller|full-body-experience]] video game,<ref name="gamecentercx">[[Retro Game Master|GameCenter CX]] - 2nd Season, Episode 13</ref> and was regarded as the first motorbike simulator for its realism at the time, in both the handling of the player's motorbike and the [[artificial intelligence]] of the computer-controlled motorcyclists.<ref name=Hang-On/> It used [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] technology and was also one of the first arcade games to use [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit graphics]] and Sega's "Super Scaler" technology that allowed [[2.5D|pseudo-3D]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)#Move to 3D|sprite-scaling]] at high [[frame rate]]s.<ref>[http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p3.html IGN Presents the History of SEGA: World War], [[IGN]]</ref> That same year, [[Jaleco]] released ''[[City Connection]]'', a [[Platform game|platform]]-racer where cops chase the player around different cities in the US, UK, France, Japan and India.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=7452|name=Cruisin}}</ref>

In 1986, Durell released ''[[Turbo Esprit]]'', which had an official Lotus license, and featured working car indicator lights. Also in 1986, Sega produced ''[[Out Run]]'', one of the most graphically impressive games of its time. It used two Motorola 68000 CPUs for its 2D sprite-based driving engine, and it became an instant classic that spawned many sequels. It was notable for giving the player the [[Nonlinear gameplay|non-linear]] choice of which route to take through the game and the choice of soundtrack to listen to while driving,<ref>{{KLOV game|id=8938}}</ref> represented as radio stations. The game also featured up to five [[multiple endings]] depending on the route taken, and each one was an ending sequence rather than a simple "Congratulations" as was common in game endings at the time.<ref>{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Gazza|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/outrun/outrun.htm|title=Outrun|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|accessdate=2011-03-17}}</ref> That same year, Konami's ''[[WEC Le Mans]]'' was a race driving simulator that attempted to accurately simulate the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] competition, with fairly realistic handling, a day-night cycle, and the use of force feedback to simulate road vibration in the form of a vibrating steering wheel that reacts to the driver's acceleration and off-road bumps.<ref>{{KLOV game|10383|WEC Le Mans 24}}</ref>

In 1987, Namco produced ''[[Final Lap]]'',<ref name="Final-Lap">{{KLOV game|7797|Final Lap}}</ref> the unofficial sequel to ''Pole Position II''. ''Final Lap'' was the first arcade game that allowed multiple machines to be linked, allowing for [[multiplayer]] races, with up to eight players in total.<ref name="Final-Lap" /> It was also arguably the first racing game to implement "rubber banding" to ensure that less talented players were never too far behind the leader, a concept that would be taken much further by the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series.<ref name="final_lap_twin">{{cite web|last=Gifford|first=Kevin|title=Final Lap Twin|url=http://magweasel.com/2011/03/16/i-love-the-pc-engine-final-lap-twin/|publisher=MagWeasel|accessdate=28 April 2012|date=March 16, 2011}}</ref> Also in 1987, [[Square (company)|Square]] released ''[[Rad Racer]]'', one of the first [[Stereoscopic video game|stereoscopic 3D]] games.<ref>[http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/52788 James Cameron: True 3D Gaming Is the Future, Already in Upcoming Avatar Game], [[Shacknews]]</ref> In the same year, Atari produced ''[[RoadBlasters]]'', a driving game that also involved a bit of shooting.

In 1988, Taito released ''[[Chase H.Q.]]'', a unique racing game where the player drives a police car that must chase criminals within a time limit.<ref>{{KLOV game|7318|Chase H.Q.}}</ref> [[CBS Sony]] released ''[[List of Family Computer games#P|Paris-Dakar Rally Special]]'', an imaginative racing game with [[Platform game|platformer]] and [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] elements, featuring [[Dakar Rally]] cars that could fire bullets, the driver able to exit the car and go exploring to lower a bridge or bypass other obstacles, underwater driving sections, and at times having avoid a fleet of tanks and fighter jets.<ref>[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6251/gems_in_the_rough_yesterdays_.php?print=1 Paris-Dakar Rally Special], [[Gamasutra]]</ref> That same year, Namco released an early [[3D computer graphics|3D]] racing game in the arcades, ''[[Winning Run]]''.<ref>{{KLOV game|10446|Winning Run}}</ref>

In 1989, Atari released ''[[Hard Drivin']]'', another arcade driving game that used 3D polygonal graphics. It also featured force feedback, where the wheel fights the player during aggressive turns, and a crash replay camera view. That same year, the now defunct [[Papyrus Design Group]] produced their first attempt at a racing simulator, the critically acclaimed ''[[Indianapolis 500: The Simulation]]'', designed by David Kaemmer and Omar Khudari. The game is generally regarded as the first true auto racing simulation on a personal computer. Accurately replicating the 1989 Indianapolis 500 grid, it offered advanced 3D graphics for its time, setup options, car failures and handling. Unlike most other racing games at the time, ''Indianapolis 500'' attempted to simulate realistic [[Game physics|physics]] and [[telemetry]], such as its portrayal of the relationship between the four contact patches and the pavement, as well as the loss of grip when making a high-speed turn, forcing the player to adopt a proper racing line and believable throttle-to-brake interaction. It also featured a garage facility to allow players to enact modifications to their vehicle, including adjustments to the tires, shocks and wings.<ref name="gamespot1"/> The damage modelling, while not accurate by today's standards, was capable of producing some spectacular and entertaining [[Multiple-vehicle collision|pile-ups]].

===1990s===
Crammond's ''[[Formula One Grand Prix (Geoff Crammond)|Formula One Grand Prix]]'' in 1992 became the new champion of sim racing, until the release of Papyrus' ''[[IndyCar Racing]]'' the following year.<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of Papyrus Racing - Page 3|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6103365/p-3.html|publisher=[[Gamespot]]|accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref> ''Formula One Grand Prix'' boasted detail that was unparalleled for a computer game at the time as well as a full recreation of the drivers, cars and circuits of the 1991 Formula One World Championship. However, the U.S. version (known as ''World Circuit'') was not granted an official license by the FIA, so teams and drivers were renamed (though all could be changed back to their real names using the Driver/Team selection menu): [[Ayrton Senna]] became "Carlos Sanchez", for example.

On the other end of the spectrum, Sega produced ''[[Virtua Racing]]'' in 1992. While not the first arcade racing game with 3D graphics (it was predated by ''[[Winning Run]]'', ''[[Hard Drivin']]'' and ''[[Stunts (video game)|Stunts]]''), it was able to combine the best features of games at the time, along with multiplayer machine linking and clean [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] to produce a game that was above and beyond the arcade market standard of its time, laying the foundations for subsequent 3D racing games.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virtua Racing--Arcade (1992)|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p13_01.html|work=15 Most Influential Games of All Time|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=12 April 2012|year=2001}}</ref>  Also, [[Nintendo]] broke new ground by introducing the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series on the SNES with ''[[Super Mario Kart]]''. Using the familiar characters from the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'']] franchise, the game not only departed from the realism paradigm by using small [[karts]] for the players to drive, but also featured bright, colourful environments and allowed the players to pick up power-ups to improve performance or hamper other racers. This franchise also spawned multiple sequels.

In 1993, Namco struck back with ''[[Ridge Racer (video game)|Ridge Racer]]'', and thus began the [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygonal]] war of driving games. Sega struck back that same year with ''[[Daytona USA (arcade game)|Daytona USA]]'', one of the first video games to feature [[Texture filtering|filtered]], [[Texture mapping|texture-mapped]] polygons, giving it the most detailed graphics yet seen in a video game up until that time.<ref>[http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p8.html IGN Presents the History of SEGA: Reap What You Sow], [[IGN]]</ref> The following year, [[Electronic Arts]] produced ''[[The Need for Speed]]'', which would later spawn the world's most successful racing game series and one of the top ten most successful [[video game]] series overall. In the same year, [[Midway Games|Midway]] introduced ''[[Crusin' USA]]''.

In 1995, ''[[Sega Rally Championship]]'' introduced  [[Rallying|rally]] racing and featured [[cooperative gameplay]] alongside the usual competitive multiplayer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 25 Racing Games... Ever! Part 2|work=[[Retro Gamer]]|pages=5–6|date=21 September 2009|url=http://www.nowgamer.com/features/424/top-25-racing-games-ever-part-2?o=4#listing|accessdate=2011-03-17}}</ref> ''Sega Rally'' was also the first to feature driving on different surfaces (including [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]], [[gravel]], and [[mud]]) with different [[friction]] properties and the car's handling changing accordingly, making it an important milestone in the genre.<ref>{{citation|title=[[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition, 2009]]|page=103|isbn=978-1-904994-45-9}}</ref> I

In 1996, [[Konami]] introduced ''[[GTI Club]]'' which allowed free roaming of the environment, something of a revolution that had only been done in 3D before in ''[[Hard Drivin']]''. Atari didn't join the 3D craze until 1997, when it introduced ''[[San Francisco Rush]]''.

In 1997, ''[[Gran Turismo (video game)|Gran Turismo]]'' was released for the [[PlayStation]], after being in production for five years since 1992.<ref>[http://venturebeat.com/2010/01/14/gran-turismos-creator-takes-a-fifth-stab-at-a-perfect-racing-game/ Gran Turismo's creator takes a fifth stab at a perfect racing game &#124; VentureBeat]</ref> It was considered the most realistic racing simulation game in its time,<ref name=GameSpot/> combined with playability, enabling players of all skill levels to play.

By 1997, the typical PC was capable of matching an arcade machine in terms of graphical quality, mainly due to the introduction of first generation 3D accelerators such as 3DFX Voodoo. The faster CPUs were capable of simulating increasingly realistic physics, car control, and graphics.

[[Colin McRae Rally]] was introduced in 1998 to the PC world, and was a successful semi-simulation of the world of rally driving, previously only available in the less serious ''Sega Rally Championship''. ''[[Motorhead (video game)|Motorhead]]'', a PC game, was later adapted back to arcade.

1999 marked a change of games into more "free form" worlds. [[Midtown Madness]] for the PC allows the player to explore a simplified version of the city of Chicago using a variety of vehicles and any path that they desire. In the arcade world, Sega introduced ''[[Crazy Taxi]]'', a [[Open world|sandbox]] racing game where you are a taxi driver that needed to get the client to the destination in the shortest amount of time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 25 Racing Games... Ever! Part 1|work=[[Retro Gamer]]|date=16 September 2009|url=http://www.nowgamer.com/features/423/top-25-racing-games-ever-part-1?o=1|accessdate=2011-03-17}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> A similar game also from Sega is ''Emergency Ambulance Driver'', with almost the same gameplay (pick up patient, drop off at hospital, as fast as possible). Games are becoming more and more realistic visually. Some arcade games are now featuring 3 screens to provide a surround view.

===2000s===
In 2000, Angel Studios (now Rockstar San Diego) introduced the first free-roaming, or the former "free form", racing game on video game consoles and handheld game consoles with ''[[Midnight Club: Street Racing]]'' which released on the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Game Boy Advance]]. The game allowed the player to drive anywhere around virtual recreations of London and New York. Instead of using enclosed tracks for races, the game uses various checkpoints on the free roam map as the pathway of the race, giving the player the option to take various shortcuts or any other route to the checkpoints of the race.

In 2003, Rockstar San Diego's ''[[Midnight Club II]]'' was the first racing game to feature both playable cars and playable motorcycles.

There is a wide gamut of driving games ranging from simple action-arcade racers like ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash!!]]'' (for [[Nintendo GameCube]]) and Nick Toon Racers to ultra-realistic simulators like [[Grand Prix Legends]], [[iRacing]], ''[[Virtual Grand Prix 3]]'', ''[[Live for Speed]]'', ''[[NetKar Pro]]'', [[GT Legends]], [[GTR2]], [[rFactor]], [[X Motor Racing]] and iPad 3D racer 'Exhilarace' —and everything in between.

== General genres ==

=== Non simulation racers ===
Racing games put fun and a fast-paced experience above all else, as cars usually compete in unique ways. A key feature of non simulation racers that specifically distinguishes them from simulation racers is their far more liberal physics. Whereas in real racing (and subsequently, the simulation equivalents) the driver must reduce their speed significantly to take most turns, arcade racing games generally encourage the player to "powerslide" the car to allow the player to keep up their speed by drifting through a turn. [[Collision]]s with other racers, track [[road debris|obstacles]], or traffic vehicles is usually much more exaggerated than simulation racers as well. For the most part, arcade racers simply remove the precision and rigor required from the simulation experience and focus strictly on the racing element itself. They often license real cars and leagues, but are equally open to more exotic settings and vehicles. Races take place on highways, windy roads, or in cities; they can be multiple-lap circuits or point-to-point, with one or multiple paths (sometimes with checkpoints), or other types of competition, like [[demolition derby]], jumping, or testing driving skills. Popular non simulation racers are the ''[[Virtua Racing]]'' series, the ''[[Daytona USA (arcade game)|Daytona USA]]'' series, the ''[[Rush (videogame series)|Rush]]'', the ''[[Ridge Racer (series)|Ridge Racer]]'' series, the ''[[Cruis'n USA|Cruis'n Series]]'', the ''[[Midnight Club]]'' series, the ''[[Burnout (series)|Burnout]]'' series, and ''[[Out Run]]''.

During the mid-late 2000s there was a trend of new [[street racing]]; imitating the [[import scene]], one can [[car tuning|tune]] [[sport compact]]s and [[sports car]]s and race them on the streets. The most widely known ones are the ''[[Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition]]'' and the ''[[Midnight Club]]'' series, ''[[Need for Speed]]'' series, and the [[Juiced (series)|''Juiced'']] series.

Some non simulation racing games increase the competition between racers by adding weapons that can be used against opponents to slow them down or otherwise impede their progress so they can be passed. This is a staple feature in "kart racing" games, such as the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series, but this kind of game mechanic also appears in standard, car-based racing games as well. Weapons can range from projectile attacks to traps as well as non-combative items like speed boosts. Weapon-based racing games include games such as ''[[Full Auto]]'', ''[[Rumble Racing]]'', and ''[[Blur (video game)|Blur]]''.

=== Racing simulators ===
{{main|Sim racing}}

Simulation style racing games strive to convincingly replicate the handling of an [[automobile]]. They often license real cars or racing leagues, but will sometimes use fantasy cars built to resemble real ones if unable to acquire an official license for them. Vehicular behavior physics are a key factor in the experience. The rigors of being a professional race driver are usually also included (such as having to deal with a car's tire condition and fuel level). Proper cornering technique and precision racing maneuvers (such as trail braking) are given priority in the simulation racing games.

Although these racing simulators are specifically built for people with a high grade of driving skill, it is not uncommon to find aids that can be enabled from the game menu. The most common aids are [[traction control system|traction control]] (TC), [[anti-lock brakes]] (ABS), steering assistance, damage resistance, clutch assistance and automatic gear changes. Racing simulators are usually piloted exclusively from the interior driving view, as driving views from a perspective other than the driver's are considered arcade.

Some of these racing simulators are customizable, as game fans have decoded the tracks, cars and executable files. Internet communities have grown around the simulators regarded as the most realistic and many websites host internet championships.

== Examples of racing game sub-genres ==

=== Off-road ===

In a car racing game, the primary gameplay mode is driving the car. However, they sometimes offer a secondary mode for tuning up the car.<ref name="fundamentals">{{cite book|last=Rollings|first=Andrew|authorlink=|author2=Ernest Adams |title=Fundamentals of Game Design|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2006|location=|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_gamedev_1/54/14053/3597646.cw/index.html}}</ref> There are various principles in winning car racing games, some of which apply to real life situations while most are unique to the game itself.

[[Image:William Edward Hartpole Lecky.jpg|thumb|right|'''William Edward Hartpole Lecky''', Photography 1868 by [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], National Portrait Gallery London]]
'''William Edward Hartpole Lecky''', [[Order of Merit|OM]] (26 March 1838 – 22 October 1903) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] historian and political theorist.

==Early life==
Born at Newtown Park, near [[Dublin]], he was the eldest son of John Hartpole Lecky, a landowner.
He was educated at Kingstown, [[Armagh]], at [[Cheltenham College]], and at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], where he graduated BA in 1859 and MA in 1863, and where he studied [[Divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]] with a view to becoming a priest in the [[Church of Ireland]].

==Career==
In 1860 he published anonymously a small book entitled ''The Religious Tendencies of the Age'', but on leaving college he abandoned his original intention and turned to historiography. In 1861 he published ''Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland'', a brief sketch of the lives and work of [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Henry Flood]], [[Henry Grattan]] and [[Daniel O'Connell]], which showed great promise. This book, originally published anonymously, was republished in 1871; and the essay on Swift, rewritten and amplified, appeared again in 1897 as an introduction to a new edition of Swift's works. Two learned surveys of certain aspects of history followed: ''A History of the Rise and Influence of Rationalism in Europe'' (2 vols., 1865), and ''A History of European Morals from [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]] to [[Charlemagne]]'' (2 vols., 1869). The latter aroused criticism, with its opening dissertation on "the natural history of morals," but both have been generally accepted as acute and suggestive commentaries upon a wide range of facts.

[[Image:William Edward Hartpole Lecky Trinity College Dublin.jpg|thumb|right|His statue at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]]]
[[File:William Edward Hartpole Lecky, Vanity Fair, 1882-05-27.jpg|thumb|Caricature by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] published in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]] in 1882.]]
Lecky then devoted himself to the chief work of his life, ''A History of England during the Eighteenth Century'', Vols. i. and ii. of which appeared in 1878, and Vols. vii. and viii., which completed the work, in 1890. His object was "to disengage from the great mass of facts those which relate to the permanent forces of the nation, or which indicate some of the more enduring features of national life". In carrying out this task, Lecky displays many of the qualities of a great historian. The work is lucid in style, extensive in its use of source material, and, above all, impartial throughout. These qualities are particularly valuable in the chapters dealing with the history of Ireland, and in the "cabinet" edition of 1892, in 12 volumes (frequently reprinted), this part of the work is separated from the rest, and occupies five volumes under the title of ''A History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century''.

A volume of ''Poems'' (1891) was less successful. In 1896, he published two volumes entitled ''Democracy and Liberty'', in which he considered, with special reference to the United Kingdom, France and the United States, some of the tendencies of modern democracies. The pessimistic conclusions at which he arrived provoked criticism both in the UK and USA, which was renewed when he published in a new edition (1899) an elaborate and very deprecatory estimate of [[William Ewart Gladstone]], then recently dead. This work, though essentially different from the author's purely historical writings, has many of their merits, though it was inevitable that other minds should take a different view of the evidence.

In ''The Map of Life'' (1899) he discussed in a popular style some of the ethical problems which arise in everyday life. In 1903 he published a revised and greatly enlarged edition of ''Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland'', in two volumes, from which the essay on Swift was omitted and that on O'Connell was expanded into a complete biography of the great advocate of repeal of the Union. Though always a keen sympathiser with the Irish people in their misfortunes and aspirations and he had criticised severely the methods by which the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] was passed, Lecky, who grew up as a moderate Liberal, was from the first strenuously opposed to Gladstone's policy of [[Home Rule]] and, in 1895, he was returned to parliament as Unionist member for [[Dublin University (UK Parliament constituency)|Dublin University]] in a by-election. In 1897, he was made a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|privy councillor]], and among the coronation honours in 1902, he was nominated an original member of the new Order of Merit.

==Degrees==
His university honours included the degree of LL.D. from Dublin, [[university of St Andrews|St Andrews]] and [[university of Glasgow|Glasgow]], the degree of D.C.L. from [[university of Oxford|Oxford]] and the degree of Litt.D. from [[university of Cambridge|Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=LKY891WE|name=Lecky, William Edward Hartpole}}</ref> In 1894 he was elected corresponding member of the Institute of France. He contributed occasionally to periodical literature, and two of his addresses, ''The Political Value of History'' (1892) and ''The Empire, its Value and its Growth'' (1893), were published.

==Family and posthumous recognition==
He married in 1871 Elizabeth, baroness de Dedem, daughter of baron de Dedem, a general in the Dutch service, but had no children. She contributed articles, chiefly on historical and political subjects, to various reviews.

In 1904, money for a memorial was raised by subscription and a statue by [[Goscombe John|John Goscombe]] was erected in Trinity College, Dublin.

A volume of Lecky's ''Historical and Political Essays'' was published posthumously (London, 1908).

The [[Lecky Professor of History|Lecky Chair of History]] at Trinity College, Dublin, was endowed by his widow in 1913.

In 1978, part of the college's humanities library complex was named in his honour.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fox|first1=Peter|title=Trinity College Library Dublin: A History|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781107011205|page=329}}</ref>

'''Educational games''' are [[game]]s explicitly designed with [[educational]] purposes, or which have incidental or secondary educational value. All types of games may be used in an educational environment. Educational games are [[game]]s that are designed to help people to learn about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand an historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play. Game types include [[board game|board]], [[card game|card]], and [[video game]]s.
An educational game is a game designed to teach humans about a specific subject and to teach them a skill. As educators, governments, and parents realize the psychological need and benefits of gaming have on learning, this educational tool has become mainstream. Games are interactive play that teaches us goals, rules, adaptation, problem solving, interaction, all represented as a story. They give us the fundamental needs of learning by providing - enjoyment, passionate involvement, structure, motivation, ego gratification, adrenaline, creativity, social interaction and emotion.

==Video games==
{{main|Educational video game|Video games in education}}
With the increase and availability of technological devises, there has been a shift in what types of games people play. Video or electronic gaming has become more widely used than traditional [[board game]]s. Barab (2009) defines conceptual play as "a state of engagement that involves (a) projection into the role of character who, (b) engaged in a partly fictional problem context, (c) must apply conceptual understandings to make sense of, and ultimately, transform the context".<ref>p. 991</ref>  The goal of such play spaces is to have the “gamer” engage in the narrative while learning cognitive and social skills. The ability to immerse oneself in the gaming process facilitates “empathetic embodiment” which occurs when a player learns to identify with the character they have chosen for the game and the virtual environment of the game (Barab, 2009).<ref>Barab, S., Scott, B., Siyahhan, S., Goldstone, R., Ingram-Goble, A., Zuiker, S., & Warren, S. (2009). Transformational play as a curricular scaffold: Using videogames to support science education. Journal of Science Education Technology,18, 305-320.</ref>

==Game based learning==
Game-based learning (GBL) is a type of [[game play]] that has defined learning outcomes. Generally, game based learning is designed to balance subject matter with gameplay and the ability of the player to retain and apply said subject matter to the real world.

===Origins===
In his classical essay, "Upon the Aesthetic Education of Man", [[Friedrich Schiller]] discusses play as a force of civilization, which helps humans rise above their instincts and become members of enlightened communities. He states that "humans are only fully human when they play". While the text is limited by the author's beliefs in concepts such as freedom and beauty, it nevertheless sets the stage for [[Johan Huizinga]]'s classical study, ''[[Homo Ludens (book)|Homo Ludens]]''.

Games have long been employed as a means of education. Using the ancient game of chess, noblemen of the Middle Ages learned strategies of war. During the Civil War, volunteers from Rhode Island played American Kriegsspiel, which had originally been created in 1812 for training Prussian officers-of-war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.instituteofplay.org/about/context/history-of-games-learning/ | title=Institute of Play, History of Games & Learning |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref> Then, in the early 19th century, came the creation of Kindergarten by [[Friedrich Fröbel]], which was based on learning through play. Children delighted in his [[Fröbel Gifts]], simple educational toys such as blocks, sewing kits, clay, and weaving materials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://games.eduxtive.com/news/historical-perspectives-on-games-and-education | title=Historical Perspectives on Games and Education |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref>

===Theory===

According to Richard N. Van Eck, there are three main approaches to creating software that stimulates cognitive growth in the gamer. These three approaches are: building games from scratch created by educators and programmers; integrate commercial off-the-shelf (COTS); and creating games from scratch by the students. The most time- and cost-effective approach to designing these educational games is to incorporate COTS games into the classroom with the understanding of the [[learning]] outcomes the instructor has for the course.<ref>Van Eck, R. (2006). Digital game-based learning: It’s not just the digital natives who are restless… Educase Review, 41,2, 1-16.
</ref> This requires the teacher to buy into the positive results of using digital games for education. It also requires teachers to have adequate self-efficacy concerning the use of these games and their technology. The students usually have high amounts of self-efficacy in usage of digital games, while the lack of confidence teachers have in incorporating the digital games usually results in less effective educational use of the games. However, Gerber and Price (2013) have found that teachers inexperience with digital games does not preclude them from the desire to incorporate them in class instruction, but districts must have in place support through regular professional development, supportive learning communities with their colleagues, and adequate financial support to implement game based learning in their class instruction.<ref>Gerber, H. R. & Price, D. P. (2013) Fighting baddies and collecting bananas: Teachers' perceptions of game-based learning. Educational Media International http://www.academia.edu/3113476/Fighting_baddies_and_collecting_bananas_Teachers_perceptions_of_game-based_literacy_learning</ref>

Games often have a [[fantasy]] element that engages players in a learning activity through [[narrative]] or storylines. [[Educational video game]]s can motivate children and allow them to develop an awareness of consequentiality.<ref>[http://inkido.indiana.edu/research/onlinemanu/papers/QA_ETRD.pdf "Making Learning Fun: Quest Atlantis, A Game Without Guns"]  by Barab, Thomas, Dodge, Carteaux, Tuzun</ref> Children are allowed to express themselves as individuals while learning and engaging in social issues. Today's games are more [[social action|social]], with most teens playing games with others at least some of the time and can incorporate many aspects of civic and political life.<ref>[http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Teens_Games_and_Civics_Report_FINAL.pdf "Teens, Video Games, and Civics"] by Lenhart, Pew Internet Project</ref> Students that participate in educational video games can offer deeper, more meaningful insights in all academic areas.<ref name="bainbridge"/>{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The success of game-based learning strategies owes to active participation and interaction being at the center of the experience, and signals that current educational methods are not engaging students enough<ref>Green, C., & Bavelier, D.(2012). Learning, attentional control, and action video games. Current Biology, 22.R197-R206.</ref>{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Experience with and affinity for games as learning tools is an increasingly universal characteristic among those entering higher education and the workforce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmc.org/publications/2009-horizon-report |title='2009 Horizon Report' by The New Media Consortium and EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative |publisher=Nmc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref> Game-based learning is an expansive category, ranging from simple paper-and-pencil games like word searches all the way up to complex, [[massively multiplayer online]] (MMO) and [[role-playing game]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wp.nmc.org/horizon-k12-2010/chapters/game-based-learning/ |title=2010 Horizon Report: The K12 Edition |publisher=Wp.nmc.org |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref>  The use of collaborative game-based role-play for learning provides an opportunity
for learners to apply acquired knowledge and to experiment and get feedback in the form of consequences or rewards, thus getting the experiences in the "safe [[virtual world]]".<ref>[http://archive.teachfind.com/becta/emergingtechnologies.becta.org.uk/upload-dir/downloads/page_documents/research/emerging_technologies/game_based_learning.pdf "Game-based Learning or Game-based Teaching?"] by Paul Pivec</ref>

The built-in learning process of games is what makes a game enjoyable. The progress a player makes in a game is through learning. It is the process of the human mind grasping and coming to understand a new system. The progress of understanding a new concept through gaming makes an individual feel a sense of reward whether the game is considered entertainment (''[[Call of Duty]]'') or serious (FAA-approved [[flight simulator]]). Well-designed games that motivate players are what make them ideal learning environments.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Real-world challenges are easier faced within a game containing effective, interactive experiences that actively engage people in the learning process. In a successful game-based learning environment, choosing actions, experiencing consequences, and working toward goals allows players to make mistakes through experimentation in a risk-free environment.<ref name="bainbridge"/> Games have rules and structure and goals that inspire motivation. Games are interactive and provide outcomes and feedback. Most games also have problem solving situations that spark creativity.<ref>{{cite web|author=Shearer, James D. |url=http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi/Shearer%20James%20D.pdf?bgsu1303865257 |title=Development of a Digital Game-based Learning Best Practices Checklist |publisher=Etd.ohiolink.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref>

Identification with the character within the video game is an important factor in the learning potential of the gamer. Some of the electronic games allow the gamer to create an avatar that is designed and “owned” by the gamer. This character is an expression of the human creating the virtual character.<ref name="bainbridge">Bainbridge, W. (2007). The scientific research potential of virtual worlds. Science, 317, 27, 471-476.</ref> This has opened a new set of scientific possibilities. The virtual world can be used as a laboratory. The relationships and space within the games can simulate complex societies and relationships without having to truly participate. This application of an avatar in not limited to simulation exercises.<ref>Kim, B., Park, H., & Baek, Y. (2009). Not just for fun, but serious strategies: Using meta-cognitive strategies in game-based learning. Computers and Education, 52, 800-810.</ref> According to Bainbridge, interviews and ethnographic research could be conducted within the reality of the game space.<ref name="bainbridge"/> This could include experiments in social psychology and cognitive science. The fact that game creators and gamers are wanting new experiences within the games, the introduction of “experiments” could increase the level of play and engagement.<ref name="bainbridge"/>

===Neurological context===
Thiagi states that games have five major characteristics: conflict, control, closure, contrivance, and competency. Games encourage active learning, interaction between multiple people, encourages team work, and also provide a free environment that allows for skill enhancement. Games based learning provides versatility for more than one learning style, and also can affect [[cognition|cognitive]] and [[psychomotor learning|psychomotor]] skills. While learning through games can be very effective, they can become a distraction, causing them to become too focused on the game and not on learning.<ref>{{cite web|author=Deirdre Bonnycastle |url=http://www.slideshare.net/DeirdreB/promoting-active-learning-using-games |title=Promoting Active Learning Using Games |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2009-05-21 |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thiagi.com/games.html |title=Training Games |publisher=Thiagi.com |date=2011-08-05 |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>

"…It cannot be denied that a great deal of learning does happen in games. Computer games that are considered “good”(i.e. popular and highly rated) already provide information in various formats, although the preference in most games is for information to be visually presented. By providing information in multiple formats (visual, textual, auditory, etc.), players cannot only choose a style that matches their own preference, but they can also practice their skills in others, and sometimes they do this even without realizing it.<ref name="academia1">Becker, K., [http://www.academia.edu/462837/Games_and_Learning_Styles Games and Learning Styles. Special Session onComputer Games and Learning.], 2012</ref>

"By design, good games support the approaches of concrete learners through a myriad of feedback mechanisms: visual, auditory, textual, progress charts, etc. while abstract learners can ignore which ever feedback mechanisms they choose – often by simply switching them off. Abstract learners can develop theories and test them out within games in ways not feasible in real life. The “reset” button remains available to both whenever they get into trouble.<ref name="academia1"/>

===Application===
Traditionally, technology used in school operates at the base level.{{clarify|date=September 2012}} They usually make up case studies designed to introduce students to certain technologies in an effort to prepare them for a future major assignment that requires the aforementioned technology. In the future, technology and games are expected to be used in simulation environments to simulate real world issues. In the professional sector, such as flight training, simulations are already used in an effort to prepare pilots for training before actually going out into planes. These training sessions are used to replicate real life stresses without the risk factor associated with flying.

Before deciding how to use game-based learning, the trainer must first determine what they would like the trainees to learn. A trainer that fails to focus training around a central idea runs the risk of using a game that fails to connect with the learners. To prevent this, tailor the material to the demographic(age group, familiarity, educational pre-text)so that the material is neither too difficult for, nor too familiar to the learner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/games/howtogbl.html |title=How To Teach Using Games |publisher=Serc.carleton.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref> Gathering ideas from children early in the design process has yielded useful insights into what children want in technology in general or in a specific type of application.<ref name=hindawi>{{cite web | url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ahci/2008/284056/ | title=Exploring Children's Requirements for Game-Based Learning Environments | last1=Nousiainen | first1=Tuula | last2=Kankaanranta | first2=Marja | date=July 24, 2008 | accessdate=June 4, 2012}}</ref> Children's early involvement in requirements gathering has revealed clues about gender differences in preferences related to technology, children's navigation skills, ways of presenting textual information, application-specific content-related preferences, the variety of elements to be included in user interfaces and their structures, and children's desire to personalize their applications.<ref name=hindawi/> Multiplayer role playing games (MMO’s) provide opportunities for players to improve such skills as, “complex learning, thinking, and social practices”.<ref>Barab, 2009, p. 990</ref> MMO`s also provide a social network which can favor collaborative gaming and learning and contribute to the formation of teams, communication within a group and help strengthen individual and communal identities.<ref>Klopfer, E, Osterweil, S and Salen, K.

Ten guidelines were suggested to help guide the process of using game-based technologies with online instruction. They are the following:
1. Taking advantage of existing resources. 
2. Asking students to be producers, not just consumers. 
3. Avoiding being overly prescriptive and ensuring mechanisms for serendipity. 
4. Being aware of non-electronic and non-media-intense games and their value in the online 
classroom. 
5. Focusing on learning, not technology. 
6. Providing lead up and debriefing sessions. 
7. Embracing interdisciplinary. 
8. Thinking about ways to use serious games. 
9. Making the most of collaborative technologies and virtual worlds to help manage complexity. 
10. Play testing the course frequently and often.

'''Playmobil''' ({{IPAc-en|p|l|e?|m|o?|?|b|i?|l}})<ref>http://store.playmobilusa.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-US-Site "PLAYMOBIL is a registered trademark. pronounced: pl?y-m?-b??l"</ref><ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/business/06beck.html "Mr. Beck was the original designer and, for 24 years until he retired in 1998, head of research and development for Playmobil (pronounced playmoBEEL)."</ref> is a line of toys produced by the [[Brandstätter Group]] (Geobra Brandstätter GmbH & Co KG), headquartered in [[Zirndorf]], Germany.

The signature Playmobil toy is a 7.5&nbsp;cm (approximately 3 inch) tall (1:24 scale) human figure, in its early days known as a "klicky". A wide range of accessories, buildings and vehicles, as well as many sorts of animals, are also part of the Playmobil line. 

Playmobil toys are produced in themed series of sets as well as individual special figures and playsets. New products and product lines developed by a 50-strong development team are introduced frequently, and older sets are discontinued. Promotional and one-off products are sometimes produced in very limited quantities. These practices have helped give rise to a sizeable community of collectors. Collector activities extend beyond collecting and free-form play and include customization, [[miniature wargaming]], and the creation of photo stories and [[stop motion]] films, or simply as [[decoration]].  
[[File:First Playmobil.jpg|thumb|First generation Playmobil figures (identifiable by the lack of articulation at the wrists) in the first themes: Knights, Indians, and Construction.]]

==History==
[[File:Jmj 2011 playmobil.jpg|thumb|A Playmobil street scene, featuring a custom model of the Pope (but really Saint Nicholas).]]
Playmobil was invented by [[German inventors and discoverers|German inventor]] [[Hans Beck]] (1929&nbsp;&ndash; 2009), who is often called "The Father of Playmobil". Beck received training as a [[cabinet (furniture)|cabinetmaker]] but was also an avid hobbyist of [[Model aircraft|model airplane]]s, a product he pitched to the company geobra Brandstätter. The owner of the company, [[Horst Brandstätter]], asked him to develop toy figures for children instead.

Beck spent three years from 1971 to 1974 developing what became Playmobil.<ref>http://store.playmobilusa.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-US-Site/en_US/Link-Page?cid=HANSBECK2006</ref> Beck conducted research that allowed him to develop a toy that would not be too complex but would nevertheless be flexible. He felt that too much flexibility would get in the way of children's imaginations, and too much rigidity would cause frustration. The toy he came up with, at 7.5&nbsp;cm tall, fit in a child's hand and its facial design was based on children's drawings - a large head, a big smile, and no nose. "I would put the little figures in their hands without saying anything about what they were," Beck remarked. "They accepted them right away&nbsp;... They invented little scenarios for them. They never grew tired of playing with them.".<ref>http://www.csmonitor.com/1997/1007/100797.home.home.1.html</ref> 

The [[1973 oil crisis]] made it possible for Playmobil to be considered a viable product. The rising oil prices imposed on geobra Brandstätter, for whom Beck worked as Head of Development, demanded that the company turn to products that required less solid plastic material than the [[hula hoop]]s and other large plastic items the company had been producing.

In 1974, the company put the first sets of knights, Native Americans, and construction workers on show in its display rooms. Initial visitors were reluctant to accept the toy. Nevertheless, the toy was shown at the [[Nuremberg International Toy Fair|International Toy Fair in Nuremberg]], which was taking place that same year.  A Dutch firm agreed to buy a whole year's production. By the end of the year, geobra Brandstätter had achieved sales of 3 million [[Deutschmark]]s with Playmobil - one-sixth of the company’s total sales.<ref>http://store.playmobilusa.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-US-Site/en_US/Link-Page?cid=HANSBECK2006</ref> Playmobil began to be sold worldwide in 1975, and has remained a popular toy ever since.

Playmobil has been a successful toy line for more than 25 years and they have been a major competitor to [[Lego]] toys. Examples of directly competing toys in both their product line are not hard to find. Within the limitations of the Playmobil toy world, the Playmobil toys are usually realistic, and present accurate representations of arms, armor, costumes, and tools from a recognizable time period. Especially notable for their fine attention to detail are the modern construction and city life toys (cars, cranes, fire-engines, trains, boats, etc.).

==Products and licensing==
[[File:Playmobil Construction 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of the construction of a Playmobil figure, second generation (identifiable by the articulation at the wrists).]]
Playmobil toys are specifically aimed at children from the ages of four to twelve. The company believe that older children tend not to play with these types of toys and so they have resisted creating toys from less well-known historical time periods. Many adults own or collect Playmobil and make movies with the toys.

The first Playmobil sets were themed around [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[construction worker]]s and [[knight]]s.<ref>http://www.collectobil.com/guide/1974.html</ref>

Playmobil hands were designed to be capable of gripping and holding objects. Earlier figures had arms of one piece. Since 1982 all figures have hands that rotate at the wrists.<ref>http://store.playmobilusa.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-US-Site/en_US/Link-Page?cid=PMFIGUR</ref> Almost all Playmobil figures are unnamed, thus allowing children to invent their own characters. The exceptions to this are characters from the 1999 game [[Hype: The Time Quest]], where some figures were subsequently made, including the title character, Hype.

Most Playmobil sets require some assembly by the owner. Buildings especially come with detailed instructions for putting them together. Playmobil building parts were originally designed to fit together using a system of tabs and slots known as "Steck-System". In recent years a new construction system has been introduced that dispenses with the tabs and instead uses small connector pieces and a special tool. This is known as "System-X" and is now the standard Playmobil construction system, Steck-System having been retired except for special reissues.
[[File:Playmobil System-X connectors and tool.JPG|thumb|Connector pieces and special tool used in System-X.]]

A number of different companies were licensed throughout Europe and Latin America to produce and distribute Playmobil figures:

In Spain, figures were produced by the leading dollmaker [[Famosa]], and marketed as "los clicks de Famobil". Spanish packages listed the quantity of male dolls (''clicks'') and females (''clacks''). Females were distinguished by hairstyle, a wider chestpiece suggesting a skirt, and some had arms that look bent but are not.{{clarify|date=March 2014}}

Greek figures were produced during the 1970s by a company called [[Lyra (company)|Lyra]]. 

In Argentina Playmobil is licensed by Antex, for distribution in all South American markets. Previously Playmobil was licensed through a number of different companies, including Brazil's [[Trol]]<!-- not troll! -->, [[Estrela (company)|Estrela]] and [[Industria de Brinquedos do Amazonas]], and Peru's [[BASA]]. 

From 1976 to 1980, Playmobil was licensed by [[Louis Marx and Company]] in the United Kingdom and sold under the brand name '''Playpeople'''.

Playmobil was introduced to the USA by [[Mattel]] and [[Schaper Toys|Schaper]].<ref>http://www.collectobil.com/guide/schaper.html</ref> In 1982, Schaper arranged a promotion to distribute Playmobil toys nationwide as in [[McDonald's]] [[Happy Meal]]s. The five Playmobil toys that were to be included in the promotion were a Sheriff, an Indian, a Sheriff's Horse, an Umbrella Girl and a Farmer. Approximately 10 million of the Sheriff and Indian Playmobil toys were distributed from October 22 through November 1, 1982. Before the other toys could be distributed McDonald's ceased distribution and promotion of Playmobil at its restaurants after tests showed that the toy failed to comply with [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|Consumer Product Safety Commission]] standards designed to prevent children under three from choking on dangerous items. (The Playmobil toys were not involved in any reported choking incidents.) McDonald's customers with children under three who received these toys were advised to discontinue their use and return the toys to a McDonald's in exchange for a [[List of McDonald's products|dessert]], a cone, or a refund.

Over the years, some proposed sets have included [[coolie|Chinese Railroad Workers]] and a [[gravedigger|Grave Digger]] for the Western theme, as well as a Medieval [[Torture]] Room. Prototypes were made. However, these sets were considered insensitive and inappropriate for young children, and were never released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.collectobil.com/guide/faq03.html#prototypes |title=FAQ part 3 - Assortment Questions |publisher=Collectobil |date= |accessdate=2009-12-03}}</ref> There are however sets including ghosts and a mummy containing a skeleton.

In 2004 [[BMW]] licensed the familiar Playmobil look and feel to release an exclusive [[BMW Z4]] done in Playmobil scale. It also came with two Playmobil passengers. Originally, the only way to get one of these Z4s (available in deep red or blue) was to take a test drive at a BMW dealership in Germany. Shortly thereafter, versions in a pale yellow or [[Robin egg blue|eggshell blue]] were available in European toy stores. Though not manufactured by Playmobil, they were officially licensed.

Playmobil [[pop-up book]]s, in which buildings and settings corresponded to the height of actual Playmobil figures, were sold for a time, as well as a series of [[comic book]]s, [[coloring book]]s, and [[puzzle]]s.

===Bootlegs and unauthorized figures===
In 1978, [[Schenk]], a [[Germans of Hungary|German-Hungarian]] firm, began reproducing [[Copyright infringement|bootleg]] Playmobil figures. They had not received any authorization or license from Geobra Brandstätter. Schenk produced exact copies of the original toy, though some sets were modified to create new types of sets, usually military, from Hungarian history. Thus, Schenk produced the [[Hussar]] (Huszár), from the period of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Hungarian War of Independence]] as well as the Hungarian hussar series (Magyar huszár sorozat). Other sets included the [[Austria]]n soldier (Osztrák), [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] soldier (Török), [[William Tell]] (Tell Vilmos), and the [[Hunyadi family|Hunyadi]] series (Hunyadi sorozat).

Schenk figures, like the early Playmobil figures, do not have moveable hands, and unlike the Playmobil horses, the Schenk horses do not have moveable heads. Schenk figures also bear different colors from their Playmobil counterparts. They were also made with inferior plastic. Following the collapse of [[communism]], a 1995 court ruling forbade the manufacture and distribution of the Schenk figures. The owner of Schenk, Károly Schenk, was allowed to sell off his remaining toy figures only in Hungary until March 1996. However, Schenk bootlegs may still be available in toy shops in Hungary.

Bootleg sets also have been manufactured in China. These sets are not marketed as Playmobil, though they are identical in terms of appearance (but not in regards to quality). Sets include a "Noshery" (fast food eatery), "Pirate Island", and medieval figures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playmofriends.com/forum/index.php?topic=617.0 |title=China Playmobil !! |publisher=Playmofriends.com |date=2006-03-12 |accessdate=2009-12-03}}</ref>

==Distribution==
New Playmobil sets are released over a two-year period, with the non-export markets getting new sets first, then the export markets receiving them a year later. This is done so that Playmobil will only have to make one very expensive mold for each new piece, and still be able to manufacture the initial stock of the new set. This first stock is what initially stocks store shelves; afterwards Playmobil makes smaller quantities to refill shelves in accordance with demand. In order to produce enough sets to release them to the entire world at the same time, Playmobil would need to buy two of each mold. Eventually, as production for the piece slowed down, the second mold would be useless.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.collectobil.com/guide/export.html |title=Export/Non-Export Markets |publisher=Collectobil |date= |accessdate=2009-12-03}}</ref>

'''Robert Shelton''', born '''Robert Shapiro''' (June 28, 1926, [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[United States]] &ndash;  December 11, 1995, [[Brighton, England]]) was a music and [[motion picture|film]] critic. Shelton was perhaps most notable for the way in which he helped to launch the career of a then unknown 20-year-old [[folk music|folk]] singer named [[Bob Dylan]]. In 1961, Dylan was performing at [[Gerdes Folk City]] in the [[West Village]], one of the best-known folk venues in [[New York City|New York]], opening for a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] act called the [[Greenbriar Boys]]. Shelton's positive review, in the ''[[The New York Times]]'', brought crucial publicity to Dylan, and led to a [[Columbia records|Columbia]] recording contract.<ref name=pc31>{{Gilliland |url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19789/m1/ |title=Show 31 - Ballad in Plain D: An introduction to the Bob Dylan era. [Part 1]}} Track 2.</ref>

==Biography==
Shelton was born in Chicago in 1926 under the name Robert Shapiro, the son of Joseph and Hannah Shapiro, Russian Jewish immigrants. His father, a research chemist, was born in [[Minsk]] and came to the US in 1905. Robert was raised in Chicago, served in the [[US Army]] in France during 1944-45, and attended the School of Journalism at [[Northwestern University]]. He moved to New York in the 1950s, and soon joined the staff of ''[[The New York Times]]''. In 1955 he was one of 30 ''The New York Times'' staffers subpoenaed by the [[Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]], who were informed by ''Times'' counsel Louis M. Loeb that they would be fired if they took the Fifth Amendment. Shelton refused to answer questions from the committee about any affiliation with the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] or about fellow ''Times'' staffer [[Matilda Landsman]], and was indicted by a grand jury for contempt. Because he did not plead the Fifth he was allowed to continue working at the ''Times'' but was transferred away from the news department onto the less sensitive entertainment desk, where he became a music critic. Convicted and sentenced to six months in prison, he appealed his conviction and had it reversed on a technicality, only to be indicted, retried, convicted, and have the conviction overturned on a technicality again. After several years of appeals in which he was represented by noted civil liberties lawyer [[Joseph L. Rauh, Jr.]] the case was finally dropped in the mid-1960s.

For a decade (1958–1968), Shelton reviewed music, in particular [[folk music]], but also [[popular music|pop]] and [[country music]], becoming a friend of many of the artists and extending his influence beyond the pages of the ''Times''. His other work included writing the programs at the [[Newport Folk Festival]], and writing album notes for several artists. On [[Bob Dylan|Bob Dylan's]] [[Bob Dylan (album)|first album]], Shelton's notes are credited to 'Stacey Williams'. During the early 1960s, Shelton co-edited a magazine, ''Hootenanny'', at the same time as his friend [[Linda Solomon]] edited a different magazine titled ''[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] Hootenanny''.

Shelton spent 20 years writing and rewriting his Dylan biography, ''No Direction Home, The Life and Music of Bob Dylan''  which was finally published in 1986, after years of arguments with publishers about the style and length of the work. Shelton's intention from the outset was to write a serious cultural study, not a showbiz biography; as a result, he later said his life's work had been "abridged over troubled waters". The title is taken from the lyric of Dylan's hit single, "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]". The same title, ''[[No Direction Home]]'', was used by [[Martin Scorsese]] for his 2005 documentary film about Dylan's career from the beginning to his motorcycle crash in 1966. Other books by Shelton include ''Electric Muse: The Story Of Folk Into Rock'' and ''The Face of Folk Music''.

In 1982 Shelton moved to Brighton, England, where he wrote mostly about films for a number of publications up to the time of his death. In 1996, Shelton's papers, and his collection of books, records and research material were donated to the Institute of Popular Music at the [[University of Liverpool]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=2DF2DBC84C2B3537AC25F7165954EBA1.journals?fromPage=online&aid=1858024| title = New Archive Collection| author = Strachan, Rob| date = January 1997| accessdate = June 15, 2014| publisher = Popular Music Journal}}</ref>

{{Nihongo|'''Nakamichi Corp., Ltd.'''|}} (?????? ''Kabushiki-Gaisha Nakamichi'')  is a Japanese consumer electronics brand that originated in Japan and gained a name from the 1970s onwards for innovative and high quality audio [[cassette deck]]s.

Nakamichi manufactured electronic devices from its founding in 1948, but only sold them under its own name from 1972. It is credited with offering the world's first three-head cassette deck.<ref>{{cite web|last=Guttenberg|first=Steve|title=Nakamichi Dragon Cassette Deck|url=http://www.hometheater.com/content/nakamichi-dragon-cassette-deck|work=Home Theater magazine|publisher=Source Interlink Media|accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref> Since 1999 its product range has included design-oriented [[home cinema]] audio systems, mini hi-fi systems and  automotive stereo products, and from 2006, video [[DVD]] products.

==Background==
Nakamichi was founded by [[Etsuro Nakamichi]] in 1948 as Nakamichi Research Corporation Ltd (Nakamichi Kenkyujo Kabushiki Kaisha) in [[Tokyo]] [[Japan]]. It specialised in manufacturing portable radios, tone arms, speakers, and communications equipment. It was later headed by the founder's younger brother Niro Nakamichi. The company was originally established as a research and development firm in electronics and optics but later became known as a manufacturer of quality audio products. While its cassette decks were particularly well known, the company is also credited with audio innovations, such as self-centering [[record player]]s, high-end [[Digital audio tape|DAT]] recorders, and ultra-compact slot-loading CD changers. 

In the 1950s, Nakamichi developed one of the first [[open reel]] [[tape recorder]]s in Japan under the '''Magic Tone''' brand. In 1957 it developed and made its own magnetic tape heads, as well as launching the [[Fidela]] 3-head Open Reel Stereo Tape Deck. 

Because of its experience in manufacturing magnetic tape heads and equipment, in 1967 the company started making tape decks for a number of foreign manufacturers including [[Harman Kardon]], [[KLH (company)|KLH]], [[Henry_Kloss#Advent_Corporation|Advent]], [[Fisher Electronics|Fisher]], [[ELAC, Inc.|ELAC]], [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]], [[Concord (audio)|Concord]], [[Ampex]] and [[Motorola]].

From 1973 Nakamichi started to sell high-quality stereo [[cassette deck]]s that benefited from the mass market's move away from [[reel-to-reel]] [[tape recorder]]s to the cassette format. The Nakamichi 1000 and 700, made in the mid-1970s, had three heads, a dual capstan drive that reduced [[wow (recording)|wow]] and [[flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]], and [[Dolby noise reduction system|Dolby-B noise reduction]] to improve the [[signal to noise ratio]]. The dual capstan drive lifted the cassette tape's spring pressure pad out of the way, enabling lower head wear, and lower modulation noise. High-end features of these models included adjustable [[record head]] [[azimuth]] and Dolby calibration. The relatively high retail price of the 1000 and 700 prompted Nakamichi to offer lower-priced two-head models such as the Nakamichi 500 and the wedge-shaped 600.

[[Image:Nakamichi550.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Nakamichi 550. Portable, though the size and weight of an early VCR.]]

The Nakamichi 550 was a portable cassette recorder that had three [[microphone]] inputs: one for left channel, one for right channel, and one for a center blend channel. This recorder could run from batteries or AC and was used to make high quality recordings in the field.

In the late 1970s Nakamichi updated and broadened its model range, with revised products including the Nakamichi 1000-II, the 700-II, and the lower-end 600-II. Nakamichi branched out into other audio components such as pre-amplifiers, power-amplifiers, tuners, receivers and later speakers.

In the early 1980s Nakamichi's top-of-the-line cassette deck was the 1000ZXL, retailing at US$3,800, its price only exceeded by the 1000ZXL Limited at US$6000. The updated 700ZXL sold for US$3,000 but Nakamichi also offered lower-end cassette decks under US$300. This time marked a peak in the market for cassette recorders, before it lost ground to [[digital recording]] media such as CD.

[[File:Nakamichi kimono LED hi-res image.pdf|thumb|Nakamichi Kimono 3D LED TV with slim full brushed aluminium body]]From 2011, Nakamichi offered products targeting a younger demographic including iPod docking systems and 3D LED TVs.

==The meaning of the brand name and logo==
The Nakamichi logo consists, in part, of the stylized representation of the letter "N"; it is also intended to represent in a fanciful way the earth, half of which is illuminated by the sun.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

A translation of "Nakamichi", the family name of the company founder, is "in the middle of a road" or "midway".

==Notable Nakamichi products and advances==

===Three-head cassette decks===
Nakamichi was the first to use a three-head recording technique in a cassette deck.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Separate tape heads were used for playback, recording, and erase. Previously the playback and recording functions were combined in a single tape head.  The three-head mechanism allowed higher quality reproduction as well as the ability to hear a recording in progress - as the tape traveled past the recording head onto the playback head. 

The first Nakamichi three-head decks were the 1000 and 700 introduced around 1973. The 1000 and 700 series decks had tape bias settings for normal bias (IEC TYPE I) and [[Tape bias|high bias]] (IEC TYPE II).  Competitor cassette decks offered Ferri Chrome (IEC TYPE III) whereas Nakamichi chose not to do so.  The settings for the normal and high bias were labeled as EX and SX respectively. Nakamichi also sold its own brand of blank cassette tapes.

Around 1978 when metal bias (IEC TYPE IV) cassettes came into the market, Nakamichi produced some early metal tape capable decks such as the 580M.<ref>http://www.vintagecassette.com/Nakamichi/580M</ref> The tape settings on these decks were EX (normal bias), SX (high bias), and ZX (metal bias).

Around 1980 Nakamichi introduced the third generation of 1000 and 700 three-head decks.  The 1000ZXL and 700ZXL had full metal capability as well as normal and high bias abilities and had built-in computers for calibrating the decks to a specific tape.  These built-in computers were known as A.B.L.E. for Azimuth, Bias, Level, and Equalization. The user would use this function (activated by an "Auto Cal" button) to optimize the deck to a specific brand of tape to get best recording results from every cassette.<ref>{{cite web

</ref>  
Hence the 1000ZXL and 700ZXL were known as computing cassette decks.  Also offered was a third less costly deck the 700ZXE auto tuning cassette deck.

A more expensive 1000ZXL Limited was also offered, with the same specifications as the 1000ZXL but with a gold plated face. Other Nakamichi cassette decks are the Cassette Deck 1 and the Cassette Deck 1 Limited. Like the 1000ZXL Limited, the Cassette Deck 1 Limited is more expensive than the Cassette Deck 1.

===Flip-Auto Reverse===
[[Image:Nakamichi RX 505 Front edited.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Nakamichi RX-505 audio cassette deck with UDAR.]]
[[Image:Nakamichi RX 505 Top Open1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Top view of UDAR mechanism.]]
Called "UDAR" for UniDirectional Auto Reverse.  Used on the Nakamichi RX series of decks.  With the advent of auto-reverse (playing the tape in both directions), Nakamichi had long recognized that the angle of the tape passing over the playback head was not the same if the tape head was rotated in the opposite direction and its first approach was to track the azimuth on the tape itself by moving the head slightly - a very complex affair which led to the design of the Dragon with its NAAC, subsequently Nakamichi never revisited this approach and set its engineers in search of a more elegant solution. Nakamichi soon developed its UDAR mechanism which mimicked the way people had manually turned over their tapes in the past - thus was born a mechanical system that would eject the tape, spin it around and reload it into the deck.  It was available on all Nakamichi RX series of tape decks, i.e., the RX-202, RX-303 and RX-505. The 'top of the range' RX-505 was made after the Dragon. Its operation was elegantly simple, easy to set up, easy to calibrate, and easy to use, with only one rewind and forward operation in a unique unidirectional auto-reverse deck. It also had an updated and simpler drive system that was more direct loading, had updated and quieter electronics, and its revised capstan is essentially what Nakamichi used for its 1988 Nakamichi 1000 DAT recorder.

===Tape pressure pad lifter===
A [[Compact audio cassette|cassette tape]] contains a "pressure pad" of some type, usually made of felt ([[:image:Cassetteinternals.jpg|reference image]]).  This pad is within the cassette tape shell (located just behind the tape opening) and opposes the magnetic head of the [[cassette deck]], providing pressure against the head(s) when the tape is being played.  Nakamichi found that this pad provided uneven and fairly inaccurate pressure and was therefore inadequate for reliable tape/head contact. Furthermore, Nakamichi found that the pressure pad was a source of audible noise, particularly scrape flutter (the tape bouncing across the head, a result of uneven pressure), and also contributed to premature head wear. Nakamichi's dual-capstan tape decks provide such accurate and precise tape tension that, unlike other decks, the cassette's pressure pad is not needed at all. To remedy this problem, the vast majority of Nakamichi dual-capstan decks contain a "cage" around the record/playback heads that lifts the pressure pad out of the way so that the deck itself—specifically, the dual capstan mechanism—is able to maintain much more consistent tape tension and tape/head contact during playback.

===The Dragon and special products===
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Nakamichidragonct.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Nakamichi Dragon CT Turntable.]] -->

In the CD era (post 1983), the top line Nakamichi products were termed the "Dragon."  The Dragon-CT turntable ("Computing Turntable") automatically adjusted for off-center holes in records by moving the platter in two dimensions.  The Dragon CD playing system has special mechanical damping to prevent vibrations of the CD, and holds multiple CDs.  The Dragon cassette deck used a special microprocessor controlled azimuth adjustment called Nakamichi Automatic Azimuth Correction (NAAC) to find the best sound for each recorded cassette tape, however because it was both expensive to manufacture and more complex as well as difficult to both service and maintain, Nakamichi sought to produce a new deck with the same excellent accuracy of azimuth but without the associated costs and difficulties of servicing. They came up with an elegant though some think gimmicky solution and that was to automate the manual turnover of tape - in other words eject the tape and spin it around to maintain proper tape head alignment and this is in fact what Nakamichi did with the amazing RX series. The RX-505 is not a compromise as many assumed but the very best method of maintaining azimuth without using the costly, complex and 'somewhat' fragile NAAC system even though the Akai GXC-65D was the first cassette deck to "actually" use this method where the cassette would flip over instead of the head being rotated but was done in a top-loading fashion as this were cassette decks from the early-mid 1970's.

Other products from Nakamichi did not acquire the "Dragon" name but were still notable. These include the Nakamichi 1000 series products with the 1000ZXL cassette deck being more advanced and expensive than the Dragon cassette deck. The Nakamichi 1000 digital audio tape transport and Nakamichi 1000p digital to audio converter system were Nakamichi's reference [[digital audio tape]] components. These components were intended to establish Nakamichi's dominance in the field of digital audio tape (DAT), but DAT was not widely adopted by [[audiophiles]], as the format itself did not gain acceptance as an [[Technical standard|industry standard]].

===Stasis Series amplifiers===
Nakamichi licensed "Stasis" technology from powerhouse amplifier manufacturer Threshold (a [[class A amplifier]] circuit by Nelson Pass, then a designer at Threshold, now at [[Pass Labs]]). This circuit was used in a line of expensive Nakamichi PA series of power-amplifiers, such as the PA-5 and PA-7, as well as its SR and TA series of receivers.

===Car stereo products===
In the early 1980s, Nakamichi introduced a line of [[car stereo]] products.  The flagship product was the TD-1200 cassette receiver which incorporated a drawer-mounted, top-loading cassette mechanism with NAAC (like the Dragon), Dolby B and Dolby C.  Other early products included the TD-700 cassette receiver with manual azimuth adjustment (like the Cassette Deck 1, Cassette Deck 1 Limited, DR-1 and the CR-7), a power amplifier and speakers.  In the early 1990s, Nakamichi was one of the first companies to produce automotive CD changers that loaded multiple discs via a single slot rather than a CD cartridge.

[[Toyota]] would choose Nakamichi along with [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] to manufacture the audio systems for its range of [[Lexus]] automobiles. The Nakamichi unit was the flagship audio system offered to Lexus buyers, and this partnership lasted from 1989 to 2001.

Another follow-on flagship head unit was the TP-1200, which consisted of a headunit and a separate 'black box' pre-amp section. The casing for both units was made from machined aluminium, and the internal circuitry for both units was suspended using a mechanical  suspension system. The headunit contained a diversity tuner and display unit only. The pre-amp section performed input switching, volume and tone adjustment. The tone controls (bass-mid-treble) were motor driven analog controls while the volume, balance and fader were digital.

Other products of note were the 100pa amplifier and the limited edition version the 1000pa.
Both were identical in specifications (4x50wrms) and internal layout, the only difference being the case color.  The 100pa was silver and the 1000pa black. 
The mobile TD-560 was a versatile pull-out-of-dash and remote controlled cassette and FM tuner head unit, that performed at the level of excellence matched only by very best Nakamichi mobile decks of the late 1980s era.  
Revolutionary was Nakamichi's mobile PA-350 four channel power amplifier, with extraordinary discrete amplifiers and exemplary performance specifications.

==Decline of Nakamichi==
In 1989 Nakamichi, along with Pioneer, teamed with Toyota Corp. to produce a premium sound system in its Lexus line of automobiles. In 1990, Nakamichi introduced the music bank in its CD players which was based on a single loading tray concept with a total capacity of 7 CDs. This differentiated from the rest of the industry which typically offered a self-loading magazine or a carousel. Nakamichi further enhanced the music bank system in its 1992 offering (MB line) touting the quickest changer in the market. However, the quick changer concept experienced frequent jamming in its machines and as a result, required the company to redesign the mechanism in 1994 with a slight delay during the loading process. While this was corrected, Nakamichi's footing in the digital age was not concrete. In fact, its presence in the rapidly growing audio/video arena was modest at best{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} with its AV-1 and AV-2 receivers (introduced in 1993).  Further impacting its audio reputation was the ending of the licensing agreement with [[Nelson Pass]] for the use of the Stasis technology. Without it, its line of preamplifiers and power amplifiers were compromised; its technological advantage, more important in the high end audio market, was lost. Nakamichi attempted to counter the loss with its receivers touting Harmonic Time Alignment (HTA).{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- Tagging the whole paragraph -->

===Nakamichi Harmonic Time Alignment technology===
The time alignment of an amplified music signal and its distortion components has a profound effect on perceived sound quality. Nakamichi researchers discovered that the human ear is much more tolerant of harmonic distortion if the distortion components are time-aligned with respect to the primary signal. Nakamichi Harmonic Time Alignment (HTA) amplifiers adopt a wideband, low open-loop gain design. A minimal amount of negative feedback is used, but, more important, it is kept constant over the entire audio spectrum. This assures the proper timing between the primary signal and any amplifier distortion components. The sonic benefits of this design include powerful, high-resolution bass, a natural, richly detailed midrange, and smooth, clear highs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- Tagging the whole paragraph -->

In layman's term, HTA masked distortion through the primary signal.  While effective, total harmonic distortion for this technology was higher than Nakamichi's receivers utilizing Stasis technology. Whether sound quality improved or dissipated with this technology is left to the listener's ears.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- Tagging the whole paragraph -->

Nakamichi's reputation for being the pioneer of audio cassettes no longer carried weight in the era of CDs. The lack of innovative digital technology meant Nakamichi was not able to successfully brand itself in the digital age. Further adding to its demise was a shrinking distribution channel as high-end audio boutiques were forced to close as they were unable to compete in a rapidly changing environment where shoppers gravitated towards electronic superstores. Ultimately, electronic consumers, who once were able to apply a significant portion of their outlay on audio-only components, needed to allocate more of their budget towards acquiring new video gear such as laser disc players, flat panel displays, DVD players, etc. In addition, a recession in the early 1990s caused many consumers to settle for mainstream electronics brands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- Tagging the whole paragraph -->

Toyota also stopped using Nakamichi systems in [[Lexus]] vehicles at this time, instead choosing [[Mark Levinson Audio Systems|Mark Levinson]] when Toyota made a deal with [[Harman International]] to provide premium audio systems in its vehicles in 2000. Bob Carter, Lexus general manager, also cited a lack of "resonance" with intended consumers as reasons for the switch.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- Tagging the whole paragraph -->

By the end of 1990s Nakamichi failed to transition properly. In 1998, it was acquired by the Grande Holdings, a Chinese company based in Hong Kong. Grande Holdings included electronics companies Akai and Sansui.  Niro Nakamichi left in 1998 to set up Mechanical Research Corporation. The company went into [[bankruptcy]] protection on February 19, 2002.<ref>http://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20020220/nakami.htm</ref> In Nakamichi's defense, many high end audio manufacturers were forced to merge or sell to larger holding companies during this time period partially influenced by the collapse of the Japanese "[[Japanese asset price bubble|bubble economy]]"; such well known companies include McIntosh and Mark Levinson.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}<!-- Tagging the whole paragraph -->

The company emerged from bankruptcy and repositioned itself as a manufacturer of high-end "lifestyle systems" in the same manner as [[Bang & Olufsen]]. They also manufacture [[CD changer]]s for hi-fi, computer, and car audio units.

In June 2006, Nakamichi released its first portable [[DVD player]] with built-in [[LCD]] screen, the Lumos.<ref>{{cite web

==Niro Nakamichi==
In 2001, Niro Nakamichi, designer of many of the historic tape decks, started a new company, Mechanical Research Corporation, which introduced ultra high end audio amplifiers, preamplifiers, and an integrated amplifier, called "engines." The products featured innovative designs and addressed issues of mechanical isolation, as well as presenting a unique appearance. Soon thereafter, however, the "engine" products were no longer promoted and a line of home theater products was introduced [http://www.niro1.com/en/].

{{Nihongo|'''Konosuke Matsushita'''|?? ???|Matsushita K?nosuke|extra=November 27, 1894 &ndash; April 27, 1989}} was a [[Japan]]ese industrialist who founded [[Panasonic Corporation|Panasonic]], the largest Japanese consumer electronics company. For many Japanese, he is known as "the god of management".{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} A biography of Matsushita's life called ''Matsushita Leadership'' was written by American business management specialist [[John Kotter]] in 1998.

==Childhood==
Konosuke Matsushita was born on November 27, 1894 in [[Wakayama Prefecture]].  His father was an affluent landlord in the farming village of Wasa which is a part of [[Wakayama]] today. Matsushita was born into a well-to-do family but the family became 
impoverished because his father made some bad investment decisions, primarily in rice speculation. In 1899, the family's entire fortune was gone and anything of value was sold off. The family was forced to move to a cramped three bedroom city apartment where conditions were less than sanitary.  There was always a lack of food, clothing, and medical care. Within several years, Matsushita's health declined rapidly and three of his older siblings died due to infectious diseases. Matsushita's formal education ended at the age of nine.

==Teenage years==

Shortly after Matsushita left school, he was sent away to Osaka to become an apprentice for a [[hibachi]] store. Not even a year into his apprenticeship, the hibachi shop failed and Matsushita was left looking for another source of income. It was during this time that the use of electricity was becoming more widespread in Japan and Matsushita felt that this technological discovery would be the dawn of a new era. Matsushita was determined to be a part of this industry and this propelled him to apply for a job with the Osaka Electric Light Company, an electrical utility company. Originally, he was hired to work as a wiring assistant but because of his willingness to learn, he quickly became an electrician.  Over the next couple of years, Matsushita’s position rose within the company as he was promoted several times. During this time, Matsushita was introduced to one of his sister's friends and shortly thereafter, he married Mumeno Iue.  Matsushita was now responsible for a family and this newfound burden was not lost on him.  At the age of 22, Matsushita was promoted to the position of an electrical inspector.  Such a position was considered somewhat prestigious as the salary was considerably attractive, given the fact that Matsushita was, to a certain degree, uneducated.   It was during this time frame that Matsushita attempted to introduce his boss to an invention of a new and improved light socket that he had perfected in his spare time.  However, his boss was less than enthusiastic and Matsushita became predictably deflated.  Because Matsushita no longer felt challenged in his career, he soon grew dissatisfied with his job.  This became the turning point in his life.

==Matsushita Electric Industrial Company==

In 1917, Matsushita left Osaka Electric Light Company to set up his own company.  Without capital, a formal education, and experience in manufacturing, it would appear the company would fail before it even began.  However, whatever resources Matsushita lacked, he made up with ambition and determination. Matsushita set up his shop in the basement of his tenement and with his wife, his brother-in-law and several assistants, he began creating several samples of his product. He attempted to peddle his samples to several wholesalers but was unsuccessful because he did not offer more than one product.  Eventually, Matsushita's assistants left his company and he was left with only his wife and brother-in-law, [[Toshio Iue]], who proved to be a capable salesman and manager in his own right. Matsushita would have eventually become bankrupt but he was "saved by an unexpected order for a thousand insulator plates for electric fans.".<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> From there, Matsushita was able to continue producing his light sockets and eventually they became popular as wholesalers began realizing the product was better in quality and less expensive than comparable products in the existing market.  Matsushita's products were originally marketed under the name brand of "National" and later moved on to the more recognizable names of Panasonic, Quasar and Technics.

One of Matsushita's best products was his invention of a more efficient battery-powered [[Bicycle lighting|bicycle lamp]].  During the 1920s, bicycle lamps were either powered by candles or by oil-burning lamps.  These types of lamps were highly inefficient as they usually only lasted for three-hours.  Matsushita created an oval lamp that used a battery for power and a lightbulb for illumination.  At first, Matsushita could not get wholesalers interested in his products as they were skeptical of the concept of using a battery-powered lamp.  Matsushita took it upon himself to personally market his products to retail bicycle shops.  Once the idea caught on, his sales for the battery-powered bicycle lamps took off. The early years of the company were difficult and he once had to pawn his wife's [[kimono]] when he found himself short on money.

==Expansion==

Matsushita learned a very important lesson in terms of growing a company while he was trying to introduce his bicycle lamp to wholesalers.  He realized that even if he had a product that was superior to anything out in the market it would not matter if he could not sell the product.  As a result, Matsushita began devising ways to create sales channels for his products by concentrating less on manufacturing and more on building a sales force.  This led to a retail store network and finally placed Matsushita's company on the map in Japan's electrical manufacturing and retail industry.

In 1929, Matsushita began setting up a new structure for his company.  The company was structured as a parent company and branches of divisions that specialized in a particular product were created.  There were three specific products that were being created in Matsushita's company at this time: the bicycle lamp and battery division, the electrical socket division, and the radio division.  For each of these products, a national sales department was formed with regional offices established in strategic locations.  These regional offices were responsible for the coordination of sales and manufacturing.  Products were manufactured based upon the demand for the products.  As a result, manufacturing was dependent on sales.

==Matsushita and the post-war period==

During the US occupation of Japan after WWII, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] decided to break up the ''zaibatsu'', or business conglomerates of Japan. Matsushita was in danger of removal as president, but was saved by a favorable petition signed by 15,000 employees.

In 1947, Konosuke lent his brother-in-law Toshio an unutilized manufacturing plant to manufacture bicycle lamps, which eventually became [[Sanyo|Sanyo Electric]].

From 1950 to 1973, Matsushita's company became one of the world’s largest manufacturers of electrical goods, sold under well-known [[trademark]]s including Panasonic and Technics. Matsushita stepped down as President of Panasonic in 1961 and was succeeded as president by his son-in-law, [[Masaharu Matsushita]].<ref name=ap>{{cite news|first=Yuri|last=Kageyama|title= Former Panasonic president Matsushita dies at 99 |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5huRLWgb5Sv5xplij62tqHZzFAg9Q?docId=e65fad42e800452b90a55c8c7ab75a74 |work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=|date=2012-07-17 |accessdate=2012-07-18}}</ref> However, he remained active in Panasonic's operations until his complete retirement in 1973. Since 1954, Matsushita also gained a significant shareholding in manufacturer [[JVC]] by forming an alliance.<ref>{{cite web

 | language =

 | year = 2007
}}</ref> {{Dead link|date=November 2009}} It still retains a 50% share today.

In retirement, Matsushita focused on developing and explaining his social and commercial philosophies, and wrote 44 published books. One of his books, entitled “Developing A Road To Peace And Happiness Through Prosperity”, sold over four million copies. In 1979, at the age of 84, he founded the [[Matsushita School of Government and Management]] to train the future politicians and businessmen of Japan.

In 1987, he was awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Paulownia Flowers]].<ref>[http://matsushita-library.jp/en/history/index.html Matsushita Memorial Library].</ref>

==Death==

Chronic [[lung]] problems lead to his death from [[pneumonia]] on 27 April 1989, at the age of 94. He died with personal assets worth US $3 billion, and left a company with US$42 billion in revenue business.

Performers are listed in alphabetical order by the [[ring name|ringname(s)]] they used in ECW (''e.g.'' Roadkill, not Amish Roadkill). Normal alphabetical order applies. Dates listed are for when a performer used that name, not the entire time the performer was active.
*Performers are listed by surname or its equivalent (''e.g.'' all Dudleys are under ''D'', 2 Cold Scorpio, who also spelled his name as Too Cold Scorpio, under ''S'')

Wrestlers who used more than one ringname while in ECW will be listed under the ring name for which they used the most or were best known in order to clean up the list, since any performer who used multiple ring names most likely has them listed on their personal article page with their current or most used ring name in bold on said page.  Their other ring names will be listed after their name next to their years worked.

Stables and tag teams will be listed alphabetically in their own separate section at the bottom of the list.

'''Gerard Leonardo Frederik Philips''' (9 October 1858 &ndash; 26 January 1942) was a Dutch [[industrialist]], co-founder (with his father Frederik Philips) of the [[Philips|Philips Company]] as a family business in 1891. Gerard and his younger brother [[Anton Philips]] changed the business to a corporation by founding in 1912 the [[Philips Electronics|NV Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken]]. As the first CEO of the Philips corporation, Gerard laid with Anton the base for the later Philips multinational.

==Career==
Gerard Philips became interested in electronics and engineering.  Frederik was the financier for Gerard's purchase of the old factory building in Eindhoven where he established the first factory in 1891. They operated the Philips Company as a family business for more than a decade.

==Marriage and family==
On 19 March 1896 Philips married Johanna van der Willigen (30 September 1862 &ndash; 1942).  They had no children.

Gerard's father was first-cousin of [[Karl Marx]] (his paternal aunt was Marx's mother).<ref>''Francis Wheen, Karl Marx: A Life'', (Fourth Estate, 1999), ISBN 1-85702-637-3</ref>  Gerard was an uncle of [[Frits Philips]], whom he and his brother brought into the business. Later they brought in his brother's grandson, Franz Otten.

==Civic activities==
Gerard and his brother [[Anton Philips|Anton]] supported education and social programs in Eindhoven, including the Philips Sport Vereniging (Philips Sports Association), which they founded.  From it the professional football (soccer) department developed into the independent [[PSV Eindhoven|Philips Sport Vereniging N.V.]]

The '''telautograph''', an [[analog (signal)|analog]] precursor to the modern [[fax]] machine, transmits electrical impulses recorded by [[potentiometer]]s at the sending station to [[servomechanism]]s attached to a [[pen]] at the receiving station, thus reproducing at the receiving station a drawing or signature made by the sender. It was the first such device to transmit drawings to a stationary sheet of paper; previous inventions in Europe had used rotating drums to make such transmissions.

The telautograph's invention is attributed to [[Elisha Gray]], who patented it on July&nbsp;31, 1888. Gray's patent stated that the telautograph would allow "one to transmit his own handwriting to a distant point over a two-wire circuit." It was the first facsimile machine in which the stylus was controlled by horizontal and vertical bars.<ref name="Wiley-IEEE">{{cite book|title=The worldwide history of telecommunications|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SnjGRDVIUL4C&pg=PA151&lpg=PA151&dq=Telautograph+and+Elisha+Gray#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> The telautograph was first publicly exhibited at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] held in [[Chicago]].

[[File:Telautograph-1888 electronic writing device.png|thumb|left|Telautograph patent schema]]
In an 1888 interview in ''The Manufacturer & Builder'' (Vol. 24: No. 4: pages 85–86) Gray made this statement:<ref>{{cite web|title=Elisha Gray Deserves Top Billing  In Brownsville History|publisher=Glenn Tunney|url=http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~glenntunneycolumn/column309.htm}}</ref>

<blockquote>''By my invention you can sit down in your office in Chicago, take a pencil in your hand, write a message to me, and as your pencil moves, a pencil here in my laboratory moves simultaneously, and forms the same letters and words in the same way. What you write in Chicago is instantly reproduced here in fac-simile. You may write in any language, use a code or cipher, no matter, a fac-simile is produced here. If you want to draw a picture it is the same, the picture is reproduced here. The artist of your newspaper can, by this device, telegraph his pictures of a railway wreck or other occurrences just as a reporter telegraphs his description in words.''</blockquote>

[[File:PSM V14 D424 Elisha Gray.jpg|thumb|The inventor Elisha Gray]]By the end of the 19th century, the telautograph was modified by [[Foster Ritchie]]. Calling it the telewriter, Ritchie's version of the telautograph could be operated using a telephone line for simultaneous copying and speaking.<ref name="Wiley-IEEE"/>

The telautograph became very popular for the transmission of signatures over a distance, and in banks and large hospitals to ensure that doctors' orders and patient information were transmitted quickly and accurately. Inside a kiosk in the middle of the main concourse of Grand Central Terminal, New York City, as late as 1960, a Telautograph receiver with vertical paper displayed updates to train information.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[File:PSM V44 D062 Sample work of telautograph.jpg|thumb|Sample work of telautograph]]
An example of a Telautograph machine writing script can be seen in the 1956 movie [[Earth vs the Flying Saucers]] as the output device for the mechanical translator. A Telautograph was used in 1911 to warn workers on the 10th floor about the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] that had broken out two floors below.

Telautograph Corporation changed its name several times. In 1971, it was acquired by Arden/Mayfair. In 1993, [[Danka Industries]] purchased the company and renamed it ''Danka/Omnifax''. In 1999, [[Xerox]] corporation purchased the company and called it the ''Omnifax division'', which has since been absorbed by the corporation.

'''The Aiwa Corporation''' (commonly called {{nihongo|'''Aiwa'''|???|}}) was a [[Japan]]ese [[consumer electronics|consumer-electronics]] company.

It produced audio and video equipment from the 1970s until the early 2000s.

==History==
The company, founded in 1951, was a leading manufacturer of audio products, including headphone stereos, minicomponent stereo systems, portable stereo systems, minidisc players, CD and cassette players, and car stereo systems. Nearly 86 percent of company revenues were derived from such audio products. The company also made and sold video products, such as VCRs, color televisions, DVD players, and digital satellite television tuners; this sector accounted for about 12 percent of sales. In the "other" category responsible for the remainder of sales, Aiwa was involved in the production of computer peripherals devices, such as modems, terminal adapters, and speakers, and what the company termed "life amenity products," such as air cleaners and humidifiers. Aiwa manufactured more than 89 percent of its output outside of Japan, with a heavy emphasis on the lower-cost southeast Asian nations of Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The company was also heavily dependent on overseas sales, with more than 80 percent of total revenues being generated outside Japan, with 43 percent in North and South America, 25 percent in Europe, and 13 percent in areas of Asia outside Japan and in other regions. Although officially an affiliated company of consumer electronics giant Sony Corporation, Aiwa prided itself on its independent operation and competed head on with Sony in several product categories. 
{{expand section|history prior to acquisition by Sony|date=January 2012}}

===Operations after acquisition by Sony===
The company slid towards bankruptcy until it was purchased by competitor [[Sony Corporation]]. As of October 1, 2002, Aiwa ceased to be a separate company and became a wholly owned division of Sony. The company retained a logo from the mid-1990s which was used for a very short time.

Sony's reasoning for acquiring the company is unclear, other than that it was already a shareholder in Aiwa Corporation. However, Aiwa was eligible for a tax refund {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} in Japan for fiscal year 2002, which offset the dropping figures in Sony's financial report for fiscal years  2002 and 2003. In January 2003, Sony announced the [[rebranding]] and relaunch of Aiwa as a "youth focused, PC-centric" electronics brand.  A new logo was presented to the world's media along with a statement of Sony's intention to invest in and "revitalize" the Aiwa brand.

The direction proposed was to capitalize on the growing trend among personal-computer-literate teenagers and young adults to use their PCs for all forms of entertainment (television, films, music, chat), an area in which Sony itself was struggling primarily due to the heavy copyright protections it imposed upon its products{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.

Since 2004, however, Sony seemingly began rolling back its support for the Aiwa brand, and by 2005 Aiwa products remained on sale in only selected territories around the globe. In 2006, Aiwa products were discontinued and no longer sold in the market.

As of January 2014, the Aiwa website still existed to provide customer-support telephone numbers for some territories and regions, but it also contained many broken links and blank pages. In other regions, such as Europe, it redirected to a page on the Sony website stating that the Aiwa website had closed.   The last apparent update to the website was in June 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=ind out about AIWA Support: Official Information from Sony|url=http://www.sony-europe.com/staticcontent/hub/aiwa.html|work=Sony Europe|publisher=Sony|accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref>

'''Daewoo''' ("Dae" [[Hangul]]: ?. [[Korean language|Korean]] for "Great" and "Woo" [[Hangul]]: ?. [[Korean language|Korean]] the first name of founder and chairman Kim Woo-jung) or the '''Daewoo Group''' was a major [[South Korea]]n ''[[chaebol]]'' (conglomerate).

It was founded on 22 March 1967 as ''Daewoo Industrial'' and was dismantled by the Korean government in 1999. Prior to the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|Asian financial crisis]], Daewoo was the second largest conglomerate in Korea after [[Hyundai Group]], followed by [[LG Corp|LG Group]] and [[Samsung]]. There were about 20 divisions under the Daewoo Group, some of which survive today as independent companies.

They were personally designed and furnished by Kim Woojoong's socialite wife Heeja who was Chairwoman of the company. The most lavish is the 5-star Hanoi Daewoo Hotel, which cost [[United States dollar|US$]]163 million to build in 1996 and was decorated by Heeja with fine art, porcelain, sculptures, and marble. She invited 3000 guests to the opening, including [[Russia]]n President [[Vladimir Putin]]. There is an 18-hole golf course on the grounds and a swimming pool which is thought to be the largest in Asia. Kim is believed to have spent time there while "on the run".<ref name="WWN">{{cite book|last=Meredith|first=Richard|title=Which way next?|publisher=Mercury Books|location=[Newport Pagnell?]|isbn=978-0954143237|edition=Revised|date=January 3, 2004}}</ref>

[[Daewoo Motor|Daewoo Motor Co., Ltd.]] was founded when the Daewoo Group purchased [[Saehan Motor]] in 1978, but the Daewoo Motor name did not appear until 1983.

The Daewoo Motor brand appeared in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1995. At the time, it was the only manufacturer not using traditional dealerships&nbsp;– it owned and operated its own retail network. It was once considered to be among the top 10 motor companies in terms of production.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012|reason=By who? Top 10 in UK or what?}}

Due to financial trouble, Daewoo was forced to sell off its automotive arm, Daewoo Motor, to [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] (GM) in 2001. Since then, GM has [[rebadge]]d Daewoo-manufactured cars as models of many GM brands, including [[Chevrolet]], [[Buick]], [[Pontiac]], [[Holden]], and [[Suzuki]]. The GM Daewoo nameplate was kept only for [[South Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] until 2011.{{Ambiguous|date=October 2012|reason=Ambiguous. GM in the US, GM Daewoo in Korea/Vietnam through 2011, and then just GM everywhere?}}

Daewoo Commercial Vehicles Division was sold to [[Tata Motors]] of India.

==History==
The Daewoo Group was founded by [[Kim Woo-jung]] in March 1967. He was the son of the Provincial Governor of [[Daegu]]. He graduated from the Kyonggi High School, then finished with an Economics Degree at [[Yonsei University]] in [[Seoul]].

During the 1960s, after the end of the [[Syngman Rhee]] government, the new government of [[Park Chung Hee]] intervened to promote growth and development in the country. It increased access to resources, promoted exports, financed industrialization, and provided protection from competition to the chaebol in exchange for a company's political support. In the beginning, the Korean government instigated a series of five-year plans under which the chaebol were required to achieve a number of basic objectives.

Daewoo did not become a major player until the second five-year plan. Daewoo benefited from government-sponsored cheap loans based on potential export profits. The company initially concentrated on labor-intensive clothing and textile industries that provided high profit margins because of South Korea's large and relatively inexpensive workforce.

The third and fourth of the five-year plans occurred from 1973 to 1981. During this period, the country's labor force was in high demand. Competition from other countries began eroding Korea's competitive edge. The government responded to this change by concentrating its efforts on mechanical and electrical engineering, shipbuilding, petrochemicals, construction, and military initiatives. At the end of this period, the government forced Daewoo into shipbuilding. Kim was reluctant to enter this industry, but Daewoo soon earned a reputation for producing competitively priced ships and oil rigs.

During the next decade, the Korean government became more liberal in its economic policies. Small private companies were encouraged, protectionist import restrictions were loosened, and the government reduced positive discrimination ([[affirmative action]]), to encourage free market trade and to force the chaebol to be more aggressive abroad. Daewoo responded by establishing a number of joint ventures with U.S. and European companies. It expanded exports of machine tools, defense products (under the S&T Daewoo company), aerospace interests, and semiconductor design and manufacturing. Eventually, it began to build civilian helicopters and airplanes, priced considerably cheaper than those produced by its U.S. counterparts. It also expanded efforts in the automotive industry and was ranked as the seventh largest car exporter and the sixth largest car manufacturer in the world. Throughout this period, Daewoo experienced great success at turning around faltering companies in Korea.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Daewoo Group also produced consumer electronics, computers, [[telecommunication]] products, construction equipment, buildings, and musical instruments ([[Daewoo Piano]]).

==Crisis and collapse==
Daewoo Group ran into deep financial trouble in 1998 due to the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], increasingly thin relationships with the Korean government under President [[Kim Dae Jung]], and its own poor financial management. With the Korean government in deficit, access to cheap and nearly unlimited credit was severely restricted.

In 1998, when the economic crisis forced most of the chaebol to cut back, Daewoo added 14 new firms to its existing 275 subsidiaries, in a year where the group lost a total of 550 billion won (US$458 million) on sales of 62 trillion won (US$51 billion). At the end of 1997, South Korea’s four biggest chaebol had a debt of nearly five times their equity. While [[Samsung]] and [[LG Corp|LG]] cut back in the midst of the economic crisis, Daewoo took on 40% more debt."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=233562 |title=South Korea: The death of Daewoo |publisher=The Economist |date= 19 August 1999|accessdate=2008-11-20}}</ref>

By 1999, Daewoo, the second largest conglomerate in South Korea with interests in about 100 countries, went bankrupt, with debts of about 80 trillion won (US$84.3 billion).

Soon after the demise, Chairman [[Kim Woo-jung|Kim Woo Jung]] fled to France, and former Daewoo factory workers put up [[Wanted posters|"Wanted" posters]] with his picture. Kim returned to Korea in June 2005 and was promptly arrested. He was charged with masterminding accounting fraud of 41 trillion won (US$43.4 billion), illegally borrowing 9.8 trillion won (US$10.3 billion), and smuggling US$3.2 billion out of the country, according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/BUSINESS/05/30/skorea.daewoo/index.html |title= Daewoo founder Kim gets 10-yr term  |date=30 May 2006 |accessdate=2008-11-20 | work=CNN |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080408091248/http://www.cnn.com/2006/BUSINESS/05/30/skorea.daewoo/index.html |archivedate = April 8, 2008}}</ref> On 30 May 2006, Kim was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted of fraud and embezzlement. On the last day of the trial, Kim tearfully addressed the court, "I cannot dodge my responsibility of wrongly buttoning up the final button of fate."<ref>{{cite news|last=Ramstad |first=Evan |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB114896838655866106-search.html?KEYWORDS=daewoo&COLLECTION=wsjie/6month |title=Daewoo Founder Gets Prison Term - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=31 May 2006 |accessdate=2008-11-20}}</ref>

===Factors that affected Daewoo's performance===
* Government intervention: Government policy served as a double edged sword: it protected the [[chaebol]], providing them with massive subsidies, unlimited cheap credit, and protection against foreign competition. However, the price for these services was total loyalty to the government. Chaebol were forced to take over industries against their will.
* Labor market: The traditional work ethic that helped Korea reach economic prosperity has been threatened as workers have begun increasingly violent protests against years of long hours and low pay. Daewoo Shipbuilding suffered heavy losses due to workers' demands for pay raises. 
* Operating in a global economy: International demand for free trade is forcing the Korean government to open its markets. The chaebol will lose its protectionist import controls. Most recently,{{When|date=July 2014}} the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and the [[European Economic Community]] imposed trade limitations.{{Why|date=October 2012|reason=If they have opened their markets, why sanctions?}}
* Product quality from Korea: Many Korean products were considered to be of low quality.
* By the 1990s, Daewoo Group was heavily leveraged, major markets were stagnant, expenditures on R&D were increasing, labor unrest was continuing, and government policy was turning against the company. 
* Kim was most recently charged with allegedly paying campaign contributions to former president [[Roh Tae Woo]] in exchange for a large government contract to build a submarine base.

===Analysis===
According to an article in ''[[The Economist]]'', dated 19 August 1999 (not long after Daewoo's bankruptcy), "Its failure was a long time coming."

The downfall of Daewoo was and still remains highly controversial because of the sheer importance of chaebols in the national economy. The collapse caused billions of dollars in losses for both South Korean banks and the government, who were forced to stage-manage{{ambiguous|date=October 2012}} Daewoo's dissolution to soften the blow. The bankruptcy was not only a financial crisis, but also a political one, and it came as a shock to much of the nation.

Michael Schuman of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' stated that while Daewoo's demise had significant consequences, it would have nonetheless been better than propping it up with fresh funds. There was a persistence of the belief that Daewoo and other Korean conglomerates were "too big to fail". Such belief led many bankers and investors to continually waste money on bailouts, despite the sign that Daewoo was unable to engineer a turnaround and repay these [[bad loan]]s. Once the too-big-to-fail perception was dispelled, with large conglomerates no longer considered the safest investments, bankers and investors began financing new opportunities in areas which had been starved of capital, such as small firms, entrepreneurs and consumers. Korea's GDP actually rose after Daewoo's unwinding.

Schuman also noted a similar analogy with [[Japan]] during its [[Lost Decade (Japan)|lost decade of the 1990s]], where banks kept injecting new funds into unprofitable "zombie firms", on the belief that the firms were too big to fail. However, most of these companies were too debt-ridden to do much more than survive on further bailouts, which led to an economist describing Japan as a "loser's paradise." Schuman states that Japan's economy did not begin to recover until this practice had ended.<ref name="schumantimes">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1867847,00.html|title= Why Detroit Is Not Too Big to Fail|last=Schuman|first=Michael|date=2008-12-19|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref>

==Breakup and present status==
The group was reorganized into three separate parts: ''[[Daewoo Electronics|Daewoo Corporation]]'', ''[[Daewoo Engineering & Construction]]'' and ''[[Daewoo International Corporation]]''. They are active in many markets, most significantly in steel processing, ship building and financial services. The corporate entity known as "Daewoo Corporation" is now known as "[[Daewoo Electronics]]" and is focused solely on manufacturing electronics.

Daewoo Electronics survives to this day, despite bankruptcy, with a new brand logo "DE", but many of the other subsidiaries and divisions have become independent or simply perished under the "reorganization" by the Korean government under Kim Dae Jung. In North America, [[Target Corporation|Target]] stores market Daewoo Electronics products under their "Trutech" brand on an [[Original Design Manufacturer|ODM]] basis.

In 2004, [[General Motors]] pulled the [[Daewoo Motors|Daewoo]] brand of vehicles out of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], citing irreparable brand damage. Later that same year, GM announced that Daewoo Motors in [[Europe]] would change its name to [[Chevrolet]] on 1 January 2005. In 2005, it was announced that Daewoo cars would have a [[Holden]] badge in Australia and New Zealand. In [[South Africa]], [[Thailand]], and the [[Middle East]], Daewoo models were already branded Chevrolet. In South Korea, Daewoo was renamed GM Korea.

As part of the company reorganization, the content and the structure of its brand portfolio (its brand architecture) was reorganized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://merriamassociates.com/2010/11/general-motors-a-reorganized-brand-architecture-for-a-reorganized-company/ |title=General Motors: A Reorganized Brand Architecture for a Reorganized Company |publisher=Merriamassociates.com |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref>  In 2011, GM discontinued the Daewoo brand name in South Korea and replaced it with the Chevrolet brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsworld.php?id=567096/ |title=GM Korea Says Goodbye To Daewoo, Hello To Chevrolet |publisher=bernama.com |date=2011-02-28 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref>

The Daewoo commercial vehicle manufacturer was taken over by [[Tata Motors]]&nbsp;– the world's 5th largest medium and heavy commercial vehicle manufacturer.

===Involvement in Burma===
Daewoo is also moving into the oil and gas industry. While Western oil and gas companies were unwilling to conduct business in [[Burma]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article157719.ece |title=Daewoo to tap Burma gas for China - Upstreamonline |publisher=Upstreamonline.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-20}}</ref> on account of the abysmal human rights record of the ruling military junta, Daewoo is one of three oil companies, along with the French company [[Total S.A.|Total]] and the American company [[Unocal]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nickyblack.com/Nicky_Black/Corporate_Citizenship_and_Myanmar_files/BM%20Chp%207%20-%20Myr%20O%26G%20industry.pdf |title=Blood Money - Chapter 7, Corporate Citizenship and the Oil and Gas Sector in Myanmar (Burma) |publisher=nickyblack.com}}</ref> which is already, or is close to, starting gas production in the country{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}(at the Yadana Field). During explorations, Daewoo found one of the largest gas fields in [[southeast Asia]]. The field is located at blocks A-1 and A-3 at the [[Shwe field]], about 100&nbsp;km off [[Sittwe]] in [[Rakhine State]]. The field will go into production in five years,{{When|date=October 2012}} providing a lucrative (and probably the largest) source of hard currency for the ruling junta. Daewoo has long been one of the largest foreign investors in the country.  Daewoo International was investigated by South Korean prosecutors for allegedly selling machinery with potential military applications to the junta.{{Dubious|date=September 2008}}<!--Burma strikes Gold, Upstream 28 August 2008 -- What is this?

===The Daewoo brand today===
Today six companies with the Daewoo brand name remain:

* [[Daewoo Electronics]] (DE) - Specializing in electronics
* [[Daewoo Engineering & Construction]] - Specializing in construction
* [[Daewoo International]] - Specializing in trading and investment
* [[Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering]] (DSME) - Specializing in shipbuilding
* [[S&T Motiv|S&T Daewoo]] - Specializing in small arms manufacture
* [[Tata Daewoo]] - Specializing in commercial vehicles, wholly owned by Tata

The '''Honda Integra''' (sold in some markets as '''Acura Integra''') was a sports car, produced by Japanese automobile manufacturer [[Honda]] from 1985 to 2006. It succeeded the [[Honda Quint]] as the slightly larger derivative of the [[Honda Civic|Civic]] and each generation of the Integra was derived from the contemporary generation of the Civic. Being more luxurious and sports-oriented than the Quint, the Integra was one of the launch models for [[Acura]] in 1986,<ref>http://owners.acura.com/community/featured-stories/3</ref> along with the [[Acura Legend|Legend]]. Throughout its life, the Integra was highly regarded for its handling and performance.

The Integra name was originally used by Honda to refer to its [[Honda VT250F|VT250F]] motorcycle and is currently used to refer to the [[Honda Integra (scooter)|scooter variant]] of its NC700 series of motorcycles.<ref>{{cite web|last=Siler|first=Wes|title=The Honda Integra is back... as a scooter?!|url=http://jalopnik.com/5857931/the-honda-integra-is-back-as-a-scooter|publisher=Jalopnik|accessdate=17 May 2012}}</ref>

''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine named the Integra to its annual [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best]] list six times: in 1987, 1988, and 1994 through 1997. The [[Acura Integra GS-R|GS-R]] model was called out specifically in 1994 and 1995. It made a return on the Ten Best list as the [[Honda Integra DC5|Acura RSX]], in 2002 and 2003. The Integra Type-R (DC2) was named the "best front-wheel-drive drivers car ever" by ''[[Evo Magazine]]'' in 2006.

This vehicle debuted in Japan in 1985 as the [[Honda Quint]] Integra, available only at Honda's Japanese dealership sales channel ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]'' before going on sale a year later in North America as part of the then-new luxury [[Acura]] lineup. Three and five-door hatchback and four-door saloon bodies were available (only the hatchback versions were sold in the U.S.), with a 1.6&nbsp;L [[DOHC]] 16-valve [[inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] [[Internal-combustion engine|engine]] powering both. The engine was the vehicle's most publicized feature, as DOHC, multi-valve engines were not commonplace in entry-level models at the time. In most European countries, only the five-door liftback was offered, as a replacement for the unsuccessful [[Honda Quint]]. Typically for European Integras, only the 1.5-liter carburetor engine was available. The five-door liftback model was also sold in Australia rebadged as the '''Rover 416i'''. Except for Britain, Honda did not offer the more powerful 1.6 DOHC fuel injection engine (in the UK known as the Integra EX16) in Europe. The ZC engine was also shared with the [[Honda Concerto]], which was sold at newly established Japanese dealership sales channel called ''Honda Clio'', which sold luxury oriented products like the [[Honda Legend]].

Vehicles with PGM-FI earned {{convert|14.4|km/L|abbr=on}} in Japanese Government emissions tests with {{convert|135|PS|kW bhp|1|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|24.5|km/L|abbr=on}} above {{convert|60|km/h|mi/h|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>Japanese sales brochure for the Integra</ref>

Compared to the US, the European Integra was aimed downmarket and generally lacked equipment, with no trim levels (LX and EX) offering painted bumpers, central locking, power windows or air conditioning, even though a small number of fully equipped, left-hand drive fuel-injected Integras were sold in the Netherlands. The Integra EX16 did offer a sunroof, painted bumpers, a rear spoiler and Hi-Fi stereo equipment, but neither electric windows, central locking nor air conditioning were available. This was considered as a drawback to its European competitors such as the Peugeot 309 1.6 injection and the Renault 11 Turbo, that all could be equipped with comprehensive, albeit expensive, equipment. The first Integra never became as popular in Europe as it did in the US, but was praised by most motor magazines for its styling and overall road performance. The styling reflected the popularity of Honda's performance coupe, the ''Honda Verno'' sports coupe companion [[Honda Prelude#Second generation (1983–1987)|Honda Prelude]], with the Integra offering a coupe for added cargo accommodation, and a slightly smaller appearance to the larger [[Honda Vigor#Second generation (CA1-CA2-CA3)|Honda Vigor]].

Being designed as the successor of the Honda Quint, the Integra is closely related to the [[Honda Civic|Civic]], although it featured a small list of key upgrades over its smaller stablemate to help merit a price increase over the [[Honda CRX|CRX Si]], which was otherwise the sportiest [[subcompact]] vehicle being offered by ''Honda Verno''; enlarged 4-wheel disc brakes replaced the small front-disc/rear-drum setup used by the Civic and CRX, suspension calibration was re-worked, better tires were used and a 113-[[horsepower|hp]] DOHC [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] 16-valve engine was used in place of the SOHC unit from the CRX Si. Just like the Prelude and the Vigor of that period, the Integra featured sleek, sporty pop-up headlights, like its Japanese dealership ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]'' stablemates, with the CRX adopting semi-concealed doors over the headlights. Nearly 228,000 units were sold during the four-year run of the first-generation model, most of them in the United States.

The first generation Acura Integras actually came with two different engines. Although they shared the same engine code ([[Honda D engine#D16A1|D16A1]]), there were a few differences. The engine differed in the years 1986 to 1987 and 1988 to 1989. The two engines are commonly called the "Browntop" and "Blacktop" due to the color of their valve covers. The "browntop" came in 1986 and 1987 Integras while the "blacktop" came in 1988 and 1989 models. The improvements in the "blacktop" engine included lighter rods, domed pistons for slightly higher compression, and an [[Ignition timing#Electronic Ignition Systems|electric advance]] distributor (the "browntop" came with a [[Ignition timing#Vacuum timing advance|vacuum advance]] distributor). The overall gain in performance was about {{Convert|5|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} for {{Convert|118|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}}.

The 1988 and 1989 Integras also got a minor facelift, featuring slightly reshaped indicator lights, an improved climate control system and an update of the instrument clocks. In Europe, the discontinued Integra five-door Liftback was replaced by the [[Honda Concerto]] for the 1990 model year.

This was the only generation to offer 3-, 4-, and 5-door models.  Production of the 5-door hatchback ceased in 1988.<ref>http://www.honda.co.jp/auto-archive/integra/4-5door/</ref>

The second generation Integra was introduced in 1989 and in this generation, one of the first [[VTEC]] engine ever manufactured by Honda was installed in a [[Japanese Domestic Market|JDM]] Integra DA series. The B16A engine is a 1.6-litre naturally aspirated engine with a specific power output of 160 PS (118 kW; 158 hp). VTEC engagement is at 4800 rpm on the B16A engine, redline for the XSi is 8200 rpm. All Japanese models remained exclusive to Honda Japanese dealership network called ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]''.

There were two variants of the top DOHC VTEC model, the RSi, and the XSi. The RSi was the base model without any options, while XSi was the fully optioned variant with climate control and optional sunroof and ABS. The XSi had a 0–100&nbsp;km time of 7.2 seconds and completed a standing quarter mile in 15.1 seconds. This top spec DOHC VTEC model was complemented by more docile models that used dual-carburator or PGM-Fi versions of the versatile ZC engine but in the more compact SOHC configuration. Similarly there were base and full options variants of these SOHC engine Integras coded RX/RXi and ZX/ZXi respectively. All vehicles sold in Japan had their width dimensions slightly reduced so as to be in compliance with Japanese [[Vehicle size class#Japan|government regulations]] concerning exterior dimensions so that the car would be officially recognized as a "compact" and not incur yearly taxes for being wider.

According to Hondatuningmagazine.com Less than 5,000 units produced for both the U.S. and Canada, the 1992-93 Integra GS-R is considered by Honda enthusiasts to be a true classic. It was a standout amongst the influx of hot hatches and sport compacts that seemed to assault the U.S. market in 90s. In 1992-93 the Integra received minor cosmetic changes and updates. In the US a GS-R(DB2) model was added to the line up. It received a DOHC VTEC B17A1 engine with a slightly longer stroke then the B16A.  The B16A engine received new intake manifold and cams and raised the VTEC engagement point (now 5500 rpm). The B17A1 engine found in the '92-93 GS-R model featured a 1.7L, DOHC VTEC powerplant that produced 160hp/117lbs-ft tq with an 8,000rpm redline and a VTEC crossover point of 5,500rpm. A rather conservative 9.7:1 compression ratio was employed and is typically increased by enthusiasts interested in harnessing more naturally aspirated power.<ref>http://www.hondatuningmagazine.com/editorial/1309_1992_acura_integra_gsr/</ref>
[[File:1990 Acura Integra GS front.jpg|thumb|left|1990 Acura Integra GS sedan]]

This generation saw the discontinuation of the 5-door hatchback, and the first availability of the 4-door sedan, outside Japan. The new hardtop bodystyle reflected a popular trend in Japan of offering an entry level sedan, such as the Civic-based platform the Integra used, in a reduced height four-door hardtop. The Integra sedan saw competition from the similarly sized [[Toyota Corolla Ceres]], the [[Toyota Sprinter Marino]], the [[Nissan Presea]], and the [[Mazda Lantis]].  It should be noted that the sedan was only ''styled'' to look like a [[Hardtop#Pillarless_hardtops|hardtop]].  The vehicle retained the B-pillar, while the doors were constructed without window frames.  This styling carried over to the third generation sedan, and shared visual similarities to the ''Honda Verno'' larger companion, the [[Honda Vigor]].

Honda debuted the third generation model in 1993 in Japan at ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]'' locations.  Acura followed in 1994.  It had an unusual four headlight front end design which was dubbed "bug eyes" by some enthusiasts.  Standard power (in Japan) from the B18B engine increased to {{Convert|142|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}}. In the U.S., the B18B1 produced slightly less power due to a lower compression ratio (emissions related).The top model was known in Japan as "Si", and it was powered by a B18C engine with a power of {{Convert|178|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} vtec . The bug eye headlights proved unpopular so the Integra was revised in 1996 with only minor cosmetic updates including elongated flat headlights and an optional bodykit, the top model was relabeled the Integra SiR.

Dealer installed options for the third generation Integra included: security system, alloy wheels, trunk mat, splash guards, fog lights, and CD changer.

USDM trim levels were as follows:

'''RS''': Regular Sport. Available in both coupe and sedan. No sedan available in 1998. Model dropped in 1999. Equipped with the B18B1 DOHC engine putting out 140 HP and 127 ft-lbs. of torque. In 1997, power ratings dropped to 138HP and 124 ft-lbs. of torque due to U.S.  emissions regulations. Standard features were a cassette player, rear window defroster, and tilt steering wheel. Cassette player replaced with CD player in 1997.<ref>http://www.team-integra.net/forum/blogs/surferx/18-history-acura-integra.html</ref>

'''LS''': Luxury Sport. Available in both coupe and sedan. From the RS, the LS adds air conditioning, power windows and door locks, cruise control, and a moonroof. In 1998, the LS became equipped with alloy wheels and in 2000 was given a leather wrapped steering wheel and shift knob.<ref>http://www.team-integra.net/forum/blogs/surferx/18-history-acura-integra.html</ref>

'''SE''':  Special Edition. Available in both coupe and sedan starting from 1995. SE's are only found in 1995 and 1996 model years until they were changed to be named the GS in 1997. From the LS, it added leather seats, alloy wheels on all years, and a rear wing spoiler.<ref>http://www.team-integra.net/forum/blogs/surferx/18-history-acura-integra.html</ref>

'''GS''': Grand Sport. Available in both coupe and sedan starting from 1997. Same standard features as the SE.<ref>http://www.team-integra.net/forum/blogs/surferx/18-history-acura-integra.html</ref>

'''GS-R''': Grand Sport Racing. Available in both coupe and sedan. Equipped with the B18C1 DOHC VTEC engine outputting 170HP and 128 ft-lbs. of torque. Same standard features as the GS minus the leather seats. However, leather seats ended up becoming a standard feature on the GS-R starting in 1999. No auto transmission available for this car.<ref>http://www.team-integra.net/forum/blogs/surferx/18-history-acura-integra.html</ref>

===DC2 Type R===
[[File:Honda Integra 1996 3door.jpg|thumb|left|1996 Honda Integra (Japan)]]
In 1995 Honda introduced the Integra Type R to the Japanese domestic market. The JDM Type R had the minor change long headlights that remained only for the JDM models while the world market version had the pre-facelift double round lights.

The DC2 Type R came standard with a 200 PS (figure may vary in different countries, 195&nbsp;hp USDM, 190&nbsp;hp in Europe) factory-tuned variant of the [[Honda_B_engine#B18|B18C]] engine. Equipped with a close ratio 5-speed manual transmission and a Helical LSD, the DC2 Integra Type R had significantly improved performance and handling relative to the GS-R/Si/SiR-G Integra.

These were the result of extensive changes, including a strengthened chassis with extra spot welds and thicker metal around the rear shock towers and lower subframe, weight reduction (reduced sound insulation, 10% thinner windscreen, lighter wheels), more power, rev limiter set at 8500 RPM USDM (8600 RPM JDM, 8700 RPM UKDM), hand built engine featuring hand-polished and ported intake ports, high compression pistons, undercut valves and revised intake and exhaust systems, and suspension upgrades. The result was a capable sports coupe which was acclaimed by motoring journalists worldwide. Interestingly, there is only 33&nbsp;lbs of net weight difference between the Integra Type R and the Integra GS-R, because the extra metal and cross bracing in the Type R almost negated most of the 98&nbsp;lbs. of weight reductions. Although the JDM version was significantly lighter than the SiR (JDM ITR 96 - 97 delete could include: air bags, A/C, rear wiper, radio, center console, clock, P/S and ABS). The DC2 Type R was the only Type R ever sold in North America (With the Acura badge). For the European, Australian and New Zealand market the DC2 was sold as a Honda.

* Edmund's Insideline tested a 12-year-old stock Type-R: 0-60 in 6.8 seconds, 1/4 mile in 14.9 seconds @ 95.2.
* MotorTrend clocked the Type R at: 0-60 in 6.2 seconds, 1/4 mile in 14.8 @ 96.3.
* Sports Compact Car clocked the Type R at: 0-60 in 6.1 seconds, 1/4 mile in 14.5 @ 96 MPH
All American test cars had the optional A/C installed.

The JDM DC2 received significant upgrades in 1998 and is known as the '98 Spec R. Some of the main changes were a redesigned rear bumper, 16-inch wheel with 215/45R16 tires, 5-lug nut wheel hubs and bigger brakes. Gear ratios for the final drive were higher, making 1st to 3rd gears closer, while 4th and 5th were longer to maintain the '96 Spec cruising comfort. The engine power remained the same, but use of a new 4-1 long tube header brought torque lower down to 6200 rpm.

An interesting and little-publicized fact about the 1995–2001 DC2 Type R is that Honda lost money on every single vehicle sold, even though extra dealer markups sometimes made for excessive dealer profit. Honda produced the DC2 Type R for homologation purposes to meet FIA certification of the motor and the chassis changes to make the car more competitive in N-series and World Cup racing. The details required, hand tooling in early versions and finishing the product through the use of various small fabrication shops in Japan made for increased costs in manufacture that could not be made up in the list price of the vehicles. Honda (and Acura in the US) deemed the car important for the marque's image and important for the racing programmes of the era, and the parent company therefore accepted a financial net loss on each vehicle sold.

It has been acclaimed by motoring journalists world-wide, including Evo magazine, who named the Type R 'the greatest front-wheel-drive performance car ever.' and TheAutoChannel.com who also named it 'the best handling front-wheel drive car ever.'

===Four-wheel Drive Integra (DB9)===

The third generation also saw the production of an all-wheel drive option.  Available only in the four-door sedan, the ZXi4WD<ref>http://www.honda.co.jp/auto-archive/integra/4-5door/1995/4d4wd_sy.html</ref> (93-95) and Xi4WD<ref>http://www.honda.co.jp/auto-archive/integra/4-5door/2000/grade_data/index.html</ref> (95-00) had 1.6L SOHC ZC engines coupled to a version of Honda's Real Time AWD.[]

===Integra SJ (EK3)===
The ''{{lang-ja|[[:ja:?????????SJ|Integra SJ]]}}'' (standing for  "[[Sedan (car)|Sedan]] Joyful") was a rebadged [[Honda Civic Ferio|Civic Ferio]], (a ''Honda Primo'' product) with modified headlamps and grille similar to the [[Honda Orthia|Orthia]]'s and slightly larger rear lights. The Integra SJ was sold in Japan at ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]'' dealerships. It originated from the [[Honda Domani]] another derivitave of this vehicle sold at ''Honda Clio'' locations. It was made from 1996 to 2001, and used the 1493 cc D15B engine. Honda's press material of the time indicated that the SJ was intended to provide a "formal sedan" for the Integra range; another reason may have been to sell Ferios using a more sporting model name at ''Honda Verno'' dealerships in Japan, as was the case with the [[Nissan Sunny#B11 series|Nissan Laurel Spirit]].
In Thailand, the Integra SJ was sold as the [[Isuzu Vertex]], last passenger car ever for that market. (This followed Isuzu's practice of selling Honda models as Isuzus which started with the [[Isuzu Gemini|Gemini]]; while Honda also selling Isuzu's sport utility vehicles in Japan and North America, and pickup truck in Thailand.)

[[File:Honda_Integra_Type_R_(2).jpg|thumb|left|2001-04 Honda Integra DC5 Type-R]]
The fourth generation Integra was introduced in Japan on April 13, 2001 and produced from July 2001 to July 2006. For North America (United States and Canada), it was introduced as the [[Acura RSX]] in accordance with Acura's new alphabetical naming scheme. It also had an entirely new engine, the [[Honda K engine|K-series]]. The Integra came in two models in the United States, the RSX base model, and the RSX-S boasting the K20A2 engine from 2002 to 2004, while the 2005 and 2006 RSX-S came with a K20Z1. The RSX was still sold as a Honda Integra in Japan and [[Australia]], markets where [[Acura]] did not exist. 

In March 2006, Honda announced that the Integra would be discontinued in June after its final 300 cars were sold, due to the shrinkage of the coupe market. The reaction of the consumers towards the discontinuation, however, forced Honda to extend production until July 2006 and produce 150 more Integras. The Acura RSX was discontinued as well, as the RSX did not fit within the confines of Acura's re-structured market strategy.  This left the Acura TSX as Acura's entry-level vehicle.  Also, the introduction of the similarly powerful and less expensive 2006 model-year [[Honda Civic Si]] was there to fill in the gap left by the RSX.

The DC5 Type R (Japanese market only) comes standard with a K20A 220&nbsp;hp (164&nbsp;kW) 2.0 L DOHC i-VTEC four-cylinder engine. The "i" in i-VTEC stands for intelligent VTEC, which employs VTC (Variable Timing Control) to advance or retard the cam timing within a 50 degree range. The Integra Type R comes equipped with Recaro seats, four-piston Brembo front brakes, a close ratio six-speed manual transmission, a limited-slip differential, and a stiffer suspension.{{-}}

==Motorsport==
The Integra and RSX have been popular in automobile racing. The [[SCCA World Challenge]] has used the Integra/RSX for many years in its GT groups. Several cars were entered into the [[2009 British Touring Car Championship season]], and won the 2003 [[Asian Touring Car Series]].

[[File:EmbarcadorcalaDeià.JPG|thumb|Deià Cove]]
'''Deià''' is a small coastal village in the [[Serra de Tramuntana]], which forms the northern ridge of the [[Spain|Spanish]] island of [[Mallorca]]. It is located about ten miles north of [[Valldemossa]], and it is known for its literary and musical residents.  Its idyllic landscape, orange and olive groves on steep cliffs overlooking the [[Mediterranean]], served as a draw for German, English, and American expatriates after the [[World War I|First World War]].

The English poet, novelist, and scholar, [[Robert Graves]], was one of the first foreigners to settle in the village, where he collaborated with [[Laura Riding]] in setting up the [[Seizin Press]]. Graves returned after the war and remained in Deià until his death.  He used the town as the setting for many of his stories, including the historical novel ''Hercules my Shipmate''. His house is now a museum.<ref>[http://www.lacasaderobertgraves.com]</ref>

[[Anaïs Nin]] visited the village in the 1920s, and she wrote a short story set on the village's beach.  The Spanish writer, [[Carme Riera]], recently wrote a short story about Nin's. The town is also the unnamed setting of the Uruguayan novelist, [[Cristina Peri Rossi]]'s ''The Ship of Fools'' (''La nave de los locos''). The Nicaraguan poet and novelist, [[Claribel Alegría]], lives in Deià today. Anja Rubik married Serbian model Sasah Knezevic in this village. They married on 16 July 2011.

In recent decades, the stars of literature have been eclipsed by the stars of rock and roll.

G. Wodehouse]], being best known as [[Bertie Wooster]]'s bonhomous, red-faced '''Aunt Dahlia'''. She is much beloved by her nephew, in contrast with her sister, Bertie's [[Aunt Agatha]]. Proprietor of the weekly newspaper for women '''''Milady's Boudoir<!--BOLD BECAUSE REDIRECTS HERE-->''''', she is married to [[List of Jeeves characters#Tom Travers|Tom Travers]], mother of [[Angela Travers]] and [[Bonzo Travers]], and employs the supremely gifted [[France|French]] chef Anatole.
[[File:PGWodehouse.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of PG Wodehouse.|P.G. Wodehouse]]

==Overview==
Dahlia and Tom Travers make their residence at [[Brinkley Court]] outside [[Market Snodsbury]] in [[Worcestershire]]. They were married "the year Bluebottle won the [[Cambridgeshire Handicap|Cambridgeshire]]". Dahlia is Tom's second wife.<ref>Wodehouse 1934, ''[[Right Ho, Jeeves]]'', chapter 4. Bertie states that Dahlia "married old Tom Travers en secondes noces"</ref>

Aunt Dahlia is "built rather on the lines of [[Mae West]]", but with a reddish-purple complexion. Her most notable personal characteristic is her carrying voice. Riding in her youth for years with such [[fox hunt|fox-hunting]] clubs as the [[Quorn Hunt|Quorn]] and the [[Pytchley Hunt|Pytchley]], she tends to address Bertie, over the phone or indoors, as if "shouting across ploughed fields in a high wind."<ref>Wodehouse 1954, ''[[Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit]].'' See also descriptions of Aunt Dahlia in Wodehouse 1938, ''[[Code of the Woosters|The Code of the Woosters]]''.</ref>

She is also a Governor of Market Snodsbury Grammar School, for which she has the formidable task to find speakers for prize-giving day. When called, Bertie would rather shove it off on to his friend [[Gussie Fink-Nottle]] (and not "Spink-Bottle", as Dahlia insists on calling him).

Dahlia employs the French chef extraordinaire Anatole since stealing him from [[Rosie M. Banks]] (Mrs [[Bingo Little]]) with the help of Jeeves. Just the thought of his cooking is usually enough to make Bertie answer Dahlia's call to Brinkley Court, except when some prize-giving is involved.

Despite Tom and Bertie's dislike of Agatha, Dahlia does not mind her sister and even goes so far as to invite her to Brinkley Court, over Tom's objections.

==Aunt Dahlia and Bertie Wooster==
Unlike Aunt Agatha, the "aged relative" seems to enjoy Bertie's company and occasionally shows him an aunt's love, even if she does call him a "young blot", "an idiot nephew", "a worm", etc. Indeed, Dahlia's famous telegram conversations with Bertie can display some rough love; for instance, after Bertie dumped his prize-giving duty on an unsuspecting Fink-Nottle, she sent:

<blockquote>
« Am taking legal advice to ascertain whether strangling an idiot nephew counts as murder. If it doesn't look out for yourself. Consider your conduct frozen limit. What do you mean by planting your loathsome friends on me like this? Do you think Brinkley Court is a leper colony or what is it? Who is this Spink-Bottle? Love. Travers. » (in ''[[Right Ho, Jeeves]]'', chapter six)
</blockquote>

And a few telegrams later, she sent:

<blockquote>
« Well, all right. Something in what you say, I suppose. Consider you treacherous worm and contemptible, spineless cowardly custard, but have booked Spink-Bottle. Stay where you are, then, and I hope you get run over by an omnibus. Love. Travers. » (in ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter six)
</blockquote>

Sometimes, Bertie suspects, Dahlia seems to value him more for his association with the exceptionally clever [[Jeeves]] than for his own qualities. Her chief use for Bertie, however, is to commit minor burglaries or acts of calculated vandalism, which often misfire and require Jeeves to extract them both from the soup.

==''Milady's Boudoir''==
'''''Milady's Boudoir<!--BOLD BECAUSE REDIRECTS HERE-->''''' is a fictional weekly newspaper for women, of which Aunt Dahlia is the proprietor. It is probably based on ''[[The Lady (magazine)|The Lady]]''<ref>

''Milady's Boudoir'' (and not "''Madame's Nightshirt''", as Tom Travers insists on calling it) never sold well and only stayed in business because of the reluctant largesse of Dahlia's husband. It lasted for three (according to Bertie)<ref>Wodehouse 1954, ''[[Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit]]'', chapter V. Bertie explains Dahlia has had her journal for three years.</ref> or four (according to Dahlia and Bertie)<ref>Wodehouse 1960, ''[[Jeeves in the Offing]]'', chapter XVII: from Dahlia ("For four years I was, if you remember, the proprietor and editress of a weekly paper for women.") and Bertie ("It had recently been sold to a mug up Liverpool way, and I have never seen Uncle Tom look chirpier than when the deal went through, he for those four years having had to foot the bills.").</ref> years before being sold to [[Mr Trotter]].

; Backstory

* In ''[[Right Ho, Jeeves]]'' (1934), Dahlia lost at [[baccarat]] the money to pay the printers and had Bertie and Jeeves help her squeeze it out of her tax-burdened husband.  When reminded of the episode in Cannes Bertie remarks "ah yes, the casino wanted to put up a plaque".
* In ''[[Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit]]'' (1954), Dahlia commissioned a high-priced serial from bestselling novelist [[Daphne Dolores Morehead]] in order to give instant credibility to her journal and make it an easier sell, or "[[Confidence trick#Salt the mine|salt the mine]]" as she put it; after being repeatedly foiled, and an attempted blackmail to make her surrender Anatole to the scheming [[Mrs Trotter]], she eventually sold it off with Jeeves's help to newspaper owner [[Mr Trotter]].
* In ''[[Jeeves in the Offing]]'' (1960), chapter XVII, the paper "had recently been sold to a mug up Liverpool way", and Dahlia underlined how most issues featured a short story where "the hero won the heroine's heart by saving her dog or her cat or her canary or whatever foul animal she happened to possess."
* In "[[Jeeves Makes an Omelette]]" (1958, written later but necessarily happening before the sale) Dahlia asked Bertie to steal a painting to get a story for her magazine.
* In "[[Jeeves and the Greasy Bird]]" (1965, written later but necessarily happening before the sale), a man too timid to talk to his love is writing articles about girls for the paper.

; Contributors include

* [[Bertie Wooster]] once contributed an article, titled "What the Well-Dressed Man is Wearing". (Written in "[[Clustering Round Young Bingo]]", 1925, proudly mentioned in some later stories.)
* [[Rosie M. Banks]] (Mrs [[Bingo Little]]) once submitted an article, "How I Keep the Love of my Husband-Baby". Fortunately for her husband, it hasn't been published. And after Dahlia poached Rosie's chef Anatole, Rosie is unlikely to further write for Mrs Travers. (In "[[Clustering Round Young Bingo]]", 1925.)
* [[Daphne Dolores Morehead]], the famous novelist, was once commissioned a serial; it wasn't published but announced in the journal in order to make it more saleable. (In ''[[Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit]]'', 1954.)
* Blair Eggleston has written a series of articles on the Modern Girl, though he is too timid around them. (In "[[Jeeves and the Greasy Bird]]", 1965.)

==Background==
{{main|Military history of Canada during the Second World War}}
Canada declared war against [[Nazi Germany]] on September 10, 1939 and sent one division to Europe, which had no chance for combat before [[France]] was [[Battle of France|overrun by Germany]]. In 1940, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] pledged to limit Canada's direct military involvement in the war. Many Canadians supported Mackenzie King's pledge, even as it became obvious the war would not be quickly resolved.

As in the First World War, young French-Canadians joined the few traditional French-speaking regiments of the Canadian army, such as the Regular-Army [[Royal 22e Régiment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> Régiment]], and several Militia regiments that were mobilized. In the Infantry, barracks life and most training was in French and only the command and radio language was in English.

In the rest of the military, however, similar French-speaking units were not created. Among the justifications for this policy were the predominance of the radio, and the fact that the technical instruction was only available in English. The [[12th Armoured Regiment (Three Rivers Regiment)]], originally mobilized by the francophone militia unit the Three Rivers Regiment (Tank), was reorganized and fought as an English-speaking unit. Many French-speaking soldiers were sidetracked in this process. One of the most famous was [[Jean-Victor Allard]] who demanded a transfer from the Three Rivers Regiment to the Infantry; he went on to become a brigade commander in Northwest Europe and then in Korea, command a British Division in NATO and subsequently become Chief of the Defence Staff of the Canadian Armed Forces (where he took pleasure in creating the first French-speaking brigade).<ref>See "Mémoires du Général Jean V. Allard" 1985 ISBN 2-89074-190-7</ref>

While units such as the [[Royal 22e Régiment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> Régiment]], [[Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal]], the [[Le Régiment de la Chaudière|Régiment de la Chaudière]] and the [[Régiment de Maisonneuve]] all had outstanding records during World War II, some feel that if they had been concentrated into the same brigade (as French-Canadians requested and as currently exists in the Canadian Armed Forces), it could have become a focus of pride for French-Canada, encouraging the war effort and political support in Quebec. These units were, however, distributed among the various English-speaking divisions of the Canadian Army overseas. [[Jack Granatstein]] in his book ''The Generals'' (1995 - ISBN 0-7737-2730-2), suggests that a shortage of French-speaking staff trained officers meant that any attempt to create an entire Francophone brigade would have likely ended in failure. However, the brigade could well have used English-speaking staff at the Brigade HQ; it would have been no different from the situation whereby these French-speaking units had to deal with English higher HQs in their various dispersed divisions.

Acceptance of French-speaking units was greater in Canada from the start of the Second World War in comparison to the first. While the creation of the [[Royal 22e Régiment|22nd Infantry Battalion (French-Canadian)]] required large rallies of French-Canadians in 1914 accompanied by political pressure to overcome Minister [[Sam Hughes]]' abhorrence of the idea, this greater acceptance of French-Canadian units as well as informal use of their language diminished the ferocity of Quebec's resistance to the war effort.

In June 1940, the government adopted conscription for home service in ''[[National Resources Mobilization Act|The National Resources Mobilization Act, 1940]]'' (NRMA), which allowed the government to register men and women and move them into jobs considered necessary for wartime production, but did not allow them to be conscripted for overseas service.

By the late summer of 1944, the numbers of new recruits were insufficient to replace war casualties in Europe, particularly among the [[infantry]].

==The Plebiscite of 1942==
[[Image:KingPlebicite.jpg|thumb|William Mackenzie King voting in the plebiscite on the introduction of conscription for overseas military service]]

{{See also|Referendums in Canada#Plebiscite on conscription|l1=Referendums in Canada: Plebiscite on conscription}}

By 1941 there were enough volunteers for five overseas divisions. Meanwhile the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]] were pressuring King to advise that the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] introduce conscription. In April 1942 a [[plebiscite]] was held, which asked the population not to support immediate conscription, but rather to allow the government to take back its promise made during the [[Canadian federal election, 1940|1940 election]]. King's famous remark on the issue, "not necessarily conscription but conscription if necessary," reflected the ambiguous nature of the plebiscite. Unsurprisingly, the plebiscite was supported by most English Canadians as well as the banned [[Communist Party of Canada]] which established [[Dominion Communist-Labor Total War Committee|Tim Buck "Yes" Committees]] to campaign for a yes vote. Across Canada, 63% of voters were in favour of conscription with English Canadians voting 83% in favour. The proposal received hardly any support from French Canadians, especially in [[Quebec]], where anti-conscription groups (including one led by [[Henri Bourassa]], the most vocal opponent of conscription in 1917) convinced 72.9% of voters to oppose the plebiscite.<ref>[http://fc.lbpsb.qc.ca/~history/m7u1l3.htm Topic 3: The Conscription Crisis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The government then passed Bill 80, repealing the sections of the NRMA that did not allow for overseas conscription. However, many Canadians still did not support immediate conscription; there were a few riots in [[Montreal]], although these were not on the same scale as the 1917 and 1918 riots. Even in [[Toronto]], a strongly pro-conscription region, Conservative [[Arthur Meighen]] was defeated in a [[by-election]] after promising to help introduce conscription.

Following the plebiscite, Public Works minister [[Pierre Joseph Arthur Cardin]] quit the King cabinet to protest his plan to introduce conscription. A number of other Quebec Liberal MPs also left the party in 1942 over the conscription issue, many of whom joined the [[Bloc populaire canadien]] when it was formed in the fall of 1942 to campaign against the government.

==Introduction of conscription==

After the campaigns in [[Italy]] in 1943 and the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]] in 1944, combined with a lack of volunteers, Canada faced a shortage of troops. A brigade from one of the three "home defence" divisions in Canada was sent to the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] in 1943 (the islands were technically North American soil and thus deployment there was not considered "overseas"). These divisions were made up largely of conscripts, other than officers and NCOs, and desertions before embarkation were noted. However, no further combat employment was made until early 1945, when 12,908 men were sent overseas, most of whom were from the home service conscripts drafted under the NRMA, rather than from the general population.
[[File:News. V.E. Day BAnQ P48S1P12270.jpg|thumb|[[:en:Montreal Star|Montreal Daily Star]] announce the end of World War II. May 7, 1945]]

The French-Canadian ministers in [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]], and Quebec in general, did not trust Defence Minister [[James Ralston]], and King felt it was politically sensible to replace him as Minister of National Defence with the anti-conscription General [[Andrew McNaughton]] in November 1944.<ref name=Campbell>Campbell, John Robinson (1984). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/12/ James Layton Ralston and manpower for the Canadian army]'' (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University</ref> McNaughton was unable to produce large numbers of volunteers for the army, although there were numerous volunteers for the navy and air force. Some members of King's cabinet threatened to resign and bring down the government. King finally agreed to a one-time levy of 17,000 NRMA conscripts for overseas service in November 1944. When word of the decision reached soldiers stationed in [[Terrace, British Columbia]], it resulted in the short-lived [[Terrace Mutiny]].

Few conscripts saw combat in Europe: only 2463 men reached units on the front lines. Out of these, 79 lost their lives. Politically, this was a successful gamble for King, as he avoided a drawn-out political crisis and remained in power until his retirement in 1948.

The NRMA men who refused to "go active" were derisively called "[[zombie]]s" both in Canada and overseas; [[Farley Mowat]] recalls in his volumes of war memoirs savagely disliking those who wore the uniform but refused to make the same sacrifices he and his brother in arms were called on to make in [[Italy]] and North-West Europe.

The [[suffix]] '''''-onym''''', in [[English language|English]] and other languages, means "word, name," and [[word]]s ending in ''-onym'' refer to a specified kind of name or word, most of which are [[classical compound]]s. For example, an [[acronym]] is a word formed from the initial letter or letters of each of the successive parts or major parts of a compound term (as [[radar]]). The use of ''-onym'' words provides a means of classifying, often to a fine degree of resolution, sets of nouns with common attributes.

In some words, the ''-onym'' form has been modified by replacing (or dropping) the "o". In the examples ''[[ananym]]'' and ''[[metanym]]'', the correct forms (''[[anonym]]'' and ''[[metonym]]'') were pre-occupied by other meanings. Other, late 20th century examples, such as ''[[hypernym]]'' and ''[[characternym]]'', are typically incorrectly formed [[neologism]]s for which there are more traditional words formed in ''-onym'' (''[[hyperonym]]'' and ''[[charactonym]]'').

The English suffix ''-onym'' is from the [[Ancient Greek]] suffix {{lang|grc|-??????}} (''?nymon''), neuter of the suffix {{lang|grc|??????}} (''?nymos''), having a specified kind of name, from the Greek {{lang|grc|?????}} (''ónoma''), [[Aeolic Greek]] ????? (''ónyma''), "name". The form ''-?nymos'' is that taken by ''ónoma'' when it is the end component of a [[bahuvrihi]] compound, but in English its use is extended to [[tatpurusa]] compounds.

The suffix is found in many modern languages with various spellings. Examples are: [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''synoniem'', [[German language|German]] ''Synonym'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''sinónimo'', [[Russian language|Russian]] ??????? (''sinonim''), [[Polish language|Polish]] ''synonim'', [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''synonyymi'', [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''sinonim''.

According to a 1988 study<ref>Scheetz, ''Names' Names,'' p. 1</ref> of words ending in ''-onym'', there are four discernible classes of ''-onym'' words: (1) historic, classic, or, for want of better terms, naturally occurring or common words; (2) scientific terminology, occurring in particular in linguistics, onomastics, etc.; (3) language games; and (4) [[nonce word]]s. Older terms are known to gain new, sometimes contradictory, meanings (e.g., ''eponym'' and ''cryptonym''). In many cases, two or more words describe the same phenomenon, but no precedence is discernible (e.g., ''necronym'' and ''penthonym''). New words are sometimes created, the meaning of which duplicating existing terms. On occasion, new words are formed with little regard to historical principles.

==Words that end in -onym==

'''Abraham Kuijper''' (29 October 1837 – 8 November 1920), generally known as '''Abraham Kuyper''', was a [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch]] journalist, statesman and Calvinist theologian. He was a master organizer.  He founded a new church (the Gereformeerde Kerken), a newspaper, the [[Free University of Amsterdam]], and the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]]. He served as [[prime minister of the Netherlands]] between 1901 and 1905.  In religious affairs, he sought to adapt the Dutch Reformed Church to the challenges posed by the loss of state financial and aid, by religious pluralism, rising nationalism, and the arminian religious revivals of his day which denied predestination.<ref>Wood, 2013a</ref> He vigorously denounced modernism in theology as a fad that would pass away.   In politics he dominated the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) from its founding 1879 to his death in 1920. He  promoted [[pillarization]], the social expression of the [[Antithesis (Netherlands)|anti-thesis]] in public life, whereby Protestant, Catholic and secular elements each had their own independent schools, universities and social organizations.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===
Kuyper's father Jan Frederik Kuyper&mdash;who served as a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] for the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] in [[Hoogmade]], [[Maassluis]], [[Middelburg]] and [[Leiden]]&mdash;[[home school|home-school]]ed  his son. The boy received no formal [[primary education]], but received [[secondary education]] at the [[Education in the Netherlands|Gymnasium]] of Leiden.

In 1855, he graduated from the Gymnasium and began to study [[literature]], [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at [[Leiden University]]. He received his [[propaedeutics|propaedeuse]] in literature in 1857, ''[[summa cum laude]]'', and in philosophy in 1858, also ''summa cum laude''. He also took classes in [[Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[physics]].

In 1862 he was promoted to [[Doctor in theology]] on the basis of a dissertation entitled "Disquisitio historico-theologica, exhibens Johannis Calvini et Johannis à Lasco de Ecclesia Sententiarum inter se compositionem" (Theological-historical dissertation showing the differences in the rules of the church, between John Calvin and John ?aski). In comparing the views of [[John Calvin]] and [[Jan ?aski]], Kuyper showed a clear sympathy for the more liberal ?aski. During his studies Kuyper was a member of the [[liberal christianity|modern tendency]] within the Dutch Reformed Church.

=== Religious life ===
In May 1862, he was declared eligible for the [[Minister of religion|ministry]] and 1863 he accepted a call to become minister for the Dutch Reformed Church for the town of [[Beesd]]. In the same year he married Johanna Hendrika Schaay (1842–1899). They would have five sons and three daughters. In 1864 he began corresponding with the anti-revolutionary MP [[Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer]], who heavily influenced his political and theological views (see [[#Views|below]]).

Around 1866, he began to sympathize with the orthodox tendency within the Dutch Reformed Church. He was inspired by the robust reformed faith of Pietje Balthus, a single woman in her early 30s, the daughter of a miller.<ref>Richard J. Mouw, ''Abraham Kuyper: A Short and Personal Introduction" (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2011), p. 3</ref> He began to oppose the centralization in the church, the role of the [[Dutch monarchy|King]] and began to plead for the [[separation of church and state]].

In 1867, Kuyper was asked to become minister for the parish in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and he left Beesd. In 1870 he was asked to come to [[Amsterdam]]. In 1871 he began to write for the ''De Heraut'' (''The Herald'').

In 1872, he founded his own paper, ''De Standaard'' (''The Standard''). This paper would lay the foundation for the network of Reformed organization, (the Reformed [[pillarization|pillar]]), which Kuyper would found.

==== Doleantie ====
In 1886, Kuyper led an exodus from the Dutch Reformed Church. He grieved the loss of Reformed distinctives within this State Church, which no longer required office bearers to agree to the Reformed standards which had once been foundational.<ref>Dan Knight, ''Dr. Abraham Kuyper'', <http://reformed.net/bios/abraham-kuyper.htm> (Accessed Feb. 6, 2008).</ref>

Kuyper and the [[Consistory (Protestantism)#Reformed usage|consistory]] of [[Amsterdam]] insisted that both ministers and church members subscribe to the Reformed confessions. This was appealed to Classis, and Kuyper, along with about 80 members of the Amsterdam consistory, were suspended in Dec. 1885. This was appealed to the provincial synod, which upheld the ruling in a 1 July 1886 ruling.<ref>Dan Knight, ''Dr. Abraham Kuyper'', <http://reformed.net/bios/abraham-kuyper.htm> (Accessed Feb. 6, 2008)</ref>

Refusing to accept his suspension, Kuyper preached to his followers in an auditorium on Sunday, 11 July 1886. Because of their deep sorrow at the state of the Dutch Reformed Church, the group called itself the [[Doleantie]] (grieving ones).

By 1889, the Doleantie churches had over 200 congregations, 180,000 members, and about 80 ministers.

Kuyper, (although at first antagonistic towards them), soon began to seek union with the churches of the [[Secession of 1834]], the Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerken (Christian Reformed Church).  These churches had earlier broken off from the Dutch Reformed Church. This union was effected in 1892, and the Gereformeerde Kerken in Nederland (Reformed Churches in the Netherlands) was formed. This denomination has its counterpart in the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]].
=== Anti-modernism ===
He vigorously ridiculed  modernism in theology as a new-fangled fad based on a superficial view of reality.  He argued that modernism missed the reality of God, of prayer, of sin, and of the church. He said modernism would eventually prove as useless as 'A Squeezed Out Lemon Peel,' while traditional religious truths would survive.<ref>Arie L. Molendijk, "'A Squeezed Out Lemon Peel.' Abraham Kuyper on Modernism," ''Church History & Religious Culture'' (2011) 91#3 pp 397-412</ref>  In his lectures at Princeton in 1898 he argued that  Calvinism was more than theology--it provided as a comprehensive worldview and indeed had already proven to be a major positive factor in the development of the institutions and values of modern society.<ref>Arie L.  Molendijk, "Neo-Calvinist Culture Protestantism: Abraham Kuyper's Stone Lectures," ''Church History & Religious Culture'' (2008) 88#2 pp 235-250. </ref>

=== Political life ===
{{Christian Democracy sidebar}}

==== Member of Parliament ====
In 1873, Kuyper stood as candidate in the general election for parliament for the constituency of [[Gouda]], but he was defeated by the incumbent member of parliament, the conservative [[Jonkheer]] [[Willem Maurits de Brauw]]. When De Brauw died the next year, Kuyper stood again in the by-election for the same district. This time he was elected to parliament, defeating the liberal candidate [[Herman Verners van der Loeff]].

Kuyper subsequently moved to [[the Hague]], without telling his friends in Amsterdam. In parliament he showed a particular interest in education, especially the [[School struggle (Netherlands)|equal financing of public and religious schools]]. In 1876, he wrote "Our Program" which laid the foundation for the [[Anti Revolutionary Party]]. In this programme he formulated the principle of [[Christian democracy in the Netherlands|antithesis]], the conflict between the religious (Reformed and Catholics) and non-religious. In 1877, he left parliament because of problems with his health, suffering from overexertion.

In 1878, Kuyper returned to politics, he led the [[petition]] against a new law on [[education in the Netherlands|education]], which would further disadvantage religious schools. This was an important impetus for the foundation of the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) in 1879, of which Kuyper would be [[Partijvoorzitter|chairman]] between 1879 and 1905. He would be the indisputed leader of the party between 1879 and 1920. His followers gave him the nickname "Abraham de Geweldige" (Abraham the Great). In 1880, he founded the [[Vrije Universiteit|Free University]] in Amsterdam and he was made professor of Theology there. He also served as its first [[rector magnificus]]. In 1881, he also became professor of literature. In 1886, he left the Dutch Reformed Church, with a large group of followers. The parish in Amsterdam was made independent of the church, and kept their own building. Between 1886 and 1892, they would be called the [[Reformed Churches in the Netherlands|''Dolerenden'']], (those with grievances). In 1892, those Dolerenden founded a new denomination called The Reformed Churches in the Netherlands after merging with other orthodox Reformed people who had seceded from the Dutch Reformed Church in 1834.

In the [[Dutch general election, 1894|general election]] of 1894, Kuyper was re-elected to the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] for the district of [[Sliedrecht]]. He defeated the liberal Van Haaften and the anti-takkian anti-revolutionary Beelaerts van Blokland. He also ran as a candidate in [[Dordrecht]] and [[Amsterdam]], but was defeated there. In the election he joined the so-called Takkians, in a conflict between the liberal minister Tak, and a majority House of Representatives. Tak wanted to reform the [[Householder Franchise|census-suffrage]], but a majority in parliament rejected his proposal. Kuyper favoured the legislation because he expected the enfranchised lower class voters would favour his party. This orientation towards the lower classes gave him the nickname "De bellringer of the common people" (klokkeluider van de kleine luyden). His position on suffrage also led to a conflict within the ARP: a group around [[Alexander de Savornin Lohman]] was  opposed on principle to [[universal suffrage]] because they rejected [[popular sovereignty]]; they left the ARP to found the [[Christelijk Historische Unie|CHU]] in 1901. The authoritarian leadership of Kuyper also played an important role in this conflict. Lohman opposed [[party discipline]] and wanted MPs to make up their own mind, while Kuyper favoured strong leadership. After the elections Kuyper became [[Fractievoorzitter|chair of the parliamentary caucus]] of the ARP. In his second term as MP he concentrated on more issues than education, like [[suffrage]], [[Labour movement|labour]], and [[foreign affairs]]. In foreign affairs especially the [[Second Boer War]] was of particular interest to him, in the conflict between the [[afrikaans|Dutch-speaking]] reformed farmers and the English-speaking Anglicans he sided with the Boers, and heavily opposed the English. In 1896, Kuyper voted against the new suffrage law of [[Samuel van Houten|Van Houten]], because according to Kuyper the reforms did not go far enough. In the [[Dutch general election, 1897|1897 elections]], Kuyper competed in [[Zuidhorn]], [[Sliedrecht]] and [[Amsterdam]]. He was defeated by liberals in Zuidhorn and Amsterdam, but he defeated the liberal Wisboom in Sliedrecht. In Amsterdam he was defeated by [[Johannes Tak van Poortvliet]]. As an MP, Kuyper kept his job as journalist, and he even became chair of the Dutch Circle of Journalists in 1898; when he left in 1901 he was made honorary president. In the same year, at the invitation of [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|B.B. Warfield]], Kuyper delivered the Stone Lectures at [[Princeton Theological Seminary|Princeton Seminary]], which was his first widespread exposure to a North American audience. These lectures were given 10–11 October 14 and 19–21 in 1898. He also received an [[honorary doctorate in law]] there. During his time in the United States, he also traveled to address several Dutch Reformed congregations in Michigan and Iowa and Presbyterian gatherings in Ohio and New Jersey.

==== Prime minister ====
In the [[Dutch general election, 1901|1901 elections]], Kuyper was re-elected in Sliedrecht, defeating the liberal De Klerk. In Amsterdam he was defeated again, now by the [[Vrijzinnig Democratische Bond|freethinking liberal]] Nolting. He did not take his seat in parliament however but was instead appointed [[Cabinet of the Netherlands#Formation|formateur]] and later [[prime minister of the Netherlands|prime minister]] of the Dutch cabinet. He also served as [[minister of Home Affairs]]. He originally wanted to become minister of labour and enterprise, but neither [[Aeneas Baron Mackay|Mackay]] or [[Theo Heemskerk|Heemskerk]], prominent anti-revolutionaries, wanted to become minister of Home Affairs, forcing him to take the portfolio. During his time as prime minister he showed a strong leadership style: he changed the [[Procedural law|rules of procedure]] of cabinet in order to become chair of cabinet for four years (before him, the chairmanship of the cabinet had rotated among its members).

The portfolio of home affairs at the time was very broad: it involved local government, industrial relations, education and public morality. The 1903 railway strike was one of the decisive issues for his cabinet. Kuyper produced several particularly harsh laws to end the strikes (the so-called "worgwetten", strangling laws), and pushed them through parliament. He also proposed legislation to improve [[working conditions]]; however only those on [[fishing]] and harbour construction passed through parliament. In education Kuyper changed several education laws to improve the financial situation of religious schools. His law on higher education, which would make the diplomas of faith-based universities equal to that of the public universities, was defeated in the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]]. Consequently, Kuyper dissolved the Senate and, after a new one was elected, the legislation was accepted. He was also heavily involved in foreign policy, giving him the nickname "Minister of Foreign Travels".

==== Minister of State ====
In 1905,his ARP lost [[Dutch general election, 1905|the elections]] and was confined to opposition. Between 1905 and 1907, Kuyper made a grand tour around the [[Mediterranean]].  In 1907, Kuyper became honorary doctor at the [[Delft University of Technology]]. In 1907, he was re-elected chair of the ARP, a post which he would hold to his death in 1920.  In 1907, Kuyper wanted to return to parliament. In a by-election in [[Sneek]] he needed the support of the local CHU. They refused him support. This led to a personal conflict between Kuyper and De Savorin Lohman. In 1908, he came into conflict with [[Theo Heemskerk|Heemskerk]], who had not involved him in the formation of the CHU/ARP/[[Algemeene Bond van RK-kiesverenigingen|Catholic General League]] cabinet, thereby denying him the chance to return as minister. In 1908, Kuyper received the honorary title of [[Minister of State#Other use|minister of state]]. He was elected to the House of Representatives for the district of [[Ommen]] in the by-elections in the same year, defeating the [[Liberale Unie|liberal]] De Meester. He also ran in Sneek where he was elected as sole candidate. Kuyper took the seat for Ommen. In 1909, he was made chair of the committee which would write the new [[orthography]] of the [[Dutch language]]. In the same year he also received an honorary doctorate at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]]. In the [[Dutch general election, 1909|1909 elections]] he was re-elected in Ommen, defeating the liberal Teesselink, but he was defeated in Dordrecht by the liberal De Kanter.

In 1909, he came under heavy criticism in the so-called decorations affairs (''lintjeszaak''). While minister of home affairs, Kuyper allegedly received money from one [[Rudolf Lehman]]{{dn|date=May 2014}}, to make him Officer in the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]]. A parliamentary debate was held on the subject and a committee was instituted to research the claim. In 1910, the committee reported that Kuyper was innocent. Between 1910 and 1912, he was member of the committee headed by Heemskerk, which prepared a revision of the constitution. In 1912, he resigned his seat in parliament for health reasons, but he returned to politics in the following year, this time as a member of the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] for the province of [[South Holland]]. He would retain this seat until his death. In 1913, he was made commander in the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]]. During the [[First World War]] Kuyper sided with the Germans, because he had opposed the English since the Boer wars. In 1918, Kuyper played an important role in the formation of the first cabinet led by [[Charles Ruijs de Beerenbrouck]]. In 1920, at the age of 83 Kuyper died in The Hague and was buried amid great public attention.

== Views ==
Kuyper's theological and political views are linked. His orthodox Protestant beliefs heavily influenced his anti-revolutionary politics.

=== Theological views ===
Theologically Kuyper has also been very influential. He opposed the liberal tendencies within the [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. This eventually led to secession and the foundation of [[Reformed Churches in the Netherlands]]. He developed so-called [[Neo-Calvinism]], which goes beyond conventional Calvinism on a number of issues. Furthermore, Kuyper made a significant contribution to the formulation of the principle of [[common grace]] in the context of a Reformed world-view.

Most important has been Kuyper's view on the role of [[God]] in everyday life. He believed that God continually influenced the life of believers, and daily events could show his workings. Kuyper famously said, "Oh, no single piece of our mental world is to be hermetically sealed off from the rest, and there is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is Sovereign over ''all'', does not cry: 'Mine!'"<ref>1880 Inaugural Lecture, Free University of Amsterdam</ref><ref>{{Cite book

=== Political views ===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
Kuyper's political ideals were orthodox-Protestant and anti-revolutionary.

The concept of [[sphere sovereignty]] was very important for Kuyper. He rejected the popular sovereignty of France in which all rights originated with the individual, and the state-sovereignty of Germany in which all rights derived from the state.  Instead, he wanted to honour the "intermediate bodies" in society, such as schools and universities, the press, business and industry, the arts etc., each of which would be sovereign in its own sphere. In the interest of a level playing field, he championed the right of every faith community (among whom he counted humanists and socialists) to operate their own schools, newspapers, hospitals, youth movements etc. He sought [[School struggle (Netherlands)|equal government finances]] for all faith-based institutions. He saw an important role for the state in upholding the morality of the Dutch people. He favoured monarchy, and saw the House of Orange as historically and religiously linked to the Dutch people. His commitment to [[universal suffrage]] was only tactical;{{inconsistent}} he expected the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] would be able to gain more seats this way. In actuality, Kuyper wanted a [[Householder Franchise]] where fathers of each family would vote for his family. He also favoured a Senate representing the various interest, vocational and professional groups in society.

With his ideals he defended the interests of a group of middle class orthodox reformed, who were often referred to as "the little people" (''de kleine luyden''). He formulated the principle of [[Christian democracy in the Netherlands|antithesis]]: a divide between secular and religious politics. [[Liberale Unie|Liberals]] and [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|socialists]], who were opposed to mixing religion and politics were his natural opponents. [[RKSP|Catholics]] were a natural ally, for not only did they want to practice religiously inspired politics, but they also were no electoral opponent, because they appealed to different religious groups. Socialists, who preached [[class conflict]] were a danger to the reformed workers. He called for workers to accept their fates and be happy with a simple life, because the [[afterlife]] would be much more satisfying and revolution would only lead to instability. At the same time he argued that the system of unrestricted free enterprise was in need of "architectonic critique" and he urged government to adopt labour legislation and to inspect workplaces.

== Legacy ==
Kuyper's political views and acts have influenced [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch politics]]. Kuyper stood at the cradle of [[pillarization]], the social expression of the [[Antithesis (Netherlands)|anti-thesis]] in public life. His championing of parity treatment for faith-based organizations and institutions created the basis for the alliance between Protestants and Catholics that would dominate Dutch politics to the present day. One of the current governing parties of the Netherlands, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]], is still heavily influenced by Kuyper's thought. His greatest theological act, the founding of the [[Reformed Churches in the Netherlands]] was undone in 2005 with the creation of the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]] which united the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands]].

In [[North America]], Kuyper's political and theological views have had a significant impact, especially in the Reformed community. He is considered the father of Dutch Neo-Calvinism and had considerable influence on the thought of philosopher [[Herman Dooyeweerd]].  Others that have been influenced by Kuyper include [[Francis Schaeffer]], [[Cornelius Van Til]], [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]], [[Albert M. Wolters]], Vincent Bacote, [[Anthony Bradley]], [[Chuck Colson]], [[Timothy J. Keller]], [[James Skillen]], [[R Tudur Jones]], and [[Bobi Jones]].

Institutions influenced by Kuyper include [[Cardus]] (formerly The Work Research Foundation), [[Calvin College]], The Clapham Institute, [[Dordt College]], [[Institute for Christian Studies]], [[Redeemer University College]], The [[Coalition for Christian Outreach]], [[Covenant College]], The Center for Public Justice, and the Washington Institute for Faith, Vocation, & Culture. In 2006, [[Reformed Bible College]], located in [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]] was renamed in honor of Abraham Kuyper and is now [[Kuyper College]].

As well as Kuyper's profound influence upon European Christian-Democrat politics up to the present, his [[political theology]] was also crucial in the history of [[South Africa]]. His legacy in South Africa is arguably even greater than within the Netherlands.  There, his Christian-National conception, centred upon the identification of the Afrikaner Calvinist community as the ''kern der natie'' became a rallying position for the [[Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk]]. As Christian-Nationalists, Kuyper's adherents in South Africa were instrumental in the building of Afrikaner cultural, political and economic institutions to restore Afrikaner fortunes following the [[Boer War]].

Saul Dubow notes that Kuyper advocated "the commingling of blood" as "the physical basis for all higher development" in the Stone Lectures (1898). Harinck argues that "Kuyper was not guided by the cultural racism of his day, but by his Calvinistic creed of human equality".<ref>George Harinck, "Abraham Kuyper, South Africa, and Apartheid," ''The Princeton Seminary Bulletin'' 23 (2002): 187. <http://scdc.library.ptsem.edu/mets/mets.aspx?src=PSB2002232&div=6> (Accessed Jul. 20, 2012)</ref>

Kuyper's legacy includes a granddaughter, [[Johtje Vos]], who is noted for having sheltered many Jews in her home in the [[Netherlands]] from the [[Nazis]]. After [[World War II]] she moved to [[New York]].<ref>Hevesi, Dennis. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/nyregion/04vos.htm "Johtje Vos, Who Saved Wartime Jews, Dies at 97,"] ''New York Times.'' 4 November 2007.</ref> Conversely, Kuyper's son Professor H. H. Kuyper, a supporter of Afrikaner Nationalism and colour racism was a wartime Nazi collaborator, and his grandson joined the Waffen SS and died on the Russian front.

'''''The Deep Blue Sea''''' (1952) is a stage play by [[Terence Rattigan]], first performed in [[London]], 6 March 1952, when it was praised by critics and audiences as evidence that Rattigan's view of life was growing deeper and more complex.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} It also won praise for actress [[Peggy Ashcroft]], who co-starred with [[Kenneth More]]. Its [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] premiere on 5 November 1953, starring [[Margaret Sullavan]], was not nearly so well-received, and ran for only 132 performances. Later revivals have starred [[Penelope Wilton]], [[Isabel Dean]], [[Penelope Keith]], [[Blythe Danner]], [[Harriet Walter]], and [[Greta Scacchi]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UK Theater Web|url=http://www.uktw.co.uk/archive/play/the-deep-blue-sea/L022756935/|accessdate=15 March 2012}}</ref> 2011 saw two major British revivals to mark Rattigan's centenary, one at the [[West Yorkshire Playhouse]] with [[Maxine Peake]] as Hester and [[Lex Shrapnel]] as Freddy. The other was at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]] with [[Amanda Root]] as Hester alongside [[Anthony Calf]] and [[John Hopkins (actor)|John Hopkins]].

Actor [[Lex Shrapnel]] says, “It’s a play about love and lust. But also about what it was like to live after the war. Freddy was a [[Spitfire]] pilot in [[World War II]]. He came out of that a war hero and worked as a test pilot, but lost his nerve and hit the bottle. Before we join the play he’s met Hester and pours his heart out to her at a time when people were very closed up. We join them at the nadir of their relationship.”<ref>{{cite web |first=Hannah |last=Giles |url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/interviews/theatre/northeast/E8831296300905/Brief+Encounter+With+...+Lex+Shrapnel.html|title=Brief Encounter With ... Lex Shrapnel|publisher=whatsonstage.com|date=January 29, 2011 |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref>

==Plot summary==
''The Deep Blue Sea'' begins with the discovery by her neighbours of Hester Collyer who has tried and failed to commit suicide. Some time before, she left her husband, a respectable High Court Judge, for a semi-alcoholic former [[RAF]] pilot, Freddy Page. The relationship was physical and passionate but his ardour has cooled, leaving her emotionally stranded and desperate. The aftershocks of her attempted suicide unravel even the remnants of this relationship, but by the end she is brought to a hard decision to live, partly through the intercession of another resident of the tenement house, Mr. Miller, an ex-doctor, struck off for what seems to have been a homosexual offence. These two outcasts, socially ostracised for their 'excessive' loves, find a curious and moving kinship.

==Screen adaptations==
A number of screen adaptations of the play have been made. The first, for [[BBC|BBC Television]], was broadcast live on 17 and 21 January 1954 in the ''Sunday Night Theatre'' strand, with Kenneth More as Freddie, and [[Googie Withers]] as Hester. A [[The Deep Blue Sea (1955 film)|feature film version]] directed by [[Anatole Litvak]] was released the following year, with More again reprising the role of Freddie, and [[Vivien Leigh]] as Hester.

A further BBC version, in the ''[[Play of the Month]]'' series was transmitted on 17 March 1974. Directed by [[Rudolph Cartier]], it starred [[Peter Egan]] (Freddie), and [[Virginia McKenna]] (Hester). The most recent BBC adaptation, in the ''Performance'' strand, was transmitted on 12 November 1994, directed by [[Karel Reisz]], with [[Colin Firth]] (Freddie Page ), [[Penelope Wilton]] (Hester Collyer), and [[Ian Holm]] (William Collyer).

In 2011 a second feature film adaptation, ''[[The Deep Blue Sea (2011 film)|The Deep Blue Sea]]'', was made, directed by [[Terence Davies]] and starring [[Rachel Weisz]] and [[Tom Hiddleston]]. The film is a Camberwell/Fly Film Production and funded by the [[UK Film Council]] and [[Film4]].

The '''Cessna 152''' is an [[United States|American]] two-seat, fixed [[tricycle gear]], [[general aviation]] [[airplane]], used primarily for [[flight training]] and personal use.

==Development==
[[File:Cessna152C-GZSS02.jpg|thumb|right|One of the first Cessna 152s produced, a 1978 model-year built in 1977.]]
[[File:1978Cessna152.jpg|thumb|1978 Cessna 152]]
First delivered in 1977 as the 1978 model year, the 152 was a modernization of the proven [[Cessna 150]] design. The 152 was intended to compete with the new [[Beechcraft Skipper]] and [[Piper Tomahawk]], both of which were introduced the same year.<ref name="Clarke"/> Additional design goals were to improve useful load through a gross weight increase to 1670&nbsp;lbs (757&nbsp;kg), decrease internal and external noise levels and run better on the then newly introduced [[avgas |100LL]] fuel.<ref name="Plane and Pilot">{{Citation | newspaper = Plane and Pilot | title = 1978 Aircraft Directory | page = 23 | publisher = Werner & Werner | place = Santa Monica, CA | year = 1977 | ISBN = 0-918312-00-0}}.</ref>

As with the 150, the great majority of 152s were built at the [[Cessna]] factory in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. A number of aircraft were also built by [[Reims Aviation]] of [[France]] and given the designation F152/FA152.<ref name = "Clarke">{{Citation | last = Clarke | first = William ‘Bill’ | title = Cessna 150 and 152 | edition = 1st | pages = 26–95 | publisher = TAB Books | year = 1987 | ISBN = 0-8306-9022-0}}.</ref>

Production of the 152 was ended in 1985 when Cessna ended production of all of their light aircraft; by that time, a total of 7,584 examples of the 152, including '''A152''' and '''FA152 Aerobat''' [[aerobatic]] variants, had been built worldwide.

In 2007 Cessna announced that it would build a [[light sport aircraft|light sport]] successor, designated the [[Cessna 162| Model 162 Skycatcher]],<ref>{{cite web | type = press release | url= http://www.cessna.com/news/article.chtml?ID=OLfDUtl3WHhXrd7RDbcK3ISyhlXGjLXAfkdDyaluhsFbGkjoho |title= Cessna Announces Light Sport Aircraft Details |date= 2007-07-22 | publisher = Cessna Aircraft |accessdate= 2007-09-28}}</ref> although production ended in 2013.

==Design==

===Powerplant===
All Cessna 152s were manufactured with a [[Lycoming O-235]] engine. The Lycoming provided not only an increase in engine power over the Cessna 150, but also was more compatible with the newer [[100LL]] low lead fuel.<ref name="Clarke"/>

Cessna 152s produced between 1977 and 1982 were equipped with Lycoming O-235-L2C engines producing 110&nbsp;hp (82&nbsp;kW) at 2550&nbsp;rpm.  This engine still suffered some lead-fouling problems in service and was succeeded in 1983 by the {{convert|108|hp|abbr=on}} O-235-N2C which featured a different piston design and a redesigned combustion chamber to reduce this problem.  The N2C engine was used until 152 production ended in 1985.<ref name="Clarke"/>

===Airframe===
The airframe is of mainly metal construction. being primarily of [[2024 aluminium alloy|2024-T3 aluminum]] alloy with riveted skin. Components such as wingtips and fairings are made from [[glass-reinforced plastic]].  The fuselage is a [[Monocoque|semi-monocoque]] with vertical bulkheads and frames joined by [[longeron]]s running the length of the [[fuselage]].  The wings are of a strut-braced design and have a 1&nbsp;degree [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] angle.  The tapered (outboard) portion of each wing has one degree of washout (the chord of the tip section has one degree lower angle of attack than the chord at the end of the constant-width section).  This allows greater [[aileron]] effectiveness during a stall.<ref name="Cessna152POH">Cessna Aircraft Company: ''1978 Cessna 152 Pilot's Operating Handbook'' Change 1, pp. 7-3 to 7-33. Cessna Aircraft Company, Wichita, Kansas, 1977.</ref>

===Flying controls===
[[File:C152panel.jpg|thumb|Instrument panel]]

Dual controls are available as optional equipment on the Cessna 152<ref name="Cessna152POH"/> and almost all 152s have this option installed.

The Cessna 152 is equipped with differential ailerons that move through 20&nbsp;degrees upwards and 15&nbsp;degrees downwards.  It has single-slotted [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] which are electrically operated and deploy to a maximum of 30 degrees.  The [[rudder]] can move 23&nbsp;degrees to either side and is fitted with a ground-adjustable [[trim tab]].  The [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevators]] move up through 25&nbsp;degrees and down through 18 degrees.  An adjustable trim tab is installed on the right elevator and is controlled by a small wheel in the center of the control console.  The trim tab moves 10&nbsp;degrees up and 20&nbsp;degrees down relative to the elevator chordline.<ref name="Cessna152POH"/>

===Landing gear===
The Cessna 152 is equipped with fixed [[tricycle gear|tricycle landing gear]].  The main gear has tubular steel legs surrounded by a full-length fairing with a step for access to the cabin.  The main gear has a 7&nbsp;ft 7&nbsp;in (2.3&nbsp;m) wheelbase.<ref name="Clarke"/> 

The nosewheel is connected to the engine mount and has an oleo strut to dampen and absorb normal operating loads. The nosewheel is steerable through eight&nbsp;degrees either side of neutral and can castor under differential braking up to 30 degrees.  It is connected to the rudder pedals through a spring linkage.<ref name="Cessna152POH"/>

The braking system consists of single disc brake assemblies fitted to the main gear and operated by a hydraulic system.  Brakes are operated by pushing on the top portion of the rudder pedals.  It is possible to use differential braking when taxiing and this allows very tight turns to be made.<ref name="Cessna152POH"/>

The 152 is also fitted with a parking brake system. It is applied by depressing both toe brakes and then pulling the "Park Brake" lever to the pilot’s left.  The toe brakes are then released but pressure is maintained in the system thereby leaving both brakes engaged.<ref name="Cessna152POH"/>

The standard tires used are 600 X 6 on the main gear and 500 X 5 on the nosewheel.<ref name="Clarke"/>

===Modifications===

There are hundreds of modifications available for the Cessna 152. The most frequently installed include:

====Tailwheel landing gear====
Taildragger conversions such as the 'Texas Taildragger' conversion are available and have been fitted to some 152s.  It involves strengthening the fuselage for the main gear being moved further forward, removing the nosewheel and strengthening the tail area for the tailwheel. This greatly improves short field performance and is claimed to give up to a {{convert|10|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} cruise speed increase.<ref name="ClarkeMods">Clarke, Bill: ''Cessna 150 and 152'' first edition, pp. 197-212. TAB Books, 1987. ISBN 0-8306-9022-0.</ref><ref name="PilotMagazine">Grimstead, Bob: ''Texas Taildragger 152'', pp. 14-22. [[Pilot Magazine UK]], January 2007.</ref>

====STOL kits====
The wings can be modified using a number of [[STOL#STOL kits|STOL modification kits]], some improving high speed/cruise performance but most concentrating on [[STOL]] performance.  Horton's STOL kit is one of the better-known of the latter. It involves fitting a more cambered leading edge cuff to increase the maximum coefficient of lift, fitting fences at the aileron/flap intersection and fitting drooped wingtips. Stalls with these modifications are almost off the airspeed indicator, since instrument error is high at high angles of attack.<ref name="ClarkeMods"/><ref name="PilotMagazine"/> It has been said that landings can be achieved in two fuselage lengths with the kit installed in addition to a taildragger modification, by balancing power against drag.<ref name="PilotMagazine"/> Takeoff performance is also improved by varying degrees depending on the surface.

====Engine====
The engine's power can be increased by various modifications, such as the ''Sparrow Hawk'' power package, increasing it to {{convert|125|hp|abbr=on}}.<ref name="ClarkeMods"/><ref name="PilotMagazine"/>  The disadvantage of the ''Sparrow Hawk'' conversion is that it uses pistons from the O-235-F series engine and therefore the engine recommended [[time between overhaul]] is reduced from 2,400 hours to 2,000 hours.<ref>Lycoming, [http://www.lycoming.com/support/publications/service-instructions/pdfs/SI1009AU.pdf "Lycoming Service Instruction No. 1009AU"].''Lycoming'', November 18, 2009.</ref>

====Other modifications====

Other popular modifications include:
* Flap gap seals to reduce drag and increase rate of climb.<ref name="ClarkeMods"/>
* Different wingtips, some of which claim various cruise speed increases and [[stall speed]] reductions.<ref name="ClarkeMods"/>
* Auto fuel [[Supplemental Type Certificate|STCs]], which permit the use of automobile fuel instead of the more expensive aviation fuel.
* Auxiliary fuel tanks for greater range.<ref name="ClarkeMods"/>
* Door catches to replace the factory ones that often fail in service.<ref name="ClarkeMods"/>
* Belly fuel drain valves to drain fuel from the lowest point in the fuel system.<ref name="ClarkeMods"/>

==Incidents and accidents==
*On 9 May 1989, a man who had murdered his ex-wife earlier that evening stole a Cessna 152T at gunpoint from an employee at [[Beverly Municipal Airport]]. During the flight, which lasted over three hours, Alfred James Hunter III fired an assault rifle at the ground below, buzzed the South Postal Annex in [[Boston]] several times, and briefly touched down at [[Logan International Airport]] before taking off again. He was arrested when he finally landed with just five minutes worth of fuel remaining.<ref>{{cite news|title=Man kills wife, steals plane|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UtdMAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VYEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3690,2706201|accessdate=12 August 2011|newspaper=Associated Press|date=May 10, 1989}}</ref>

*On 24 May 2001, a Cessna 152 violated Israeli airspace and was shot down by an IDAF [[AH-64 Apache]]. Estephan Nicolian, a Lebanese student pilot, was shot down after ignoring repeated warnings by Israeli ATC to turn back.

'''Ethylene oxide''', also called '''oxirane''', is the [[organic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] {{chem|C|2|H|4|O}}. It is a cyclic ether. (A cyclic ether consists of an alkane with an oxygen atom bonded to two carbon atoms of the alkane, forming a ring.) Ethylene oxide is a colorless flammable gas at room temperature, with a faintly sweet odor; it is the simplest [[epoxide]]: a three-membered ring consisting of one oxygen atom and two carbon atoms. Because of its special molecular structure, ethylene oxide easily participates in [[addition reaction]]s; e.g., opening its ring and thus easily [[polymerisation|polymerizing]]. Ethylene oxide is [[isomer]]ic with [[acetaldehyde]] and with [[vinyl alcohol]].

Although it is a vital raw material with diverse applications, including the manufacture of products like [[polysorbate 20]] and [[polyethylene glycol]] that are often more effective and less toxic than alternative materials, ethylene oxide itself is a very hazardous substance: at room temperature it is a flammable, carcinogenic, [[mutagenicity|mutagenic]], irritating, and anaesthetic gas with a misleadingly pleasant aroma.

The chemical reactivity that is responsible for many of ethylene oxide's hazards has also made it a key industrial chemical. Although too dangerous for direct household use and generally unfamiliar to consumers, ethylene oxide is used industrially for making many consumer products as well as non-consumer chemicals and intermediates. Ethylene oxide is important or critical to the production of detergents, thickeners, solvents, plastics, and various organic chemicals such as [[ethylene glycol]], ethanolamines, simple and complex glycols, polyglycol ethers and other compounds. As a poison gas that leaves no residue on items it contacts, pure ethylene oxide is a [[disinfectant]] that is widely used in hospitals and the medical equipment industry to replace steam in the sterilization of heat-sensitive tools and equipment, such as disposable plastic syringes.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=oJy5wdzi0yUC&pg=PA309|page=309|title=Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing and Design|volume=20|author=McKetta, John J. and Cunningham, William A. |publisher=CRC Press|year=1984|isbn=0-8247-2470-4}}</ref>

Ethylene oxide is industrially produced by direct [[oxidation]] of [[ethylene]] in the presence of [[silver]] [[catalyst]]. It is extremely flammable and explosive and is used as a main component of [[thermobaric weapon]]s;<ref name=e1/><ref name=e2/> therefore, it is commonly handled and shipped as a refrigerated liquid.<ref name=Ullmann>Rebsdat, Siegfried and Mayer, Dieter (2005) "Ethylene Oxide" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a10_117}}.</ref>

==History==
Ethylene oxide was first reported in 1859 by the [[France|French]] chemist [[Charles-Adolphe Wurtz]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wurtz, A.|journal= Comptes rendus|volume= 48|pages= 101–105 |year=1859| title= Sur l'oxyde d'éthylène| url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30054/f101.image}}</ref> who prepared it by treating [[2-chloroethanol]] with [[potassium hydroxide]]:

:Cl–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–OH + KOH ? (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + KCl + H<sub>2</sub>O

Wurtz measured the [[boiling point]] of ethylene oxide as 13.5&nbsp;°C, slightly higher than the present value, and discovered the ability of ethylene oxide to react with acids and salts of metals.<ref name="oe1">{{cite book

|pages = 15–17}}</ref> Wurtz mistakenly assumed that ethylene oxide has the properties of an organic base. This misconception persisted until 1896 when [[Georg Bredig]] found that ethylene oxide is not an [[electrolyte]].<ref name="oe1" /><ref>{{cite journal|author=Bredig, G. and Usoff, A. |year=1896|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0cPmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA116 |title=Ist Acetylen ein Elektrolyt?|trans_title=Is acetylene an electrolyte?|journal=Zeitschrift für Elektrochemie|volume=3|pages=116–117}}</ref> That it differed from other [[ether]]s — particularly by its propensity to engage in addition reactions, which are typical of unsaturated compounds — had long been a matter of debate. The heterocyclic triangular structure of ethylene oxide was proposed by 1868 or earlier.<ref>[[Eugen Freiherr von Gorup-Besanez|Eugen F. von Gorup-Besanez]], ed., ''Lehrbuch der organischen Chemie für den Unterricht auf Universitäten'' … [Textbook of Organic Chemistry for Instruction at Universities … ], 3rd ed.

==Chemical properties==
Ethylene oxide readily reacts with diverse compounds with opening of the ring. Its typical reactions are with nucleophiles which proceed via the '''[[Nucleophilic substitution|S<sub>N</sub>2]]''' mechanism both in acidic (weak nucleophiles: water, alcohols) and alkaline media (strong nucleophiles: OH<sup>–</sup>, RO<sup>–</sup>, NH<sub>3</sub>, RNH<sub>2</sub>, RR'NH, etc.).<ref name="traven" /> The general reaction scheme is

: [[File:Ethylene oxide reactions.png|Ethylene oxide reactions]]

and more specific reactions are described below.

===Addition of water and alcohols===
Aqueous solutions of ethylene oxide are rather stable and can exist for a long time without any noticeable chemical reaction, but adding a small amount of acid, such as strongly diluted [[sulfuric acid]], immediately leads to the formation of [[ethylene glycol]], even at room temperature:

: (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + H<sub>2</sub>O ? HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–OH

The reaction also occurs in the gas phase, in the presence of a [[phosphoric acid]] salt as a catalyst.<ref name="oe3">{{cite book

|editor=Zimakov, P.V. and Dyment, O. H.
| location = M.
|publisher = Khimiya
|year = 1967
|pages = 90–120}}</ref>

The reaction is usually carried out at about 60&nbsp;°C with a large excess of water, in order to prevent the reaction of the formed ethylene glycol with ethylene oxide that would form [[diethylene glycol|di-]] and [[triethylene glycol]]:<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>

:2 (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + H<sub>2</sub>O ? HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–O–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–OH

:3 (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + H<sub>2</sub>O ? HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–O–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–O–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–OH

The use of alkaline catalysts may lead to the formation of [[polyethylene glycol]]:

:n (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + H<sub>2</sub>O ? HO–(–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–O–)<sub>n</sub>–H

Reactions with [[alcohol]]s proceed similarly yielding ethylene glycol ethers:

: (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH ? HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>

:2 (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH ? HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–O–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>

Reactions with lower alcohols occur less actively than with water and require more severe conditions, such as heating to 160&nbsp;°C and pressurizing to 3 MPa and adding an acid or alkali catalyst.

Reactions of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols proceed in the presence of [[sodium]] metal, [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[boron trifluoride]] and are used for the synthesis of [[surfactants]].<ref name="oe3" />

===Addition of carboxylic acids and their derivatives===
Reactions of ethylene oxide with [[carboxylic acid]]s in the presence of a catalyst results in incomplete and with [[anhydrides]] in complete glycol esters:

: (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + CH<sub>3</sub>COOH ? HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–OCOCH<sub>3</sub>

: (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + (CH<sub>3</sub>CO)<sub>2</sub>O ? CH<sub>3</sub>COO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–OCOCH<sub>3</sub>

The addition of acid [[amide]]s proceeds similarly:

: (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + CH<sub>3</sub>CONH<sub>2</sub> ? HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–NHCOCH<sub>3</sub>

Addition of ethylene oxide to higher carboxylic acids is carried out at elevated temperatures (typically 140–180&nbsp;°C) and pressure (0.3–0.5 MPa) in an inert atmosphere, in presence of an alkaline catalyst (concentration 0.01–2%), such as hydroxide or carbonate of sodium or potassium.<ref>{{cite book

|isbn = 978-0-8247-9997-7}}</ref> The carboxylate ion acts as [[nucleophile]] in the reaction:

:RCOOH + OH<sup>–</sup> ? RCOO<sup>–</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O

: (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + RCOO<sup>–</sup> ? RCOOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O<sup>–</sup>

:RCOOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O<sup>–</sup> + RCOOH ? RCOOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH + RCOO<sup>–</sup>

===Adding ammonia and amines===
Ethylene oxide reacts with [[ammonia]] forming a mixture of mono-, di- and tri- [[ethanolamine]]s. The reaction is stimulated by adding a small amount of water.

: (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + NH<sub>3</sub> ? HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–NH<sub>2</sub>

:2 (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + NH<sub>3</sub> ? (HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH

:3 (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + NH<sub>3</sub> ? (HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>N

Similarly proceed the reactions with primary and secondary amines:

: (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + RNH<sub>2</sub> ? HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–NHR

Dialkylamino ethanols can further react with ethylene oxide, forming amino polyethylene glycols:<ref name="ect" />

:n (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + R<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH ? R<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O–(–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O–)<sub>n</sub>–H

Trimethylamine reacts with ethylene oxide in the presence of water, forming [[choline]]:<ref>{{cite book

: (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>N + H<sub>2</sub>O ? [HOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>N (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup>OH<sup>–</sup>

Aromatic primary and secondary amines also react with ethylene oxide, forming the corresponding arylamino alcohols.

===Halide addition===
Ethylene oxide readily reacts with aqueous solutions of [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]], [[hydrobromic acid|hydrobromic]] and [[hydroiodic acid]]s to form [[halohydrin]]s. The reaction occurs easier with the last two acids:

: (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + HCl ? HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–Cl

The reaction with these acids competes with the acid-catalyzed hydration of ethylene oxide; therefore, there is always a by-product of ethylene glycol with an admixture of diethylene glycol. For a cleaner product, the reaction is conducted in the gas phase or in an organic solvent.

Ethylene fluorohydrin is obtained differently, by boiling [[hydrogen fluoride]] with a 5–6% solution of ethylene oxide in [[diethyl ether]]. The ether normally has a water content of 1.5–2%; in absence of water, ethylene oxide polymerizes.<ref>{{cite book
|author = Sheppard, William A. and Sharts, Clay M. 
|title = Organic Fluorine Chemistry
|publisher = W.A. Benjamin
|year = 1969
|page= 98
|isbn = 0-8053-8790-0}}</ref>

Halohydrins can also be obtained by passing ethylene oxide through aqueous solutions of metal halides:<ref name="oe3" />

:2 (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + CuCl<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O ? 2 HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–Cl + Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>?

===Metalorganic addition===
Interaction of ethylene oxide with organomagnesium compounds, which are [[Grignard reaction|Grignard reagents]], can be regarded as [[nucleophilic substitution]] influenced by [[carbanion]] organometallic compounds. The final product of the reaction is a primary alcohol:

: <math>\mathsf{(CH_2CH_2)O+RMgBr}\rightarrow\mathsf{R\!\!-\!\!CH_2CH_2\!\!-\!\!OMgBr\ \xrightarrow{H_2O}\ R\!\!-\!\!CH_2CH_2\!\!-\!\!OH}</math>

Similar mechanism is valid for other organometallic compounds, such as alkyl lithium:

: <math>\mathsf{(CH_2CH_2)O+RLi}\rightarrow\mathsf{R\!\!-\!\!CH_2CH_2\!\!-\!\!OLi\ \xrightarrow{H_2O}\ R\!\!-\!\!CH_2CH_2\!\!-\!\!OH}</math>

===Other addition reactions===

====Addition of hydrogen cyanide====
Ethylene oxide easily reacts with the [[hydrogen cyanide]] forming ethylene cyanohydrin:

: (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + HCN ? HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–CN

A slightly chilled (10–20&nbsp;°C) aqueous solution of [[calcium cyanide]] can be used instead of HCN:<ref>{{cite journal
|url = http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/pdfs/cv1p0256.pdf
|title = Ethylene cyanohydrin

:2 (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + Ca(CN)<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O ? 2 HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–CN + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>

Ethylene cyanohydrin easily loses water, producing [[acrylonitrile]]:

:HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–CN ? CH<sub>2</sub>=CH–CN + H<sub>2</sub>O

====Addition of hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans====
When reacting with the [[hydrogen sulfide]], ethylene oxide forms 2-mercaptoethanol and thiodiglycol, and with alkylmercaptans it produces 2-alkyl mercaptoetanol:

: (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + H<sub>2</sub>S ? HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–HS

:2 (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + H<sub>2</sub>S ? (HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S

: (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + RHS ? HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–SR

The excess of ethylene oxide with an aqueous solution of hydrogen sulfide leads to the tris-(hydroxyethyl) sulfonyl hydroxide:

:3 (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + H<sub>2</sub>S ? [(HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>S<sup>+</sup>]OH<sup>–</sup>

====Addition of nitrous and nitric acids====
Reaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous solutions of [[barium nitrite]], [[calcium nitrite]], [[magnesium nitrite]], [[zinc nitrite]] or [[sodium nitrite]] leads to the formation of [[2-nitroethanol]]:<ref>{{cite journal

When ethylene oxide is heated to about 400&nbsp;°C, or to 150–300&nbsp;°C in the presence of a catalyst ([[aluminium oxide|Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>]], [[phosphoric acid|H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>]], etc.), it [[isomerization|isomerizes]] into [[acetaldehyde]]:<ref name="petrov">{{cite book

2) CH<sub>3</sub>CHO* ? CH<sub>3</sub>• + CHO•

3) CH<sub>3</sub>CHO* + M ? CH<sub>3</sub>CHO + M*

In reaction 3), '''M''' refers to the wall of the reaction vessel or to a heterogeneous catalyst.
The moiety CH<sub>3</sub>CHO* represents a short-lived (lifetime of 10<sup>?8.5</sup> seconds), activated molecule of acetaldehyde. Its excess energy is about 355.6 kJ/mol, which exceeds by 29.3 kJ/mol the [[binding energy]] of the C-C bond in acetaldehyde.<ref name="benson" />

In absence of a catalyst, the thermal isomerization of ethylene oxide is never selective and apart from acetaldehyde yields significant amount of by-products (see section [[Ethylene oxide#Thermal decomposition|Thermal decomposition]]).<ref name="oe2"/>

===Reduction reaction===
Ethylene oxide can be hydrogenated into ethanol in the presence of a catalyst, such as [[nickel]], [[platinum]], [[palladium]],<ref name="oe2" /> [[borane]]s, [[lithium aluminium hydride]] and some other [[hydride]]s.<ref name="reduction">{{cite book

Conversely, with some other catalysts, ethylene oxide may be ''reduced'' by hydrogen to ethylene with the yield up to 70%. The reduction catalysts include mixtures of zinc dust and [[acetic acid]], of lithium aluminium hydride with [[titanium trichloride]] (the reducing agent is actually [[Titanium(II) chloride|titanium dichloride]], formed by the reaction between LiAlH<sub>4</sub> and TiCl<sub>3</sub>) and of [[iron(III) chloride]] with [[butyllithium]] in [[tetrahydrofuran]].<ref name="reduction" />

Ethylene oxide can further be oxidized, depending on the conditions, to [[glycolic acid]] or [[carbon dioxide]]:

===Dimerization===
In the presence of acid catalysts, ethylene oxide dimerizes to afford [[dioxane]]:

: [[File:Dioxane-synthesis.png|250px|Synthesis of dioxane]]

The reaction mechanism is as follows:<ref name="oe2" />

: [[File:Dioxan-HerstellungCZ.png|650px|Mechanism of dimerization]]

The dimerization reaction is not selective, and there are always by-products, such as [[acetaldehyde]] (due to [[Ethylene oxide#Isomerization|isomerization]]). The selectivity and speed of dimerization can be increased by adding a catalyst, such as platinum, platinum-palladium or [[iodine]] with [[sulfolan]]; however, 2-methyl-1,3-[[dioxolane]] is formed as a side product in the last case.<ref>{{cite web

===Thermal decomposition===

==Industrial synthesis==

===History===
Commercial production of ethylene oxide dates back to 1914 when [[BASF]] built the first factory which used the chlorohydrin process (reaction of ethylene chlorohydrin with calcium hydroxide). The chlorohydrin process was unattractive for several reasons, including low efficiency and loss of valuable chlorine into [[calcium chloride]].<ref>{{cite journal

It was further improved in 1958 by Shell Oil Co. by replacing air with oxygen and using elevated temperature of 200–300&nbsp;°C and pressure (1–3 MPa).<ref name = "industrial"/> This more efficient routine accounted for about half of ethylene oxide production in the 1950s in the U.S., and after 1975 it completely replaced the previous methods.<ref name = "industrial" >{{cite book

===Chlorohydrin process of production of ethylene oxide===
Although the chlorohydrin process is almost entirely superseded in the industry by the direct oxidation of ethylene, the knowledge of this method is still important for educational reasons and because it is still used in the production of [[propylene oxide]].<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate = 2009-11-19}}</ref> The process consists of three major steps: synthesis of ethylene chlorohydrin, dehydrochlorination of ethylene chlorohydrin to ethylene oxide and purification of ethylene oxide. Those steps are carried continuously. In the first column, hypochlorination of ethylene is carried out as follows:<ref name="uk">{{cite book

:CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> ? Cl–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–Cl

To suppress the conversion of ethylene into the [[ethylene dichloride]] (the last reaction), the concentration of ethylene is maintained at about 4–6%, and the solution is heated by steam to the boiling point.<ref name="uk" />

Next, aqueous solution of ethylene chlorohydrin enters the second column, where it reacts with a 30% solution of calcium hydroxide at 100&nbsp;°C:<ref name="uk" />

:2 OH–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–Cl + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> ? 2 (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + CaCl<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O

The produced ethylene oxide is purified by [[rectified spirit|rectification]]. The chlorohydrin process allows to reach 95% conversion of ethylene chlorohydrin. The yield of ethylene oxide is about 80% of the theoretical value; for 1 ton of ethylene oxide, about 200&nbsp;kg of ethylene dichloride is produced.<ref name="uk" /> But, the major drawbacks of this process are high chlorine consumption and effluent load. This process is now obsolete.

===Direct oxidation of ethylene===

====Usage in global industry====
Direct oxidation of ethylene was patented by Lefort in 1931. This method was repeatedly modified for industrial use, and at least four major variations are known. They all use oxidation by oxygen or air and a silver-based catalyst, but differ in the technological details and hardware implementations.<ref name="eos">{{cite book

A different modification was developed Shell International Chemicals BV. Their method is rather flexible with regard to the specific requirements of specific industries; it is characterized by high selectivity with respect to the ethylene oxide product and long lifetime of the catalyst (3 years). It accounts for about 40% of global production.<ref name="cmpa" />

====Chemistry and kinetics of the direct oxidation process====
Formally, the direct oxidation process is expressed by the following equation:

: <math>\mathsf{2CH_2\!\!=\!\!CH_2+O_2\ \xrightarrow{Ag}\ 2(CH_2CH_2)O}</math>      ?H = -105 kJ/mol

However, significant yield of carbon dioxide and water is observed in practice, which can be explained by the complete oxidation of ethylene or ethylene oxide:

:CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub> + 3 O<sub>2</sub> ? 2 CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O      ?H = -1327 kJ/mol

: (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + 2.5 O<sub>2</sub> ? 2 CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O      ?H = -1223 kJ/mol

The process of heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of ethylene was studied by P. A. Kilty and W. M. H. Sachtler, who suggested the following mechanism:<ref name="kilty">{{cite journal

Here (ads) refers to particles adsorbed on the catalyst surface and (adj) to particles of silver, directly adjacent to the oxygen atoms. In this process, 1,2-dichloroethane, vinyl chloride are used as inhibitors so as to prevent further oxidation of ethylene oxide to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. Here, the chemisorbed chlorine hinders dissociative chemisorption of atomic oxygen.

Thus the overall reaction is expressed as

:7 CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub> + 6 O<sub>2</sub> ? 6 (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + 2 CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O

and the maximum degree of conversion of ethylene to ethylene oxide is 6/7 or 85.7%.<ref name="kilty" />

The catalyst for the reaction is metallic silver deposited on various matrixes, including [[pumice]], [[silica gel]], various [[silicate]]s and [[aluminosilicate]]s, [[alumina]] and [[silicon carbide]], and activated by certain additives ([[antimony]], [[bismuth]], [[barium peroxide]], etc.).<ref name = "lebedev">{{cite book

Lower temperatures reduce the activity of the catalyst, and higher temperatures promote the complete oxidation of ethylene thereby reducing the yield of ethylene oxide. Elevated pressure of 1–3 MPa increases the productivity of the catalyst and facilitates absorption of ethylene oxide from the reacting gases.<ref name="lebedev" />

Whereas oxidation by air is still being used, oxygen (> 95% purity) is preferred for several reasons, such as higher molar yield of ethylene oxide (75–82% for oxygen vs. 63–75% for air), higher reaction rate (no gas dilution) and no need of separating nitrogen in the reaction products.<ref name="ect" /><ref>{{cite book

== Process overview ==
The production of ethylene oxide on a commercial scale is attained with the unification of the following [[Unit operations|unit processes]]:
*Main reactor
*Ethylene oxide [[scrubber]]
*Ethylene oxide de-sorber
*[[Stripping (chemistry)|Stripping]] and [[distillation column]]
*CO<sub>2</sub> scrubber and CO<sub>2</sub> de-scrubber

Main Reactor: The main reactor consists of thousands of catalyst tubes in bundles. These tubes are generally 6 to 15 m long with an inner diameter of 20 to 50&nbsp;mm. The catalyst packed in these tubes is in the form of spheres or rings of diameter 3 to 10&nbsp;mm. The operating conditions of 200<sup>o</sup>C to 300<sup>o</sup>C with a pressure of 1 to 3 MPa prevail in the reactor. To maintain this temperature, the cooling system of the reactor plays a vital role. With the aging of the catalyst, its selectivity decreases and it produces more exothermic side products of CO<sub>2</sub>.

Ethylene oxide scrubber: After the gaseous stream from the main reactor, containing ethylene oxide (1-2%) and CO<sub>2</sub> (5%), is cooled, it is then passed to the ethylene oxide scrubber. Here, water is used as the scrubbing media which scrubs away majority of ethylene oxide along with some amounts of CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and [[aldehydes]] (introduced by the recycle stream). Also, a small proportion of the gas leaving the ethylene oxide scrubber (0.1 – 0.2%) is removed continuously (combusted) to prevent the buildup of inert compounds (N<sub>2</sub>, Ar, and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), which are introduced as impurities with the reactants.

Ethylene oxide de-sorber: The aqueous stream resulting from the above scrubbing process is then sent to the ethylene oxide de-sorber. Here, ethylene oxide is obtained as the overhead product, whereas the bottom product obtained is known as the ‘glycol bleed’. When ethylene oxide is scrubbed from the recycle gas with an aqueous solution, ethylene glycols (viz. mono-ethylene glycol, di-ethylene glycol and other poly-ethylene glycols) get unavoidably produced. Thus, in-order to prevent them from building up in the system, they are continuously bled off.

Stripping and distillation column: Here, the ethylene oxide stream is stripped off its low boiling components and then distilled in-order to separate it into water and ethylene oxide.

CO<sub>2</sub> scrubber: The recycle stream obtained from the ethylene oxide scrubber is compressed and a side-stream is fed to the CO<sub>2</sub> scrubber. Here, CO<sub>2</sub> gets dissolved into the hot aqueous solution of potassium carbonate (i.e. the scrubbing media). The dissolution of CO<sub>2</sub> is not only a physical phenomenon, but a chemical phenomenon as well, for, the CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with potassium carbonate to produce potassium hydrogen carbonate.

K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O ? 2 KHCO<sub>3</sub>

CO<sub>2</sub> de-scrubber: The above potassium carbonate solution (enriched with CO<sub>2</sub>) is then sent to the CO<sub>2</sub> de-scrubber where CO<sub>2</sub> is de-scrubbed by stepwise (usually two steps) flashing. The first step is done to remove the hydrocarbon gases, and the second step is employed to strip off CO<sub>2</sub>.

==Applications==
[[File:Eo-usesEN.png|thumb|350px|Global industrial use of ethylene oxide in 2007.<ref name="iars" />]]

Ethylene oxide is one of the most important raw materials used in the large-scale chemical production. Most ethylene oxide is used for synthesis of [[ethylene glycol]]s, including diethylene glycol and triethylene glycol, that accounts for up to 75% of global consumption. Other important products include ethylene glycol ethers, ethanolamines and ethoxylates. Among glycols, ethylene glycol is used as [[antifreeze]], in the production of [[polyester]] and [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET – raw material for plastic bottles), liquid coolants and solvents.

Polyethyleneglycols are used in perfumes, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, [[lubricant]]s, [[paint thinner]]s and [[plasticizer]]s. Ethylene glycol ethers are part of brake fluids, detergents, solvents, lacquers and paints. Other products of ethylene oxide. Ethanolamines are used in the manufacture of soap and detergents and for purification of natural gas. Ethoxylates are reaction products of ethylene oxide with higher alcohols, acids or amines. They are used in the manufacture of detergents, surfactants, [[emulsifier]]s and [[dispersant]]s.<ref>{{cite web

=== Production of ethylene glycol ===
Ethylene glycol is industrially produced by non-catalytic hydration of ethylene oxide at a temperature of 200&nbsp;°C and a pressure of 1.5–2 MPa:<ref name="MEG">{{cite book

: (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + H<sub>2</sub>O ? HOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH

By-products of the reaction are diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol and polyglycols with the total of about 10%, which are separated from the ethylene glycol by distillation at reduced pressure.<ref>{{cite book

|accessdate = 2009-10-20}}</ref> Shell OMEGA technology (Only Mono-Ethylene Glycol Advantage) is a two-step synthesis of ethylene carbonate using a [[phosphonium]] halide as a catalyst. The glycol yield is 99–99.5%, with other glycols practically absent. The main advantage of the process is production of pure ethylene glycol without the need for further purification. The first commercial plant which uses this method was opened in 2008 in South Korea.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090514033943/http://www.shell.com/home/content/chemicals/innovation/leading_edge_technology/omega_delivers_ethylene_glycol/omega_delivers_ethylene_glycol.html OMEGA delivers for ethylene glycol makers], Shell (October 2008).</ref> Dow METEOR (Most Effective Technology for Ethylene Oxide Reactions) is an integrated technology for producing ethylene oxide and its subsequent hydrolysis into ethylene glycol. The glycol yield is 90–93%. The main advantage of the process is relative simplicity, using fewer stages and less equipment.

=== Production of glycol ethers ===
The major industrial esters of mono-, di- and triethylene glycols are methyl, ethyl and normal butyl ethers, as well as their acetates and phthalates. The synthesis involves reaction of the appropriate [[alcohol]] with ethylene oxide:<ref>{{cite book

=== Production of ethanolamines ===
In the industry, [[ethanolamine]]s (mono-, di- and triethanolamines) are produced by reacting [[ammonia]] and ethylene oxide in anhydrous medium at a temperature of 40–70&nbsp;°C and pressure of 1.5–3.5 MPa:<ref>{{cite web

All three ethanolamines are produced in the process, while ammonia and part of methylamine are recycled. The final products are separated by vacuum [[distillation]]. Hydroxyalkylamines are produced in a similar process:

:(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + RNH<sub>2</sub> ? HOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NHR

:2 (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + RNH<sub>2</sub> ? (HOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NR

Monosubstituted products are formed by reacting a large excess of amine with ethylene oxide in presence of water and at a temperature below 100&nbsp;°C. Disubstituted products are obtained with a small excess of ethylene oxide, at a temperature of 120–140&nbsp;°C and a pressure of 0.3–0.5 MPa.<ref>{{cite book

=== Production of ethoxylates ===
<!-- [[File:Alkoxylation process.png|thumb|left|550px|Schematic image of the production ethoxylates <ref name="buss" />]] -->
Industrial production of ethoxylates is realized by a direct reaction of higher alcohols, acids or amines with ethylene oxide in the presence of an alkaline catalyst at a temperature of 120–180&nbsp;°C. Modern plants producing ethoxylates are usually based on the BUSS LOOP reactors technology,<ref name="buss">{{cite book

In the first stage, the initiator or catalyst of the reaction and the feedstock are fed into the container, where they are mixed, heated and vacuum dried. Then reaction is carried out in a special insulated reactor in an inert atmosphere (nitrogen) to prevent a possible explosion of ethylene oxide. Finally, the reaction mixture is neutralized, degassed and purified.<ref>{{cite web

=== Production of acrylonitrile ===
Currently, most [[acrylonitrile]] (90% in 2008) is produced by the SOHIO method, which is based on the catalytic oxidation of [[propylene]] in the presence of ammonia and bismuth phosphomolybdate. However, until 1960 a key production process was addition of [[hydrogen cyanide]] to ethylene oxide, followed by dehydration of the resulting [[cyanohydrin]]:<ref name="ACS Landmarks">{{cite web |url = http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/acrylonitrile/index.htm |title = The Sohio Acrylonitrile Process |publisher = American Chemical Society |work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks |accessdate= June 25, 2012}}</ref>

==Identification of ethylene oxide==
[[Gas chromatography]] is the principal method for analysis and detection of ethylene oxide.<ref name="iars" />

An inexpensive test for ethylene oxide exploits its precipitation of solids hydroxides of metals when it is passed through aqueous solutions of their salts:

:2 (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)O + MnCl<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O ? 2 HO–CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>–Cl + Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>?

Similarly, ethylene oxide is detected by the bright pink color of the indicator when passing air through aqueous solutions of some salts of sodium or potassium (chlorides, iodides, thiosulfates, etc.) with the addition of [[phenolphthalein]]:<ref name="oe4">{{cite book

Other methods of ethylene oxide detection are<ref name="oe4" /> color reactions with [[pyridine]] derivatives and hydrolysis of ethylene glycol with [[periodic acid]]. The produced [[iodic acid]] is detected with [[silver nitrate]].

==Fire and explosion hazards==
Ethylene oxide is extremely flammable and its mixtures with air are explosive. When heated, it may rapidly expand causing fire and explosion.<ref>{{cite web

Fires caused by ethylene oxide are extinguished by traditional media, including [[Fire retardant foam|foam]], carbon dioxide or water. Suppression of this activity can be done by blanketing with an [[inert gas]] until total pressure reaches non explosive range. Extinguishing of burning ethylene oxide is complicated by that it can continue burning in an inert atmosphere and in water solutions. Fire suppression is reached only upon dilution with water above 22:1.<ref>{{cite web

==Physiological effects==

===Effect on microorganisms===
The disinfectant effect of ethylene oxide is similar to that of sterilization by heat, but because of limited penetration, it affects only the surface. The Sterility Assurance Level, after a certain specified exposure to ethylene oxide is 10<sup>?6</sup>, meaning that the chance of finding a single bacterium is below 1 per million.<ref>{{cite web

Results of human epidemiological studies on workers exposed to ethylene oxide differ. There is evidence from both human and animal studies that inhalation exposure to ethylene oxide can result in a wide range of carcinogenic effects.

Ethylene oxide is toxic by inhalation with an U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] permissible exposure limit calculated as a TWA (time weighted average) over 8 hours of 1 ppm, and a short term exposure limit (excursion limit) calculated as a TWA over 15 minutes of 5 ppm. [29 CFR 19101.1048]. At concentrations in the air about 200 parts per million, ethylene oxide irritates [[mucous membrane]]s of the nose and throat; higher contents cause damage to the trachea and bronchi, progressing into the partial collapse of the lungs. High concentrations can cause [[pulmonary edema]] and damage the cardiovascular system; the damaging effect of ethylene oxide may occur only after 72 hours after exposure.<ref name="atsdr" /> The maximum content of ethylene oxide in the air according to the U.S. standards ([[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists|ACGIH]]) is 1.8&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>.<ref>{{cite book

Because the odor threshold for ethylene oxide varies between 250 and 700 ppm, the gas will already be at toxic concentrations when it can be smelled. Even then, the odor of ethylene oxide is sweet, aromatic, and can easily be mistaken for the pleasant aroma of [[diethyl ether]], a common laboratory solvent of very low toxicity.

Ethylene oxide causes acute poisoning, accompanied by a variety of symptoms.<ref name = "ChemAnalitica11" />
Central nervous system effects are frequently associated with human exposure to ethylene oxide in occupational settings. Headache, nausea and vomiting have been reported for more than fifty years. Peripheral neuropathy, impaired hand-eye coordination and memory loss have been reported in more recent case studies of chronically-exposed workers at estimated average exposure levels as low as 3 ppm (with possible short-term peaks as high as 700 ppm).[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp137.pdf Toxicological Profile For Ethylene Oxide, U.S. Public Health Service]
The metabolism of ethylene oxide is not completely known. Data from animal studies indicate two possible pathways for the metabolism of ethylene oxide: hydrolysis to ethylene glycol and glutathione conjugation to form mercapturic acid and meththio-metabolites.

Ethylene oxide easily penetrates through the clothing and footwear, causing skin irritation and dermatitis with the formation of blisters, fever and [[leukocytosis]].<ref name="ChemAnalitica11" />

The [[median lethal dose]]s (LD<sub>50</sub>, or a dose required to kill half the members of a tested population after a certain time) for ethylene oxide are 72&nbsp;mg/kg (rat, oral) and 187&nbsp;mg/kg (rat, [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] injection).<ref name="msds">{{cite web

'''St Catharine’s College''' is a [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge|constituent college]] of the [[University of Cambridge]]. Founded in 1473, the college is often referred to informally by the [[nickname]] "'''Catz'''". The college is located in the historic city-centre of Cambridge, and lies just south of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] and lies across the street from [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge| Corpus Christi College]]. The college is notable for its open court (rather than closed [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]]) that faces towards [[Trumpington Street]]. 

St Catharine’s is unique in being the only [[Oxbridge]] College founded by the serving head of another College. <ref>{{cite web|title=St Catharine's College, University of Cambridge: Your Paintings|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/galleries/locations/st-catharines-college-university-of-cambridge-7176|website=BBC|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref>

The college community is moderately sized, consisting of approximately 70 [[fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|fellows]], 150 graduate students, and 410 undergraduates.<ref>http://www.caths.cam.ac.uk/home/?m=page&id=1</ref> As of 2013, the college's endowment stands at £48.3 million, placing the college 18th out of all the University's colleges. <ref>http://www.caths.cam.ac.uk/home/?m=page&id=238</ref>

==History==
===Foundation===
[[File:Historical plan of St Catharine's College, Cambridge (1897) - cambridgedescri00atkiuoft 0498.png|thumb|upright|left|Historical plan of St Catharine's College]]
[[Robert Woodlark]], Provost of [[King's College, Cambridge|King’s College]], had begun preparations for the founding of a new college as early as 1459 when he bought tenements on which the new college could be built. The preparation cost him a great deal of his private fortune (he was suspected of diverting King’s College funds), and he was forced to scale down the foundation to only three Fellows. He stipulated that they must study [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] only. The college was established as "Katharine Hall" in 1473. The college received its Royal Charter of Incorporation in 1475 from [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]]. Wodelarke may have chosen the name in homage to the mother of [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] who was called Catharine, although it is more likely that it was named as part of the [[Renaissance]] cult of St Catharine, who was a patron saint of learning. At any rate, the college was ready for habitation and formally founded on St Catharine’s day (November 25) 1473. There are six Saints Catharine, but the college was named for [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catharine of Alexandria]].<ref>http://www.caths.cam.ac.uk/home/?m=page&id=23</ref>

[[File:St.Catharines.JPG|thumb|left|St Catharine’s, as seen from [[Trumpington Street]]]]
The initial foundation was not well-provided for. Wodelarke was principally interested in the welfare of Fellows and the College had no undergraduates at all for many years. By 1550, however, there was an increasing number of junior students and the focus of the College changed to that of teaching undergraduates.

===Expansion and modern day===
As the College entered the 17th century, it was still one of the smallest Colleges in Cambridge. However, a series of prudent Masters and generous benefactors were to change the fortunes of the College and expand its size. Rapid growth in the fellowship and undergraduate population made it necessary to expand the college, and short-lived additions were made in 1622. By 1630 the College began to demolish its existing buildings which were decaying, and started work a new court. In 1637 the College came into possession of the George Inn (later the Bull Inn) on [[Trumpington Street]]. Behind this Inn was a stables which was already famous for the practice of its manager, [[Thomas Hobson]], not to allow a hirer to take any horse other than the one longest in the stable, leading to the expression “[[Hobson's choice]]”, meaning no choice at all. 

The period of 1675 to 1757 saw the redevelopment of the college's site into a large three-sided court, one of only four at Oxbridge colleges; the others are at Jesus and Downing at Cambridge and [[Worcester College, Oxford|Worcester]], St Catharine’s sister college, at Oxford. Proposals for a range of buildings to complete the fourth side of the court have been made on many occasions. <ref>
http://www.caths.cam.ac.uk/assets/uploadedfiles/downloads/MainCourt.pdf</ref>

The college was granted new statutes in 1860 and adopted its current name. In 1880, a movement to merge the college with [[King's College, Cambridge|King’s College]] began. The two colleges were adjacent and it seemed a solution to King’s need for more rooms and St Catharine’s need for a more substantial financial basis. However, the Master ([[Charles Kirkby Robinson]]) was opposed and St Catharine’s eventually refused.

In 1966 a major rebuilding project took place under the Mastership of Professor E. E. Rich. This saw the creation of a new larger hall, new kitchens and an accommodation block shared between St Catharine's and King's College. Pressure on accommodation continued to grow, and in 1981 further accommodation was built at St. Chad's on [[Grange Road]], with further rooms added there in 1998. In 2013 the College completed the building of a new lecture theatre, College bar and JCR. <ref>http://www.caths.cam.ac.uk/home/?m=page&id=23</ref>

In 1979, the membership of the college was broadened to welcome female students, and in 2006 the first woman was appointed as Master of the college, [[Jean Thomas (academic)|Dame Jean Thomas]].

A history of the college was written by W.H.S. Jones in 1936.<ref>W.H.S. Jones, 1936, ''A history of St Catharine's College'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 414 pp</ref>

The academic reputation of colleges within Cambridge is hotly disputed and often difficult to determine. Historically, St Catharine's position has been unexceptional and in the controversial annual league table of colleges placed towards the middle. In recent years, however, the academic reputation of the college has markedly improved and the college was placed at the top of the [[Tompkins Table]], which ranks the colleges by the class of degrees obtained by their undergraduates, for the first time in 2005. Between 1997 and 2010, the college averaged 9th of the 29 colleges. In 2014 its position slipped to 21st.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/tompkins-table-2014-trinity-college-cambridge-produces-record-number-of-firsts-9621501.html|title=Tompkins Table 2014: Trinity College Cambridge produces record number of firsts |publisher=www.independent.co.uk|date=22 July 2014|accessdate=5 October 2014|last=Garner|first=Richard}}</ref>

==Student life==

The College maintains a friendly rivalry with [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens’ College]] after the construction of the main court of St Catharine's College on Cambridge’s former High Street relegated one side of Queens' College into a back alley. A more modern rivalry with [[Robinson College]] resulted from the construction in the 1970s of a modern block of flats named St Chad’s (in which the rooms are octagonal to resemble the wheel on the college crest) by the [[Cambridge University Library|University Library]]. 

The College is known for its reputation in hockey and racquet sports, in part due to its facilities for these sports including grass tennis courts and an astroturf hockey pitch. [[St. Catharine's College Boat Club (Cambridge)|St. Catharine's College Boat Club]], the college boat club, hosts the Cardinals Regatta each year, in which teams compete along a short course in fancy dress with an emphasis on bribery to secure victory. The college's Boat Club is moderately strong, with both Men's and Women's 1st boats generally residing in the middle of the 1st division of the [[May Bumps]] races.

The College hosts several other notable societies. The Shirley Society is the College literary society, the oldest in Cambridge, it regularly hosts significant figures from the arts world throughout the academic year. The College based girls' choir is the first of its kind in a UK university and is composed of girls aged 8–14 from local schools.

'''Robert Rauschenberg''' (October 22, 1925 – May 12, 2008) was an American painter and graphic artist whose early works anticipated the [[pop art]] movement. Rauschenberg is well known for his "[[Combine painting|Combines]]" of the 1950s, in which non-traditional materials and objects were employed in innovative combinations. Rauschenberg was both a painter and a sculptor and the Combines are a combination of both, but he also worked with [[photography]], [[printmaking]], [[papermaking]], and performance.<ref name="Retrospective">

Rauschenberg is also survived by his son, photographer Christopher Rauschenberg, and his sister, Janet Begneaud.

==Artistic contribution==
Rauschenberg's approach was sometimes called "[[Neo-Dada|Neo Dadaist]]," a label he shared with the painter [[Jasper Johns]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/10/arts/art-in-review-021995.html|title=Art in Review|author=Roberta Smith|publisher=''New York Times''|date=1995-02-10|accessdate=2009-03-20}}</ref> Rauschenberg was quoted as saying that he wanted to work "in the gap between art and life" suggesting he questioned the distinction between art objects and everyday objects, reminiscent of the issues raised by the "[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]", by [[Dada]] pioneer, [[Marcel Duchamp]]. At the same time, Johns' paintings of numerals, flags, and the like, were reprising Duchamp's message of the role of the observer in creating art's meaning.

Alternatively, in 1961, Rauschenberg took a step in what could be considered the opposite direction by championing the role of ''creator'' in creating art's meaning. Rauschenberg was invited to participate in an exhibition at the [[Galerie Iris Clert]], where artists were to create and display a portrait of the owner, [[Iris Clert]]. Rauschenberg's submission consisted of a telegram sent to the gallery declaring "This is a portrait of Iris Clert if I say so."
[[Image:Rauschenberg3.JPG|thumb|right|Robert Rauschenberg, ''Riding Bikes'', [[Berlin, Germany]], 1998.]]

From the fall of 1952 to the spring of 1953 Rauschenberg traveled through Europe and [[North Africa]] with his fellow artist and partner [[Cy Twombly]]. In [[Morocco]], he created collages and boxes out of trash. He took them back to [[Italy]] and exhibited them at galleries in [[Rome]] and [[Florence]]. A lot of them sold; those that did not he threw into the river [[Arno]].<ref name="Rauschenberg's Epic Vision">John Richardson (September 1997), [http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/archive/1997/09/rauschenberg199709 Rauschenberg’s Epic Vision] ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.</ref> From his stay, 38 collages survived.<ref>[[Holland Cotter]] (June 28, 2012), [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/arts/design/robert-rauschenberg-north-african-collages-and-scatole-personali-c-1952.html Robert Rauschenberg: ‘North African Collages and Scatole Personali, c. 1952’] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> In a famously cited incident of 1953, Rauschenberg erased a drawing by [[Willem de Kooning|de Kooning]], which he obtained from his colleague for the express purpose of erasing it as an artistic statement. The result is titled ''[[Erased de Kooning Drawing]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.sfmoma.org/multimedia/interactive_features/78 |title=Explore Modern Art &#124; Multimedia &#124; Interactive Features &#124; Robert Rauschenberg's Erased de Kooning Drawing |publisher=SFMOMA |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Robert Rauschenberg Dead at 82 | publisher=BLOUINARTINFO  | date= May 13, 2008| url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/27563/robert-rauschenberg-dead-at-82| accessdate=2008-05-14 }}</ref> 

By 1962, Rauschenberg's paintings were beginning to incorporate not only found objects but found images as well - photographs transferred to the canvas by means of the [[silkscreen]] process. Previously used only in commercial applications, silkscreen allowed Rauschenberg to address the multiple reproducibility of images, and the consequent flattening of experience that implies. In this respect, his work is contemporaneous with that of [[Andy Warhol]], and both Rauschenberg and Johns are frequently cited as important forerunners of American [[Pop Art]].

In 1966, [[Billy Klüver]] and Rauschenberg officially launched [[Experiments in Art and Technology]] (E.A.T.) a non-profit organization established to promote collaborations between artists and engineers.<ref>Kristine Stiles & Peter Selz, ''Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings'' (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, p. 453</ref>

In 1969, [[NASA]] invited Rauschenberg to witness the launch of [[Apollo&nbsp;11]]. In response to this landmark event, Rauschenberg created his ''Stoned Moon Series'' of [[lithographs]]. This involved combining diagrams and other images from NASA's archives with photographs from various media outlets, as well as with his own work.<ref>{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=235}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Signs of the Times: Robert Rauschenberg’s America|url=http://www.mmoca.org/exhibitions/exhibitdetails/signsofthetimes/index.php|publisher=[[Madison Museum of Contemporary Art]]|accessdate=27 January 2012}}</ref>

{{As of|2003}} he worked from his home and studio in [[Captiva, Florida|Captiva]], [[Florida]]. His first project on Captiva Island was a 16.5-meter-long silkscreen print called ''Currents'' (1970), made with newspapers from the first two months of the year, followed by ''Cardboards'' (1970–71) and Early Egyptians (1973–74), the latter of which is a series of wall reliefs and sculptures constructed from used boxes. He also printed on textiles using his solvent-transfer technique to make the ''Hoarfrosts'' (1974–76) and ''Spreads'' (1975–82), and in the ''Jammers'' (1975–76), created a series of colorful silk wall and floor works. ''Urban Bourbons'' (1988–95) focused on different methods of transferring images onto a variety of reflective metals, such as steel and aluminum. In addition, throughout the 1990s, Rauschenberg continued to utilize new materials while still working with more rudimentary techniques, such as wet fresco, as in the ''Arcadian Retreat'' (1996) series, and the transfer of images by hand, as in the ''Anagrams'' (1995–2000). As part of his engagement with the latest technological innovations, he began making digital Iris prints and using biodegradable vegetable dyes in his transfer processes, underscoring his commitment to caring for the environment.<ref name="Robert Rauschenberg">[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name=Robert%20Rauschenberg Robert Rauschenberg] Guggenheim Collection.</ref>

[[Image:Robert Rauschenberg's untitled 'combine', 1963.jpg|thumb|left|Robert Rauschenberg, untitled "combine," 1963.]]
In 1951 Rauschenberg created his "White Paintings," in the tradition of [[Monochrome painting|monochromatic painting]], whose purpose was to reduce painting to its most essential nature, and to subsequently lead to the possibility of pure experience.<ref name="guggenheimcollection.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/3518 |title=Pop art - Rauschenberg - Untitled (Red Painting) |publisher=Guggenheim Collection |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}</ref> The "White Paintings" were shown at Eleanor Ward's [[Stable Gallery]] in New York during October 1953.

However, one commentator said that "…rather than thinking of them as destructive reductions, it might be more productive to see them, as [[John Cage]] did, as hypersensitive screens – what Cage suggestively described as 'airports of the lights, shadows and particles.' In front of them, the smallest adjustments in lighting and atmosphere might be registered on their surface.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cage|first=John|title=Silence|year=1961|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|pages=102}}</ref>
Rauschenberg himself said that they were affected by ambient conditions, "so you could almost tell how many people are in the room".
The ''Black Paintings '' of 1951 like the White Paintings were executed on multiple panels and were single colour works. Here Rauschenberg incorporated pieces of newspaper into the painting working the paper into the paint so that sometimes newspaper could be seen and in other places could not. By 1953-1954 Rauschenberg had moved from the  monochromatic paintings of the White Painting and Black Painting series, to the Red Painting series.  These paintings were created with diverse kinds of paint  applications of red paint, and with the addition of materials such as wood, nails, newsprint and other materials to the canvas created complex painting surfaces, and were forerunners of Rauschenberg's well-known ''Combine'' series.<ref name="guggenheimcollection.org"/>

===Combines===

Rauschenberg picked up trash and found objects that interested him on the streets of New York City and brought these back to his studio where they could become integrated into his work. He claimed he "wanted something other than what I could make myself and I wanted to use the surprise and the collectiveness and the generosity of finding surprises. And if it wasn't a surprise at first, by the time I got through with it, it was.  So the object itself was changed by its context and therefore it became a new thing."<ref>"http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/9117/rosetta-brooks-interviews-robert-rauschenberg.</ref>

Rauschenberg's comment concerning the gap between art and life can be seen as a statement which provides the departure point for an understanding of his contributions as an artist. In particular his series of works which he called Combines served as instances in which the delineated boundaries between art and sculpture were broken down so that both were present in a single work of art. Technically "Combines" refers to Rauschenberg's work from 1954 to 1962, but the artist had begun collaging newsprint and photographic materials in his work and the impetus to combine both painting materials and everyday objects such as clothing, urban debris, and taxidermied animals such as in ''[[Monogram (artwork)|Monogram]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lukechueh.com/paintings/monogram.html |title=Robert Rauschenberg - Monogram |publisher=Lukechueh.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}</ref> continued throughout his artistic life.

His transitional pieces that led to the creation of Combines were ''Charlene'' (1954) and ''Collection'' (1954) where he combined collage technique and started to incorporate objects such as scarves, comic strips, and faux architectural [[cornice]] pieces. Considered one of the first of the Combines, ''Bed'' (1955) was created by dripping red paint across a quilt. The quilt was later stretched and displayed as a work of art. Some critics according to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' considered the work to be a symbol for violence and [[rape]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1953011/Robert-Rauschenberg.htmlRauschenberg]"Telegraph.co.uk" | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

Critics originally viewed the Combines in terms of the formal aspects of art, shape, color, texture, and the composition and arrangement of these. This 1960s view has changed over time so that more recently critics and [[art historian]]s see the Combines as carrying coded messages difficult to decipher because there is no apparent order to the presentation of the objects.

===Performance and dance===
From the early 1950s until 2007 Rauschenberg designed for dance. He began designing sets and costumes for [[Merce Cunningham]], [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]], and [[Trisha Brown]] and for his own productions.<ref name="Kimmelman"/> In the 1960s he was involved in the radical dance-theater experiments at and around [[Judson Memorial Church]] in [[Greenwich Village]] and was close to Cunningham-connected experimentalists like [[Carolyn Brown (choreographer)|Carolyn Brown]], [[Viola Farber]], and [[Steve Paxton]]; he even [[choreograph]]ed himself. Rauschenberg's full-time connection to the Cunningham company ended with its 1964 world tour.<ref>Alastair Macaulay (May 14, 2008), [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/14/arts/dance/14coll.html Rauschenberg and Dance, Partners for Life ] ''[[New York Times]]''</ref> In 1977 Rauschenberg, Cunningham, and Cage reconnected as collaborators for the first time in 13 years, when the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, New York, performed Travelogue (1977), for which Rauschenberg contributed the costume and set designs.<ref name="Robert Rauschenberg"/>

===Commissions===
In 1965, when ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine commissioned him to visualize a modern Inferno, he did not hesitate to vent his rage at the [[Vietnam War]] and a whole range of horrors, including racial violence, [[neo-Nazism]], political assassinations, and ecological disaster.<ref name="Rauschenberg's Epic Vision"/> On December 30, 1979 the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' printed 650,000 Rauschenbergs as the cover of its Sunday magazine, ''[[Tropic (magazine)|Tropic]]''. In essence an original lithograph, it showed images of south Florida. The artist signed 150 of them.<ref>Patricia Burstein (May 19, 1980), [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20076514,00.html In His Art and Life, Robert Rauschenberg Is a Man Who Steers His Own Daring Course] ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''.</ref>

In 1983, he won a [[Grammy Award]] for his album design of [[Talking Heads]]' album ''[[Speaking in Tongues (Talking Heads album)|Speaking in Tongues]]''.<ref>Richard Lacayo (May 15, 2008), [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1806817,00.html Robert Rauschenberg: The Wild and Crazy Guy] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.</ref> In 1986 Rauschenberg was commissioned by [[BMW]] to paint a full size [[BMW E24|BMW 635 CSi]] for the sixth installment of the famed [[BMW Art Car Project]]. Rauschenberg's contribution was the first to include the wheels in the project, as well as incorporating previous works of art into the design. In 1998, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] commissioned (and later refused)<ref name="Robert Rauschenberg"/> a work by Rauschenberg based on the Apocalypse to commemorate [[Pio of Pietrelcina]], the controversial Franciscan priest who died in 1968 and who is revered for having had stigmata and a saintly aura, at [[Renzo Piano]]'s [[Padre Pio Pilgrimage Church]] in Foggia, Italy.<ref>John Richardson (September 1997), [http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/archive/1997/09/rauschenberg199709 Rauschenberg’s Epic Vision] ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]].</ref>

==Exhibitions==
In 1951 Rauschenberg had his first one-man show at the [[Betty Parsons]] Gallery<ref>The New York Times, May 14, 1951,</ref> and in 1954 had a second one-man show at the [[Charles Egan Gallery]].<ref>Stuart Preston, New York Times, December 19, 1954</ref> In 1955, at the Charles Egan Gallery,  Rauschenberg showed ''Bed'' (1955), one of his first and certainly most famous Combines.<ref>{{cite web|author=Willem de Kooning |url=http://www.theartstory.org/gallery-egan-charles.htm |title=Gallery - The Charles Egan Gallery |publisher=The Art Story |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}</ref>

Rauschenberg had his first career retrospective, organized by the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]], New York, in 1963, and in 1964 he was the first American artist to win the Grand Prize at the [[Venice Biennale]] ([[Mark Tobey]] and [[James McNeill Whistler|James Whistler]] had previously won the Painting Prize). After that time, he enjoyed a rare degree of institutional support. A retrospective organized by the National Collection of Fine Arts (now the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]), Washington, D.C., traveled throughout the United States in 1976 and 1978.<ref name="Robert Rauschenberg"/> A retrospective at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York (1997), traveled to Houston, Cologne, and Bilbao (through 1999). Recent exhibitions were presented at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York (2005; traveled to [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]], [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris, and [[Moderna Museet]], Stockholm, through 2007); at the [[Peggy Guggenheim Collection]], Venice (2009; traveled to the [[Tinguely Museum]], Basel, Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and Villa e Collezione Panza, Varese, through 2010); and Inverleith House, [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh|Royal Botanic Garden]], Edinburgh (2011).<ref>[http://www.gagosian.com/artists/robert-rauschenberg Robert Rauschenberg] [[Gagosian Gallery]].</ref>
 
A memorial exhibition of Rauschenberg's photographs opened October 22, 2008, (on the occasion of what would have been his 83rd birthday) at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]].<ref>[http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&int_new=26812 Art Daily, ''Guggenheim Museum Honors Late Artist Robert Rauschenberg With Photographic Tribute'', retrieved December 16, 2008]</ref>

==Legacy==
Already in 1984, Rauschenberg announced his Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange (ROCI) at the [[United Nations]]. This would culminate in a seven-year, ten-country tour to encourage "world peace and understanding", through Mexico, Chile, Venezuela, Beijing, Lhasa (Tibet), Japan, Cuba, Soviet Union, Berlin, and Malaysia in which he left a piece of art, and was influenced by the cultures he visited. Paintings, often on reflective surfaces, as well as drawings, photographs, assemblages and other multimedia were produced, inspired by these surroundings, and this was considered some of his strongest works. The ROCI venture, supported by the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C., went on view in 1991.

In 1990, Rauschenberg created the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation (RFF) to promote awareness of the causes he cared about, such as world peace, the environment and humanitarian issues. He also set up Change,&nbsp;Inc., to award one-time grants of up to $1,000 to visual artists based on financial need. Rauschenberg's will, filed in [[Probate Court]] on October 9, 2008, named his charitable foundation as a major beneficiary, along with Darryl Pottorf, Christopher Rauschenberg, Begneaud, his nephew Byron Richard Begneaud, and [[Susan Weil|Susan Weil Kirschenbaum]]. The amounts to be given to the beneficiaries were not named, but the estate is "worth millions", said Pottorf, who is also executor of the estate.<ref>[http://www.news-press.com/article/20081009/NEWS0124/810090347/1075 Rauschenberg will names charitable causes, family]</ref> 

The RRF today owns many works by Rauschenberg from every period of his career. In 2011, the foundation, in collaboration with [[Gagosian Gallery]], presented "The Private Collection of Robert Rauschenberg", selections from Rauschenberg's personal art collection; proceeds from the collection helped fund the endowment established for the foundation's philanthropic activities.<ref>[http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/the-collection-of-robert-rauschenberg--november-03-2011 The Private Collection of Robert Rauschenberg, November 3 - December 23, 2011] [[Gagosian Gallery]].</ref> Also in 2011, the foundation launched its "Artist as Activist" print project and invited [[Shepard Fairey]] to focus on an issue of his choice. The editioned work he made was sold to raise funds for the [[Coalition for the Homeless]].<ref>Cristina Ruiz (28 March 2012), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Rauschenbergs-foundation-could-outspend-Warhols/26110 Rauschenberg’s foundation could outspend Warhol’s] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.</ref> The RRF artist residency takes place at the late artist's property in [[Captiva Island]], Florida. The foundation also maintains the 19th Street Project Space in New York.

In 2000, Rauschenberg was honored with [[amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research|amfAR]]’s Award of Excellence for Artistic Contributions to the Fight Against AIDS.<ref>[http://amfar.org/in-the-spotlight/amfar-awards/award-of-excellence-for-artistic-contributions-to-the-fight-against-aids/ Award of Excellence for Artistic Contributions to the Fight Against AIDS] [[amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research]].</ref>

==Art market==
Robert Rauschenberg had his first solo show in 1951, at the [[Betty Parsons|Betty Parsons Gallery]] in New York.<ref>Michael McNay (13 May 2008), [http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/may/13/art Obituary: Robert Rauschenberg] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref> Later, only  after much urging from his wife, [[Ileana Sonnabend]], did [[Leo Castelli]] finally organize a solo show for Rauschenberg in the late 1950s.<ref>Andrew Russeth (June 7, 2010), [http://www.blouinartinfo.com/market-news/article/34827-ten-juicy-tales-from-the-new-leo-castelli-biography Ten Juicy Tales from the New Leo Castelli Biography] ''BLOUINARTINFO''</ref> The Rauschenberg estate was long handled by [[Pace Gallery]] before, in May 2010,<ref>Carol Vogel (September 29, 2010), [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/29/pace-gallery-secures-de-kooning-estate/ Pace Gallery to Represent de Kooning Estate] ''[[New York Times]]''</ref> it moved to [[Gagosian Gallery]], a dealership that had first exhibited the artist's work in 1986.<ref>[http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/robert-rauschenberg--february-16-2013 Robert Rauschenberg: Jammers, February 16 - March 28, 2013] [[Gagosian Gallery]], London.</ref> In 2010 ''Studio Painting'' (1960?61), one of Rauschenberg's "Combines", originally estimated at $6&nbsp;million to $9&nbsp;million, was bought from the collection of [[Michael Crichton]] for $11&nbsp;million at [[Christie's]], New York.<ref>Carol Vogel (May 12, 2010), [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E7DD103BF931A25756C0A9669D8B63 At Christie's, a $28.6&nbsp;Million Bid Sets a Record for Johns] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>
 
===Lobbying for Artists' Resale Royalties===
In the early 1970s, Rauschenberg unsuccessfully lobbied [[U.S. Congress]] to pass a bill that would compensate artists when their work is resold. The artist later supported a state bill in California that did become law, the [[California Resale Royalty Act]] of 1976.<ref>Jori Finkel (February 6, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/blogs/Lessons-of-Californias-droit-de-suite-debacle/31771 Jori Finkel: Lessons of California’s droit de suite debacle] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.</ref> Rauschenberg took up his fight for artist resale royalties after the taxi baron Robert Scull sold part of his art collection in a 1973 auction, including Rauschenberg's 1958 painting ''Thaw'' that he had originally sold to Scull for $900 but brought $85,000 at an auction at [[Sotheby's|Sotheby Parke Bernet]] in New York.<ref>Patricia Cohen (November 1, 2011), [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/arts/design/artists-file-suit-against-sothebys-christies-and-ebay.html Artists File Lawsuits, Seeking Royalties] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

The '''Mên-an-Tol''' (also '''Men an Toll''') is a small formation of [[standing stone]]s  in [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]] ({{gbmapping|SW426349}}). It is about three miles northwest of Madron. It is also known locally as the "Crick Stone".

==Location==
The Mên-an-Tol stands near the [[Madron]] to [[Morvah]] road in [[Cornwall]]. Other antiquities in the vicinity include the [[Mên Scryfa]] inscribed stone about 300 metres to the north, and the [[Boskednan stone circle]] less than 1 kilometre to the northeast.

==Etymology==
The name Mên-an-Tol in the [[Cornish Language]] literally means "the hole stone".

==Description==
The Mên-an-Tol consists of three upright [[granite]] stones: a round stone with its middle holed out with two standing stones to each side, in front of and behind the hole. When seen at an angle from one side, the stones form a three-dimensional "101".

The two side stones are both about 1.2 metres high. The westernmost stone was moved and brought into a straight line with the other two stones sometime after 1815.<ref name="pastscape">[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=424271 MEN AN TOL], Pastscape, retrieved 9 November 2013</ref> The holed stone is roughly octagonal in outline. It is 1.3 metres wide and 1.1 metres high; the circular hole is 0.5 m in diameter.<ref name="pastscape"/> The only other holed stone in Cornwall of this type is the [[Tolven Holed Stone]] which can seen in a garden near [[Helston]].

There is one other standing stone nearby, and six recumbent stones, some of which are buried.<ref name="pastscape"/> A [[cairn]] exists as a low stony mound just to the southeast. There are two other early Bronze Age barrows or cairns between 120 and 150 metres to the north.<ref name="pastscape"/>

==Interpretation==
The Mên-an-Tol is thought to date to either the late [[Neolithic British Isles|Neolithic]] or early [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]]. The holed stone could originally have been a natural occurrence rather than deliberately sculpted.<ref name="pastscape"/>

The distribution of the stones around the site has led to the suggestion that the monument is actually part of a [[stone circle]].<ref name="pastscape"/> If so, then it is likely that the stones have been rearranged at some point, and the two standing stones either side of the holed stone may have been moved from their original positions.<ref name="pastscape"/> It has also been suggested that the holed stone could have been a capstone for the nearby cairn before being moved to its present position.<ref name="pastscape"/>

==History==
[[File:Menantolborlase.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing and plan by W. Borlase, 1769]]
[[File:Churches of West Cornwall 04.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing by J. T. Blight, 1864]]
In 1749 the site was first archaeologically investigated by [[William Borlase]], who also drew a plan. This shows that the megaliths were not in a line like today, but formed an angle of about 135°. Borlase also reported that farmers had taken away some stones from the area. From him comes the first written record of the myths and rituals.<ref>William Borlase, (1769), ''Antiquities Historical and Monumental of the County of Cornwall'', Bowyer and Nichols, London</ref>

In the 19th Century the local antiquary [[John Thomas Blight]] published several drawings of the site, and made the first suggestion that the stones could be the remains of a stone circle.<ref>John Thomas Blight, (1864), ''A week at the Land's End, 1861, Churches of West Cornwall''</ref> In 1872 [[William Copeland Borlase]], a descendant of the earlier Borlase, gave a more detailed description of the area.<ref>William Copeland Borlase, (1872), ''Naenia Cornubiae'', Longmans</ref>

In 1932 [[Hugh O'Neill Hencken]] wrote the first modern archaeological report. He believed that the position of the stones was not the prehistoric arrangement, but had been significantly changed. He also thought that the holed stone might be part of a destroyed tomb. He was even told that local farmers with back or limb complaints would crawl through the hole to relieve their pain.<ref>Hugh O'Neill Hencken, (1932), ''The Archaeology of Cornwall and Scilly'', Metheun</ref>

In 1993, the Cornwall ''Historic Environment Service'' published a detailed report with the latest research results. They suggested that the standing stones originated from a stone circle which consisted of 18 to 20 stones. The holed stone, however, could be part of a nearby portal tomb. It also possible that the holed stone stood at the center of the stone circle and served to frame specific points on the horizon. Such a use of a holed stone is not known in other sites,<ref>Ann Preston-Jones, (1993), ''The Men-an-Tol. Management and Survey'', Historic Environment Service, Cornwall County Council</ref> although the nearby stone circle of [[Boscawen-Un]] does have a central standing stone.

==In folklore==
[[File:Mên an Tol (small) (9705213).jpg|thumb|right|A view through the Mên-an-Tol holed stone]]
Mên-an-Tol is supposed to have a [[fairy]] or [[piskie]] guardian who can make miraculous cures. In one story, a [[changeling]] baby was put through the stone in order for the mother to get the real child back. Evil piskies had changed her child, and the ancient stones were able to reverse their evil spell.<ref name="Wentz">Evans-Wentz, W. Y. (1911) ''The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries''. London: H. Frowde (Reprinted 1981 by Colin Smythe. ISBN 0-901072-51-6) p. 179</ref>

[[Cornish folklore|Local legend]] claims that if at [[full moon]] a woman passes through the holed stone seven times backwards, she will soon become pregnant. Another legend is that passage through the stone will cure a child of rickets ([[osteomalacia]]). For centuries, children with rickets were passed naked through the hole in the middle stone nine times.

== Popular culture ==

The song Men-An-Tol appears on the [[Zeitgeist (The Levellers album)|Zeitgeist]] album by [[Levellers (band)|The Levellers]].

The '''fleet of the Royal Canadian Navy''' consists of the surface warships, submarines and auxiliary vessels operated by the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], the maritime component of the [[Canadian Forces]]. The current fleet consists of 66 vessels, including 34 commissioned vessels. Commissioned vessels carry the designation '[[Her Majesty's Canadian Ship]]' (HMCS) in reference to the monarch and head of state of Canada. Auxiliary vessels carry the designation 'Canadian Forces Auxiliary Vessel' (CFAV) since the [[unification of the Canadian Forces]] in 1968.

====Halifax class frigate====
{{main|Halifax class frigate}}
The backbone of the Royal Canadian Navy, the twelve ''Halifax''-class [[frigate]]s are multi-role patrol surface vessels that carry the [[Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King]] helicopters of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] as well as anti-submarine torpedoes and anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles. These ships, built by [[Saint John Shipbuilding]] of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] and [[MIL-Davie Shipbuilding]] of [[Lauzon, Quebec]], were commissioned between 1992 and 1996 and named after Canadian cities. The ships are undergoing the Frigate Life Extension (FELEX) through to 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/news/defence-news/year-2013-news/august-2013-navy-world-naval-forces-maritime-industry-technology-news/1206-royal-canadian-navy-halifax-class-frigates-modernization-and-life-extension-program-.html |title=Royal Canadian Navy Halifax-class Frigates Modernization and Life Extension Program |date=August 22, 2013}}</ref>

====''Iroquois'' class destroyer====
{{main|Iroquois class destroyer}}
The ''Iroquois'' class is a guided-missile destroyer in service with the Royal Canadian Navy. The four destroyers were designed in the late 1960s and built by [[Marine Industries]] and [[MIL-Davie Shipbuilding]]. Originally designed as anti-submarine warfare vessels, the ships underwent major retrofits in the 1990s and were re-purposed as area air defence destroyers. [[HMCS Huron (DDG 281)|HMCS ''Huron'']] was retired in 2000 and sunk in 2007, as a target in a live-fire exercise. As of September 2014, ''Iroquois'' and ''Algonquin'' are planned to be retired.<ref name=ctva>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/navy-sending-four-cold-war-era-ships-into-retirement-1.2014607 |title=Navy sending four Cold War era ships into retirement |work=CTV News |date=19 September 2014 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>

====''Victoria'' class submarines====
{{main|Upholder/Victoria class submarine|l1=Victoria class submarine}}
In 1998, the Canadian government made a deal with the United Kingdom to acquire four mothballed, but state-of-the-art [[Upholder/Victoria class submarine|''Upholder''-class]] [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] [[submarine]]s that were declared surplus when the [[Royal Navy]] decided to operate only nuclear-powered submarines such as the [[Trafalgar class submarine|''Trafalgar''-class]] boats. The four submarines were eventually purchased for $750 million [[Canadian Dollar|CAD]]. After an update program which took longer than expected the ''Upholder''s are being successfully reactivated following a decade of mothballing and are now in service into the Royal Canadian Navy as the [[Upholder/Victoria class submarine|''Victoria'' class]].

==Future procurement projects==

===Maritime-helicopter replacement===
Although aviation assets are the responsibility of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) since unification, the political fiasco surrounding the maritime-helicopter replacement has had a major impact on the ability of the Canadian patrol frigates to deliver their expected capabilities. In 1993, the Maritime Helicopter Program, which had selected the [[AgustaWestland EH101]] as a replacement for the aging [[CH-124 Sea King]], was cancelled by incoming Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] in an infamous decision that dogged his government for over a decade. Chrétien's government did end up ordering fifteen CH-149 Cormorants, a slightly cheaper though less effective version of the EH101, for search-and-rescue services, however it took until July 2004 for a replacement of the now-ancient Sea Kings to be announced.  The Sea Kings will be replaced with the [[CH-148 Cyclone]], with delivery of interim models expected in 2010. This date was pushed to 2011.  However, as of July 1, 2012, no aircraft have been delivered in spite of reduced requirements, and Sikorsky announced yet further unspecified delays in delivery.

===Current and future programs===

====Joint support ships====
{{main|Joint Support Ship Project}}
[[Image:Joint Support Ship.jpg|thumb|right|Proposal Joint Support Ship]]
In the late 1990s, one of the fleet's three underway-replenishment vessels, HMCS ''Provider'', was paid off. The remaining two supply ships, HMCS ''Preserver'' and HMCS ''Protecteur'', were showing their age, and MARCOM began studies into designing a new class of underway-replenishment and naval [[sealift]]-capable vessels.

On 16 April 2004, Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]] announced plans to purchase three new "joint support ships" (JSS) to replace the ''Protecteur''-class underway-replenishment vessels. In addition to supporting naval operations, the new ships will be able to transport a [[battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]] — a capability Canada's navy has lacked since the departure of the light carrier [[HMCS Bonaventure (CVL 22)|HMCS ''Bonaventure'']] in 1970. The new ships will also have reinforced hulls enabling them to sail in the Arctic.  The requirement for three JSSes was re-affirmed in June 2006 by the newly elected Conservative government, which issued the [[request for proposal]]. In November 2006, two industry teams were selected to provide a proposal. One of these teams was  to be awarded the implementation contract in 2008. The first of the 28,000-tonne vessels was scheduled to be delivered in 2012. As of 22 August 2008, the JSS Program has been suspended due to cost. The Protecteur Class will have their service lives extended beyond 2012 while a suitable replacement is found.<ref name=DnD20070516>

In July 2010, the plan to replace the ships was renewed, with the federal government announcing that it planned to authorize construction of two JSSs, including an option to purchase a third. A yard will be selected for the construction of the initial two ships, as part of the [[National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy]].<ref name=CBC20100714>

On 11 October 2010, the federal government announced that five shipbuilding companies are "being invited to participate in a request for proposals" for constructing ships as part of the [[National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy]].  One is to be selected for military vessels and one for non-military vessels.
<ref>[http://www.metronews.ca/halifax/canada/article/660118 The Canadian Press, 2010-10-11]</ref>

On 19 October 2011, the Canadian federal government awarded a $25 billion contract to the Irving Shipbuilding in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] to build a fleet of 23 combatant vessels to serve in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]. The Canadian government also awarded a contract worth $8 billion to build 7 non-combatant vessels.<ref name=CBC20111019>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2011/10/19/pol-shipbuilding-announcement.html| title=Halifax, B.C. yards win shipbuilding work |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation | date=19 October 2011 | accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref>

====Amphibious assault vessels====
{{main|Amphibious Assault Ship Project}}
In the first months of 2005, senior members of the Canadian Forces and the government examined the possibility of purchasing two new or used [[amphibious assault ships]] in keeping with the government's commitment to developing greater joint capability in the Canadian Forces.  This was apparently not connected to the [[Joint Support Ship Project]]. According to the [[General Delegation for Ordnance (France)|Délégation générale pour l’armement (DGA)]], the Canadian Forces Maritime Command and [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|DND]] might show an interest in the French built [[Mistral class amphibious assault ship]]<ref>[http://www.defense.gouv.fr/dga/votre_espace/presse/communiques/2007/batiment_francais_hydroglisseurs_et_helicopteres_americains_certification_acquise Canadian Forces Maritime Command and DND might show an interest in the French made the Mistral Class]</ref>  The ship might carry a significantly large military force with equipment and vehicles in 'fighting order,' enabling the CF to face armed opposition ashore. The [[Amphibious Assault Ship Project]]<ref>[http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/Community/MapleLeaf/vol_8/vol8_40/840_10.pdf Future Canadian Amphibious Assault Ship and Joint Support Ship]</ref> would procure vessels that would be able to rapidly disembark personnel and equipment in 'waves' using 'connector systems' such as landing craft and/or helicopters. The ship would be able to offload equipment and personnel in the face of armed opposition. They could also be used as large hospital ships and support humanitarian operations.

However, while the military may have shown interest in this type of vessel, it is not an approved federal government procurement project as outlined in the [[Canada First Defence Strategy]].<ref>Department of National Defence [http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/focus/first-premier/index-eng.asp "Canada First Defence Strategy"]</ref> According to French daily La Tribune, the Royal Canadian Navy shows "strong interest" in buying two ''Mistral'' ships.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fr.reuters.com/article/frEuroRpt/idFRLDE70602X20110107 |title=Le Canada s'intéresse aux Mistral de DCNS |author=Reuters |date=7 January 2011 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref>

====Orca-class training vessels====
{{main|Orca class patrol vessel}}
The program to replace the navy's [[YAG training vessels|wooden YAG vessels]] with up to eight modern steel training / patrol vessels (the [[Orca class training vessel|''Orca'']] program) is complete and was contracted by Victoria Shipyards Limited. The first ship, PCT (Patrol Craft, Training) Orca 55 was accepted by the navy at CFB Esquimalt on 17 November 2006.<ref name=Lookout20061127>The eighth and final vessel in the class, Moose 62, was delivered 27 Nov 2008.

====Polar Class 5 Arctic offshore patrol ships====
{{main|Arctic Patrol Ship Project}}
On 9 July 2007, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced the construction of up to eight patrol ships capable of operating in the Arctic Ocean (with [[polar class]] 5 (PC-5), as well as the establishment of a deep water port for the RCN in [[Nunavut]] capable of supporting RCN operations in the [[Northwest Passage]] and adjacent waters.

The [[Arctic Patrol Ship Project]] will be built in Canada.:<ref name=Cbc20070513>

The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] reported that the vessels "...are expected to be based on the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]]'s [[NoCGV Svalbard|Svalbard class]] design".

With steel-reinforced hulls, they will be capable of operating in ice up to one metre thick, and each vessel will also be equipped with a helicopter landing pad. They will be able to patrol the length of the [[Northwest Passage]] during the summer navigable season and its approaches year-round, and will also be capable of full operations on the east and west coasts throughout the year.
Critics have noted that the vessels are less capable than the three larger icebreakers Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] announced in 2006 most notably the Navy League of Canada which described the 25-millimetre gun as a "pea shooter".<ref name = Cbc20090607 />

Press reports in 2009 suggested that the Arctic Patrol Ship Project had been postponed,<ref name=Cbc20090607>

====Other====
The ''Halifax''-class Frigate Life Extension (FELEX)
program has been established and a contract was awarded to [[Lockheed Martin]]. It is believed that introduction of the active [[phased array]] radar (APAR) that the Canadian Forces developed with the Dutch navy will not be undertaken during FELEX due to the weight of the system and stability considerations.  Canada is considering a 4-to-10 vessel replacement program for the [[Iroquois class destroyer|''Iroquois''-class destroyers]], likely involving the use of APAR.  To save money, the replacement classes for the ''Iroquois''- and [[Halifax class frigate|''Halifax''-class]] ships will have identical hulls and [[Marine propulsion|propulsion systems]]. Canada plans to upgrade her Frigates with a missile guidance system for sea to sea and sea to air missiles. There is also the possibility of arming the Sea King replacements with anti ship missiles.

A mid-life upgrade program for the [[Kingston class coastal defence vessel|''Kingston''-class patrol vessels]] appeared on a list of the Chief of the Maritime Staff's project priorities, but was cancelled. The government also indicated plans outlined in the [[Canada First Defence Strategy]] that will  replace the ''Iroquois'' class destroyers and ''Halifax'' class frigates with the [[Single Class Surface Combatant Project]]. The Department of National Defence has not identified a procurement timeframe for the ''Iroquois'' replacements, although it has been reported that design work is underway and a project office and personnel have been assigned.

'''Schwäbisch Hall''' ({{IPA-de|??v??b?? ?hal}} (or '''Hall''' for short)<ref name="Goethe Institute1">{{Citation|title=The city of Schwäbisch Hall|publisher =[[Goethe-Institut]]|url=http://www.goethe.de/ins/de/ort/swh/sta/enindex.htm|accessdate=March 22, 2011}}</ref> is a town in the German [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]] and capital of the district of [[Schwäbisch Hall (district)|Schwäbisch Hall]]. The town is located in the valley of the [[Kocher]] in the north-eastern part of Baden-Württemberg.

Hall was a [[Free Imperial City]] for five centuries until it was annexed by Württemberg in 1802.

==Etymology==

The first part of the name, "Schwäbisch", refers to the name of the region, [[Swabia]] (in English; "Schwaben" in German). The most probable origin of the second part of the name "Hall" is a west [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word family that means "drying something by heating it", likely referring to the [[salt]] production method of heating salty [[groundwater]].<ref>Kuno Ulshöfer, Herta Beutter (ed.): Hall und das Salz. Beiträge zur hällischen Stadt- und Salinengeschichte, Sigmaringen 1982, p. 8.</ref> The salt mine closed in 1925.<ref>{{cite web|title=Schwäbisch Hall|url=http://www.castleroad.de/showpage.php?SiteID=20&lang=2&sid=45&sel=ao|publisher=castleroad.de|accessdate=March 26, 2011}}</ref>

==History==

===Early history===
Salt was distilled by the [[Celts]] at the site of Schwäbisch Hall as early as the fifth century.<ref name="History">{{Citation|title=The history of Schwäbisch Hall - an overview|publisher=Schwäbisch Hall|url=http://www.schwaebischhall.de/en/welcome/history.html|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}</ref>
The first time it was mentioned in a forged document called "Öhringer Stiftungsbrief" that dates in the final years of the 11th century.<ref name="History"/> The village probably belonged first to the ''Counts of Comburg-Rothenburg'' and went from them to the Imperial house of [[Hohenstaufen]] (ca 1116). It was probably Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I ''Barbarossa'']] who founded the imperial mint and started the coining of the so-called ''[[Heller (money)|Heller]]''. Hall flourished through the production of salt and coins. Since 1204 it has been called a town.<ref name="History"/>

After the fall of the house of Hohenstaufen, Hall defended itself successfully against the claims of a noble family in the neighbourhood<ref name="History"/> (the ''Schenken von Limpurg''). The conflict was finally settled in 1280 by King [[Rudolph I of Habsburg]]; this allowed the undisturbed development into an [[Free Imperial City]] (''Reichsstadt'') of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV the Bavarian]] granted a constitution that settled internal conflicts (''Erste Zwietracht'') in 1340. After this, the city was governed by the inner council (''Innerer Rat'') which was composed by twelve noblemen, six "middle burghers" and eight craftsmen. The head of the council was the ''Stättmeister'' (mayor). A second phase of internal conflicts 1510–12 (''Zweite Zwietracht'') brought the dominating role of the nobility to an end. The confrontation with the noble families was started by Stättmeister ''Hermann Büschler'', whose daughter ''Anna Büschler'' is the subject of a popular book by Harvard professor [[Steven Ozment]] ("The Bürgermeister's Daughter: Scandal in a sixteenth-century German town"). The leading role was taken over by a group of families who turned into a new ruling class. Amongst them where the ''Bonhöffers'', the ancestors of [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]].

===Middle ages===
From the 14th to the 16th centuries, Hall systematically acquired a large territory in the surrounding area, mostly from noble families and the [[Comburg]] monastery. The wealth of this era can still be seen in some [[gothic architecture|gothic]] buildings like St. Michael's Church (rebuilt 1427–1526) with its impressive stairway (1507). The town joined the [[Protestant Reformation]] very early. [[Johannes Brenz]], a follower of [[Martin Luther]], was made pastor of St. Michael's Church in 1522 and quickly began to reform the church and the school system along Lutheran lines.

Hall suffered severely during the [[Thirty Years' War]], though it was never [[siege|besieged]] or scene of a [[battle]]. However, it was forced to pay enormous sums to the armies of the various parties, especially to the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]], [[Sweden|Swedish]] and [[France|French]] troops, who also committed numerous atrocities and plundered the town and the surrounding area. Between 1634 and 1638 every fifth inhabitant died of hunger and diseases, especially from the [[bubonic plague]]. The war left the town an impoverished and economically ruined place. But with the help of reorganizations of salt production and trade and a growing [[wine]] trade, there was an astonishingly fast recovery.

===17th century to early 20th century===
Fires were a constant threat to the mostly wooden houses of the town. The great fires of 1680 and especially of 1728 destroyed much of the city, which led to new buildings in the [[Baroque]] style, such as the city hall.

The [[Napoleonic wars]] brought the history of Hall as a Free Imperial City to an end. Following the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] (1801), the duke of [[Württemberg]] was allowed by [[Napoleon]] to occupy the town and several other minor states as a compensation for territories on the left side of the [[Rhine]] that fell to [[France]]. This took place in 1802 — Hall lost its territory and its political independence and became a ''Oberamtsstadt'' (seat of an ''Oberamt'', comparable to a [[county]]). Ownership of the salt works was handed over to the state. A long economic crisis during the 19th century forced many citizens to move to other places in Germany or to emigrate overseas, mostly to the [[USA]]. While other towns like [[Heilbronn]] grew steadily due to the [[Industrial Revolution]], the population of Hall stagnated. The economic situation improved during the second half of the 19th century — a main factor was the [[railway]] line to Heilbronn (1862) — but was not followed by a significant growth of the town. It was not until the 1920s and 1930s that new settlements were built on the heights surrounding the old town. Hall also grew through the incorporation of Steinbach (1930) and Hessental (1936).

1827, a health spa was founded on one of the islands in the Kocher river. Especially after the building of the railway (1862) it became a considerable economical factor. The well-preserved old town also brought a rising number of tourists. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Hall has developed many festivities. Especially well known are the theatre productions which are performed every year in the centre of the city on the steps of St. Michael.

===Nazi Germany and World War II===
In 1934, Hall was officially named ''Schwäbisch Hall''. During the [[Third Reich]] a [[Luftwaffe]] [[air base]] was built at Hessental.<ref name="History"/> During [[Kristallnacht]] on 9 November 1938, local Nazis burned the synagogue in Steinbach and devastated shops and houses of Jewish citizens.<ref name="History"/> Approximately 40 Jewish citizens of Schwäbisch Hall fell victim to the [[Holocaust]] in extermination camps in Eastern Europe.<ref name="History"/> In 1944 a [[concentration camp]] was established next to the train station Hall-Hessental. The train station at Hall was targeted by an American air raid on February 23, 1945, but the devastation was mostly limited to the suburbs of St. Katharina and Unterlimpurg. The town was occupied by [[US Army]] troops on April 17, 1945 without serious resistance; though several buildings were destroyed or damaged, the historical old town suffered comparatively little.

===Post World War II===
In 1960, Schwäbisch Hall reached the status of a "Große Kreisstadt."<ref name="History"/> This means that the city took over some tasks of the district.<ref name="History"/>

'''Anthony Keith "Tony" Gwynn, Sr.''' (May 9, 1960 – June 16, 2014), nicknamed '''Mr. Padre''', was an American professional [[baseball]] [[right fielder]] who played 20 seasons (1982–2001) in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[San Diego Padres]]. The left-handed hitting Gwynn won eight [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting title]]s in his career, tied for the second-most in MLB history. He is considered one of the best and most consistent hitters in baseball history. He was a 15-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], recognized for his skills both on offense and defense with seven [[Silver Slugger Award]]s and five [[Gold Glove Award]]s. He was inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 2007, his first year of eligibility.

Gwynn attended college at [[San Diego State University]] (SDSU), where he played both [[college baseball]] and [[college basketball]] for the [[San Diego State Aztecs]]. He was selected by the Padres in the third round of the [[1981 Major League Baseball Draft|1981 MLB Draft]] as the 58th overall pick. Gwynn played in the [[World Series]] in both [[1984 World Series|1984]] and [[1998 World Series|1998]], the only two [[World Series]] appearances in San Diego's franchise history. He had a .338 career [[batting average]] and never hit below .309 in any full season, in addition to batting .371 in World Series games. Gwynn accumulated [[3,000 hit club|3,141 career hits]] as a [[contact hitter]], one of just ten players to reach the 3,000 hit club while only playing for one team.

Following his retirement, the Padres [[San Diego Padres#Retired numbers|retired]] his [[jersey number]] 19 in 2004. He became the head [[coach (baseball)|baseball coach]] at his alma mater, and also spent time as a [[baseball analyst]]. Gwynn died on June 16, 2014 of [[salivary gland cancer]].

[[File:Tony Gwynn 1976 - Basketball.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gwynn was a standout basketball player in both high school (pictured) and college.]]
He did not play baseball his first year at [[San Diego State]] in order to concentrate on basketball. He joined the Aztecs baseball team in 1979 when then-freshman [[shortstop]] [[Bobby Meacham]], who knew Gwynn from his high school days, convinced SDSU baseball coach [[Jim Dietz]] to give Gwynn a chance to compete.<ref name=goaztecs/> Dietz was looking for replacements for two outfielders who were injured riding bicycles after being struck by an automobile.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cushman|first=Tom|title=Hitting the Hall|magazine=San Diego Magazine|date=December 2006|volume=59|issue=2|page=134|issn=0036-4045|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0P8DAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA136&dq=tony%20gwynn%20all-american%20college&pg=PA134#v=onepage&q=tony%20gwynn%20all-american%20college&f=false|accessdate=October 5, 2012|ref=cushman2006}}</ref> Gwynn became a two-sport star, playing three seasons of baseball and four of basketball.  In baseball he primarily was a [[left fielder]] and [[designated hitter]] at San Diego State. Gwynn hit .301 his first season, but said he "stunk defensively."<ref name=cushman2006_p136>[[#cushman2006|Cushman 2006]], p. 136.</ref> He was a two-time [[All-American]] outfielder his final two seasons after leading the team in hitting.

==Professional baseball career==

===Minor leagues (1981–1982)===
The [[San Diego Padres]] selected Gwynn in the third round of the [[1981 Major League Baseball Draft]] with the 58th overall pick. Later that day, Gwynn was also selected by the [[Los Angeles Clippers|San Diego Clippers]] in the 10th round of the [[1981 NBA Draft|National Basketball Association (NBA) draft]].<ref name=jaffe_06162014/> He chose to play baseball in what he termed a "practical" decision, citing his physical battles pushing and fighting against larger players such as [[Charles Bradley (basketball)|Charles Bradley]] while playing WAC basketball.<ref name=benson/>

Gwynn was noted for constantly studying his swing, always looking for ways to improve his hitting. Gwynn began using smaller bats while playing his first season of professional ball for the [[Walla Walla Padres]], San Diego's [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] [[Minor League Baseball]] affiliate, in 1981, because he was having trouble adapting to wood bats and wanted something of a similar weight to the aluminum bats he used in college. Even though Gwynn was batting .360 at the time, he felt that larger bats were hampering him because he had to choke up so far.

He hit .331 with 12 homers and 17 stolen bases in just 42 games for Walla Walla, earning him [[most valuable player]] honors for the Northwest League,  before finishing the season in [[Class AA (baseball)|Class AA]] with [[Amarillo Gold Sox|Amarillo]] for 23 games while batting .462.<ref name=jaffe_06162014/><ref name=posnanski_12212013/>

===Major leagues (1982–2001)===

====1982–1983====
Gwynn was promoted from the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[Hawaii Islanders]] and debuted for the Padres on July 19, 1982. He started in [[center field]] against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]; in his fourth at-bat, Gwynn got his first major league hit—a [[double (baseball)|double]]—against [[reliever]] [[Sid Monge]]. Rose, who was the Phillies first baseman and became the MLB all-time hit leader, told Gwynn, "Congratulations.

During the last three months of the 1987 season, a finger on Gwynn's left hand would lock when he gripped a bat.  It would come open barely enough for the bat to slip out from his grip.

In the [[1989 San Diego Padres season|1989 season]], he was hurting in September while he was in the race for another batting title. His right toe made it hard for him to put a shoe on, and his left [[Achilles tendon]] was sore and prevented him from pushing off properly when swinging.

Gwynn entered the [[1993 San Diego Padres season|1993 season]] anticipating he would be better after his past two surgeries. He incorporated Williams' advice into his swing.

The Gwynn-Ripken induction weekend was notable for a number of attendance records, which were announced during the ceremony.  14,000 people visited the Hall of Fame Museum on July 28, a record number for a single-day.  Baseball attendance for all games played on July 28 also set a single-day record.  The induction ceremony also had the greatest collection of living Hall-of-Famers, 53, present for a ceremony.  A record crowd estimated at 75,000 attended the induction ceremony, shattering the previous record of 25,000 in 1999. In 2002, Gwynn was also inducted by the [[San Diego Hall of Champions]] into the [http://www.sdhoc.com/awards/hall-of-fame/baseball/tony-gwynn/ Breitbard Hall of Fame] honoring San Diego's finest athletes both on and off the playing surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sdhoc.com/sport/baseball/tony-gwynn |title=Tony Gwynn |publisher=San Diego Hall of Champions |date= |accessdate=June 8, 2012}}</ref> Prior to his induction into the Hall of Fame on July 20, 2007, Gwynn appeared on a [[Wheaties]] box.

His career paralleled that of [[Wade Boggs]], who also debuted in the major leagues in 1982. Gwynn and Boggs were the premier contact hitters in an era dominated by home runs. They both won multiple batting titles—Gwynn's eight to Boggs's five—and each won four straight to join Cobb, [[Rogers Hornsby]], and Carew as the only players to do so. Gwynn and Boggs each hit over .350 in four straight seasons, the only players to do so since 1931.

He missed the start of the 2012 season after undergoing surgery, and missed games in 2013 while involved with a [[clinical trial]].

==Health and death==
Gwynn had three procedures to remove noncancerous growths from his [[parotid gland]] since 1997.

After his playing career ended, Gwynn's weight peaked at {{convert|330|lb|kg}}, and he underwent [[adjustable gastric banding surgery]] in 2009 in an attempt to lose weight. He did not closely adhere to the diet, and his weight loss began to stall. His weight problem led to a [[slipped disc]] in his back that affected a nerve down his leg in 2010. He needed a walker before he had the damaged disc removed to cure the pain while walking. Later, he experienced a loss of taste for food during [[radiation therapy]] for his cancer, and while being limited to a [[liquid diet]], he lost {{convert|80|lb|kg}}, all of which he regained after he resumed eating solid foods.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bloom|first=Barry M.|title=Gwynn taking fight with cancer a day at a time|date=April 4, 2011|work=MLB.com|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/print.jsp?ymd=20110404&content_id=17367182&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Bf10749e|archivedate=October 24, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref>

'''''Vineland''''' is a 1990 novel by [[Thomas Pynchon]], a [[postmodern]] fiction set in [[California]], United States in 1984, the year of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s reelection.<ref name="KnabbVineland">Knabb 2002</ref> Through flashbacks by its characters, who have lived the sixties in their youth, the story accounts for the free spirit of rebellion of that decade, and describes the traits of the fascistic [[Richard_Nixon#Civil rights|Nixonian repression]] and its [[War on drugs]] that clashed with it; and it articulates the slide and transformation that occurred in U.S. society from the 1960s to the 1980s.<ref name="KnabbVineland"/><ref name="VinP71">Vineland, p.71</ref><ref name="PatellP129">Patell (2001) p.129</ref>

== Title and location ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
Vineland, the central locale of the novel, is a fictive small town in [[California]]'s [[Anderson Valley]] (perhaps based upon [[Boonville, California|Boonville]]). ''Vineland'' may be a play on the word "[[Hollywood]]", a reference to the first Viking settlement in North America, [[Vinland]], or a reference to Andrey Vinelander, a character in Vladimir Nabokov's ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle]]''.  Still others contend that the title refers to [[Vineland, New Jersey]] or a "Vinland the Good" mentioned in a [[Frank O'Hara]] poem.  However, the most obvious explanation is that the title is a reference to the area in which the novel is set, which is near California's grapevine-filled [[Wine Country (California)|Wine Country]].

== Plot ==

The story is set in [[California]], United States, in 1984, the year of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s reelection.<ref name="KnabbVineland"/> After a scene in which former hippie Zoyd Wheeler dives through a window, something he is required to do yearly in order to keep receiving mental disability checks, the action of the novel opens with the resurfacing of [[Drug Enforcement Administration|D.E.A.]] agent Brock Vond, who (through a platoon of agents) forces Zoyd and his 14-year-old daughter Prairie out of their house. They hide from Brock, and from Hector Zuñiga (a drug-enforcement ''federale'' from Zoyd's past, who Zoyd suspects is in cahoots with Brock) with old friends of Zoyd's, who recount to the mystified Prairie the story of Brock's motivation for what he has done. 

This hinges heavily on Frenesi Gates, Prairie's mother, whom she has never met. In the '60s, during the height of the hippie era, the fictive College of the Surf seceded from the United States and became its own nation of hippies and dope smokers, called the People's Republic of Rock and Roll (PR³). Brock Vond, working for the D.E.A., intends to bring down PR³, and finds a willing accomplice in Frenesi. She is a member of 24fps, a militant film collective (other members of which are the people telling Prairie their story in the present), that seeks to document the "fascists' " transgressions against freedom and the hippie ideals. Frenesi is uncontrollably attracted to Brock and the sex he provides, and ends up working as a double agent to bring about the killing of the de facto leader of PR³, Weed Atman (a mathematics professor who accidentally became the subject of a cult of personality). 

Her betrayal caused Frenesi to need to flee, and she has been living in witness protection with Brock's help up until the present day. Now she has disappeared. The membership of 24fps, Brock Vond, and Hector Zuñiga are all searching her out, for their various motives. The book's theme of the ubiquity of television (or the Tube) comes to a head when Hector, a Tube addict who has actually not been working with Brock, finds funding to create his pet project of a movie telling the story of the depraved sixties, with Frenesi Gates as the star, and the pomp and circumstance surrounding this big-money deal create a net of safety that allows Frenesi to come out of hiding. 24fps finds her and achieves their goal of allowing Prairie to meet her, at an enormous reunion of Frenesi's family. Weed Atman is also present at the reunion as one of many Thanatoids in the book—people who are in a state that is "like death, but different." 

Brock, nearly omnipotent with D.E.A. funds, finds Prairie with a surveillance helicopter, and tries to snatch her up in order to get to Frenesi, but while he is hovering above her on a ladder, the government abruptly cuts all his funding due to a loss of interest in funding the war on drugs because people have begun playing along willingly with the antidrug ideal, and his helicopter pilot flies him away. Later he tries to come after Prairie and Frenesi again, but is killed when he crashes his helicopter. The family reunion allows everyone to tie up all their loose ends, and the book ends with Prairie looking into the beginning of a life no longer controlled by the fall-out of the past.

== Technique ==
Throughout the novel, Pynchon's technique is recognizable. From a cameo of Mucho Maas (from ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'') to a bizarre episode hinting at [[Godzilla]], Pynchon's "zaniness" pervades the novel. For example, Pynchon laces the book with ''[[Star Trek]]'' references. He has his characters watch a [[sitcom]] named ''Say, Jim,'' about a starship all of whose officers "were black except for the Communications Officer, a freckled, red-head named Lieutenant O'Hara." The numerous references to films rigorously include the year of release in a manner unusual for a work of fiction. Several characters are Thanatoids, victims of [[karma|karmic]] imbalance and inhabitants of a strange state of being "like death, only different."

In addition, the novel is replete with [[kunoichi|female ninjas]], [[astrologers]], [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] smokers, [[television]] addicts, musical interludes (including the theme song of ''[[The Smurfs (Hanna-Barbera series)|The Smurfs]]'') and, naturally, [[metaphor]]s drawn from ''Star Trek''.

'''''The Net''''' is a 1995 [[cyberspace|cyber]] [[thriller (genre)|action thriller film]] directed by [[Irwin Winkler]] and featuring [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Jeremy Northam]] and [[Dennis Miller]].<ref>[http://www.wired.com/2013/04/the-net-movie-technology/ What We Learned About Technology From 1995?s The Net]</ref>

==Plot==
The film opens with United States [[Undersecretary of Defense]] Michael Bergstrom ([[Ken Howard]]), who commits suicide after discovering that he has tested positive for [[HIV]].

Angela Bennett ([[Sandra Bullock]]) is a [[systems analyst]] from [[Venice, California]] who [[telecommuting|telecommute]]s to Cathedral Software in [[San Francisco]]. Her interpersonal relationships are completely online and on the phone, limiting interactions with neighbors and her mother ([[Diane Baker]]) who is institutionalized with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Bennett's coworker Dale sends her a [[floppy disk]] with a [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor]], labeled "[[Pi|?]]", to a commonly used computer security system called "Gatekeeper" sold by Gregg Microsystems. Dale and Bennett agree to meet, but his private plane's navigation system malfunctions and it crashes, killing him.

Bennett travels to [[Cozumel]], [[Mexico]] on vacation, where she meets Jack Devlin ([[Jeremy Northam]]). Devlin pays a mugger to steal Bennett's purse with the disk, then shoots the thief. He takes Bennett out on his speedboat to kill her, but she finds his gun and confronts him. While fleeing with the disk and Devlin's wallet, Bennett's [[dinghy]] collides with rocks, destroying the disk and hospitalizing her, unconscious, for three days.

When Bennett wakes up, she finds that all records of her life have been deleted: She was checked out of her hotel room, her car is no longer at the [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] parking lot, and her credit cards are invalid. Bennett's home is empty and listed for sale and, because none of the neighbors ever saw her, they cannot confirm her identity. Bennett's [[Social Security number]] is now assigned to a "Ruth Marx", who has an arrest record. Another woman has taken her identity at Cathedral; the impostor offers Bennett her old life back in exchange for the disk. She contacts the only other person who knows her by sight, psychiatrist and former lover Alan Champion ([[Dennis Miller]]). He checks her into a hotel, offers to contact a friend at the [[FBI]], and arranges to have her mother moved for her safety.

Using her knowledge of the backdoor and a password found in Devlin's wallet, Bennett logs into the [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]]'s computers and learns that Bergstrom, who had opposed Gatekeeper's use by the federal government, was misdiagnosed. Fellow hacker "Cyberbob" identifies ? with the "Praetorians", a notorious group of [[cyberterrorist]]s linked to recent computer failures around the country. They plan to meet at [[Pacific Park]] on the [[Santa Monica Pier]], but the Praetorians intercept their online chat. Bennett escapes from Devlin&mdash;a [[contract killer]] for the cyberterrorists&mdash;at the park, but the Praetorians kill Champion by tampering with pharmacy and hospital computer records. After Bennett is arrested by the [[California Highway Patrol]] a man identifying himself as Champion's FBI friend frees her from jail. She realises he is an impostor and escapes again.

Now wanted for murder, Bennett hitchhikes from [[Los Angeles]] to Cathedral's office in San Francisco where, using her impostor's computer, she connects the terrorists to Gregg Microsystems and uncovers their scheme; once the Praetorians sabotage an organization's computer system, Gregg sells his Gatekeeper product to them and gains unlimited access through the backdoor. Bennett [[email]]s evidence of the backdoor to the FBI from the [[Moscone Center]] and tricks Devlin into releasing a virus into Gregg's mainframe, undoing the erasing of her identity. They battle on the convention center's catwalks, where Devlin accidentally shoots and kills the imposter (the real Ruth Marx). Bennett then ambushes Devlin with a fire extinguisher, causing him to fall to his death. The film closes with Bennett reunited with her mother and the conspiracy exposed.

'''Slovenian Railways''' ({{lang-sl|Slovenske železnice}}, ''SŽ'') is the state [[railway]] company of [[Slovenia]], created in 1991 from the [[Ljubljana]] division of the former [[Yugoslav Railways]] after the breakup of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

Slovenia is a member of the [[International Union of Railways]] (UIC). The [[UIC Country Code]] for Slovenia is 79.

==History==
{{main|History of rail transport in Slovenia}}
[[File:Muzejski vlak Slovenia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Steam locomotive]] SŽ 25-026, manufactured in 1920 in Vienna, nowadays used by Slovenske železnice for tourist purposes]] 
[[Slovenia]] received its first railway connection in the 1840s, when the [[Austrian Empire]] built a railway connection - Südliche Staatsbahn or [[Austrian Southern Railway]] - between its capital, [[Vienna]], and its major commercial port, [[Trieste]]. Thus, [[Maribor railway station|Maribor]] was connected by railway to [[Graz Hauptbahnhof|Graz]] in 1844. The stretch was extended via [[Pragersko railway station|Pragersko]] to [[Celje railway station|Celje]] in 1846, and further via [[Zidani Most railway station|Zidani Most]] to [[Ljubljana railway station|Ljubljana]] in 1849. A double-track line was continued via [[Postojna railway station|Postojna]], [[Pivka railway station|Pivka]], and [[Diva?a railway station|Diva?a]], finally reaching [[Trieste]] in 1857.

Before [[World War I]], numerous other railways were built. In 1860, Pragersko was connected to [[Ormož railway station|Ormož]] and further to [[?akovec]], Croatia, thus connecting the Austrian and the Hungarian part of the empire. In 1862, a single-track railway (expanded into double-track in 1944) along the [[Sava river]] was built, connecting Zidani Most with [[Zagreb]]. In 1863, the "Carinthian railway" was built along the [[Drava]] river, connecting [[Maribor railway station|Maribor]] with [[Dravograd railway station|Dravograd]], [[Klagenfurt Hauptbahnhof|Klagenfurt]] and [[Villach Hauptbahnhof|Villach]]. In 1870, a railway along the upper Sava river valley was built, connecting Ljubljana with [[Kranj railway station|Kranj]], [[Jesenice railway station|Jesenice]] and [[Tarvisio]], Italy. In 1873, a line from Pivka via [[Ilirska Bistrica railway station|Illirska Bistrica]] connected [[Rijeka]], then the most important commercial port in the Hungarian part of the empire. In 1876, a line from Diva?a connected [[Pula]], the Austrian naval base, via [[Prešnica]]. In 1906, [[Bohinj Railway]] was built, connecting Villach with Jesenice, along the [[So?a]] river valley to [[Gorizia]] and further to Trieste, with two over-6000 meter tunnels.

Few lines were opened after World War I. One of them connected Ormož with [[Ljutomer railway station|Ljutomer]] and [[Murska Sobota railway station|Murska Sobota]], and opened in 1924. After [[World War II]], a single-track electrified line connecting Prešnica with [[Koper railway station|Koper]] was built in 1967. In 1999, a single-track line between Murska Sobota and [[Hodoš railway station|Hodoš]] was rebuilt, offering a direct connection with the Hungarian railway system. The line was originally built in 1907 and closed down in 1968 among numerous other lines closed down during the 1960s.

Numerous ex-[[Yugoslav Railways]] [[steam locomotive]]s are plinthed at stations around Slovenia and there is a [[Slovenian Railway Museum|railway museum]] at Ljubljana.

==System==
Slovenian Railways operates 1,229&nbsp;km of [[standard gauge]] tracks, 331&nbsp;km as [[double track]], and reaches all regions of the country. It is remarkably well connected to all surrounding countries reflecting the fact that Slovenia used to be part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and later of Yugoslavia. 

Electrification is provided by a 3 kV DC system and covers about 503&nbsp;km. The remainder of the former Yugoslavian railroads that have been electrified operate with [[25 kV AC]] system, thus trains to Zagreb switch engines at [[Dobova]] until dual system engines will be available.

==Rail links to adjacent countries==
* Same gauge
** [[Rail transport in Austria|Austria]] &nbsp;—  voltage change to 15 kV AC
** [[Rail transport in Croatia|Croatia]] &nbsp;— voltage change to 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz AC
** [[Rail transport in Hungary|Hungary]] &nbsp;— voltage change to 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz AC
** [[Rail transport in Italy|Italy]] &nbsp;— same voltage 3 kV DC

==Crossroad of Pan-European corridors==
[[Ljubljana]] is at the heart of the SŽ system. Here, the [[Pan-European corridors]] V and X intersect. These transportation corridors are being established to tie larger segments of Europe economically together: Corridor V links [[Venice]] - [[Trieste]]/[[Koper]] - [[Ljubljana]] - [[Maribor]] - [[Budapest]] - [[Kiev]], while Corridor X connects [[Salzburg]] - [[Ljubljana]] - [[Zagreb]] - [[Belgrade]] - [[Thessalonica]]. The freight system to Koper, a modern and growing port east of Trieste, represents the shortest connection to the Mediterranean for a large portion of the [[hinterland]] of Central and Eastern Europe.

In 2010, Slovenske železnice joined [[Cargo 10]], a joint venture with other railways in the region.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17046693?story_id=17046693

===InterCity Slovenija (ICS)===
[[File:Pendolino ETR 310.jpg|thumbnail|ICS Pendolino ETR-310 serving as fast train between Ljubljana and Maribor.]]
The [[SŽ series 310|ICS]] trains are modern, air-conditioned trains which provide fast speeds and comfort. They are equipped with disabled access and other facilities. The passengers can buy food on board (from Monday to Friday), the 1st class passengers are offered food free of charge. There are also electric sockets in the 1st class department. The train is a [[tilting train|tilting]] [[Electric multiple unit|EMU]]. The reservation of a seat is obligatory and is included in the price of the ticket. Also included in the price of the ticket is the obligatory ICS supplement.

The ICS trains run on the following line (note: the regular service runs between Maribor and Ljubljana. The Austria to Maribor part of the line is served by only one pair of trains a day. The section from Ljubljana to Koper runs only on summer Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays.):

===InterCity (IC)===
The [[InterCity|IC]] trains are quality trains serving longer distances in national and international traffic. They connect bigger towns, cities and tourist resorts. They consist of comfortable cars. They provide fast connection and call only at major stations. The train usually consists of open or compartment coaches (1st and 2nd class). Some of the trains may have a [[restaurant car]]. An IC supplement must be paid for this type of train.

===EuroCity (EC)===
The [[EuroCity|EC]] trains are high-quality trains serving important lines in international traffic. They connect important cities in Slovenia and the rest of Europe. The EC trains are even faster than the IC trains and they call at fewer stations. The majority of the EC trains include air-conditioned cars and have catering facilities on board. The train usually consists of open and compartment passenger coaches (1st and 2nd class). Some of the trains may have a [[restaurant car]]. An EC supplement must be paid for this type of train.

===International trains (MV)===
The MV trains (Slovene for ''mednarodni vlak'', international train) are quality trains serving international lines. They do not call at minor stations. The train usually consists of open and compartment passenger coaches (1st and 2nd class). Some of the trains may have a [[restaurant car]]. An MV supplement must be paid for this type of train.

===EuroNight (EN)===
The [[EuroNight|EN]] trains are high-quality overnight international trains. They offer open or compartment passenger coaches (1st and 2nd class), [[couchette car]]s and [[sleeping car]]s. Some of the trains may have a [[restaurant car]]. The EC supplement must be paid for regular seats and an additional supplement must be paid for couchettes and sleeper cars. Some EN trains use "global" prices with an obligatory reservation.

===Regional (RG) and local trains (LP)===
The RG and LP (Slovene for ''lokalni potniški'', local passenger train) trains are other trains, connecting all parts of Slovenia. They serve as commuter trains. On some lines, they are the only type of trains available, for example lines to [[Kamnik]] and [[Imeno]]. The trains offer 2nd class travel only. They are usually [[Electrical multiple units|EMU]]s and [[Diesel multiple units|DMU]]s on unelectrified lines.

===Supplements===
In addition to the ICS, IC, EC and MV supplements, there is also the supplement for tickets bought on the train.<ref>http://www.slo-zeleznice.si/en/passengers/it-is-useful-to-know/ticket-supplement</ref> Currently set at [[Euro|€]]2.50, it is payable if the ticket is bought on the train, rather than prior to boarding at the railway station ticket counters or any authorised point of sale. Furthermore, no discounts (children, senior, group travel...) are available in this case. This supplement and discount restriction do not apply, however, if the train is boarded at a station where no tickets can be purchased (many local stops are mere [[Haltepunkt|halts]] sometimes even without any shelter) or if the ticket counters are closed at the time of boarding (for example during the night).

===Named trains<ref>http://www.slo-zeleznice.si/en/passengers/timetable/timetable-according-to-route</ref>===
Many trains are assigned names. The examples include:
*IC 502 / 503 "[[Pohorje]]"
*IC 518 / 519 "[[Ptuj]]"
*IC 516 / 517 "[[Mura]]"
*IC 508 / 509 "Dana"
*EC 210 / 211 "[[Sava]]"
*EC 150 / 151 "[[Emona]]"
*EC 158 / 159 "[[Croatia]]"
*EC 212 / 213 "[[Mimara Museum|Mimara]]"
*MV 498 / 499 "[[Vatroslav Lisinski|Lisinski]]"
*MV 246 / 247 "[[Citadella]]"
*MV 414 / 415 "[[Alps|Alpine Pearls]]"
*MV 480 / 481 "[[Opatija]]"
*MV 482 / 483 "[[Ljubljana]]"
*MV 1472 / 1473 "[[Istria|Istra]]"
*RG 1604 / 1605 "[[Istria|Istra]]"
*RG 600 / 601 "[[So?a]]"

===Former named trains===
A noted train of the SŽ was the ''Casanova'' linking Ljubljana to [[Venice]] in a 4-hour ride, eliminated in April 2007.
Last train connection with Italy, night train EN 440 / 441 "[[Venice|Venezia]]" from [[Budapest]] to Venice was eliminated in December 2011.

The '''flag of Croatia''' is one of the state symbols of [[Croatia]]. It consists of three equal size, horizontal stripes in colours [[red]], [[white]] and [[blue]]. In the middle is the [[coat of arms of Croatia]].

==History==
The flag combines the colors of the flags of the Kingdom of Croatia (red and white), the Kingdom of Slavonia (white and blue) and the Kingdom of Dalmatia (red and blue). Those three kingdoms are the historic constituent states of the Croatian Kingdom.

The red-white-blue tricolor has been used as the Croatian flag since 1848, and the [[pan-Slavic colors]] are widely associated with [[romantic nationalism]]. While the [[Banovina of Croatia]] existed within the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], it had a similar flag without the modern crown above the chequy. During the [[Independent State of Croatia]], flag was like the modern, but without crown and there was letter "U" at the top left of the flag. Also, first field of Croatian chequy was white. While Croatia was part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] its [[Triband (flag)|tricolor]] was the same, but it had a five-pointed red star with a yellow border in place of the coat of arms. The star was replaced by the coat in May 1990, shortly after the first multiparty elections. The current flag and the coat of arms were officially adopted on 21 December 1990, about ten months before the proclamation of independence from Yugoslavia and a day before the Constitution of Croatia on 22 December 1990.

==Shield==
The shield is in the red and white checks of Croatia. Above is a crown made of shields of its various regions. From left to right they are the ancient arms of Croatia, [[Republic of Ragusa| Dubrovnik]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Istria]], and [[Kingdom_of_Slavonia | Slavonia]].

The '''[[coat of arms]] of the [[Republic of Croatia]]''' ({{lang-hr|Grb Republike Hrvatske}}) consists of one main shield and five smaller shields which form a crown over the main shield. The main coat of arms is a [[checkerboard]] ([[chequy]]) that consists of 13 red and 12 silver (white) fields. It's also informally known in Croatian as '''''šahovnica''''' ("chessboard", from ''šah'', "chess"). The five smaller shields represent five different historical regions within Croatia.

==History==
The  checkerboard coat of arms (''šahovnica'') is first attested as an official symbol of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|kingdom of Croatia]] on an [[Innsbruck]] tower depicting the emblem of [[Maximilian I, Archduke of Austria]] in 1495.<ref name="Wappen">Karl-Heinz Hesmer: ''Chronik griffbereit: Flaggen und Wappen der Welt''.

ISBN 0-415-21695-8.</ref>

The origin of the design has often been purported as being medieval. Historic tradition states it to be the arms of  [[Stephen Držislav of Croatia|Stephen Držislav]] in the 10th century.<ref>Bellamy, Alex J. (2003). ''The Formation of Croatian National Identity: A Centuries-old Dream''. Manchester University Press. p. 36. ISBN 0-7190-6502-X.</ref> 
A [[Split (city)|Split]] stone baptistry from the time of [[Peter Krešimir IV of Croatia|Peter Krešimir IV]] (r. 1058–1074/5) has engraved falcons that carry something that resembles a chequy on their wings, and the bell tower of the medieval [[Church of St. Lucy, Jurandvor]] has a checkerboard pattern carved onto it.<ref>{{cite book | title = Ethnologia Europaea | volume = 25-26 | page = 78 | editor = Bjarne Stoklund | authors = Jonas Frykman, Gösta Arvastson | publisher = Museum Tusculanum Press | year = 1995 | isbn = 9788772893426 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Ioe1OOZG71AC&pg=PA78 | accessdate = 2013-02-04}}</ref>

The size of the checkerboard ranges from 3×3 to 8×8,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=76849|journal=Vjesnik Arheološkog muzeja u Zagrebu|publisher=Archaeological Museum in Zagreb|issn=0350-7165|title=Stari grbovi zemalja Nezavisne Države Hrvatske|trans_title=Ancient Arms of Lands of the Independent State of Croatia|language=Croatian|volume=22-23|issue=1|date=January 1942|author=Emilij Laszowski|pages=207–221|accessdate=5 November 2012}}</ref> but most commonly 5×5, like in the current design. It was traditionally conjectured that the colours originally represented two ancient Croat states, [[Red Croats|Red Croatia]] and [[White Croats|White Croatia]], but there is no historical evidence to support this.

Towards the [[Late Middle Ages]] the distinction for the three crown lands (Croatia 'proper', Dalmatia, Slavonia) was made. The ''šahovnica'' was used as the coat of arms of Croatia proper & together with the shields of Slavonia and Dalmatia was often used to represent the whole of Croatia in [[Austria-Hungary]].
It was used as an unofficial coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]] adopted in 1848 and as an official coat of arms of the post-1868 [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] (both unofficially known as [[Triune Kingdom]]). The two are the same except for the position of the ''šahovnica'' and Dalmatian coat of arms which are switched around & with different crowns used above the shield - the later employing St Stephen's crown (associated with Hungarian kings).

By late 19th century ''šahovnica'' had come to be considered a generally recognized symbol for Croats and Croatia and in 1919, it was included in the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) to represent Croats. When the [[Banovina of Croatia]] was formed, the ''šahovnica'' (chequy gules and argent) was retained as the official symbol.

The  [[Ustashe]] regime which had ruled Croatia during the [[World War II]] superimposed their ideological symbol, the letter "U" above or around the ''šahovnica'' (upper left square white) as the official national symbol during their rule.

After the [[Second World War]], the new Socialist Republic of Croatia became a part of the federal [[SFRY|Second Yugoslavia]]. The ''šahovnica'' was included in the new socialist coat of arms.<ref name="sahovnica">Jonas Frykman, Jonas Frykman Gösta Arvastson: ''Ethnologia Europaea'', Volume 26, 1995. ISBN 87-7289-342-7</ref>  It was designed in the socialist tradition, including symbols like wheat for peasants and an anvil for workers, as well as a rising sun to symbolize a new morning and a [[red star]] for [[communism]].

During the change to multiparty elections in Croatia (as part of the collapse of Communist rule in Eastern Europe from the late 1980s), and prior to the establishment of the current design, the ''šahovnica'', shedding the communist symbols that were the hallmark of [[Croatia in the second Yugoslavia]], reappeared as a stand-alone symbol as both the 'upper left square red' and 'upper left square white' variants. The choice of 'upper left square red' or 'upper left square white' was often dictated by heraldic laws and aesthetic requirements.

The first-field-white variant was adopted by the [[Republic of Croatia]] and used briefly in 1990.<ref>{{cite video | people= | date=1990-06-20 | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8ath2k53vo | title=SRH preimenovana u RH | trans_title = Socialist Republic of Croatia is renamed to Republic of Croatia | medium=Motion picture, [[TV kalendar]] | location=[[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] | publisher=[[Croatian Radiotelevision]]}}</ref> According to constitutional changes which came into effect on 26 June 1990 the red star in the flag of [[SR Croatia]] was to be replaced by the "historical Croatian coat of arms with 25 red and white fields", without specifying order of fields.<ref name="heimer1990">{{cite web|url=http://zeljko-heimer-fame.from.hr/hrvat/hr-hist.html#hr-1990|title=Republika Hrvatska, 1990.|last=Heimer|first=Željko|work=The Flags and Arms of the Modern Era|language=Croatian|accessdate=14 December 2011}}</ref> The first-field-white variant was used at the official flag hoisting ceremony on 25 July and was later occasionally used on par with the first-field-red variant until 12 December 1990 when the current coat of arms was officially  adopted.<ref name="heimer1990"/><ref name="udrugahrvpol">{{cite web|url=http://www.uhp.hr/dan|title=Dan udruge|publisher=Udruga hrvatski policajac|language=Croatian|accessdate=14 December 2011}}</ref>

==Current design==
On 21 December 1990, the post-socialist government of Croatia, passed a law prescribing the design created by the [[graphic designer]] [[Miroslav Šutej]], under the aegis of a commission chaired by Nikša Stan?i?, then head of the Department of [[History of Croatia|Croatian History]] at the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Zagreb|Faculty of Philosophy]], [[University of Zagreb]].

The new design added the five crowning shields which represent the historical regions from which Croatia originated. They are, from left to right:

[[Dalmatia]] - [[Coat of arms of Dalmatia]]: Bleu celeste, three leopards' heads affrontés caboshed Or, crowned Or - Three golden, crowned [[Leopard (heraldry)|heraldic leopard]] heads, two over one, on a blue shield. The depicted version from the crown differs from the traditional depiction of these arms: traditionally, the leopards are roaring and langued (i.e. with tongues visible), and the colour of the shield is [[Azure (heraldry)|heraldic azure]], not bleu celeste. Historically, this coat of arms was in use since at least the 14th century. First officially recorded use goes back to [[Louis I of Hungary|King Louis I]] and his daughter [[Mary, Queen of Hungary|Queen Mary]] who both used an earlier version of the arms as part of their personal coat of arms. Until 1526 this coat of arms was also used to represent Croatia in general,<ref name="Grbovnica Slavonije"/> apparent from the coat of arms of several kings: [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]], [[Mary, Queen of Hungary|Mary]], [[Matthias Corvinus]] and [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]].

Some of the more traditional [[heraldry|heraldic]] pundits have criticized the latest design for various design solutions, such as adding a crown to the coat, varying shades of blue in its even fields, and adding the red border around the coat. The government has accepted their criticism insofar as not accepting further non-traditional designs for the [[Counties of Croatia|county]] coats of arms, but the national symbol has remained intact.

Unlike in many countries, Croatian design more commonly uses symbolism from the coat of arms, rather than from the [[Flag of Croatia|Croatian flag]]. This is partly due to the geometric design of the shield which makes it appropriate for use in many graphic contexts (e.g. the insignia of [[Croatia Airlines]] or the design of the shirt for the [[Croatia national football team]]), and partly because the [[Pan-Slavic colors]] are present in many European flags.

===Historical versions of the crown arms===
Most coats of arms used in the crown on the modern-day coat of arms differ significantly from historically accurate versions.

[[Image:Chicago8.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Poster in support of the "Conspiracy 8"]]

The '''Chicago Seven''' (originally '''Chicago Eight''', also '''Conspiracy Eight'''/'''Conspiracy Seven''') were seven defendants—[[Abbie Hoffman]], [[Jerry Rubin]], [[David Dellinger]], [[Tom Hayden]], [[Rennie Davis]], [[John Froines]], and [[Lee Weiner]]—charged with conspiracy, inciting to [[riot]], and other charges related to [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] protests that took place in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], on the occasion of the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]]. [[Bobby Seale]], the eighth man charged, had his trial severed during the proceedings, lowering the number from eight to seven.

==Background==
{{main|1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity}}
The [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] was held in Chicago in late August—convened to select the party's candidates for the November [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 Presidential election]]. Prior to and during the convention—which took place at the [[International Amphitheatre]]—rallies, demonstrations, marches, and attempted marches took place on the streets and in the lakefront parks, about five miles away from the convention site. These activities were primarily in protest of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s policies for the [[Vietnam War]], policies which were vigorously contested during the presidential primary campaign and inside the convention.

[[Anti-war]] groups had petitioned the city of Chicago for permits to march five miles from the central business district (the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]]) to within sight of the convention site, to hold a number of rallies in the lakefront parks and also near the convention, and to camp in [[Lincoln Park]]. The city denied all permits, except for one afternoon rally at the old bandshell at the south end of [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]]. The city also enforced an 11:00&nbsp;pm curfew in Lincoln Park. Confrontations with protesters ensued as the police enforced the curfew, stopped attempts to march to the International Amphitheatre, and cleared crowds from the streets.

The Grant Park rally on Wednesday, August 28, 1968, was attended by about 15,000 protesters, while other actions involved hundreds or thousands. After the large rally, several thousand protesters attempted to march to the International Amphitheatre, but were stopped in front of the Conrad Hilton Hotel, where the presidential candidates and their campaigns were headquartered. Police moves to push the protesters out of the street were accompanied by tear gas, verbal and physical confrontation, frequent use of police batons to beat people, rocks and bottles thrown by protesters, damage to private commercial property by protesters, and scores of arrests. The television networks broadcast footage of these clashes, cutting away from the nominating speeches for the presidential candidates.

Over the course of five days and nights, the police made arrests, in addition to using tear gas, Mace, and batons on the marchers.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Schultz

Dozens of journalists covering the actions were also clubbed by police or had cameras smashed and film confiscated. In the aftermath of what was later characterized as a "[[police riot]]" by the U.S. [[National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0612FB3A541B7B93C0A91789D95F4C8685F9|title=U.S. Study scores Chicago violence as "a police riot"|author=Max Frankel|work=The New York Times|page=1|date=December 2, 1968|accessdate=December 31, 2007}}</ref>  a federal [[grand jury]] indicted eight demonstrators and eight police officers.

== Grand jury and indictment ==

Following the convention on September 9, 1968 a Federal grand jury was empaneled to consider criminal charges. The grand jury focused on the possible grounds for charges in four areas:<ref>{{Cite book | last = Epstein

* A conspiracy by protesters to cross state lines to incite a riot
* Violations by police of the civil rights of demonstrators by use of excessive force
* TV network violations of the Federal Communications Act
* TV network violations of federal wiretap laws.

Over the course of more than six months the grand jury met 30 times and heard some 200 witnesses. However, President Lyndon Johnson's [[Attorney General]], [[Ramsey Clark]], discouraged an indictment, believing that the violence during the convention was primarily caused by actions of the Chicago police. The grand jury returned indictments only after President [[Richard Nixon]] took office and [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]] assumed the office of Attorney General. On March 20, 1969, eight protesters were charged with various crimes and eight police officers were charged with civil rights violations.

== Charges ==

The eight defendants were charged under the anti-riot provisions of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]]<ref name="civrightsact">{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/conventions/chicago/facts/chicago68/index.shtml | work=CNN | title=Brief History Of Chicago's 1968 Democratic Convention | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref> which made it a federal crime to cross state lines with the intent to incite a riot. The Chicago 8 indictment alleged crimes of three kinds:

* That all eight defendants conspired (together with another sixteen unindicted co-conspirators) to cross state lines to incite a riot, to teach the making of an incendiary device, and to commit acts to impede law enforcement officers in their lawful duties.
* That David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and Bobby Seale individually crossed state lines to incite a riot.
* That John Froines and Lee Weiner instructed other persons in the construction and use of an incendiary device.

The sixteen unindicted co-conspirators were: Wolfe B. Lowenthal, [[Stew Albert|Stewart E. Albert]], Sidney M. Peck, [[Kathy Boudin]], Corina F. Fales, Benjamin Radford, Thomas W. Neumann, Craig Shimabukuro, Bo Taylor, David A.

==Trial==
[[File:Constrial3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bobby Seale]] as depicted by [[Franklin McMahon]] at the trial.]]

The original eight defendants, indicted by the grand jury on March 20, 1969, were [[Abbie Hoffman]], [[Jerry Rubin]], [[David Dellinger]], [[Tom Hayden]], [[Rennie Davis]], [[John Froines]], [[Lee Weiner]], and [[Bobby Seale]]. The defense attorneys were [[William Kunstler]] and [[Leonard Weinglass]] of the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]]. The judge was [[Julius Hoffman]]. The prosecutors were Richard Schultz and [[Tom Foran]]. The trial began on September 24, 1969, and on October 9 the [[United States National Guard]] was called in for crowd control as demonstrations grew outside the courtroom.

Early in the course of the trial, [[Black Panther Party]] activist [[Bobby Seale]] hurled bitter attacks at Judge Hoffman in court, calling him a "fascist dog", a "[[:wikt:honky|honky]]", a "pig", and a "[[racism|racist]]", among other things. Seale had wanted the trial postponed so that his own attorney, [[Charles R. Garry|Charles Garry]], could represent him (as Garry was about to undergo [[gallbladder]] surgery). The judge denied the postponement, and refused to allow Seale to represent himself, leading to Seale's verbal onslaught. When Seale refused to be silenced, the judge ordered Seale bound and gagged in the courtroom, citing a precedent from the case of ''Illinois v. Allen''.<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/397/337/ US Supreme Court Center], 397 U.S. 337 (1970)</ref>  (This was alluded to in [[Graham Nash|Graham Nash's]] song, "[[Chicago (1970 song)|Chicago]]", which opened with: "So your brother's bound and gagged, and they've chained him to a chair"). Ultimately, Judge Hoffman severed Seale from the case, sentencing him to four years in prison for [[contempt of court]], one of the longest sentences ever handed down for that offense in the US up to that time.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,840376,00.html Contempt in Chicago], ''Time Magazine'', Friday, Nov. 14, 1969</ref>

The Chicago Eight then became the Chicago Seven, where the defendants, particularly [[Youth International Party|Yippies]] Hoffman and Rubin, mocked courtroom decorum as the widely publicized trial itself became a focal point for a growing legion of protesters. One day, defendants Hoffman and Rubin appeared in court dressed in judicial robes. When the judge ordered them to remove the robes, they complied, to reveal that they were wearing Chicago police uniforms underneath. Hoffman blew kisses at the jury. Judge Hoffman became the favorite courtroom target of the defendants, who frequently would insult the judge to his face.<ref name="Shande">{{cite news|title=Judge Hoffman Is Taunted at Trial of the Chicago 7 After Silencing Defense Counsel | author=J. ANTHONY LUKAS | date=February 6, 1970|work=The New York Times (paid access) |url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60716F6355B157493C4A91789D85F448785F9 | accessdate=October 7, 2008}}</ref> Abbie Hoffman (no relation) told Judge Hoffman "you are a 'shande fur de Goyim' [disgrace in front of the [[gentile]]s]. You would have served [[Hitler]] better."  He later added that "your idea of justice is the only obscenity in the room."<ref name="Shande" />  Both Davis and Rubin told the Judge "this court is bullshit."

"In Tribute", Pg 84</ref>}}

The trial extended for months, with many celebrated figures from the [[American left]] and counterculture called to testify, including singers [[Phil Ochs]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], and [[Country Joe McDonald]], writers [[Norman Mailer]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]], and activists [[Timothy Leary]] and [[Jesse Jackson|Rev. Jesse Jackson]]. Ochs, who was involved in planning for the demonstrations, told the court how he had acquired a pig to nominate as a presidential candidate. Rubin attempted to deliver the acceptance speech for the pig, named [[Pigasus (politics)|Pigasus]], but before he could finish police arrested him and Ochs under a livestock ordinance, a charge later changed to disorderly conduct.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/FTrials/Chicago7/ochs.html | title = Excerpts from the Testimony of Phil Ochs | accessdate =January 24, 2011 | publisher = [[Kansas City School of Law]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/galleries/chicago_1968_dnc/chicago_1968_dnc.html | title = Chicago DNC 1968 | accessdate =January 24, 2011 | date = August 20, 2008 |work=New York Daily News}}</ref>

==Contempt citations==
While the jury deliberated on the verdict, Judge Hoffman cited all the defendants—plus their lawyers Kunstler and  Weinglass—for numerous contempts of court, imposing sentences ranging from 2½ months to four years.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Verdict==
On February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty of conspiracy.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1970/Apollo-13/12303235577467-2/#title "The Chicago Seven: 1970 Year in Review, UPI.com"]</ref> Two (Froines and Weiner) were acquitted completely, while the remaining five were convicted of crossing state lines with the intent to incite a riot, a crime instituted by the anti-riot provisions of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]].<ref name="civrightsact"/> On February 20, they were sentenced to five years in prison. In addition, they were fined $5,000 each.<ref>[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Chicago7/Sentencing.html The Chicago Seven Trial: Excerpts from the Trial Transcript]</ref>

==Appeal==
On November 21, 1972, all of the convictions were reversed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] on the basis that the judge was biased in his refusal to permit defense attorneys to screen prospective jurors for cultural and racial bias.<ref>''United States v. Dellinger'', 472 F.2d 340 (7th Cir. 1972).</ref> The Justice Department decided not to retry the case. During the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys had been cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but all of those convictions were also overturned.

The contempt charges were retried before a different judge, who found Dellinger, Rubin, Hoffman, and Kunstler guilty of some of the charges, but opted not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.<ref>''In re Dellinger'', 461 F.2d 389 (7th Cir. 1972).</ref>

==Documentary and dramatic presentations==
{{Refimprove|section|date=October 2014}}
Mixing fact and fiction, [[Haskell Wexler]]'s 1969 film, ''[[Medium Cool]]'', centers around the relationship between a cameraman and young widow as they find themselves amid the turmoil and violence during the "long hot summer" of Chicago. Wexler mixed staged scenes with actual footage he shot from the demonstrations, his characters interacting with the protesters seamlessly. Indeed, at one point, the viewer can hear another filmmaker telling Wexler he is getting too close to the action.

French left-wing political filmmakers [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Jean-Pierre Gorin]], under the collective [[Dziga Vertov Group]], made a film depicting the trials in 1970 called ''Vladimir et Rosa''. In it, Judge [[Julius Hoffman]] becomes "Judge [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]]" and the accused become microcosms of [[French revolution]]ary society. [[V.I. Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Karl Rosa]] also appear, played by Godard and Gorin, respectively.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066532 IMDB ''Vladimir et Rosa'']</ref>

In the 1971 [[Peter Watkins]] film ''[[Punishment Park]]'', members of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] are put on trial for similar "crimes". Like [[Black Panther Party]] activist [[Bobby Seale]], one of the African-American defendants is bound and gagged.

Woody Allen satirized the trial in his 1971 film ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]''. Allen's character, Fielding Melish, is on trial and defending himself.  The judge orders Melish bound and gagged.  In the next scene, a bound and gagged Allen coerces a confession, à la Perry Mason, from a prosecution witness in his cross-examination.

In 1972, Playwright and screenwriter David Petersen's play "[[Little Orphan Abbie]]" based on the transcript of the trial, opened in Seattle, directed by Jody Briggs and starring Glenn Mazen. It got good reviews and sold out every night, which led to having its run extended twice. It was slated for production in New York by Joe Papp, but had to be postponed and finally cancelled due to extended runs of other plays. It was later produced in Los Angeles, first on stage at the Burbage Theater, directed by Ron Hunter, and later shot for television by Telemedia Productions, directed by Dick Studebaker. The television version used stock footage of the events in the parks and on the streets of Chicago during the riots.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 1987, [[HBO]] aired ''Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8'', a [[docudrama]] which re-enacted the trial using the court transcript as the primary source for the script.  All eight of the original defendants, along with defense attorneys [[William Kunstler]] and [[Leonard Weinglass]], participated in the project and provided commentary throughout the film.  It was awarded the 1988 [[CableACE Award]] for Best Dramatic Special.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.allmovie.com/work/conspiracy-the-trial-of-the-chicago-8-61687 | title = ''Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8'' | accessdate =January 24, 2011 | last = Siebert | first = Perry | publisher = [[Allmovie]]}}</ref>

In 1993, British playwright [[John Goodchild]] adapted the original trial transcripts for a [[radio play]] produced by [[L.A. Theatre Works]], titled ''[[The Chicago Conspiracy Trial]]''.  Its cast included [[David Schwimmer]] ([[Abbie Hoffman]]), [[Tom Amandes]] (Richard Schultz), [[George Murdock]] (Judge [[Julius Hoffman]]), and [[Mike Nussbaum]] ([[William Kunstler]]).  The play received a [[New York Festivals]] award in 1993.

The 2000 film, ''[[Steal This Movie]]'', mostly tells the story of Abbie Hoffman (played by [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]) but also looks at the trial.

In the 2007 film ''[[Chicago 10 (film)|Chicago 10]]'', Oscar-nominated director [[Brett Morgen]] intercuts archival footage from the period, including the events of August 1968, with animated scenes from the trial drawn from the court transcript. The film premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and released in theaters in February 2008.

A feature film made at the time of the trial, based on the trial transcript and distributed by [[New Line Cinema]], ''The Great Chicago Conspiracy Circus'', by [[Cannes]]-winning director [[Kerry Feltham]], was released in January 2008 on DVD. The film won the [[Berlin Film Festival]] jury prize,<ref>[http://www.kerryfeltham.com/KF%20filmography.htm Kerry Feltham]</ref> as well as positive reviews from the ''New York Times''<ref>{{cite news | author = A.

Archival footage of events at the Chicago demonstrations was featured in the 2010 documentary ''[[Phil Ochs: There but for Fortune]]''. The film, which also featured interviews with many of Ochs' associates, including Rubin and Hoffman, was a dual portrait of the singer-songwriter's career and the protest movements of the 1960s.<ref name = "Hollywood Reporter Review">{{cite news | first = David | last = Rooney | title = Phil Ochs: There But for Fortune – Film Review | date = January 2, 2011 | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/phil-ochs-fortune-film-review-67588 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | accessdate =January 8, 2011}}</ref><ref name = "NY Times Review">{{cite journal | title = Aspiring to Musical Power and Glory | journal = [[The New York Times]] | date = January 4, 2011 | first = Stephen | last = Holden | authorlink = Stephen Holden | pages = C6| id = | url = http://movies.nytimes.com/2011/01/05/movies/05phil.html | accessdate =January 8, 2011}}</ref>

'''Tate St Ives''' is an [[art gallery]] in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]], Cornwall, England, exhibiting work by modern British artists. The Tate also manages another, earlier, property in St Ives, the [[Barbara Hepworth Museum|Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden]] which it opened in 1980.

== The building ==
The three-storey building, designed by architects [[Evans and Shalev]], lies on the site of an old gas works, overlooking Porthmeor Beach. It was opened in 1993, the second regional gallery in the [[Tate Gallery]] network.

An extension to the gallery has been proposed in response to the large numbers of visitors the gallery attracts, with the aims of providing better education spaces and accommodating larger works of art. The plans have met with fierce objections from some parts of the local community. On 20 July 2010, [[Cornwall Council]] successfully bought the land for the proposed extension from the [[Penwith Housing Association]] which has pledged to use the money to build more homes for elderly people in the town.

== Community initiatives ==
The gallery's artist residency programme aims to develop the professional practice of artists who live and work in Cornwall.

'''Thomas Stevenson Drew''' (August 25, 1802 &ndash; January 1879) was the [[List of Governors of Arkansas|third elected]] [[governor of Arkansas|governor]] of the U.S. state of [[Arkansas]].

==Biography==
Drew was born in [[Wilson County, Tennessee]], and moved with his family to north [[Louisiana]] and then to southern Arkansas in 1818. He worked as a traveling salesman and schoolteacher. Drew settled in [[Clark County, Arkansas|Clark County]] in southern Arkansas.

In 1823, Drew was appointed Clark County Clerk. In 1827, he moved to [[Pocahontas, Arkansas|Pocohontas]], Arkansas, where he married Cinderella Bettis, daughter of the properous founder of that town, Ransom Bettis. His father-in-law gave the newlyweds {{convert|800|acre|km2}} of bottomland in Cherokee Bay near the town of Biggers in what is now [[Randolph County, Arkansas|Randolph County]], then [[Lawrence County, Arkansas|Lawrence County]]. The Drews prospered, having a  [[plantation]] and twenty African American [[slave]]s.

In 1832, Drew was elected judge of Lawrence County. In 1835, Drew and Bettis convinced the Arkansas Territorial Legislature to create Randolph County from Lawrence County. In 1836, Drew and Bettis held an infamous free barbecue complete with free liquor for the entire county in Pocahontas (then known as Bettis Bluff). The next day, the grateful attendees chose Pocahontas as the county seat in an upset election over the more populated community of Columbia. That same year, Drew gave the county land in downtown Pocahontas where a courthouse was constructed.

==Political career==
In 1836, Drew was chosen as a delegate to the Arkansas Constitutional Convention.  He was elected Governor in 1844 as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_arkansas/col2-content/main-content-list/title_drew_thomas.html|title=Arkansas Governor Thomas Stevenson Drew|publisher=National Governors Association|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> having secured the backing of the Conway-Sevier faction that had ruled Arkansas since territorial days.  His administration concentrated on the state's financial solvency and attempted to correct the state's bad credit as well as disunity within Democratic ranks. Under Drew, Arkansas became the first southern state to declare [[Thanksgiving Day]] as a state holiday. At his wife's urging, Drew secured passage of legislation protecting a woman's property which she brought into a marriage as her own separate entity, distinct from the husband's holdings.

Though Drew was the third person to be elected governor, he was the fourth in office because his predecessor, [[Samuel Adams (governor)|Samuel Adams]], had served as acting governor during much of 1844, having gained the office through the previous position as president of the [[Arkansas State Senate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theus50.com/arkansas/governors.php|title=State of Arkansas Governor|publisher=theus50.com|accessdate=June 11, 2011}}</ref>

Drew was re-elected governor in 1848. The next year, he dispatched a [[militia]] to [[Marion County, Arkansas|Marion County]] to suppress the [[Tutt-Everett War]]. Drew only served a year of his second term. He resigned in protest of the $1,500 annual salary, then provided for the governor, was inadequate. He retired from politics and concentrated on his own financial holdings.

In 1860, he was living in [[Sebastian County, Arkansas|Sebastian County]] near [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]] in western Arkansas.<ref>1860 Arkansas Census</ref> He moved to [[Weatherford, Texas|Weatherford]] west of [[Fort Worth, Texas]], and later moved to [[Hood County, Texas|Hood County]], Texas, where he died in the community of [[Lipan, Texas|Lipan]].

==Death and legacy==
Drew was originally buried in the Old [[Baptist]] Cemetery in Lipan. In 1923, his remains were exhumed and reburied at the Masonic Cemetery in Pocahontas, Arkansas, alongside the graves of Bettis, Cinderella, and several of the Drew children.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=11788156|title=Thomas Stevenson Drew|publisher= Find A Grave|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref>

One of Drew's brothers, [[Richard Maxwell Drew]], held several public offices in [[Claiborne Parish, Louisiana|Claiborne Parish]], Louisiana, including that of [[Louisiana State Legislature|state representative]] from 1848 until his death in 1850 at the age of twenty-eight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://house.louisiana.gov/H_PDFdocs/HouseMembership_History_CURRENT.pdf|title=Membership in the Louisiana House of Representatives, 1812-2012|publisher=house.louisiana.gov|accessdate=June 5, 2011}}</ref> [[Richard Cleveland Drew]], R. M. Drew's son and hence a nephew of Thomas Drew, was a [[Louisiana Circuit Courts of Appeal|circuit court]] judge from [[Webster Parish, Louisiana|Webster Parish]], which was created in 1871 from neighboring Claiborne Parish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/c/a/r/Richard-D-Carey/GENE1-0004.html|title=Descendants of William Caldwell|publisher=familytreemaker.genealolgy.com|accessdate=June 5, 2011}}</ref>

'''Intrinsic factor''' (IF), also known as '''gastric intrinsic factor''' (GIF), is a [[glycoprotein]] produced by the [[parietal cell]]s of the [[stomach]]. It is necessary for the absorption of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] (cobalamin) later on in the small intestine.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pocock, G and Richards, C|title=Human Physiology:The Basis of Medicine|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-019-856878-0|page=230|edition=3rd}}</ref> In humans, the gastric intrinsic factor [[protein]] is encoded by the ''GIF'' [[gene]].<ref name="pmid2071148">{{cite journal | author = Hewitt JE, Gordon MM, Taggart RT, Mohandas TK, Alpers DH | title = Human gastric intrinsic factor: characterization of cDNA and genomic clones and localization to human chromosome 11 | journal = Genomics | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 432–40 |date=June 1991 | pmid = 2071148 | doi = 10.1016/0888-7543(91)90329-D| url =  }}</ref>

[[Haptocorrin]] (also known as HC, R protein, and transcobalamin I, TCN1), is a glycoprotein secreted by the [[salivary gland]]s which binds to  vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is acid sensitive and in binding to transcobalamin I it can safely pass through the acidic stomach to the duodenum. Here in the less acidic environment of the small intestine, pancreatic enzymes digest the glycoprotein carrier and vitaminB<sub>12</sub> can then bind to intrinsic factor. This new complex is then absorbed by the epithelial cells ([[enterocyte]]s) of the ileum. Inside the cells, B<sub>12</sub> dissociates once again and binds to another protein, [[transcobalamin| transcobalamin II]] (TCN2). The new complex can then exit the epithelial cells to be carried to the liver.

== Site of secretion ==
The intrinsic factor is secreted by the stomach. It is present in the gastric juice as well as in the gastric mucous membrane. The optimum pH for its action is 7 and it is inactivated at temperatures above 45&nbsp;°C. It does not necessarily run parallel with the amount of [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]] or [[pepsin]] in the gastric juice. So in some cases, the intrinsic factor may be present even if there is no HCl or pepsin or vice versa. The site of formation of the intrinsic factor varies in different species. In pigs it is obtained from the pylorus and beginning of the [[duodenum]]. In human beings it is present in the [[Fundus (stomach)|fundus]] and body of the [[stomach]].

== Clinical significance ==
In [[pernicious anemia]], which is usually an [[autoimmune disease]], [[autoantibody|autoantibodies]] directed against intrinsic factor or parietal cells themselves lead to an intrinsic factor deficiency, [[malabsorption]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and subsequent [[megaloblastic anemia]]. [[Atrophic gastritis]] can also cause intrinsic factor deficiency and anemia through damage to the parietal cells of the stomach wall. [[Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency|Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency]] can interfere with normal dissociation of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> from its binding proteins in the small intestine, preventing its absorption via the intrinsic factor complex.

Other risk factors contributing to pernicious anemia are anything that damages or removes a portion of the stomach's parietal cells, including [[bariatric surgery]], gastric tumors, gastric ulcers, and excessive consumption of alcohol.

== Treatment ==
Patients experiencing an insufficiency in their intrinsic factor levels cannot benefit from a low dose oral vitamin B<sub>12</sub> supplement, because it will not absorb through the wall of the small intestine. Historically, the disease was thought untreatable before the discovery that it could be managed with daily uptake of 300 g raw liver pulp (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1934 to Whipple, Minot & Murphy). Unlike other water-soluble vitamins, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is stored in the liver. The high dose of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus ingested allows enough of it to be taken up passively. As more and more potent liver extracts became available this repugnant treatment became unnecessary, improving the life quality of the patients. Today, synthetic vitamin B<sub>12</sub> can be injected monthly, thus bypassing the digestive tract altogether.

'''Samuel Adams''' (June 5, 1805 – February 27, 1850) was an American politician and [[List of Governors of Arkansas|third]] [[Governor of Arkansas|governor]] of [[Arkansas]]. 

==Biography==
Adams was born in [[Halifax County, Virginia]]. Adams was self-taught and moved to Arkansas in 1835, where he became a planter and was active in Arkansas politics.

==Career==
Adams was a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], and was elected to the [[Arkansas Senate]] in 1840. He was reelected and served as president of the Senate during his second term.

On April 29, 1844, Governor [[Archibald Yell]] resigned from his office to run for the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Adams, who was president of the Arkansas Senate at that time, became Acting [[Governor of Arkansas]] and served until November 5, 1844.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nga.org/cms/render/live/en/sites/NGA/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_arkansas/col2-content/main-content-list/title_adams_samuel.html|title=Arkansas Governor Samuel Adamspublisher=National Governors Association|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> During his short term he focused on [[internal improvements]] and education, and left a surplus in the state treasury when he left office.

In 1846, Adams was elected to the office of State Treasurer and served in that position until his death.

==Death and legacy==
Samuel Adams died in [[Saline County, Arkansas]]. Adams is buried in the historic [[Mount Holly Cemetery]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=7421625|title=Samuel Adams|publisher= Find A Grave|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref>

Adams was the stepfather of Civil War General [[James Fleming Fagan]]. An engraving of Samuel Adams graced Arkansas Civil War treasury notes.

{{Catholic-cleanup|date=September 2013}}
The '''relations between the Catholic Church and the state''' have been constantly evolving with various forms of government, some of them controversial in retrospect. In its history it has had to deal with various concepts and systems of governance, from the [[Roman Empire]] to the [[mediaeval]] [[divine right of kings]], from nineteenth and twentieth century concepts of democracy and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] to the appearance of [[left-wing politics|left-]] and [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] dictatorial regimes. Although the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s decree [[Dignitatis Humanae]] emphasized that people must not be coerced in matters of religion, it "leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion and toward the one Church of Christ", i.e., that in an ideal society the [[Catholic Church]] would be recognized as the official religion of the state.

==Catholicism and the Roman Emperors==
[[Christianity]] emerged in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]] as one of many new religions in the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Early Christians]] were persecuted as early as 64 A.D. when [[Nero]] ordered large numbers of Christians executed in retaliation for the [[Great Fire of Rome]]. Christianity remained a  growing, albeit, minority religion in the empire for several centuries. Roman persecutions of Christians climaxed with the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] at the turn of the 4th century. Following [[Constantine the Great]]'s victory on [[Milvian Bridge]], which he attributed to a Christian omen he saw in the sky, the [[Edict of Milan]] declared that the empire would no longer sanction persecution of Christians. Following Constantine's deathbed conversion in 337 all emperors adopted Christianity, except for [[Julian the Apostate]] who, during his brief reign, attempted unsuccessfully to re-instate [[paganism]].

In the Christian era (more properly the era of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils]]) the [[Catholic Church|Church]] came to accept it was the Emperor's duty to use secular power to enforce religious unity, anyone within the Church who did not subscribe to Catholic Christianity was seen as a threat to the dominance and purity of ''"the one true faith"'' and they saw it as their right to defend this by all means at their disposal.<ref>"The First Christian Theologians: An Introduction to Theology in the Early Church", Edited by Gillian Rosemary Evans, contributor Clarence Gallagher SJ , "''The Imperial Ecclesiastical Lawgivers''", p68, Blackwell Publishing, 2004, ISBN 0-631-23187-0</ref>

Beginning with [[Edward Gibbon]] in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' some historians have taken the view that Christianity weakened the Roman Empire through its failure to preserve the pluralistic structure of the state. Pagans and Jews lost interest and the Church drew the most able men into its organisation to the detriment of the state.<ref>''On Pagans, Jews, and Christians'', [[Arnaldo Momigliano]], p. 158, ISBN 0-8195-6218-1</ref>

Some historians have argued that the institution of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire mixed secular and temporal power in a way which would lead to problems for both [[Catholic Church|Church]] and state and which can ultimately only be resolved through the [[separation of church and state]].  The question of the proper delineation of church and state remains an open question to this day. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==The papacy and the Divine Right of Kings==
The doctrine of the [[divine right of kings]] came to dominate mediaeval concepts of kingship, claiming [[Bible|biblical]] authority (''[[Epistle to the Romans]]'', chapter 13). [[Augustine of Hippo]] in his work ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' had stated his opinion that while the ''City of Man'' and the ''City of God'' may stand at cross-purposes, both of them have been instituted by [[God]] and served His ultimate will. Even though the City of Man --- the world of [[secularism|secular]] government --- may seem ungodly and be governed by sinners, it has been placed on earth for the protection of the City of God. Therefore, monarchs have been placed on their thrones for God's purpose, and to question their authority is to question God. Although it is worth mentioning that Augustine also said "a law that is not just, seems to be no law at all" and [[Thomas Aquinas]] indicated laws "opposed to the Divine good" must not be observed.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2096.htm#4 Summa Theologica on The power of human law]</ref> However it was discouraged for Roman Catholics to take action to overthrow even [[tyrant|tyrannical governments]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

This belief in the god-given authority of monarchs was central to the Roman Catholic vision of governance in the [[Middle Ages]], [[Renaissance]] and ''[[Ancien Régime]]''. Although this was most true of what would later be termed the [[Ultramontanism|ultramontaine]] party and the Catholic Church has recognized, on an exceptional basis, Republics as early as 1291 in the case of [[San Marino]].<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13449a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]</ref> It believed that only God, and the Roman Catholic Church itself as God's agent, could depose a monarch. In a society based on an alliance of ''throne and altar'', the Church itself became part of the mediaeval governing elite.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} A senior cleric, usually an [[archbishop]] or [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] ''anointed'' and crowned a monarch. [[Emperor]]s were crowned by the [[Pope]], starting with [[Charlemagne]] and continuing throughout the [[Holy Roman Empire]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

During early medieval times, a near-monopoly of the Church in matters of education and of literary skills accounts for the presence of churchmen as their advisors. This tradition continued even as education became more widespread. Prominent examples of senior members of the church hierarchy who advised monarchs were Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]] in [[England]], and Cardinals [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]] and [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]] in France; prominent, devoutly Catholic laymen like such as Sir [[Thomas More]] also served as senior advisors to monarchs.

Besides advising monarchs, the Church held direct power in mediaeval society as a landowner, a power-broker, a policy maker, etc. Some of its [[bishop]]s and [[archbishop]]s were feudal [[lord]]s in their own right, equivalent in rank and precedence to [[count]]s and [[duke]]s. Some were even [[monarch|sovereign]]s in their own right, and the Pope himself ruled the [[Papal States]]. Bishops played a prominent role in [[Holy Roman Empire]] as [[prince-elector|electors]]. As late as the 18th century, in the era of [[the Enlightenment]], [[Jacques-Benigne Bossuet]], preacher to [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], defended the doctrine of the divine right of kings and [[absolute monarchy]] in his [[sermon]]s. The Church was a model of [[hierarchy]] in a world of hierarchies, and saw the defense of that system as its own defense, and as a defense of what it believed to be a god-ordained system.

During the [[French Wars of Religion]], the [[Monarchomachs]] began to contest the divine right of kings, setting up the bases for the theory of [[popular sovereignty]] and theorizing the right of [[tyrannicide]]s.

===The French Revolution===
The central principle of the medieval, Renaissance and ''ancien régime'' periods, monarchical rule 'by God's will', was fundamentally challenged by the 1789 [[French Revolution]]. The revolution began as a conjunction of a need to fix [[France|French]] national finances and a rising [[middle class]] who resented the privileges of the [[clergy]] (in their role as the [[Estates General (France)|First Estate]]) and [[nobility]] (in their role as the [[Estates General (France)|Second Estate]]). The pent-up frustrations caused by lack of political reform over a period of generations led the revolution to spiral in ways unimaginable only a few years earlier, and indeed unplanned and unanticipated by the initial wave of reformers. Almost from the start, the revolution was a direct threat to clerical and noble privilege: the legislation that abolished the [[feudalism|feudal]] privileges of the Church and nobility dates from August 4, 1789, a mere three weeks after the [[fall of the Bastille]] (although it would be several years before this legislation came fully into effect).

At the same time, the revolution also challenged the theological basis of royal authority. The doctrine of [[popular sovereignty]] directly challenged the former divine right of kings. The king was to govern on behalf of the people, and not under the orders of God. This philosophical difference over the basis of royal and state power was paralleled by the rise of a short-lived [[democracy]], but also by a change first from [[absolute monarchy]] to [[constitutional monarchy]] and finally to [[republicanism]].

Under the doctrine of the divine right of kings, only the Church or God could interfere with the right of a monarch to rule. Thus the attack on the French absolute monarchy was seen as an attack on God's anointed king. In addition, the Church's leadership came largely from the classes most threatened by the growing revolution. The upper clergy came from the same families as the upper nobility, and the Church was, in its own right, the largest landowner in France.

The revolution was widely seen, both by its proponents and its opponents, as the fruition of the (profoundly secular) ideas of [[the Enlightenment]]. The 1789 ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'', voted by the National Constituent Assembly, seemed to some in the church to mark the appearance of the [[antichrist]], in that they excluded Christian morality from the new 'natural order'. The fast-moving nature of the revolution far outpaced Roman Catholicism's ability to adapt or come to any terms with them.

In speaking of "the Church and the Revolution" it is important to keep in mind that neither the Church nor the Revolution were monolithic. There were class interests and differences of opinion inside the Church as well as out, with many of the lower clergy—and a few bishops, such as [[Talleyrand]]—among the key supporters of the early phases of the revolution. The [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]], which turned Church lands into state property and the clergy into employees of the state, created a bitter division within the church between those "jurors" who took the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|required oath of allegiance to the state]] (the [[abbé Grégoire]] or [[Pierre Daunou]]) and the "non-jurors" who refused to do so. A majority of parish priests, but only four bishops, took the oath.

As a large-scale landowner tied closely to the doomed ''[[ancien regime]]'', led by people from the [[aristocracy]], and philosophically opposed to many of the fundamental principles of the revolution, the Church, like the absolute monarchy and the feudal nobility, was a target of the revolution even in the early phases, when leading revolutionaries such as [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] were still well-disposed toward King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] as an individual. Instead of being able to influence the new political elite and so shape the public agenda, the Church found itself sidelined at best, detested at worst. As the revolution became more radical, the new state and its leaders set up its own rival deities and religion, a [[Cult of Reason]] and, later, a [[deism|deistic]] [[cult of the Supreme Being]], closing many Catholic churches, transforming cathedrals into "temples of reason", disbanding monasteries and often destroying their buildings (as at [[Cluny]]), and seizing their lands. In this process many hundreds of Catholic priests were killed, further polarising revolutionaries and the Church.  The revolutionary leadership also devised a [[French Revolutionary Calendar|revolutionary calendar]] to displace the Christian months and the seven-day week with its [[Sabbath in Christianity|sabbath]]. Catholic reaction, in anti-revolutionary risings such as the [[revolt in the Vendée]] were often bloodily suppressed.

===France after the Revolution===
When [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] came to power in 1799, he began the process of coming back to terms with the Catholic Church. The Church was reestablished in power during the [[Bourbon Restoration]], with the [[ultra-royalist]]s voting laws such as the [[Anti-Sacrilege Act]]. The Church was then strongly [[counter-revolutionary]], opposing all changes made by the 1789 Revolution. The [[July Revolution]] of 1830 marked the end of any hope of a return to the ''ancien regime'' status of an absolute monarchy, by establishing a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The most reactionary aristocrats, in favor of an integral restoration of the ''Ancien Régime'' and known as [[Legitimist]]s, began to retire from political life.

However, [[Napoleon III]]'s regime did support the Pope, helping to restore [[Pope Pius IX]] as ruler of the Papal States in 1849 after there had been a revolt there in 1848. Despite this official move, the process of secularism continued throughout the 20th century, culminating with the [[Jules Ferry laws]] in the 1880s and then with the [[1905 law on separation of the Church and the state]], which definitely established state secularism (known as ''[[laïcité]]'').

The Church itself remained associated with the [[Comte de Chambord]], the [[Legitimist]] pretender to the throne. It was only under [[Pope Leo XIII]] (r: 1878-1903) that the Church leadership tried to move away from its anti-Republican associations, when he ordered the deeply unhappy French Church to accept the [[Third French Republic]] (1875–1940) (''[[Inter innumeras sollicitudines]]'' [[List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII|encyclical of 1892]]). However, his liberalising initiative was undone by [[Pope Pius X]] (r: 1903-1914), a traditionalist who had more sympathy with the French monarchists than with the Third Republic.

===Catholicism in the United Kingdom and Ireland===
Following [[William III of England|William of Orange]]'s victories over [[James II of England|King James II]], by 1691 the supremacy of [[Protestantism]] was entrenched throughout the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]. The economic and political power of Catholics, especially in [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], was severely curtailed. This was reinforced by the introduction of the [[Penal Laws]]. The practice of Catholicism (including the celebration of [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]]) was made illegal as Catholic priests celebrated the sacraments at risk of execution by law.

However, towards the end of the eighteenth century a ''rapprochement'' began to develop between [[London]] and the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]'s activities abroad and relations with Catholic countries were hampered by the tension that existed between it and the Church, and it was eager to persuade the Church to end its moral support for Irish separatism. Likewise, the Church was keen to send [[missionary|missionaries]] to the newly conquered [[colony|colonies]] of the [[British Empire]], especially [[Africa]] and [[India]], and to ease the restrictions on its British and Irish adherents. Britain began to phase out the penal laws, and in 1795 it financed the building of [[St. Patrick's College, Maynooth]], a seminary for the training of Catholic priests, in [[County Kildare]]. In return, the Church agreed to actively oppose Irish separatism, which it duly did in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. It has continued this policy right up to the present day, condemning each successive attempt by [[Irish republicanism]] to achieve independence from Britain through violence. Catholic missions to Africa began early in the 1800s.

===Pius IX and the 'errors of the world'===
The nineteenth century was dominated by attitudes shaped by the French Revolution and its aftermath. The concept of revolution as a means of achieving dramatic change had grown in popularity, as had the belief that the citizenry had rights. These ideas became of particular importance in the Italian peninsula, which was divided up between a number of states, notably the [[Piedmont (Italy)|Kingdom of Piedmont]] to the north, the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] to the south, and in between the ''Patrimony of St. Peter'', more commonly known as the [[Papal States]], a collection of states controlled by the Pope for many centuries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Growing Italian nationalistic demands for the creation of an all-Italy state came to a head in the 1840s. In 1846 the liberal-leaning Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti became [[Pope Pius IX]]. Pius's liberal policies, in contrast with the autocracy of his predecessors, led to growing belief that under him the Papal States would not stand in the way of Italian unification. However the 1848 outbreak of revolution in Italy (alongside France, where King Louis Philippe lost his throne, in Austria and even unsuccessfully in tame versions in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], shocked Pius, who himself, when unwilling to support [[Italian nationalism]], was forced to flee into exile, producing a short-lived Roman Republic. Pius on his return, abandoned the liberalism that had been his trademark, returned to the more traditional conservatism of his immediate predecessors and spent the rest of his papacy condemning nationalism, populism and [[democracy]], most dramatically his 1864 papal [[encyclical]] ''[[Quanta Cura]]'' and its attached ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]''. Under Pius IX, the Church set itself against all the new theories of popular [[sovereignty]] and rights of citizens, which, having been fringe ideas on the left at the time of the French Revolution of 1789, had now gained widespread acceptance among moderate opinion. Pius's continuing defense of the ''Divine Right of Kings'' and his insistence on condemning policies and perspectives championed by such leaders as [[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[William Ewart Gladstone]] (United Kingdom), [[Daniel O'Connell]] and [[Issac Butt]] (Ireland), and [[Abraham Lincoln]], earned for him and the Papal States widespread international criticism. Pius's world still looked back on the pre-revolutionary theory of the alliance of ''throne and altar'', as the embodiment of God's design for government, with God's king and God's church together governing as God's will.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Ironically, given that many of the ideas which so appalled Pope Pius IX came from France via the revolutions of 1789 and after, Pius's control of the Papal States rested on France, whose army under Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] defended the Papal States from attack. But the [[Franco-Prussian War]] forced Napoleon III to take back his soldiers in his own ultimately unsuccessful attempt to defend his imperial throne. Without the French Emperor's protection, the Papal States and Rome fell to invading Piedmontese troops. For Pius the final evidence of the sinfulness of the modern world was the seizure by secular troops of the Vicar of Christ's own lands. The [[First Vatican Council]], which had been meeting and which had only just proclaimed the pope [[papal infallibility|infallible]] in matters of faith and morals, was itself a victim of the invasion and never reassembled. Though infallibility was not a political concept, some of Pius's critics thought its proclamation was meant to bolster his [[moral authority]] as the Vicar of Christ, perhaps discouraging Italian nationalists from attacking the Pope's own Rome. In reality it was merely a doctrinal issue, not a political one. Pope Pius, stripped of his temporal power retreated into the Vatican Palace and declared himself the "prisoner in the Vatican", while the King of Piedmont, now proclaimed ''King of Italy'', was installed in the former papal residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Pius, initially a liberal, by the end of his reign saw the world in apocalyptic terms; the attack on the symbols of God (thrones, the papacy, the Church), the triumph of godless ideas  Pius by the end was a believer in the world of throne and altar that had been undermined through the French Revolution. In his view, God's will for government, his anointed kings were being swept away, as power moved to the un-anointed masses. In 1878 Pius died, broken by a world he could not understand and which he believed had left God to one side for the world of the "mob". It was an analysis increasingly abandoned by most leaders in Europe and the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Leo XIII===
[[Pope Leo XIII]], seeing that [[popular democracy]] seemed to be on the ascendant, tried a new and somewhat more sophisticated approach to political questions than his predecessor Pius IX.

On May 15, 1891, Leo XIII issued an encyclical on political issues known as ''[[Rerum Novarum]]'' ([[Latin]]: "About New Things").  This addressed politics as it had been transformed by the [[Industrial Revolution]] and other changes in society that had occurred during the nineteenth century.  The document criticised [[capitalism]], complaining of the exploitation of the masses in industry.  However, it also sharply criticized the [[socialism|socialist]]'s concept of class struggle, and their proposed solution to eliminate private [[property]].  It called for strong governments to undertake a mission to protect their people from exploitation, and asked Roman Catholics to apply principles of social justice in their own lives.

This document was rightly seen as a profound change in the thinking of the [[Holy See]] about political matters.  It drew on the economic thought of St [[Thomas Aquinas]], whose "[[just price]]" theory taught that prices in a marketplace ought not to be allowed to fluctuate on account of temporary shortages or gluts.

Seeking to find some principle to replace the threatening [[Marxism|Marxist]] doctrine of [[class struggle]], ''Rerum Novarum'' urged social solidarity between the upper and lower classes, and endorsed [[nationalism]] as a way of preserving traditional [[morality]], [[convention (norm)|custom]]s, and [[Folkways (sociology)|folkways]].  In doing so, ''Rerum Novarum'' proposed a kind of [[corporatism]], the organisation of political societies along industrial lines that resembled mediaeval [[guild]]s.  Under corporatism, your place in society would be determined by the ethnic, work, and social groups you were born into or joined.  A one-person, one-vote democracy was rejected in favour of representation by interest groups.  A strong government was required to serve as the arbiter among competing factions.  Forty years later, the corporatist tendencies of ''Rerum Novarum'' were underscored by [[Pope Pius XI]]'s May 25, 1931 encyclical ''[[Quadragesimo Anno]]'' ("In the Fortieth Year"), which restated the hostility of ''Rerum Novarum'' to both unbridled competition and class struggle.

==The Church and the twentieth century==

===Spain===
{{Further|National Catholicism}}
In [[Spain]], the [[Falange]] enjoyed the support of many in the Roman Catholic Church.  Spain had a long history of contention between Catholic, largely monarchist, traditionalists and advocates of secular [[liberal democracy]], or of more radical [[anticlericalism|anticlerical]] views. Traditionalist Catholics, already alienated by the liberal secularism of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] whose democratically elected government imposed limitations and government intrusion upon the Church, were moved to outright hostility by what they viewed as the governments failure to prevent or punish attacks on churches and the killing of priests and others in religious orders by the various groups supporting the Republican government.  Almost [[Red terror (Spain)|7,000 clergy were killed]], despite the fact that very few actively engaged in the opposition.

These attacks were frequent in the first months of the civil war, and radicalised a large number of Catholics, including clergy, who had previously tended to support the [[reformist]] [[right-wing politics|right wing]] [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] party. A number of Catholics decided that the liberal state could not (or would not) protect them or their Church and switched to supporting Franco's rebel Nationalists.

Association with monarchists was particularly clear in the case of [[Carlism]], while [[Basque nationalism]] saw the majority of Basque priests break ranks with the Church to support the Republican government. This led to them being branded traitors and [[communism|communists]] by Franco.

Franco received the privileges of proposing trios of candidates from which the Pope would select a bishop in Spain, inheriting it from [[List of Spanish monarchs|Spanish monarchs]], and of being covered by a [[palio]] in processions.

During the 1960s and the 1970s, the movement of [[worker priest]]s expressed the view of young priests unhappy with the hierarchy and the government. They organized parishes as social bettering centers. The contacts with [[Marxism]] led many to join leftist groups or [[defrock|to secularize]]. An agreement of Church and State turned one [[seminary]] into a special jail for prisoners who were priests.

===France===
The pro-Catholic movement [[Action Française]] (AF), campaigned for the return of the monarchy and for aggressive action against Jews as well as a [[corporatist]] system. It was supported by a strong section of the clerical hierarchy, eleven out of seventeen cardinals and bishops. On the other hand, many Catholics regarded the AF with distrust, and in 1926, [[Pope Pius XI]] explicitly condemned the organization. Several writings of [[Charles Maurras]]', the leading ideologist of AF and, interestingly enough, an agnostic, were placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum at the same time. However, in 1939 [[Pope Pius XII]] waived the condemnation. Maurras' personal secretary, [[Jean Ousset]], later went on to found the [[Cité catholique]] fundamentalist organization along with former members of the [[Organisation armée secrète|OAS terrorist group]] created in defense of "French Algeria" during the [[Algerian War]]. Furthermore, the archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]], one of the leading Catholic figures opposed to the reforms brought by the [[Second Vatican Council]], created in 1970 the [[Society of St. Pius X]]. This finally led to the [[Ecône Consecrations]] during which Lefebvre consecrated four bishops without authority from the Vatican which was thought to have incurred automatic excommunications. However, these excommunications were nullified by Pope Benedict XVI in 2009. Since then, the [[Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei]] has been in dialogue with the [[Society of St. Pius X]] to resolve matters of doctrine and discipline in question.

===Ireland===
The Roman Catholic Church was granted "special recognition" in the [[Constitution of Ireland]] when it was drawn up in 1937, although other religions were also mentioned. This remained the case until 1972, when the constitution was amended by [[plebiscite]]. The considerable influence of the Church over Irish politics since independence in 1922 declined sharply in the 1990s after a series of scandals. In 1950 the Church helped force the resignation of the Minister for Health [[Noel Browne]] over his controversial proposals to provide free healthcare to mothers and children. The [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] gave the Church considerably more responsibility for education than they enjoyed in the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic]] and this remains the case today.

===Elsewhere in Europe===
The association of Roman Catholicism, sometimes in the form of the hierarchical church, sometimes in the form of lay Catholic organisations acting independently of the hierarchy produced links to [[dictator]]ial governments in various states.

* The Roman Catholic Church supported the dictator [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] in [[Portugal]];

* In [[Austria]], [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] turned a Roman Catholic political party into the single party of a [[one-party state]]. In rural Austria the Catholic [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] collaborated with the [[Heimwehr]] militia and helped bring Dollfuss to power in 1932. In June 1934, he produced his authoritarian constitution which stated "We shall establish a state on the basis of a Christian Weltanschauung". The Pope described Dollfuss as a "Christian, giant-hearted man ... who rules Austria so well, so resolutely and in such a Christian manner. His actions are witness to Catholic visions and convictions. The Austrian people, Our beloved Austria, now has the government it deserves".

* In [[Poland]], in 1920s [[Józef Pi?sudski]] founded a military-style government ([[Sanacja]]) that incorporated Catholic corporatism into its ideology. After the Second World War the Catholic Church was a focal point of opposition to the Communist regime. Many Catholic priests were arrested or disappeared for opposing the communist regime of [[People's Republic of Poland]]. [[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] encouraged opposition to the Communist regime in such a way that it would not draw retaliation, becoming (in a quote from CNN) "a resilient enemy of Communism and champion of human rights, a powerful preacher and sophisticated intellectual able to defeat Marxists in their own line of dialogue." After the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|fall of the Soviet Union]], Poland became a multiparty [[democracy]] and several parties which professed to defend Catholicism were legalised, like [[Solidarity Electoral Action|Akcja Wyborcza Solidarno??]] or [[League of Polish Families|Liga Polskich Rodzin]].

===Fascism===

For strategic reasons, it was desirable for the (essentially [[agnosticism|agnostic]]) [[fascism|fascist]] movements of [[Benito Mussolini]] in [[Italy]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] in [[Germany]] not to alienate Catholics ''en masse''.

Modern researchers are divided the degree of the Church's connection to fascism.  Most historians of the period reject most claims of active complicity or active resistance, painting a picture of a Catholic leadership who chose [[neutral country|neutrality]] or mild resistance over an explicit ideological struggle with fascism.

The closest ties of Roman Catholicism to fascism may have come in the ''[[clerical fascism]]'' in wartime [[Croatia]]; see [[Involvement of Croatian Catholic clergy with the Ustasa regime]].

====Italy====
In 1924, [[Pope Pius XI]] forbade the Catholic Popular Party to work with the Socialist Party against Mussolini's Fascist Party (whose politics at that time were a complex amalgam of left and right). The pope later dissolved the Catholic Popular Party .

Fear of [[communism]], and a certain disdain for the [[liberal democracy]] that had revoked the long-standing privileges enjoyed by the Catholic Church, were made explicit in such Papal documents as ''[[Quanta Cura]]'' and the ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]''. These documents have been interpreted by some as showing Church support for Fascism, or at least with leanings toward fascism. By the [[Lateran Treaties]], Mussolini granted [[Pope Pius XI]] the crown of [[Vatican City]] as a nation to rule, made Roman Catholicism the [[state church]] of [[Italy]], and paid the Pope compensation for the loss of the [[Papal States]]. This indicates at ''de facto'' recognition by the Pope of Mussolini's [[coup d'état|coup]].  The relationship to Mussolini's government deteriorated drastically in later years.

====Germany====
{{main|Reichskonkordat}}
The division of Germans between Catholicism and Protestantism has implicated German politics since the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' that followed [[German unification]] was the defining dispute between the German state and Catholicism.

In [[Weimar Germany]], the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] was the Catholic political party. It disbanded around the time of the signing of the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' (1933), the treaty that continues to regulate church-state relations to this day. Pius XI's encyclical ''[[Mit Brennender Sorge]]'' (1937) protested what it perceived to be violations of the ''Reichskonkordat''. The role of [[Catholic bishops in Nazi Germany]] remains a controversial aspect of the study of [[Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust]].

====Slovakia====
During [[World War II]], [[Jozef Tiso]], a Roman Catholic [[monsigneur]], became the Nazi [[Vidkun Quisling|quisling]] in [[Slovakia]]. Tiso was head of state and the security forces, as well as the leader of the paramilitary [[Hlinka Guard]], which wore the Catholic Episcopal cross on its armbands. The Catholic clergy was represented at all levels of the regime and its corporatist were based on papal encyclicals.

====Croatia====
Mike Budak, the Minister of Religion of [[Independent State of Croatia]], said on 22 July 1941:

:"The [[Ustashi]] movement is based on the Catholic Religion. For the minorities, Serbs, Jews and Gypsies, we have three million bullets. A part of these minorities has already been eliminated and many are waiting to be killed. Some will be sent to Serbia and the rest will be forced to change their religion to Catholicism. Our new Croatia will therefore be free of all heretics, becoming purely Catholic for the future years."
Notice the absence of a mention of [[Bosniaks|Bosnian Muslims]].
Unlike Serbs, they were considered Croatian brothers whose ancestors converted to Islam.

Controversy surrounds the depths of the involvement of the Roman Catholic clergy with the [[Ustase|Ustaše]], a Croatian Fascist movement in the former Yugoslavia. According to [[Branko Bokun]], a Roman Catholic priest made the following remarks on 13 June 1941:

"Brethren, up to now we have worked for the Holy Roman Apostolic Church with the cross and the missal. Now the moment has come to work with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other. The more Serbs and Jews you succeed in eliminating, the more you will be raised in esteem in the heart of the Roman Catholic Church".

The issue of [[clerical fascism]] in wartime Croatia is further discussed in the article [[Involvement of Croatian Catholic clergy with the Ustaša regime]].

====Belgium====
* The [[Belgium|Belgian]] Fascist movement [[Rexism]] arose out of a conservative Catholic movement and its publications. The full names of the Rexists was ''Christus Rex'' or "Christ the King"

{{See also|clerical fascism}}

===The United States===
Prior to 1960, the [[United States|U.S.]] had never had a [[Catholic]] president. Many [[Protestant]]s were afraid that if a Catholic were elected president, he would take orders from the [[Pope]]; this was one reason why [[Al Smith]] lost the [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928 election]].  Decades later another Catholic, [[John F. Kennedy]], spoke to a convention of [[Baptist]] pastors in [[Texas]] during his election campaign. He assured them that, if elected, he would put his country before his religion.

Since the late 1960s, the Catholic Church has been politically active in the U.S. around the "life issues" of [[abortion]], [[assisted suicide]] and [[euthanasia]], with some bishops and priests refusing communion to Catholic politicians who publicly advocate for legal abortion. This has created stigma within the Church itself however. The church has also played significant roles in the fights over [[capital punishment]], [[gay marriage]], [[welfare]], [[Secular state|state secularism]], various "peace and justice" issues, among many others.  Its role varies from area to area depending upon the size of the Catholic Church in a particular region, also it depends on the region's predominant ideology. For example, a Catholic church in the [[Southern U.S.]] would be more likely to be against universal health care than a Catholic church in [[New England]].

[[Robert Drinan]], a Catholic priest, served five terms in Congress as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Massachusetts]] before the [[Holy See]] forced him to choose between giving up his seat in Congress or being [[defrocking|laicized]].  The Church forbids Catholic priests from holding political office anywhere in the world ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PY.HTM Code of Canon Law 285 §3; 287 §2]).

Catholics currently active in [[Politics in the United States|American politics]] are members of both major parties, and currently hold many important offices. The most prominent include [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]], former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives [[Nancy Pelosi]], and former Governor of California [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. Additionally, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] former New Mexico governor [[Bill Richardson]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] former New York mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], both Catholics, sought the nomination for their respective parties in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]]. Five associate justices, [[Clarence Thomas]], [[Samuel Alito]], [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Sonia Sotomayor]], and [[Anthony Kennedy]], are members of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], resulting in a Catholic majority on the court. Vice President [[Joe Biden]] is also a Roman Catholic.

=== Argentina ===
{{Further|State-Church relations in Argentina}}

Secularism became enforced in Argentina in 1884 when President [[Julio Argentino Roca]] passed [[Argentine Law 1420|Law 1420]] on secular education. In 1955, the Catholics nationalists overthrewed General [[Juan Perón|Perón]] in the "''[[Revolución Libertadora]]''," and a concordat was signed in 1966. Catholic nationalists continued to play an important role in the [[politics of Argentina]], while the Church itself was accused of having set up [[ratlines (World War II)|ratlines]] to organize the evasion of [[former Nazi]]s after WWII. Furthermore, several important Catholic figures have been accused of having openly supported the "[[Dirty War]]" in the 1970s, including [[Pope Francis]], then-[[Archbishop of Buenos Aires]]. [[Antonio Caggiano]], Archbishop of Buenos Aires from 1959 to 1975, was close to the fundamentalist [[Cité catholique]] organisation, and introduced [[Jean Ousset]] (former personal secretary of [[Charles Maurras]], the leader of the [[Action française]])'s theories on [[counter-revolutionary warfare]] and "[[Subversion (politics)|subversion]]" in Argentina.<ref name="Verbitsky4">Quoted by [[Horacio Verbitsky]], in ''The Silence'', extract transl. in English made available by [[Open Democracy]]: [http://www.opendemocracy.net/content/articles/PDF/2709.pdf Breaking the silence: the Catholic Church in Argentina and the "dirty war"], July 28, 2005, p.4</ref>

=== Brazil ===
{{Further|Roman Catholicism in Brazil}}

===Australia===
Traditionally, Catholics in Australia had been predominantly of Irish descent. They have also been traditionally in the working-class. As a result, for much of its early history, the [[Australian Labor Party]] had a significant proportion of Catholics as members and supporters. However, this historical link has eroded over time and Catholics are now  present across the political spectrum. Prominent Archbishop [[Daniel Mannix]] was perhaps the most politically vocal Catholic figure, including in his opposition to conscription. This conscription debate was often framed in terms of a divide between Protestants and Catholics.

Links between the Catholic Church and Australian politics strengthened when the [[Australian Labor Party]] split and the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labour Party]] was founded, chiefly under the influence of [[Bob Santamaria]]. In one state, the Catholic Church threw its institutional support behind this party and the movements upon which it relied. However, after the Archbishop died, the party and the Industrial groups upon which it was based no longer had any Church support.

Prominent Catholics in the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal-National coalition]], the main centre-right political force in Australia, include Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]], [[Malcolm Turnbull]] and [[Christopher Pyne]]. Prominent Catholics in the Labor Party, the main centre-left party, include former Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]].

=== International Law ===
In 2003, Pope John Paul II also became a prominent critic of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 US-led invasion of Iraq]]. He sent his "Peace Minister", Cardinal [[Pio Laghi]], to talk with US President [[George W. Bush]] to express opposition to the war. John Paul II said that it was up to the [[United Nations]] to solve the international conflict through diplomacy and that a unilateral aggression is a crime against peace and a violation of [[international law]].

==Communism==
The Catholic Church has been a staunch defender of [[anti-Communism]],{{Clarify|reason=is the Catholic Church a defender of all anti-communists?|date=June 2012}} as the latter defined itself as [[atheist]] and often followed [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] policies.

Pope [[John Paul II]] offered support to the Polish [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement. Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] once said the collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] would have been impossible without John Paul II [http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/03/pope.gorbachev/index.html].

In later years, Popes have also criticised some of the more extreme versions of [[corporate capitalism]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}.

'''Spearfishing''' is an ancient method of [[fishing]] that has been used throughout the world for millennia. Early civilizations were familiar with the custom of spearing fish from rivers and streams using sharpened sticks.

Today modern spearfishing makes use of elastic powered [[speargun]]s and slings, or compressed gas pneumatic powered spearguns, to strike the hunted fish. Specialised techniques and equipment have been developed for various types of aquatic environments and target fish.

Spearfishing may be done using [[free-diving]], [[snorkelling]], or [[scuba diving]] techniques. Spearfishing while using scuba equipment is illegal in some countries. The use of mechanically powered spearguns is also outlawed in some countries and jurisdictions. Spearfishing is highly selective, normally uses no bait  and has no [[by-catch]].

==History==
[[File:Tomb of Usheret 01.jpg|thumb|Fisherman with a spear in a wall painting from the tomb of Usheret in Thebes, 18 Dynasty, around 1430 BC|alt=Photo of painting displaying man standing on boat with two small dogs, pointing spear at fish]]
Spearfishing with barbed poles ([[harpoon]]s) was widespread in palaeolithic times.<ref>Guthrie, Dale Guthrie (2005) [http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=3u6JNwMyMCEC&pg=PA298&lpg=PA298&dq=Cosquer+spear+fish&source=web&ots=JMnNQj1gPu&sig=2SgDhCZyGrWWNpMXz9y0DLSWmuE&hl=en#PPA298,M1 ''The Nature of Paleolithic Art.''] Page 298. University of Chicago Press. ISBN 0-226-31126-0</ref> [[Cosquer cave]] in Southern France contains cave art over 16,000 years old, including drawings of seals which appear to have been harpooned.

There are references to fishing with spears in ancient literature; though, in most cases, the descriptions do not go into detail. An early example from the [[Bible]] is in [[Book of Job|Job]] [[BibleWiki:Job Chapter 41, Verse 7|41:7]]: ''Canst thou fill his [Leviathan] skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?''.

The Greek historian [[Polybius]] (''ca'' 203 BC–120 BC), in his [[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]], describes hunting for swordfish by using a [[harpoon]] with a barbed and detachable head.<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+34.3 "Fishing for Swordfish"], ''Histories'' Book 34.3 ([[Evelyn S. Shuckburgh]], translator). London, New York: Macmillan, 1889. Reprint Bloomington, 1962.</ref>

Greek author [[Oppian|Oppian of Corycus]] wrote a major treatise on sea fishing, the ''Halieulica'' or ''Halieutika'', composed between 177 and 180. This is the earliest such work to have survived intact. Oppian describes various means of fishing including the use of spears and tridents.

In a parody of fishing, a type of [[gladiator]] called [[retiarius]] carried a [[trident]] and a [[Net casting|casting-net]]. He fought the [[murmillo]], who carried a short sword and a [[helmet]] with the image of a fish on the front.

[[Copper]] harpoons were known to the seafaring [[Harappa]]ns<ref>Ray 2003, page 93</ref> well into antiquity.<ref>Allchin 1975, page 106</ref> Early hunters in India include the [[Mincopie]] people, aboriginal inhabitants of [[India]]'s [[Andaman and Nicobar]] islands, who have used harpoons with long cords for fishing since early times.<ref>Edgerton 2003, page 74</ref>

==Traditional==
[[Image:Fishing arrow Guyana.JPG|thumb|right|Head of an arrow used for fishing, from [[Guyana]].]]
Spear fishing is an ancient method of fishing and may be conducted with an ordinary [[spear]] or a specialised variant such as an eel spear<ref>[http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/claremuseum/riches_of_clare/water/eel_spear2.htm Image of an eel spear].</ref><ref>[http://www.journalofantiques.com/June03/hearthJun03.htm Spear fishing for eels].</ref> or the [[trident]]. A small trident type spear with a long handle is used in the American South and Midwest for [[Frog gigging|gigging]] [[American bullfrog|bullfrog]]s with a bright light at night, or for gigging [[carp]] and other fish in the shallows.

Traditional spear fishing is restricted to shallow waters, but the development of the [[speargun]] allows fishing in deeper waters. With practice, divers are able to hold their breath for up to four minutes and sometimes longer; of course, a diver with [[Scuba set|underwater breathing equipment]] can dive for much longer periods.

==Modern==
In the 1920s, sport spearfishing using only watertight swimming goggles became popular on the [[Mediterranean]] coast of [[France]] and [[Italy]]. This led to development of the modern [[diving mask]], [[swimfin|fins]] and [[Snorkel (swimming)|snorkel]]. Modern [[scuba diving]] had its genesis in the systematic use of [[rebreather]]s by [[Italy|Italian]] sport spearfishers during the 1930s. This practice came to the attention of the [[Italian Navy]], which developed [[Decima Flottiglia MAS|its frogman unit]], which affected [[World War II]].<ref name=quick>{{cite journal |last=Quick |first=D. |title=A History Of Closed Circuit Oxygen Underwater Breathing Apparatus |journal=Royal Australian Navy, School of Underwater Medicine. |volume=[[RANSUM]]-1-70 |year=1970 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4960 |accessdate=2008-04-25 }}</ref>

During the 1960s, attempts to have spearfishing recognised as an Olympic sport were unsuccessful. Instead, two organisations, the [[International Underwater Spearfishing Association]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iusarecords.com |title=iusarecords.com |publisher=iusarecords.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-24}}</ref> (IUSA) and the [[Underwater Society of America#International Bluewater Spearfishing Records Committee|International Bluewater Spearfishing Records Committee]] (IBSRC), list world record catches by species according to rules to ensure fair competition. Spearfishing is illegal in many bodies of water, and some locations only allow spearfishing during certain seasons.

===Conservation===
Spearfishing has been implicated in local disappearances of some species, including the [[Atlantic goliath grouper]] on the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Bonaire]]-  the [[Nassau grouper]] in the barrier reef off the coast of [[Belize]], the giant [[Giant sea bass|black sea bass]] in [[California]], and others but these are not endangered species generally, despite what this book   ''The Unnatural History of the Sea'',<ref>Roberts, Callum. Island Press, 2007, p. 238</ref> indicates. 
Stories like this are not unusual as most SCUBA divers, without a true understanding of Spearfishing [or Underwater Hunting]- or the ability and courage to  participate - as it is very physically demanding, a vehement critics of it.  
On the other hand, in countries such as [[Australia and South Africa]] where the sport is regulated by state fisheries, spearfishing has been found to be the most environmentally friendly form of fishing due to being highly selective, having no by-catch, causing no habitat damage, nor creating pollution or harm to protected endangered species.<ref>{{cite conference |last1=Smith|first1=Adam |last2=Nakaya|first2=Seiji |title=Spearfishing – is it ecologically sustainable?|conference=3rd World Recreational Fishing Conference. 21–24 May 2002.|date=21–24 May 2002|pages=19–22|url=http://www.chbf.com/documents/sustainable_spearfishing.pdf|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref>  
In 2007, the Australian Bluewater Freediving Classic became the first spearfishing tournament to be accredited and was awarded 4 out of 5 stars based on environmental, social, safety and economic indicators.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sawynok|first1=Bill|title=2006/057:

===Shore diving===
[[File:Spearfisherman Ryu Kyu Islands July 2007.JPG|thumb|Spearfisherman hunting [[Yellowfin tuna]] in the [[Ryukyu Islands]]]]

Shore diving is perhaps the most common form of spearfishing and simply involves entering and exiting the sea from beaches or [[headlands]] and hunting around ocean structures, usually [[reef]], but also rocks, [[kelp]] or sand. Usually shore divers hunt at depths of {{convert|5|-|25|m}}, depending on location. In some locations in the South [[Pacific]], divers can experience drop-offs from {{convert|5|to|40|m}} close to the shore line. [[Shark]]s and reef fish can be abundant in these locations. 
In subtropical areas, sharks may be less common, but other challenges face the shore diver, such as managing entry and exit in the presence of big waves. Headlands are favoured for entry because of their proximity to deeper water, but timing is important so the diver does not get pushed onto rocks by waves. Beach entry can be safer, but more difficult due the need to consistently dive through the waves until the surf line is crossed.

Shore dives produce mainly reef fish, but oceangoing [[pelagic fish]] are caught from shore dives too, and can be specifically targeted.

Shore diving can be done with trigger-less spears such as pole spears or [[Hawaiian sling]]s, but more commonly triggered devices such as spearguns. Speargun setups to catch and store fish include speed rigs and fish stringers.

===Boat diving===
Boats, ships, kayaks, or even jetski can be used to access offshore reefs or ocean structure. Man-made structures such as oil rigs and [[Fish Aggregating Device]]s (FADs) are also fished. Sometimes a boat is necessary to access a location that is close to shore, but inaccessible by land.

Methods and gear used for boat diving are similar to shore diving or blue water hunting, depending on the target prey.

Boat diving is practised worldwide. Hot spots include Mozambique, the Three Kings islands of [[New Zealand]] ([[yellowtail]]), Gulf of Mexico oil rigs ([[cobia]], [[grouper]]) and the [[Great Barrier Reef]] ([[wahoo]], [[dogtooth tuna]]). 
The deepwater fishing grounds off Cape Point, (Cape Town, South Africa) have become popular with [[trophy hunting]], freediving spearfishers in search of Yellowfin Tuna.

===Blue water hunting===
Blue water hunting involves diving in open ocean waters for pelagic species. It involves accessing usually very deep and clear water and [[chumming]] for large pelagic fish species such as [[marlin]], [[tuna]], [[wahoo]], or giant [[trevally]]. Blue water hunting is often conducted in drifts; the boat driver drops divers and allow them to drift in the current for up to several km before collecting them. Blue water hunters can go for hours without seeing any fish, and without any ocean structure or a visible bottom the divers can experience [[sensory deprivation]] and have difficulty determining the size of a solitary fish. One technique to overcome this is to note the size of the fish's eye in relation to its body. Large specimens have a proportionally smaller eye.

The creation of the Australian Bluewater Freediving Classic in 1995 in northern New South Wales was a revolutionary way of creating interest and promotion of this format of conservative underwater hunting, and contributed to the formation of the International Bluewater Spearfishing Records Committee. The I.B.S.R.C. formed in 1996, was the first dedicated organization worldwide, created by recognized world leaders in blue-water hunting, to record and regulate the capture of pelagic species by blue-water hunters.

Notably, some blue water hunters use large multi-band wooden guns and make use of breakaway rigs to catch and subdue their prey. If the prey is large and still has fight left after being subdued, a second gun can provide a kill shot at a safe distance. This is acceptable to IBSRC and IUSA regulations as long as the spearo loads it himself in the water.

Blue water hunting is conducted worldwide, but notable hot spots include [[Mozambique]] ([[dogtooth tuna, wahoo, Giant Turrum (GT)]]), [[Tanzania]]([[dogtooth tuna, wahoo, Giant Turrum (GT), Spanish Mackerel]]), [[South Africa]] ([[yellowfin tuna, Spanish Mackerel, wahoo, marlin, Giant Turrum (GT)]]), [[Australia]] ([[dogtooth tuna, wahoo, Spanish Mackerel]]) and the South [[Pacific]] ([[dogtooth tuna]]).

===Freshwater hunting===
[[File:Freshwater spearfishing.jpg|thumb|A common carp shot with a band-powered speargun by a diver using snorkelling gear, Minnesota, USA.]]
Many US states allow spearfishing in lakes and rivers, but nearly all of them restrict divers to shooting only rough fish such as [[carp]], [[gar]], [[Ameiurus|bullheads]], suckers, etc. A few US states do allow the taking of certain gamefish such as [[Lepomis|sunfish]], [[crappies]], [[striped bass]], [[catfish]] and [[walleyes]]. Freshwater hunters typically have to deal with widely varying seasonal changes in water clarity due to flooding, algae blooms and lake turnover. Some especially hardy midwestern and north central SCUBA divers go spearfishing under the ice in the winter when water clarity is at its best.

In the summer the majority of freshwater spearfishermen use snorkelling gear rather than SCUBA since many of the fish they pursue are in relatively shallow water. Carp shot by freshwater spear fishermen typically end up being used as fertilizer, bait for trappers, or are occasionally donated to zoos.

Spearfishing with a hand held spear from land, shallow water or boat has been practised for thousands of years. The fisher must account for optical [[refraction]] at the water's surface, which makes fish appear higher in their line of sight than they are. By experience, the fisher learns to aim lower. Calm and shallow waters are favored for spearing fish from above the surface, as water clarity is of utmost importance.<ref>{{cite book

Spearfishing in this manner has some similarities to [[bowfishing]]. Also, see [[gigging]].

==Equipment==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
This is a list of equipment commonly used in spearfishing. Not all of it is necessary and spearfishing is often practised with minimal gear.
; Speargun : A [[speargun]] is an underwater fishing implement designed to fire a spear at fish.
; Polespear : [[Polespear|Pole spears]], or hand spears, consist of a long shaft with point at one end and an elastic loop at the other for propulsion. They also come in a wide variety, from [[aluminum]] or [[titanium]] metal, to [[fiberglass]] or [[carbon fiber]]. Often they are screwed together from smaller pieces or able to be folded down for ease of transport.
; Hawaiian slings : [[Hawaiian sling]]s consist of an elastic band attached to a tube, through which a spear is launched.
; Wet Suit : [[Wetsuit]]s designed specifically for spearfishing are often two-piece (jacket and high waisted pants or  'long-john' style pants with shoulder straps) and are black or are fully or partially camouflage. Camouflage patterns include, blue for open ocean, green or brown for reef hunting. Commonly they have a pad on the chest to aid in loading spearguns. Sometimes they have reinforced elbows or knees. Often they have an "open-cell" interior, which offers superior warmth because of its very close suction fit to the skin (consequently lubrication is required to put on an open-cell wetsuit). Nylon exteriors are generally used to protect the spearo wetsuit from reefs but more delicate uncovered "smooth skin" wetsuits are sometimes used when diving from boats, because they dry quickly.
; Weight belt or weight vest : These are used to compensate for wetsuit buoyancy and help the diver descend to depth.  Rubber belts, which can be quickly released in an emergency, have proven to be a particular popular design for spearfishing worldwide, such that most spearfishing equipment manufacturers now offer them.
; Fins : Fins for freedive spearfishing are much longer than those used in SCUBA to aid in fast ascent.  Typically a closed foot design is used by freediving (snorkelling) spearos, usually worn with neoprene socks, while open foot designs (which allow diving boots to be worn) are  more popular with SCUBA divers.
; Knife or cutters : A knife is carried as a safety precaution in case the diver becomes tangled in a spearline or floatline. It can also be used as an iki jime or kill spike.
; Iki jime or kill spike : In lieu of a knife, a sharpened metal spike can be used to kill the fish quickly and humanely upon capture. This action reduces interest from sharks by stopping the fish from thrashing. [[Iki jime]] is a Japanese term and is a method traditionally used by Japanese fishermen. Killing the fish quickly is believed to improve the flavor of the flesh by limiting the buildup of [[epinephrine|adrenaline]] in the fish's muscles.
; Buoy or float : A [[buoy]] is usually tethered to the spearfisher's speargun or directly to the spear. A buoy helps to subdue large fish. It can also assist in storing fish. But is more importantly used as a safety device to warn boat drivers there is diver in the area - usually by being large, brightly colored and flying a [[dive flag]] (the red-white "international" flag in the USA or the blue & white "alpha" flag elsewhere in the world). A typical spearo dive float will be torpedo-shaped, orange or red in colour with a volume of between 7 and 36 litres and display a dive flag on a short mast. However, other designs, such as inflatable mini-dinghy, planche (box), Tommy Botha (big game) and body-boards are also used.
; Floatline : A floatline connects the buoy to the speargun or to the weight-belt. Often made from braided polyester, they are also frequently made from mono-filament encased in an airtight plastic tube, or made from stretchable bungee cord.
; Gloves : Gloves are valuable to spearfishermen who desire to maintain a sense of safety or access more dangerous areas, such as those between coral, that could otherwise not be reached without use of the hands. They also aid in loading the bands on  rubber powered speargun and protect the spearfisher's hands from the teeth and spines of struggling fish. They are also used for warmth in colder climes.
; Fish Stringer : Usually a length of cable/cord/string/monofilament terminated by a loop (and sometimes a swivel) at one end and a large stainless steel pin/spike at the other.  The pin is typically 15–30&nbsp;cm long, 4-8mm diameter, with a sharp point at one end, and with the cable threaded through a hole, usually in the middle.  Can alternatively be a large, shaped loop of stainless steel.  Used to store speared fish on.  Usually attached to the dive float or around the waist of the diver.  The pin can optionally be used as an [[iki jime]] spike, to dispatch speared fish.
; Snorkel and diving mask: Spearfishing [[Snorkel (swimming)|snorkels]] and [[diving mask]]s are similar to those used for [[scuba diving]], although the masks usually have two lenses and a lower internal volume.

==Management==
Spearfishing is intensively managed throughout the world.

[[Australia]] allows only recreational spearfishing and generally only breath-hold free diving. State & territory governments impose numerous restrictions, demarcating Marine Protected Areas, Closed Areas, Protected Species, size/bag limits and equipment.  The body principally concerned with spearfishing is the [[Australian Underwater Federation]], Australia's peak recreational diving body. The AUF's vision for spearfishing is "Safe, Sustainable, Selective, Spearfishing". The AUF provides membership, advocacy and organises competitions.<ref>'AUF Spearfishing' home page at [http://www.auf-spearfishing.com.au Australian Underwater Federation], retrieved 02/07/2012.</ref>

[[Norway]] has a relatively large ratio of coastline to population, and has one of the most liberal spearfishing rules in the northern hemisphere. Spearfishing with scuba gear is widespread among recreational divers. Restrictions in Norway are limited to [[Fish migration|anadrome]] species, like atlantic [[salmon]], [[trout|sea trout]], and [[lobster]].<ref>[http://www.frivannsliv.no/spearfishing.no/Spearfishing.html Spearfishing in Norway]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref>

In [[Mexico]] a regular fishing permit allows spearfishing, but not electro-mechanical spearguns. Spearfishing with scuba gear is illegal and the use of power heads as well. Penalties are severe and include fines, confiscated gear and even imprisonment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conapescasandiego.org/contenido.cfm?cont=REGULATIONS |title=Sportfishing regulations, Conapesca Mexico San Diego Office |publisher=Conapesca San Diego |date= |accessdate=2014-03-24}}</ref>

[[United States]] has different spearfishing regulations for each state. In [[Florida]] spearfishing is restricted to several hundred yards offshore in many areas and the usage of a [[powerhead]] is prohibited within state waters. Many types of fish are currently under heavy bag restrictions.
In [[California]] only recreational spearfishing is allowed. California also imposes numerous restrictions, demarcating [[Marine protected areas]], closed areas, protected species, size/bag limits and equipment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/marine/regulations.asp |title=Ocean Fishing: Laws and Regulations |publisher=Dfg.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-03-24}}</ref>

In the UK, while spearfishing is not explicitly regulated, it is instead subject to both local (typically local bye-laws) and national-level [http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/marine/ legislation] relating to permitted fish species and minimum size limits.  For example, it is not permitted to spearfish in freshwater and the non-tidal reaches of rivers.

Under recent EU guidelines, recreational spearfishing is now explicitly permitted in the EUs Atlantic waters.

'''Perphenazine''' is a [[typical antipsychotic]] [[psychoactive drug|drug]].  Chemically, it is classified as a piperazinyl [[phenothiazine]]. Originally marketed in the US as Trilafon, it has been in clinical use for decades.

==Medical uses==
Perphenazine is used to treat psychosis (e.g. in people with [[schizophrenia]] and the [[mania|manic]] phases of [[bipolar disorder]]). Perphenazine effectively treats the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions, but its effectiveness in treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as [[flattened affect]] and [[poverty of speech]], is unclear. Earlier studies found the typical antipsychotics to be ineffective or poorly effective in the treatment of negative symptoms,<ref name="King">{{cite journal

In low doses it is used to treat [[clinical depression|agitated depression]] (together with an [[antidepressant]]). Fixed combinations of perphenazine and the [[tricyclic antidepressant]] [[amitriptyline]] in different proportions of weight exist (see Etrafon below). When treating depression, perphenazine is discontinued as fast as the clinical situation allows.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Perphenazine has no intrinsic antidepressive activity. Several studies show that the use of perphenazine  with [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac) in patients with psychotic depression is most promising, although fluoxetine interferes with the metabolism of perphenazine, causing higher plasma levels of perphenazine and a longer half-life. In this combination the strong [[antiemetic]] action of perphenazine attenuates fluoxetine-induced [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] (emesis), as well as the initial agitation caused by fluoxetine. Both actions can be helpful for many patients. 

Perphenazine has been used in low doses as a 'normal' or 'minor' tranquilizer in patients with a known history of addiction to drugs or alcohol, a practice which is now strongly discouraged.<ref> [http://www.mentalhealth.com/drug/p30-t05.html#Head_4 "Perphenazine, Warnings mentalhealth.com"], Retrieved 2010-1-24. </ref> {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Perphenazine has sedating and [[anxiolytic]] properties, making the drug useful for the treatment of agitated psychotic patients and, in high doses (up to 100&nbsp;mg per day), for patients with life-threatening (febrile) [[catatonia]], a state in which the patients are extremely agitated, but unable to express themselves. In this situation perphenazine may be used together with [[electroconvulsive therapy]] and correction of [[electrolyte]]s and fluids in the body.

A valuable off-label indication is the short-time treatment of [[hyperemesis gravidarum]], in which pregnant women experience violent nausea and vomiting. This problem can become severe enough to endanger the life of the unborn. As perphenazine has not been shown to be [[teratogenic]] and works very well, it is sometimes given orally in the smallest possible dose.

==Side effects==
As a member of the phenothiazine type of antipsychotics, perphenazine shares in general all allergic and toxic side-effects of [[chlorpromazine]].  A 2005 [[systematic review]] of the data on perphenazine conducted by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] concluded that "there were no convincing differences between perphenazine and other antipsychotics" in the incidence of adverse effects.<ref name="Hart">{{cite journal

When used for its strong [[antiemetic]] or [[antivertignosic]] effects in cases with associated brain injuries, it may obscure the clinical course and interferes with the diagnosis.  High doses of perphenazine can cause temporary dyskinesia.  As with other typical antipsychotics, permanent or lasting [[tardive dyskinesia]] is a risk.

==Pharmacokinetics==
It has an oral bioavailability of approximately 40% and a half-life of 8 to 12 hours (up to 20 hours), and is usually given in 2 or 3 divided doses each day. It is possible to give two-thirds of the daily dose at bedtime and one-third during breakfast to maximize hypnotic activity during the night and to minimize daytime [[sedation]] and [[hypotension]] without loss of therapeutic activity.

==Pharmacodynamics==

==Formulations==
It is sold under the brand names Trilafon (single drug) and Etrafon/Triavil (contains fixed dosages of amitriptyline). A brand name in Europe is Decentan pointing to the fact that perphenazine is approximately 5-times more potent than chlorpromazine. Usual oral forms are tablets (2, 4, 8, 16&nbsp;mg) and liquid concentrate (4&nbsp;mg/ml).

The 'Perphenazine injectable USP' solution is intended for deep [[intramuscular]] (i.m.) injection, for patients who are not willing to take oral medication or if the patient is unable to swallow. Due to a better bioavailability of the injection, two-thirds of the original oral dose is sufficient. The incidence of hypotension, sedation and extrapyramidal side-effects may be higher compared to oral treatment. The i.m.-injections are appropriate for a few days, but oral treatment should start as soon as possible.    

In many countries, depot forms of perphenazine exist (as perphenazine [[enanthate]]). One injection works for 1 to 4 weeks depending on the dose of the depot-injection. Depot-forms of perphenazine should not be used during the initial phase of treatment as the rare [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] may become more severe and uncontrollable with this form. Extrapyramidal side-effects may be somewhat reduced due to constant plasma-levels during depot-therapy. Also, patient compliance is sure, as many patients do not take their oral medication, particularly if feeling better once improvement in psychosis is achieved.

==Interactions==
Fluoxetine causes higher plasma-levels and a longer half-life of perphenazine, therefore a dose reduction of perphenazine might be necessary.

Perphenazine intensifies the central depressive action of drugs with such activity (tranquilizers, hypnotics, narcotics, antihistaminics, OTC-antiemetics etc.). A dose reduction of perphenazine or the other drug may be necessary.

In general, all [[neuroleptic]]s may lead to seizures in combination with the opioid tramadol (Ultram).

Perphenazine may increase the [[insulin]] needs of [[diabetic]] patients. Monitor [[blood glucose level]]s of insulin-dependent patients regularly during long-term treatment.

The '''German Catholic League''' ({{lang-de|Katholische Liga}}) was initially a loose confederation of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German states]] formed  on July 10, 1609 to counteract the [[Protestant Union]] (formed 1608), whereby the participating states concluded an alliance "for the defence of the Catholic religion and peace within the Empire." Modelled loosely on the more intransigent ultra-Catholic [[French Catholic League]] (1576), the German Catholic league initially acted politically to negotiate issues with the slightly older Protestant Union.

Nevertheless, the league's founding, as had the founding of the Protestant Union, further exacerbated long standing tensions between the [[Protestant]] [[Protestant Reformation|reformers]] and the members of the [[Catholic Church]] which thereafter began to get worse with ever more frequent episodes of civil disobedience, repression, and retaliations that would eventually ignite into the first phase of the [[Thirty Years' War]] roughly a decade later with the act of rebellion and calculated insult known as the [[Second Defenestration of Prague]] on 23 May 1618. Both the Protestant Union and the Catholic League were symptomatic of the increasingly intolerant behaviour towards others' personal religious/political beliefs of that era.

== Background ==
In 1555, the [[Peace of Augsburg]] was signed, which confirmed the result of the [[First Diet of Speyer]] (1526) and ended the violence between the [[Lutherans]] and the Catholics in Germany.

It stated that:
* German [[fürst|princes]] (numbering 225) could choose the religion (Lutheranism or Catholicism) for their realms according to their conscience (the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'').
* Lutherans living in an ''ecclesiastical state'' (under the control of a Catholic [[prince-bishop]]) could remain Lutherans.
* Lutherans could keep the territory that they had captured from the Catholic Church since the [[Peace of Passau]] (1552).
* The [[ecclesiastical province|ecclesiastical leaders]] of the Catholic Church (bishops) that converted to Lutheranism had to give up their territory (the principle called ''reservatum ecclesiasticum'').
Those occupying a state that had officially chosen either Lutheranism or Catholicism could not practice the religion differing to that of the state.

Although the Peace created a temporary end to hostilities, the underlying bases of the religious conflict remained unsolved. Both parties interpreted it at their convenience, the Lutherans in particular considering it only a momentary agreement. Further, [[Calvinism]] spread quickly throughout Germany, adding a third major Christian worldview to the region, but its position was not supported in any way by the Augsburg terms, since Catholicism and Lutheranism were the only permitted creeds.

== The foundation of the Catholic League ==
[[File:Katholische Liga Carl-Theodor von Piloty.jpg|thumb|left|Painting by [[Karl von Piloty]] showing the foundation of the Catholic League]]
The best documented reason of the foundation of the Catholic League was an incident in the town of [[Donauwörth]], a [[Free Imperial City]] within the territory of [[Bavaria]]. On April 25, 1606, the Lutheran majority of the town barred the Catholic residents of the town from holding an annual [[Procession|Markus procession]], to show the rule of their confession over the town. The Catholics, led by five monks, wanted to pass through the town and on to the nearby village of Ausesheim, showing their flags and singing hymns. They were permitted to do so by the terms of the [[Peace of Augsburg]]. The city council would only allow them to re-enter town without flags and singing. The conflict ended in a brawl.

On protest of the [[bishop of Augsburg]], Catholic Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] of [[Habsburg]] threatened an [[Imperial ban]] in case of further violation of the rights of the Catholic citizens. Nevertheless, next year similar anti-Catholic incidents of civil disobedience took place, and the participants of the Markus procession were thrown out of town.

Emperor Rudolf then declared an Imperial ban on the town and ordered [[Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria]] to execute the ban. Facing his army, the town surrendered. According to Imperial law, the disciplinary measures should not have been executed by the Catholic duke of Bavaria, but by the Protestant [[duke of Württemberg]], who, like Donauwörth, was a member of the [[Swabian Circle|Swabian Imperial Circle]]. Maximilian ''de facto'' absorbed the former Free Imperial City, which was a violation of Imperial law as well.

In the same year, the Catholic majority of the [[diet (assembly)|Reichstag]] meeting in the [[Diet of Augsburg]] resolved that the renewal of the Peace of Augsburg of 1555 should be conditional on the restoration of all church land appropriated since 1552. Acting on these events, the Protestant princes formed a military alliance on May 14, 1608, the [[Protestant Union]], whose leader was [[Frederick IV, Elector Palatine|Frederick IV]] of Wittelsbach, the [[Elector Palatine]].

To create a union of Catholic states as a counterpart to this Protestant Union, early in 1608 Maximilian started negotiations with other Catholic princes.<ref>{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia |wstitle=German (Catholic) League}}</ref> On July 5, 1608, the spiritual electors  manifested a tendency in favour of the confederacy suggested by Maximilian. Opinions were even expressed as to the size of the confederate military forces to be raised.

In July 1609, the representatives of the Prince-Bishops of [[Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg|Augsburg]], [[Bishopric of Constance|Constance]], [[Bishopric of Passau|Passau]], [[Bishopric of Regensburg|Regensburg]], and [[Bishopric of Würzburg|Würzburg]] assembled at [[Munich]]. The [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg]], having shown disapproval, was not invited, and the Prince-Bishop of [[Bishopric of Eichstädt|Eichstädt]] hesitated. On July 10, 1609, the participating states concluded an alliance "for the defence of the Catholic religion and peace within the Empire." The most important regulation of the League was the prohibition of attacks on one another. Instead of fighting, conflicts had to be decided by the laws of the Empire or, if these failed to solve the conflict, by arbitration within the League. Should one member be attacked, it had to be helped with military or alternatively  legal support. Duke Maximilian was to be the president, and the Prince-Bishops of Augsburg, Passau, and Würzburg his councillors. The League was to continue for nine years.

The Munich Diet failed to erect a substantial structure for the newly formed League. On June 18, 1609, the Electors of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], and [[Electorate of Trier|Trier]] had proposed an army of 20,000 men. They had also considered making Maximilian president of the alliance, and on August 30 they announced their adhesion to the Munich agreement, provided that Maximilian accepted the Elector of Mainz, arch-[[chancellor]] of the Empire, as co-president.

To create a structure, several general meetings of the members were arranged. On February 10, 1610, the representatives of all the important Catholic states, except for Austria and Salzburg — and a great number of the smaller ones — met at Würzburg to decide the organization, funding and arming of the League. This was the real beginning of the Catholic League. The [[Pope]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and the [[King of Spain]], who had been informed by Maximilian, were all favorably disposed towards the undertaking.

The main problem of the League was the unreadiness of its members. In April 1610, the contributions of all its members were not yet paid; Maximilian threatened to resign. To prevent him from doing so, Spain, which had made the giving of a subsidy dependent on Austria's enrollment in the League, waived this condition, and the pope promised a further contribution.

The conduct of the Union in the Jülich dispute and the warlike operations of the Union army in [[Alsace]] seemed to make a battle between League and Union inevitable.

In the year 1613 at Ratisbon, [[Austria]] joined  the League. The assembly now appointed no less than three war-directors: Duke Maximilian, and Archdukes Albert and Maximilian of Austria. The object of the League was now declared "a Christian legal defense" The membership of Austria made the League part of the struggles between the emperor and his Protestant vassals in [[Bohemia]] and [[Lower Austria]], that would lead to the beginning of the Thirty Years' War.

[[Image:Joachim von Sandrart 009.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Maximilian I, Elector and Duke of Bavaria]]
Duke Maximilian refused to accept the resolutions of Ratisbon and even resigned the post as president, when [[Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Maximilian III]] of Austria, the Prince Elector of Mainz and the Prince Elector of Trier, protested the inclusion of the [[Bishop of Augsburg]], and the [[Provost of Ellwangen]] in the [[Bavarian Directory]]. On May 27, 1617, with the Prince-Bishops of Bamberg, Eichstädt, Würzburg, and the Prince-Provost of Ellwangen, Bavaria formed a separate league for nine years.

At the end of 1618, the position of the Emperor in Bohemia as in Lower and [[Upper Austria]] gradually became critical. Searching for help, the Emperor tried to restore the League. A meeting of several of the ecclesiastical Princes decided to reconstruct the League on its original basis. It would consist of two groups: the Rhenish district under the presidency of Mainz, and the Oberland district, presided by Bavaria; the treasury and the military command were to be considered separate. Maximilian could only lead the whole of the troops when he had to appear in the Rhenish district. On 31 May, the Oberland both groups were established and bound themselves to render mutual help for six years.

After the death of [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[king of Bohemia]], the kingdom deprived his successor, [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] in 1618 of the Bohemian crown, and elected [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] as King, on August 26 and 27, 1619. After the election as Emperor, Ferdinand conferred with the spiritual electors at Frankfurt, asking for the support of the League.

Now the formation of a confederate army began. With 7,000 men, Bavaria supplied the largest contribution to the army, whose strength was fixed at Würzburg in December 1619, as 21,000 infantry and 4000 cavalry. Commander in chief was [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]], a descendant of a Catholic [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantine]] family.

Facing the superiority of the League army of 30,000 men confronting the Protestant Union's army of 10,000, on July 3, 1620, the Union agreed to cease all hostilities between both parties during the war in Austria and Bohemia.

==The League in War==
[[Image:Battle of White Mountain.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[Battle of White Mountain]]]]
Without the risk of an attack  the League could use all its military forces to support the emperor. The same month, the army was relocated to  Upper Austria. Tilly won the [[Battle of White Mountain]] north of [[Prague]] on November 8, 1620, in which half of the enemy forces were killed or captured, losing only 700 men. The Emperor regained control over Bohemia and the first stage of the League's activity during the Thirty Years' War ended.

After the end of the [[Bohemian War]], the League's army fought in central Germany, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Mingolsheim]] on April 27, 1622, after which they joined with the Spanish to fight and win the [[Battle of Wimpfen]] against the [[Margrave of Baden-Durlach]] on May 6. Following these victories, the army captured the city of [[Heidelberg]], the capital of the leader of the Protestant Union, following an eleven-week siege on September 19.  The Protestant prince [[Christian the Younger of Brunswick|Christian, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], raised another army, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Stadtlohn]] where 13,000 out of his army of 15,000 were lost. This victory virtually ended all Protestant resistance in Germany.  This caused Denmark's king [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] to enter the Thirty Years' War in 1625 to protect Protestantism and also in a bid to make himself the primary leader of Northern Europe.
[[Image:Johann Tserclaes Tilly.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]], commander in chief of the army of the Catholic League]]
The league's army fought and defeated the Danish on August 26–27, 1626 at the [[Battle of Lutter]], destroying more than half the fleeing Danish army.

Because this and other victories by Wallenstein, Denmark was forced to sue for peace at the [[Treaty of Lübeck]].  Now, the Catholic League hit its peak. Almost the whole German territories were under their control. The danger of imperial hegemony, resulting from this success, made the Swedish King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]] become involved in the conflict in 1630.

While [[Treaty of Stettin (1630)|Gustavus Adolphus landed his army in Pomerania]] and tried to make alliances with the leaders of Northern Germany, the League's army laid siege to the city of [[Magdeburg]] for two months from March 20, 1631, as the city had promised to support Sweden. On May 20, 40,000 successfully attacked Magdeburg. A massacre of the populace ensued in which 25,000 of the 30,000 inhabitants of the city perished while fires destroyed much of the city.

It is not clear whether the commander in chief of the League's forces, Count Tilly ordered the massacre. Magdeburg was a strategically vital city in the Elbe River region and was needed as a resupply center for the looming fight against the Swedes. Therefore, it would have been logical behavior, not to destroy, but to occupy the town with troops of the League.

In 1630, Ferdinand II dismissed his Generalissimus [[Wallenstein]]. Now, the Catholic League was in control of all the Catholic armed forces.

==The end of the Catholic League==
At the [[Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)|First Battle of Breitenfeld]], the Catholic League led by General Tilly was defeated by the Swedish forces. A year later (1632), they met again in the [[Battle of Rain]], and this time General Tilly was killed. The upper hand had now switched from the league to the union, led by Sweden, who were able to attack and capture or destroy the territories of the Catholic League. Even [[Munich]], the capital of [[Bavaria]], was conquered. Thereafter, the German Catholic League did not play a major role in later events.

The [[Peace of Prague (1635)|Peace of Prague]] of 30 May 1635, was a treaty between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], Ferdinand II, and most of the Protestant states of the Empire. It effectively ended the civil war aspect of the Thirty Years' War. The [[Edict of Restitution]] of 1629 was effectively revoked, with the terms of the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555 being reestablished as at November 12, 1627.

One of the most important regulations was that formal alliances between states of the Empire were prohibited. The armies of the various states were to be  unified with those of the Emperor as an army for the Empire as a whole. The result of this clause was the end of the Catholic League, a now prohibited alliance between states of the Empire.

As well as ending the fighting between the various states, the treaty also ended religion as a source of national conflict; the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' was established for good within the Empire.

'''Archibald Yell''' (August 9, 1797 – February 22, 1847) was an American attorney and politician in Arkansas.  He was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] and [[List of Governors of Arkansas|second]] [[Governor of Arkansas|governor]] of [[Arkansas]]. 

==Biography==
Yell was likely born in [[Tennessee]], although his gravestone lists [[North Carolina]] as his birthplace.<ref name="p8" >Donovan et al. 1995, p. 8.</ref> His family first settled in [[Jefferson County, Tennessee|Jefferson County]] in the eastern part of the state, then moved to [[Rutherford County, Tennessee|Rutherford]] in [[Middle Tennessee]], and finally settled in [[Bedford County, Tennessee|Bedford County]] to the south.

As a youth, Yell participated in the [[Creek War]], serving in 1813 and early 1814 under General [[Andrew Jackson]], who became a special friend. In 1814 and 1815, during the [[War of 1812]], he served with Jackson in [[Louisiana]], including in the [[Battle of New Orleans]]. He was also active in [[freemasonry]], and was the Tennessee [[Grand Master (Masonic)|grand master]] in 1830.<ref name="p9" >Donovan et al. 1995, p. 9.</ref>

Yell returned to Tennessee, and read law as a legal apprentice. He was admitted to the bar in [[Fayetteville, Tennessee]]. In 1818, he joined Jackson’s army during the [[Seminole Wars|First Seminole War]] in [[Florida]].

==Political career==
Active in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Yell moved to the [[Arkansas Territory]] in 1831 to head the federal land office in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]. The federal government offered him the governorship of the [[Florida Territory]] the following year, but he declined. 

He was a strong supporter and personal friend of President [[James K. Polk]]. Just prior to taking office in 1835, Polk sent Yell to Texas to advocate for its annexation to the union. In 1835, he was appointed by the [[James K. Polk]] administration as an Arkansas territorial judge. He is reported to have single-handedly retrieved a criminal from a local saloon and physically brought him to his court.

Yell was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1836, after Arkansas was admitted to the Union. He served one term, from 1836 to 1839.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=Y000017|title=Yell, Archibald, (1797-1847)|publisher= Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> While in Washington, he was a strong supporter of Texan statehood and favored a stronger military. Around this time that Yell formed the first [[Masonic]] lodge in Arkansas at [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]].<ref name="p9" />

In 1840, Yell was elected [[governor of Arkansas]]. He focused on internal improvements, as infrastructure was needed to benefit planters and farmers. He also worked to better control banks and supported public education. 

Yell resigned his post as governor to run again for Congress in 1844, and won the seat. Yell is reported to have been the consummate campaigner. At one stop during the campaign, he is said to have won a shooting match, donated meat to the poor, and bought a jug of whiskey for the crowd.<ref name="p11" >Donovan et al. 1995, p. 11.</ref>

Soon after he took his seat in Congress, the [[Mexican-American War]] began. Yell returned to Arkansas and formed the [[1st Arkansas Volunteer Cavalry]]. Several of his men later achieved notability in Arkansas, including the future governor [[John Selden Roane]], and future Confederate generals [[Albert Pike]], [[Solon Borland]], and [[James Fleming Fagan]]. His cavalry compiled a record of insubordination.<ref name="p12" >Donovan et al. 1995, p. 12.</ref> During the [[Mexican-American War]], Yell was commissioned as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] in the [[United States Army]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_arkansas/col2-content/main-content-list/title_yell_archibald.html|title=Arkansas Governor Archibald Yell|publisher=National Governors Association|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref>

==Family life==
Yell met Mary Scott in Bedford County, Tennessee, where they were neighbors. They married in 1821 after he had started to establish his law practice. She had one daughter, Mary, who was born January 5, 1823. Mary Scott Yell died from complications following their daughter's birth.   

A few years later, Yell married Nancy Moore of [[Danville, Kentucky]]. They had four children before her death. 

Yell later married Maria (McIlvaine) Ficklin, a widow. They had no children. Maria died October 15, 1838 in Arkansas, while Yell was serving in the US Congress.

Yell’s nephew [[James Yell]] became a [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] of the Arkansas [[state militia]] during the Civil War.

==Death==
On February 22, 1847, Yell was killed in combat at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]] in Mexico. Yell was originally buried on the battlefield in Mexico. His body was removed and returned to Arkansas for burial at Waxhaws Cemetery in Fayetteville. When [[Evergreen Cemetery (Fayetteville, AR)|Evergreen Cemetery]] was established in the city, the Masons arranged for his body to be relocated and reinterred in the Masonic section of that cemetery.<ref name="p12" >Donovan et al. 1995, p. 12.</ref>

Murrell''' (also spelled as '''Murel''' and '''Murrel''') (c. 1806-1844), was a notorious [[bandit]] who operated along the [[Mississippi River]] in the United States in first half of the nineteenth century. Captured and convicted in the [[Circuit Court]] of [[Madison County, Tennessee]], he was imprisoned in the [[List of Tennessee state prisons|Tennessee State Penitentiary]], modeled on the [[Auburn system|Auburn penal system]], from 1834 to 1844.

==Early life==

Prison records show that John Andrews Murrell was born in [[Lunenburg County, Virginia]], but was raised in [[Williamson County, Tennessee]]. He was a son of Jeffrey Murrell and Zilpha Andrews and the third of eight children. At the time he was in prison, Murrell's mother, wife and two children lived near [[Denmark, Tennessee#Cities and towns|Denmark, Tennessee]]. While in prison, Murrell learned the [[blacksmith]]'s [[apprenticeship|trade]]. On his release, he lived in [[Pikeville, Tennessee]], where he died of "pulmonary consumption" (probably [[tuberculosis]]). In a deathbed confession, Murrell admitted that he was guilty of most of the crimes charged him with the exception of murder, which he claimed never to have done<ref name=Kirk>[http://www.tellicotimes.com/Murrell.html Kirk, Lowell. John A. Murrell: An Early Tennessee "Terrorist”. The Tellico Times.]</ref>

As a child, Murrell and his brothers were petty thieves. Ironically, their father was a Methodist church circuit rider. Murrell is known to have stolen horses, and at least once he was caught with a runaway slave living on his property. He was known to kidnap slaves and sell them to other slave owners. It was for slave stealing that he was sentenced to ten years in [[Tennessee]].<ref name=TN>[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=953  The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture: John Andrews Murrell 1806-1844]</ref>  Murrell would be considered a conductor on the [[Reverse Underground Railroad]].

Murrell died just nine months after leaving prison. His body was dug up and parts of it stolen. His [[human skull|skull]] is still missing, but one of his thumbs is in the Tennessee State Museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/pitw/archives/2011/10/24/one-thumb-up-severed-200-year-old-thumb-sticks-out-at-the-tennessee-state-museum|author=Phillips, Betsy |date=October 24, 2011|title=One Thumb Up! Severed 200-Year-Old Thumb Sticks Out at the Tennessee State Museum |publisher=Nashville Scene|accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref>

==The "Murrell Excitement"==
In 1835 Virgil Stewart, who was the chief witness against Murrell,<ref name=TN/> wrote an account of an alleged Murrell-led slave rebellion plot, financed by highwaymen and Northern Abolitionists. It was published as a pamphlet titled "A History of the Detection, Conviction, Life And Designs of John A. Murell, The Great Western Land Pirate; Together With his System of Villany and Plan of Exciting a Negro Rebellion, and a Catalogue of the Names of Four Hundred and Forty Five of His Mystic Clan Fellows and Followers and Their Efforts for the Destruction of Mr. Virgil A. Stewart, The Young Man Who Detected Him, To Which is Added Biographical Sketch of Mr. Virgil A. Stewart."

Stewart wrote his "confession of John Murrell" under the name "Augustus Q. Walton, Esq.," for whom he created a biography. Most  historians view Stewart's pamphlet as fictional, since Murrell and his brothers were inept as thieves, having bankrupted their father, who tried to make up for their misdeeds.

However, the pamphlet was widely believed at the time, especially in the South, and caused the "Murrell Excitement". It definitely increased tensions between the races and between locals and outsiders. On July 4, 1835, there were coordinated actions in the red-light districts of Nashville, Memphis and Natchez; twenty slaves and ten white men were hanged after they confessed to complicity. On July 6, an angry mob in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] gathered to expel all professional gamblers from the town, since a rumor claimed they supported the plot. Five gamblers barricaded themselves inside a building, refusing to come out. They shot and killed a widely-respected doctor. They were eventually overcome and all five were hanged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://masglp.olemiss.edu/Water%20Log/WL18/wlvicks.htm|title=The Vicksburg Flatboat War of 1838 and Its Influence on Submerged lands law in Mississippi |publisher=Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant Legal Program|accessdate=2014-07-18}}</ref>

== Disputed claims ==

The following claims were derived from Stewart's "History of the Detection, Conviction, Life, and Designs of John A. Murel...." (see above):

* He was known as a 'land-pirate,' using the [[Mississippi River]] as a base for his operations. He used a network of anywhere from 300 (Stewart estimate) to 1,000 (as quoted in [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'') to 2,500 (as some newspaper reports claimed) fellow bandits collectively known as the [[Mystic Clan]] to pull off his escapades. Many of these were members of cultural/ethnic groups such as the [[Melungeon]]s and the [[Redbone (ethnicity)|Redbone]]s. He was also known as a [[bushwhacker]] along the [[Natchez Trace]].

* To cover up his misdeeds, he played the persona of a traveling preacher. Twain's work and others say he would preach to a congregation while his [[List of Old West gangs|gang]] stole the horses outside. However, the accounts are unanimous that Murrell's horse was always left behind.

* Just before he was apprehended, he was about to spearhead a slave revolt in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] in an attempt to take over the city and install himself as a sort of potentate of Louisiana.

*His place and date of birth are in question: Some sources claim [[Williamson County, Tennessee]], others say [[Jackson, Tennessee]]. In any case, it is clear that he grew up in Williamson County, Tennessee, just south of Franklin.  He is claimed to have been born in 1791.<ref>[http://www.policestudies.eku.edu/POTTER/International/Southhistory.htm ]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref> We know from Record Group 25, "Prison Records for the Main Prison at Nashville, Tennessee, 1831-1922," that Murrell was born in 1806, most likely in Williamson County, Tennessee.

* The location of his hideout and operations base is debated. Once again, [[Jackson County, Tennessee|Jackson]] or [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]] are bandied about, but other places include [[Natchez, Mississippi]] in an odd depression on a bluff called [[Devil's Punch Bowl (Mississippi)|Devil's Punch Bowl]], [[Tunica County, Mississippi]], the [[Neutral Ground (Louisiana)|Neutral Ground in Louisiana]], and even the tiny [[Island 37]], part of [[Tipton County, Tennessee]]. One record, a genealogical note,<sup>[http://gagen.i-found-it.net/halliburtonmemoirs.html]</sup> even places him as far east as [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]; in fact [[Atlanta]] historian [[Franklin Garrett]] makes it clear there was a lawless district in that town named for him, "[[Murrell's Row]]" in the 1840s. Because Murrell has come to symbolize [[Natchez Trace]] lawlessness in the [[antebellum era|antebellum]] period, it's understandable that his "hideouts" (whether there were any hideouts or not) have been said to have been located at most of the well-known areas of particular lawlessness along the Natchez Trace.

* Some say he began to plot his takeover of New Orleans in 1841, although he was in the sixth year of a ten-year sentence in the prison at Nashville at the time, and Stewart had already published his account of Murrell's plot in 1835. Others say he was in operation from 1835 to 1857; he was in prison for ten of those years, and died of tuberculosis in 1845 shortly after leaving prison and taking up a quiet life as a [[Christian]] and [[blacksmith]].

* A river feature in [[Chicot County, Arkansas]] called Whiskey Chute is named for his raid on a whiskey-carrying steamboat that was sunk after it was pillaged. It was named such in 1855.

== In popular culture ==

[[Mark Twain]], in his novel [[Tom Sawyer]], has Tom Sawyer and [[Huckleberry Finn]] seeing "[[Injun Joe]]" finding "Murel's" treasure and then after "Injun Joe"'s death by starvation, Sawyer and Finn find the treasure again.

The [[Tennessee Historical Society]] has a traveling exhibit which features, among many other items, a preserved thumb which supposedly belonged to Murrell.

He was fictionalized by [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in ''The Cruel Redeemer Lazarus Morell'', written between 1933 and 1934 and published in ''[[A Universal History of Iniquity]]'' in 1935.  It is speculation that Borges adapted the last name from Twain; and as Twain did not have a first name for the bandit, Borges used Lazarus, many believe as an allusion to the Bible character of the same first name who was raised from the dead by Jesus, symbolizing a second life (which, in a purely ironic way, Borges' Lazarus Morrell provided for the slaves he freed).

He was fictionalized in Episode 5 of [[Riverboat (TV)|Riverboat]] on U.S. television network [[NBC]], and the episode was first broadcast on October 11, 1959. In the show, he was a riverboat captain who planned to hijack another [[riverboat]] piloted by "Dan Simpson," and planned to do so by planting an alluring agent (played by [[Debra Paget]]) as a dancing girl on his vessel.

He was fictionalized in Episode 20, Season 2 of [[The Adventures of Jim Bowie]] (1958) titled ''Pirate on Horseback.''  In the episode, Jim Bowie pretends to be a criminal in order to gain Murrell's trust, played by [[Donald Randolph]].  Murrell is presented as the leader of "The Brotherhood," planning to overthrow the U.S. Government, and receives his guidance from Heaven.

He was fictionalized as a featured character both in Robert Lewis Taylor's ''The Travels of Jamie McPheeters'' and on the 1963 television showed based on it, where he was portrayed by [[James Westerfield]].

In the 1940 film [[Virginia City (film)|Virginia City]], [[Humphrey Bogart]] portrays a bandit named John Murrell, although the action in that story takes place at the end of the Civil War, more than twenty years after the death of the real Murrell.

He is fictionalized as the murderer James Murrell in the [[Eudora Welty]] short story, "A Still Moment," published in ''The Wide Net and Other Stories'' (1943).

''Sow the Seeds of Hemp'', a 1976 novel by [[Gary Jennings]], is a fictionalized account of the pursuit of John Murrell by Virgil Stewart, told from Stewart's point of view.

American novelist [[John Wray (novelist)|John Wray]]'s second novel, entitled "Canaan's Tongue" (2005), uses Murrell and his bandits for an allegorical look at the United States, belief, and power.

His escapades have also inspired numerous rumors about the location of his treasure. One claim is that it is buried in the [[Devil's Punch Bowl (Mississippi)|Devil's Punch Bowl]]. [[Coin collector]]s say it is on [[Honey Island]] in Louisiana. (See external link below for details.)

To top it off, his ghost reportedly appears from time to time on the [[Natchez Trace]]. Once again, the Devil's Punch Bowl is said to be the site of the haunting of members of his gang.

Walt Disney's [[Davy Crockett]] has Crockett and [[Mike Fink]] fighting off an attack by a Murrell-type outlaw, who is referred to as [[Samuel Mason]], and joined by the [[Harpe Brothers]] in [[Davy Crockett and the River Pirates]], 1956.

'''Wade Anthony Boggs''' (born June 15, 1958) is an American former professional [[baseball]] [[third baseman]]. He spent his 18-year baseball career primarily with the [[Boston Red Sox]], but also played for the [[New York Yankees]], with whom he won his only [[World Series]], and [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], with whom he recorded his 3,000th hit. His hitting in the 1980s and 1990s made him a perennial contender for [[American League]] batting titles. He is 33rd on the list of career leaders for batting average among Major League Baseball players with a minimum of 1000 plate appearances. Boggs was elected to the Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2004 and the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005|2005]].

With 12 straight [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] appearances, Boggs is third only to [[Brooks Robinson]] and [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]] in number of consecutive appearances as a third baseman. In 1999, he ranked number 95 on the ''[[Sporting News]]'' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the [[Major League Baseball]] All-Century Team. Boggs, a 1976 graduate of [[Plant High School]] in [[Tampa, Florida]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Famous Faces|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=May 30, 2010|page=4E}}</ref> currently resides in the [[Tampa Palms, Tampa, Florida|Tampa Palms]] neighborhood of Tampa.

==Major league career==

===Boston Red Sox===
[[File:Wade Boggs 1988.jpg|thumb|170px|Boggs at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Baltimore Memorial Stadium]], 1988]]
A left-handed hitter, Boggs won five batting titles starting in {{by|1983}}. He also batted .349 in his rookie year which would have won the batting title, but was 121 plate appearances short of the required minimum of 502. From {{by|1982}} to {{by|1988}}, Boggs hit below .349 only once, hitting .325 in {{by|1984}}. From 1983 to {{by|1989}}, Boggs rattled off seven consecutive seasons in which he collected 200 or more hits, an American League record for consecutive 200-hit seasons that was later matched and surpassed by Seattle's [[Ichiro Suzuki]]. Boggs also had six seasons with 200 or more hits, 100+ runs and 40+ doubles. Although he would not win another batting title after 1988 (his batting title that year broke [[Bill Madlock]]'s Major League record of four by a third baseman), he regularly appeared among the league leaders in hitting.

In 1985, Boggs had 72 multi-hit games, a club record.

In 1986, Boggs made it to the [[1986 World Series|World Series]] with the Red Sox, but they lost to the [[New York Mets]] in seven games. He holds the record for batting average at [[Fenway Park]], at .369.

===New York Yankees===
In {{by|1992}}, Boggs slumped to .259 – one of only three times in his career that he failed to reach .300 – and at the end of the season he left the Red Sox, with whom he had spent his entire career to that point. He was heavily pursued by two teams: the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and the [[Yankees – Red Sox rivalry|arch-rival]] of the Red Sox, the [[New York Yankees]] - he chose the Yankees when they added the third year to the contract that the Dodgers would not offer. Boggs went on to be awarded three straight all-star appearances, had four straight .300-plus seasons, and even collected two [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove Awards]] for his defense.

In 1996, Boggs helped the Yankees win their first World Series title in 18 years, which became his only world title. In the series' fourth game, which saw the Yankees rally from six runs down to win, Boggs was called on to pinch hit in the tenth inning and using the batting eye he was known for throughout his career, he coaxed a bases-loaded walk out of [[Steve Avery]] which gave the Yankees the lead in a game they went on to win 8-6.<ref>http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Wade_Boggs_1958</ref> After the Yankees won the series in game 6, Boggs memorably celebrated by jumping on the back of an [[NYPD]] horse, touring the field with his index finger in the air - despite his self-professed fear of horses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/wade-boggs-boston-refusal-retire-number-disappointing-173604723--mlb.html |date=15 July 2012 |last=Kaduk |first=Kevin |title=Wade Boggs on Boston's refusal to retire his number: 'It's disappointing' |publisher=[[Yahoo!

===Tampa Bay Devil Rays===
Boggs signed with the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] for the final two seasons of his career. He hit the first home run in Devil Rays history, in the 6th inning of the inaugural game on March 31, 1998. On August 7, 1999, he collected his 3,000th hit with a home run. Despite his reputation as a singles hitter with limited power, he is one of only two players whose 3,000th hit was a [[home run]],<ref name="library"/> and was the only one until [[Derek Jeter]] hit his on July 9, 2011. Boggs' 3,000th hit ball was caught by Michael Hogan who had just moved to Tampa, 10 days prior, to take a job as assistant director of athletic communications at the University of South Florida. Hogan gave the ball back following the game. Boggs retired in {{by|1999}} after sustaining a knee injury, leaving with a career batting average of .328 and 3,010 hits. Two yellow seats among the rest of the Tropicana's blue seats mark where both historic balls landed in right field, each with a small metal plate noting it as the area that the ball landed.

His career paralleled that of [[Tony Gwynn]], who also debuted in the [[National League]] in 1982. Boggs and Gwynn were the premier [[contact hitter]]s of their era. They both won multiple batting titles—Boggs's five and Gwynn's eight—and each won four straight to join [[Ty Cobb]], [[Rogers Hornsby]], and [[Rod Carew]] as the only players to do so. Gwynn and Boggs each hit over .350 in four straight seasons, the only players to do so since 1931. They joined [[Lou Brock]] and [[Rod Carew]] as the only players whose careers ended after World War II who finished with 3,000 hits and fewer than 160 home runs.<ref name=verducci_08091999>{{cite news|last=Verducci|first=Tom|title=Single Minded|date=August 9, 1999|magazine=Sports Illustrated|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?expire=&title=As+they+closed+in+on+magic+hit+number+3%2C000%2C+Tony+Gwynn+-+08.09.99+-+SI+Vault&urlID=481594891&action=cpt&partnerID=289881&fb=Y&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1016542%2F1%2Findex.htm|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68NUjQ4I9|deadurl=no|archivedate=June 12, 2012}}</ref><ref name=chass_06292001>{{cite news|last=Chass|first=Murray|title=ON BASEBALL; Hits to Stop Coming Once Gwynn Is Gone|date=June 29, 2001|newspaper=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/29/sports/on-baseball-hits-to-stop-coming-once-gwynn-is-gone.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68QAhktDu|deadurl=no|archivedate=June 14, 2012}}</ref>

While not unique among non-pitchers, Boggs also recorded a few innings pitching at the Major League level. His main pitch was a [[knuckleball]], which he used 16 times (along with one [[fastball]]) in one shutout inning for the Yankees against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]] in a 1997 game.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/21/sports/boggs-and-his-knuckler-are-the-stars-of-the-show.html|date= 1997-08-21|title= Boggs and His Knuckler Are the Stars of the Show|accessdate= 2010-05-24 |work= New York Times | first=Jack | last=Curry}}</ref>

His own style included mental preparedness techniques, which consisted in visualizing four at-bats each evening before a game and imagining himself successfully getting four hits.

As of June 8, 1986, over the course of the previous 162 games (equivalent to a full season, though across two seasons) Boggs was hitting .400, with 254 hits in 635 at-bats.<ref>Boston Globe, June 9, 1986. p. 37.</ref>

In 1987, Boggs&nbsp;– who was up for a new contract following the season&nbsp;– hit 24 home runs, the most in any year of his career.

On April 7, 2000 his #12 was retired by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. It is the only number to have been issued only once by the Rays.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats10.shtml|title= Retired Uniform Numbers in the American League|accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=Baseball Almanac.com}}</ref>  Although he has not had his number retired by the Boston Red Sox, he was inducted into the team's Hall of Fame in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/bos/history/feature_hall_of_fame.jsp|title= Red Sox Hall of Fame|accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=RedSox.com}}</ref>

Boggs was known for his [[superstition]]s. He ate [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] before every game ([[Jim Rice]] once called Boggs "chicken man"), woke up at the same time every day, took exactly 150 ground balls in practice, took batting practice at 5:17, and ran sprints at 7:17.<ref name="library">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Wade_Boggs_1958|title= The Ballplayers - Wade Boggs Biography |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=BaseballLibrary.com}}</ref>  His route to and from his position in the field beat a path to the home dugout. He drew the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word "[[Chai (symbol)|Chai]]", meaning "life", in the batter's box before each at-bat, though he is not [[Jew]]ish.<ref>''The Rundown.'' >{{cite web |url= http://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/archrndwn/2005/aug/050806.waitwait.html |title= Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me|accessdate=2008-07-25 }} NPR.

==Life outside baseball==

===The Margo Adams affair and palimony lawsuit===
[[File:WadeBoggsSigning.JPG|thumbnail|Boggs autographing the book "Yankee Stadium" at a book signing on September 23, 2008]]
Boggs garnered non-baseball related media attention in 1989 for his four-year extramarital affair with Margo Adams, a California [[mortgage broker]]. After Boggs ended the relationship in 1988, Adams filed a $12 million [[lawsuit]] for [[Intentional infliction of emotional distress|emotional distress]] and [[Breach of contract|breach of oral contract]]. She argued that Boggs had verbally agreed to compensate her for lost income and services performed while accompanying Boggs on road trips.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D6133EF930A35750C0A96F948260 |title=THE LAW; At the Bar |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=New York Times | first=David | last=Margolick | date=1989-03-03}}</ref> Boggs' reputation was further sullied when Adams agreed to an interview with [[Penthouse (magazine)|''Penthouse'' magazine]] in which she discussed intimate details of her time with Boggs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0D7123FF930A15751C0A96F948260|title= BASEBALL; Gossip Checks In At Red Sox Camp |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=New York Times | first=Murray | last=Chass | date=1989-02-23}}</ref>  While acknowledging the affair, Boggs went on the offensive in order to combat the wave of negative press, denying many of the claims made by Adams. Boggs' rebuttal included an appearance on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] program ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'' in which he presented his side of the story to [[Barbara Walters]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2D81F3EF936A15750C0A96F948260|title= SPORTS PEOPLE: BASEBALL; Boggs Speaks Out |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=New York Times | date=1989-03-25}}</ref>  In February 1989, an [[appellate court|appeals court]] threw out $11.5 million of the initial lawsuit, ruling that Adams could not seek compensation for emotional distress.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7D7103FF934A15751C0A96F948260|title= Big Hit for Boggs in Court |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=New York Times | date=1989-02-27}}</ref>  The remaining demand for $500,000 was settled out of court later that year for an undisclosed amount.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D9103CF930A25751C1A96F948260|title= SPORTS PEOPLE: BASEBALL; Boggs Settlement |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=New York Times | date=1989-12-13}}</ref>

===Hall of Fame plaque cap logo controversy===
Before his retirement, Boggs was plagued by newspaper reports that the expansion Devil Rays gave him financial compensation in return for selecting a Devil Rays cap for his plaque at the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]], though he has denied that any such condition was part of his contract.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/hallfame/2005-01-06-boggs-sandberg-questions_x.htm |title = Boggs, Sandberg field queries as new Hall of Famers |accessdate = 2008-05-21 |work = www.usatoday.com |publisher = USA Today | first1=Craig | last1=Muder | date=2005-01-06}}</ref>  In light of those reports (and other rumors that teams were offering number retirement, money, or organizational jobs in exchange for the cap designation) the Hall decided in 2001 to change its practice of deferring to players' wishes regarding cap logo selection, and reinforced the Hall's authority to determine with which cap the player would be depicted. Boggs is wearing a Boston cap on his plaque.

===Family===
Boggs's mother died in June 1986 due to a car accident in Tampa while he was with the Red Sox.<ref>{{cite news|title=Boston Red Sox - Wade Boggs: 2005 Hall of Fame inductee|publisher=Boston Globe|author=Shaughnessy, Dan|date=July 31, 2005|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2005/07/31/wade_boggs_2005_hall_of_fame_inductee|accessdate=2010-02-27}}</ref> Shortly after her death, Boggs and his father bought a fish camp on [[U.S. 301]] just south of [[Hawthorne, Florida]] they named ''Finway'', which his father operated until shortly before he died.<ref>{{cite web|title=Old Florida Heritage Highway CMC Meeting|date=March 4, 2009|url=http://www.scenicus441.com/Agenda%20and%20Minutes/March_2009_minutes.pdf|accessdate=2010-02-27}}</ref>

Wade Boggs was named one of the Top 10 Most Superstitious Athletes by [[Men's Fitness]].<ref>[http://www.mensfitness.com/sports_and_recreation/athletes/181 Top 10 Most Superstitious Athletes]</ref>

===Wrestling===
As a baseball player, Boggs made an appearance for the [[professional wrestling promotion]] [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in 1988. He appeared in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignette]] with wrestler [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] in which Perfect played baseball. The two remained good friends afterward and 19 years later in 2007, Boggs inducted the late Perfect into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]]. In the DVD ''The Life and Times of Mr. Perfect'', Boggs related how Hennig saved his life, carrying Boggs to help after he had severely cut his leg climbing over a broken barbed wire fence during a hunting trip.<ref name="DVD">''The Life & Times of Mr. Perfect'' (2008)</ref>

===Television===
Boggs was one of the baseball players featured in the classic ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Homer at the Bat]]", in which he was recruited as a ringer by [[Mr. Burns]] for the Power Plant's softball team, only to later be knocked out in a bar fight (over whether [[Henry_Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] or [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Pitt the Elder]] was England's greatest [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]) by [[Barney Gumble]]. Boggs appeared as himself in the episode "Bar Wars" of ''[[Cheers]]'', in which he was sent to the bar as an apology by a rival bar. He was accosted by the regulars who thought he was a fake. David Levine revealed in 2009 that Boggs had promised to trade Adams' panties for [[Kirstie Alley]]'s.<ref>[http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2009/04/wade-boggs-and-baaaaa-d-behavior.html Wade Boggs and Baaaaa-d behavior]</ref> In ''[[Seinfeld]]'''s "The Chaperone", George convinces the Yankees to switch to cotton uniforms, assuring manager [[Buck Showalter]] that the Bombers would be "five degrees cooler than the other team." Wade Boggs was quoted as saying: 'What a fabric! Finally we can breathe.'<ref name="Jay S.">Confirmed by Jay S.</ref>  In 2011, he also appeared in the ''[[Psych]]'' episode [[Psych (season 6)#Episodes|Dead Man's Curveball]].

===Oil Can Boyd's accusation of racism===
Former Red Sox pitcher [[Oil Can Boyd]] was on a book tour to promote his new autobiography and was on the ''[[Dennis and Callahan]]'' show on [[WEEI]], when he claimed that Boggs was a bigot and would call him the n-word every day to his face in the clubhouse.<ref name="Delusional">{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/dailypitch/post/2012/05/wade-boggs-says-oil-can-boyd-delusional-drug-addict/1|title=Wade Boggs: Oil Can Boyd is 'a delusional drug addict'|last=Boeck|first=Scott|date=May 10, 2012|accessdate=July 11, 2012|work=USA Today}}</ref> Boggs vehemently disputed the claims, asserting "Absolutely, positively, 100 million percent, I am not a racist. I am not a bigot."<ref name="Delusional"/> Referring to Boyd, who has admitted to frequently using cocaine and marijuana, Boggs noted, "You have a delusional drug addict who let not only his family down, but his team, the city of Boston, Red Sox Nation when it counted most. Now he wants the good people of Boston to go out and spend money on this garbage to support his habit. I find that extremely amusing."<ref name="Delusional"/>

The '''Catholic League of France''', sometimes referred to by contemporary (and modern) [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] as the '''Holy League''', a major player in the [[French Wars of Religion]], was formed by [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]], in 1576.<ref>Holt, Mack P. : The French Wars of Religion, 1562-1629, page 122. New York, 1995</ref> The League intended the eradication of Protestants—also known as [[Calvinists]] or [[Huguenots]]—out of Catholic France during the [[Protestant Reformation]]; as well as the replacement of [[Henry III of France|King Henry III]].

[[Pope Sixtus V]], [[Philip II of Spain]], and the [[Jesuits]] were all supporters of this Catholic party.

== The Catholic League's political origins ==

Confraternities and leagues were established by French Catholics to counter the growing power of the [[Lutherans]], [[Calvinists]] and members of the [[Reformed Church of France]]. The Protestant Calvinists at that time dominated much of the [[French nobility]], leading to active persecution of Catholics in some regions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Under the leadership of Henry I, Duke of Guise, the Catholic confraternities and leagues were united as the Catholic League. Guise used the League not only to defend the Catholic cause but also as a political tool in an attempt to [[usurp]] the French throne.<ref>Carroll, Warren H. ''The Cleaving of Christendom''. A History of Christendom, volume 4, page 432.

The Catholic League aimed to preempt any seizure of power by the [[Huguenots]] and to protect French Catholics' right to worship. The Catholic League's cause was fueled by the doctrine [[Extra Ecclesiam Nulla Salus]]. Catholic Leaguers saw their fight against Calvinism (the primary branch of Protestantism in France) as a [[Crusade]] against [[heresy]]. The League's [[pamphlet]]eers also blamed any natural disaster that occurred in France at the time as God's way of punishing France for tolerating the existence of the Calvinist heresy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
 
After a series of bloody clashes, the [[French Wars of Religion]] (1562–1598), between Catholics and Protestants, the Catholic League formed in an attempt to break the power of the Calvinist gentry once and for all. The Catholic League saw the French throne under [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] as too conciliatory towards the Huguenots. The League, similar to hardline Calvinists, disapproved of Henry III's attempts to mediate any coexistence between the Huguenots and Catholics. The Catholic League also saw moderate French Catholics, known as [[Politiques]], as a serious threat. The Politiques were tired of the many tit for tat killings and were willing to negotiate peaceful coexistence rather than escalating the war.

==History of the League==
[[File:Légended'Henri III.jpg|thumb|left|Assassination of the [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]], leader of the Catholic League, by king [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], in 1588.]]
The League immediately began to exert pressure on [[Henry III of France]]. Faced with this mounting opposition (spurred in part because the heir to the French throne, [[Henry IV of France|Henry of Navarre]], was a Huguenot) he canceled the [[Peace of La Rochelle]], re-criminalizing Protestantism and beginning a new chapter in the [[French Wars of Religion]]. However, Henry also saw the danger posed by the [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]], who was gaining more and more power. In the [[Day of the Barricades]], King Henry III was forced to flee Paris, which resulted in Henry, Duke of Guise becoming the de facto ruler of France. Afraid of being deposed and assassinated, the King decided to strike first. On December 23, 1588, Henry III's guardsmen assassinated the Duke and his brother, [[Louis II, Cardinal of Guise|Louis II]] and the Duke's son was imprisoned in the [[Bastille]].

However, this move did little to consolidate the King's power and enraged both the surviving Guises and their followers. As a result, the King fled Paris and joined forces with [[Henry IV of France|Henry of Navarre]], the throne's Calvinist heir apparent. Both the King and Henry of Navarre began building an army with which to besiege Paris. On August 1, 1589, as the two Henrys besieged the city and prepared for their final assault, [[Jacques Clément]] a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Lay brother]] with ties to the League, successfully infiltrated the King's entourage, dressed as a priest, and assassinated him. This was retaliation for the killing of the Duke of Guise and his brother. As he lay dying, the King begged Henry of Navarre to convert to Catholicism, calling it the only way to prevent further bloodshed. However, the King's death threw the army into disarray and Henry of Navarre was forced to lift the siege.

Although Henry of Navarre was now the legitimate King of France, the League's armies were so strong that he was unable to capture Paris and was forced to retreat south. Using arms and [[military advisors]] provided by [[Elizabeth I of England]], he achieved several military victories. However, he was unable to overcome the superior forces of the League, which commanded the loyalty of most Frenchmen and had the support of Philip II of Spain. The League then attempted to declare the [[Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon|Cardinal of Bourbon]], Henry's uncle, as king Charles X of France on November 21, 1589, but his status as a prisoner of Henry of Navarre and his death in May 1590 removed all legitimacy from this gesture. Furthermore, the Cardinal refused to [[usurp]] the throne and supported his nephew, although to little avail.

Unable to provide a viable candidate for the French throne (the League's support was split among several candidates, including [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]], a Spanish princess, which made them appear to no longer have French interests at heart), the League's position weakened, but remained strong enough to keep Henry from besieging Paris. Finally, in a bid to peacefully end the war, Henry of Navarre was received into the [[Catholic Church|Church]] on July 25, 1593 and was recognized as King Henry IV on February 27, 1594. He is purported to have said later, "Paris is well worth a Mass," though some scholars question the veracity of this quotation.

Under the rule of King Henry IV, the [[Edict of Nantes]] was passed, granting [[religious toleration]] and limited autonomy to the Huguenots and ensuring a lasting peace for France. Moreover, the Catholic League now lacked the threat of a Calvinist king and gradually disintegrated.<ref name="French Wars of Religion"/>

==Assessment==
Historian Mack Holt argues that historians have sometimes over-emphasised the political role of the League at the expense of its religious and devotional character:

{{bquote|What is the final judgement on the Catholic League?  It would be a mistake to treat it, as so many historians have, as nothing more than a body motivated purely by partisan politics or social tensions.  While political and social pressures were doubtless present, and even significant in the case of the Sixteen in Paris, to focus on these factors exclusively overlooks a very different face of the League.  For all its political and internecine wrangling, the League was still very much a Holy Union.  Its religious role was significant, as the League was the conduit between the Tridentine spirituality of the Catholic Reformation and the seventeenth century ''devots''. Often overlooked is the emphasis the League placed on the internal and spiritual renewal of the earthly city.  Moving beyond the communal religion of the later Middle Ages, the League focused on internalizing faith as a cleansing and purifying agent. New religious orders and confraternities were founded in League towns, and the gulf separating laity and clergy was often bridged as clerics joined aldermen in the ''Hotel de Ville'' where both became the epitome of goodly magistrates. To overlook the religious side of the League is to overlook the one bond that did keep the Holy Union holy as well as united.<ref>Holt, Mack P. ''The French Wars of Religion, 1562-1629'', page 149-150. New York, 1995</ref>}}
